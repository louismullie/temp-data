## Question

why is ANA positive in lupus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and how to interpret that clinically and biologically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immunologic definition of ANA and which nuclear antigens are typically targeted in SLE. Then, I should verify the epidemiology of ANA positivity in SLE versus the general population to understand sensitivity and specificity. Next, I will examine the pathogenic mechanisms that link ANA to SLE, including immune complex formation and type I interferon pathways. After that, I need to check the clinical implications, including classification criteria, assay variability, and the ANA-negative SLE subset. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful interpretation and note exceptions and pitfalls to avoid overcalling or missing disease.

> Let me first confirm the immunologic construct. ANA are autoantibodies directed against nuclear macromolecules and their complexes, including DNA, histones, nucleosomes, and RNA-binding proteins such as Sm, RNP, Ro/SSA, and La/SSB; in SLE, the dominant specificities often target chromatin components (dsDNA, histones) and RNA-binding proteins, reflecting a broad breach of tolerance to nuclear antigens [^112GZC8e] [^112HJL82] [^112DeUmt].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before drawing conclusions. Meta-analytic data show that indirect immunofluorescence ANA has very high sensitivity for SLE, around 97–98% at a titer threshold of 1:80, whereas specificity is modest, approximately 75%, and declines further at lower titers; importantly, 12–20% of healthy adults can be ANA-positive, which explains many false positives when pretest probability is low [^111FfXxZ] [^113jt3bc]. Hold on, I should also note that some cohorts report slightly lower sensitivity in real-world settings, reinforcing that assay performance and population mix matter for interpretation [^113vLC69].

> I will now examine the pathogenic mechanisms. ANA in SLE participate in immune complex–mediated inflammation: anti-dsDNA and nucleosome antibodies form complexes that deposit in tissues such as kidney and skin, activate complement, and drive cytokine release; plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense nucleic acid–containing immune complexes via TLR7/9, amplifying a type I interferon program that further fuels autoreactive B and T cell responses, creating a self-amplifying loop of autoimmunity [^112DeUmt] [^115XJMU8]. Let me consider whether all ANA are pathogenic; no, many are epiphenomena, but anti-dsDNA and some anti-RBP antibodies correlate with disease activity and organ involvement, supporting a causal role for a subset [^112DeUmt] [^114KXFUs].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications. The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria require ANA positivity at a titer ≥ 1:80 as an entry criterion, reflecting its high sensitivity and utility as a gatekeeper for research cohorts. However, this design trade-off increases specificity at the expense of excluding a small fraction of truly ANA-negative SLE, estimated around 3–5% in some series, which is acceptable for classification but not for diagnosis [^113ZHKpZ] [^114ZNfsX] [^113BFFJW] [^116BFcgW]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, and expert clinical judgment remains essential when ANA is negative but the phenotype is compelling [^117FEDUY].

> I need to ensure I account for assay variability and temporal dynamics. Different HEp-2 kits and platforms yield variable ANA results, with seroconversion over time documented in both directions. Some patients lose ANA positivity with therapy or disease evolution, while others seroconvert from negative to positive, so a single negative ANA does not absolutely exclude SLE, and a single positive ANA does not confirm it without compatible clinical features [^11673yfL] [^11123ciQ] [^1145NKGp]. Let me double-check the practical implication: repeat ANA testing is generally not helpful unless the clinical picture changes, and results must be interpreted in context and, when possible, with attention to titer and pattern [^113MEpFB].

> But wait, what if the patient is ANA-negative with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis? I should confirm that this subset exists and matters. Several cohorts describe ANA-negative SLE, including patients with class III/IV lupus nephritis, who would be excluded from classification by EULAR/ACR if ANA is negative despite otherwise fulfilling criteria; this is a recognized limitation that underscores why ANA cannot be used as a standalone diagnostic test and why expert adjudication is necessary [^112DGwYz] [^1159nru1] [^112HJL82]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not negate ANA's value; it simply means that in the right clinical context, ANA negativity should prompt careful review of alternative diagnoses or assay issues rather than closure of the SLE workup [^112GZC8e].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. ANA are positive in SLE because the disease is fundamentally a multi-autoantibody, immune complex–driven process with impaired tolerance to nuclear antigens; ANA positivity is highly sensitive but nonspecific, so it functions best as a screening anchor that must be integrated with clinical features and more specific serologies such as anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm, recognizing that a minority of bona fide SLE will be ANA-negative and that preanalytical and analytical variability can influence results [^112DeUmt] [^112GZC8e] [^113ZHKpZ]. I should confirm the bottom line: a positive ANA supports the possibility of SLE and triggers a structured evaluation, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for diagnosis in isolation, and clinical correlation remains paramount [^117S9Umx] [^116BFcgW].

Patients are ANA positive in lupus because **loss of B-cell tolerance** drives production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens (dsDNA, histones, Sm, RNP, Ro/La) [^112DeUmt], which are released during apoptosis and immune complex formation [^112DeUmt]. These autoantibodies form immune complexes that activate complement and type I interferon pathways, sustaining autoimmunity and organ inflammation [^112DeUmt] [^115XJMU8]. ANA positivity is highly sensitive but not specific for SLE; low titers can occur in healthy individuals or other diseases, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^112GZC8e] [^115Mm26w].

---

## Immunological mechanisms underlying ANA positivity in lupus

### Loss of B-cell tolerance and autoantibody production

- **B-cell tolerance**: Central and peripheral tolerance defects allow autoreactive B cells to survive and mature, producing ANAs against nuclear antigens (dsDNA, histones, Sm, RNP, Ro/La) [^112DeUmt].
- **Autoantibody diversity**: Over 180 distinct autoantibodies have been identified in SLE, reflecting broad autoreactivity [^115NUGAD].

---

### Apoptosis and immune complex formation

During apoptosis, blebs expose nuclear antigens; B cells present these antigens to T cells, amplifying autoimmunity. Released nuclear antigens bind ANAs to form **immune complexes** that activate complement and type I interferon, promoting inflammation and organ damage [^112DeUmt] [^115XJMU8].

---

### Genetic predisposition

HLA-DR and other loci confer genetic susceptibility to ANA production and SLE; **HLA-DR** variants are strongly associated with ANA positivity and SLE risk [^114zxVoe].

---

## Clinical significance of ANA positivity in lupus

### Diagnostic utility

ANA is highly sensitive (> 95%) for SLE but has low specificity; **titer ≥ 1:80** is an entry criterion in the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification [^111FfXxZ] [^113jt3bc]. Positivity alone is not diagnostic and must be interpreted with clinical features and specific autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm) [^114qH1xC].

---

### Prognostic implications

Certain ANA subsets correlate with disease activity and organ involvement; **anti-dsDNA** correlates with nephritis and disease activity, while **anti-Sm** is specific for SLE and associates with severe disease [^112DeUmt] [^114BwTei] [^112HJL82] [^114mkVCZ].

---

## Frequency and patterns of ANA positivity in lupus

| **ANA pattern** | **Frequency in SLE (%)** | **Clinical associations** |
|-|-|-|
| Homogeneous | 30–40 | - dsDNA <br/> - Histones <br/> - Nephritis |
| Speckled | 40–60 | - Sm <br/> - RNP <br/> - Ro/La <br/> - Sjögren's |
| Nucleolar | 10–20 | - Scleroderma overlap |
| Centromere | Rare | - Limited scleroderma |

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **False positives**: ANA can be positive in healthy individuals, other autoimmune diseases, infections, and with certain drugs [^115Mm26w].
- **Assay variability**: Different methods (IIF, ELISA, multiplex) yield variable results; standardized protocols are essential [^112GZC8e] [^11673yfL].
- **ANA-negative SLE**: A small subset (< 5%) are ANA-negative, often with other specific autoantibodies or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis [^112HJL82] [^112DGwYz].

---

## Clinical guidelines for ANA testing and interpretation

- **Indications**: Test when SLE or other ANA-associated diseases are suspected based on multisystem features (rash, arthritis, cytopenias, serositis, nephritis) [^113bfRPo].
- **Interpretation**: Use ANA as a screening tool; confirm with specific autoantibodies and clinical correlation [^112GZC8e].
- **Avoid routine screening**: Do not order ANA for nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, widespread pain) without clinical suspicion [^113MEpFB] [^114t92Ww].

---

Patients are ANA positive in lupus due to **loss of B-cell tolerance**, apoptosis-driven antigen exposure, immune complex formation, and genetic susceptibility; ANA positivity is a sensitive but nonspecific hallmark that must be interpreted with clinical context and specific autoantibodies.

### New lupus criteria: a critical view [^1157FtaX]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the validation of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Recent Findings

Positive antinuclear antibodies, which constitute the obligatory entry criterion of the EULAR/ACR criteria, were found in the vast majority of SLE patients worldwide, with 97% (94–100%) of patients antinuclear antibodies positive in studies investigating EULAR/ACR criteria performance. Combined over the publications, EULAR/ACR criteria sensitivity was 92% (range 85–97%). Specificity varied more relevantly, with the publications published after the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria showing 93% (83–98%) specificity. Of particular relevance is the good performance of the EULAR/ACR criteria seen in pediatric SLE as well as in early SLE.

Summary

The new classification criteria have been investigated in an impressive number of cohorts worldwide, adding to the data from the EULAR/ACR criteria project cohort. It is critical to strictly keep to the attribution rule, that items are only counted if there is no more likely alternative explanation than SLE, the domain structure, where only the highest weighted item in a domain counts, and the limitation to highly specific tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA.

### Clinical phenotype associations with various types of anti-dsDNA antibodies in patients with recent onset of rheumatic symptoms. results from a multicentre observational study [^114BwTei]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

In patients with recent onset of rheumatic symptoms, the assessment of anti-dsDNA antibodies with different techniques results in a considerable discrepancy of outcomes and of correlations to various clinical and biochemical manifestations.
Anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with presence of proteinuria, regardless of clinical diagnosis, outcome of ANA screening and laboratory method used for the assessment of anti-dsDNA antibodies.
In distinct subgroups of patients, anti-dsDNA antibodies are also variously associated with presence of other clinical manifestations, such as haematuria, leukopenia, pleuritis and alopecia.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with unknown aetiology. Whether SLE represents one disease entity or is a continuous overlap of aetiologically unrelated organ manifestations is not established.

This is particularly challenging when attempting to determine biomarkers for SLE. Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies are regarded as fairly specific for SLE.B-cell-mediated and T-cell-mediated autoimmunity to the individual components of nucleosomes are considered important in establishing a diagnosis, but the pathogenic and diagnostic roles played by anti-dsDNA and other antibodies are still debated.

Antibodies to dsDNA may have a direct pathogenic effect in lupus nephritis, lupus dermatitisand possibly also in certain aspects of cerebral lupus. How anti-dsDNA antibodies relate to the rest of the clinical components of current classification criteriaremains to be determined.

When emphasising anti-dsDNA antibodies as a central biomarker in SLE, it is important to perceive that these antibodies basically are not representing a homogenous antibody population. Growing insight into the different possible mechanisms of production of antibodies specifically binding to dsDNAchallenges the notion of a specific relationship between all anti-dsDNA antibodies per se with SLE. Which and how anti-dsDNA antibodies are pathogenic has also been questioned.

We aim to explore in the present investigation whether the positivity of anti-dsDNA antibodies is a biomarker indicating presence of defined clinical phenotypes, such as, for example, arthropathy or nephropathy or serositis, rather than a defined diagnosis, such as SLE.

### Speckled antinuclear antibodies in keratinocytes – what does it mean? [^1177TVLu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Epidermal in vivo nuclear staining is occasionally noted in the lupus band test (LBT) in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD). The exact clinical significance of this finding remains unelucidated, especially in association with a positive LBT We have reviewed the clinical and serological characteristics of patients with in vivo-bound antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in keratinocytes.

Methods

Between 1990–1999 speckled IgG staining in keratinocyte nuclei was observed in 31 LBT specimens. We had detailed clinical and laboratory data for 22/31 patients. The present study comprises 22 patients with in vivo-bound ANA (8 cases with mixed CTD (MCTD), 10 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), one with undefined CTD and one clinically healthy mother of a child with neonatal lupus erythematosus), and 22 consecutive CTD patients (2 MCTD, 15 SLE, 5 SS) without in vivo-bound ANA. Antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) antibodies were determined using indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA methods.

Results

A significant difference (p < 0.01) in anti-RNP antibodies between patients with and without in vivo-bound ANA was observed. Consequently, there was a strong association of in vivo-bound ANA and anti-RNP antibodies (p < 0.01). In SLE patients with in vivo-bound ANA the incidence of nephropathy was significantly lower (p < 0.01), regardless of LBT positivity. In SLE patients there were no differences in LBT positivity, anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement consumption between groups.

Conclusion

Our study implies that the presence of speckled ANA in keratinocytes in LBT may be useful in the diagnosis of MCTD and in the prognosis of renal involvement, especially in SLE patients.

### Performance of antinuclear antibodies for classifying systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic literature review and meta-regression of diagnostic data [^111FfXxZ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published literature on the performance of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)-HEp-2 antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing for classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published between January 1990 and October 2015. The research question was structured according to Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format rules, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were followed where appropriate. Meta-regression analysis for diagnostic tests was performed, using the ANA titer as independent variable, while sensitivity and specificity were dependent variables.

Results

Of 4,483 publications screened, 62 matched the eligibility criteria, and another 2 articles were identified through reference analysis. The included studies comprised 13,080 SLE patients in total, of whom 12,542 (95.9%) were reported to be IIF-ANA positive at various titers. For ANA at titers of 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320, meta-regression gave sensitivity values of 98.4% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 97.6–99.0%), 97.8% (95% CI 96.8–98.5%), 95.8% (95% CI 94.1–97.1%), and 86.0% (95% CI 77.0–91.9%), respectively. The corresponding specificities were 66.9% (95% CI 57.8–74.9%), 74.7% (95% CI 66.7–81.3%), 86.2% (95% CI 80.4–90.5%), and 96.6% (95% CI 93.9–98.1%), respectively.

Conclusion

The results of this systematic literature review and meta-regression confirm that IIF-ANAs have high sensitivity for SLE. ANAs at a titer of 1:80 have sufficiently high sensitivity to be considered as an entry criterion for SLE classification criteria, i.e., formally test other classification criteria for SLE only if ANAs of at least 1:80 have been found.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^115NUGAD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A major challenge for the development of diagnostics to detect early SLE is to find biomarkers that are relatively disease specific (table 1). This is complicated by the fact that SLE along with other many autoimmune diseases in established and preclinical phases share immune features. ANAs and other autoantibodies are commonly observed in conditions other than those specific for the disease in question. These so-called alternative autoantibodies are especially frequent and broadly represented in SLE and preclinical conditions related to SLE. Furthermore, more than 180 autoantibodies are associated with SLE, which means that the usual clinical panels that include a dozen or less specificities are not providing a wide-angle picture of the autoantibody landscape. Arrays that measure 100 or more autoantibodies simultaneously have been investigated as an approach to developing a more comprehensive autoantibody profile. These arrays have been used to show that subjects with higher SLE risk, including first-degree relatives and those with incomplete lupus (ILE, a condition defined as having one or two criteria for SLE classification in addition to an ANA), have greater IgG autoreactivity than healthy controls. Another array platform with 200 specificities was developed with a different goal, to rule out SLE in patients suspected of having the disease. The test platform offered quantitative results expressing the likelihood of an SLE diagnosis, which could be useful for sorting out ANA-positives in a primary care practice. While this test was capable of distinguishing patients with SLE and those with no SLE, performance in undifferentiated, early or incomplete patients has not been reported.

### The anti-DNA antibody: origin and impact, dogmas and controversies [^117Tzm9p]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The inclusion of 'the anti-DNA antibody' by the ACR and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) as a criterion for systemic lupus erythematosus does not convey the diverse origins of these antibodies, whether their production is transient or persistent (which is heavily influenced by the nature of the inducing antigens), the specificities exerted by these antibodies or their clinical impact-or lack thereof. A substantial amount of data not considered in clinical medicine could be added from basic immunology evidence, which could change the paradigms linked to what 'the anti-DNA antibody' is, in a pathogenic, classification or diagnostic context.

### Repeat testing of antibodies and complements in systemic lupus erythematosus: when is It enough? [^114TnEMu]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently undergo repeat testing for antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (anti-ENA), but it is not known whether this is necessary or cost-effective. This study characterized the frequencies of changes in anti-ENA, anti-dsDNA, and complement C3 and C4 upon repeat testing.

Methods

Chart review was done at one site of 130 patients with SLE enrolled in the 1000 Canadian Faces of Lupus prospective registry with annual antibody and complement testing. We determined the frequency of seroconversion (changes) on the next test and over the entire followup given 1 or multiple consistent results, and the cost to detect these changes.

Results

Overall, 89.4% of patients had no changes in anti-ENA screening results from the first available test, 3.3% changed from negative to positive, and 7.3% from positive to negative. Following a single anti-ENA test, 3.9% of negative tests changed to positive and 4.2% of positive changed to negative on the next test. After multiple consistent tests, the frequencies of changes progressively declined. No changes from the first test were observed in anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4 in 60.8%, 83.3%, and 75.4% of patients, respectively. After 2 consistent anti-ENA tests, the cost to detect 1 change was above US$2000.

Conclusion

Anti-ENA results change infrequently, especially following 1 or more negative tests. The high cost and lack of evidence that changes affect management suggest that repeating anti-ENA tests routinely is unnecessary. Anti-dsDNA and complements change more frequently after an abnormal result, but less after a normal value.

### Sensitivity of classification criteria from time of diagnosis in an incident systemic lupus erythematosus cohort: a population-based study from Norway [^115UcQLh]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex, heterogeneous autoimmune disease, with partly overlapping phenotypes that evolve from disease onset and undergo multiple changes across the course of the disease. Immune complexes containing autoantibodies is a hallmark of the disease and compiled data from the recent international SLE classification project (detailed below) showed that 98% of patients scored positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by standardised indirect immunofluorescence testing. While the presence of additional, more specific autoantibodies binding double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), Smith ribonucleoprotein (anti-Sm) and membrane phospholipids (anti-PL) makes the diagnosis more likely, they are never more than diagnostic aids.

In SLE, the immune-mediated inflammation has destructive potential. Thus, if the disease is left untreated, targeted organs are at high risk of structural damage and loss of function. This implies that diagnostic delay, with the thwarted start-up of immune-suppressive therapies, is critical to avoid, as it may result in a situation where the patient already at time of diagnosis has severe, and sometimes irreversible, damage in one or more organ systems. Moreover, there is evidence that delayed diagnosis may increase the likeliness of persistent disease activity and flares, which has an impact on disease burden, damage accrual and mortality.

In the absence of diagnostic criteria, the current 'gold-standard' case definition for SLE and the basic eligibility criterion for all types of SLE research (including studies of early SLE), is 'diagnosis confirmed by expert clinical assessment'. However, this case definition is liable to bias, thus the case definition for research must be accompanied by classification criteria to secure homogeneity and comparability. Requiring high specificity, classification, in general, comes with the risk of low sensitivity. Accordingly, classification may exclude a significant proportion of patients, for example, from testing of new treatments in clinical trials.

Reflecting the need for better representation of SLE patients in clinical trials, it was an expressed ambition of the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) classification criteria to increase sensitivity, especially for patients with early disease, compared with the 1997 ACR criteria. This consequently accommodates inclusion earlier in the disease course to trials on newer treatments. Moreover, the new criteria were constructed as an additive scoring system, and as proposed when the criteria were launched, recent studies have linked higher scores to a more severe disease progression and higher risk of organ damage.

### Lupus in the 21st century [^1142i996]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the years we have witnessed significant innovations in the clinical management of SLE. This supplement will focus on the most recent clinical developments over the last 20 years, building on the legacy of the 20th century. With this aim, a group of renowned SLE experts were asked to approach SLE from a number of perspectives, most importantly the clinical perspective, to provide a comprehensive update for clinicians involved in daily disease care.

As a crucial milestone in the history of lupus, the 21st century saw two large group works aimed at redefining disease classification: namely, the new 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE and the classification criteria of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics group published 7 years earlier. In this supplement, Aringer and Johnson clearly retrace the steps of this process.

Both classification systems highlight the importance of the immunological variable in order to classify a patient with SLE. The 2019 criteria took this one step further by placing ANA positivity as an obligatory entry criterion in the classification process. Complement also forms part of the new criteria and has a significant bearing on the final score. Furthermore, especially in the most recent criteria, cutaneous items underwent substantial revisions and the concept of biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN) with ANA or anti-dsDNA positivity as a stand-alone manifestation was further refined. Non-infectious fever represents the only entirely new criterion within the EULAR/ACR 2019 classification criteria and helps with early classification.

From a clinical point of view, a significant level of new data has emerged in the last 20 years regarding neuropsychiatric (NP) and renal manifestations. In 1999 the ACR published a standard nomenclature as well as a set of case definitions for 19 NP syndromes in SLE, laying the foundation for renewed scientific interest in NPSLE. Since then there has been considerable scientific focus on the diagnosis and attribution of the wide spectrum of NP events occurring in SLE patients as reviewed by Govoni and Hanly.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^115p1Tge]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

Disease activity monitoring in SLE includes serial measurement of anti-double stranded-DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, but in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive, the utility of repeated measurement is unclear. We investigated the usefulness of serial anti-dsDNA testing in predicting flare in SLE patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive.

Methods

Data were analysed from patients in a multinational longitudinal cohort with known anti-dsDNA results from 2013 to 2021. Patients were categorized based on their anti-dsDNA results as persistently negative, fluctuating or persistently positive. Cox regression models were used to examine longitudinal associations of anti-dsDNA results with flare.

Results

Data from 37 582 visits of 3484 patients were analysed. Of the patients 1029 (29.5%) had persistently positive anti-dsDNA and 1195 (34.3%) had fluctuating results. Anti-dsDNA expressed as a ratio to the normal cut-off was associated with the risk of subsequent flare, including in the persistently positive cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.87; P < 0.001) and fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.66), both for a ratio > 3. Both increases and decreases in anti-dsDNA more than 2-fold compared with the previous visit were associated with increased risk of flare in the fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65; P = 0.008) and the persistently positive cohort (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.71; P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Absolute value and change in anti-dsDNA titres predict flares, including in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients. This indicates that repeat monitoring of dsDNA has value in routine testing.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^114ZNfsX]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoantibodies

In essence, SLE is a multi-autoantibody and immune complex disease. With more autoantibody tests available over time, immunological abnormalities are seen in essentially all patients with SLE. In parallel, the importance of securing the presence of immunological abnormalities has become obvious, with the phase II belimumab clinical trial showing effects in serologically active patients only. While the latter is not surprising, the SLICC criteria have responded by making at least one immunological criterion an absolute requirement for SLE classification.

A systematic literature search and metaregression within the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria project found that the vast majority of SLE patients [97.8% (95% CI 96.8, 98.5)] have positive ANAs, or have at least been ANA positive historically. In a Delphi exercise, SLE experts all over the world also closely linked ANA and SLE. Given the high sensitivity of the ANA test, combined with its low specificity, and the fact that ANAs are used as a screening parameter in clinical routines, ANAs are now an obligatory entry criterion for the EULAR/ACR 2019 SLE classification criteria. While this precludes (always) ANA-negative SLE patients from classification by the new criteria, this is a very uncommon situation acceptable for classification.

### 2019 European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^113BFFJW]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "EULAR/ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus" for systemic lupus erythematosus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The EULAR/ACR (European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology) classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. The target patient population includes individuals with suspected SLE, a complex autoimmune disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations.

The primary components of the EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE include a variety of clinical and laboratory features. The presence of anti-nuclear antibodies at a titer of ≥ 1:80 on HEp-2 cells or an equivalent positive test is an entry criterion. Constitutional symptoms, hematologic features, neuropsychiatric presentations, mucocutaneous involvement, serosal involvement, musculoskeletal involvement, renal involvement, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, and SLE-specific antibodies are all considered in the scoring system. Each of these components is assigned a specific value, and the cumulative score is used to determine the likelihood of SLE.

The diagnostic criteria for SLE are met if the cumulative score is ≥ 110. If the score is < 110, the diagnostic criteria for SLE are not met. The EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of SLE, incorporating a broad range of clinical and laboratory features that reflect the multisystem nature of the disease.

The EULAR/ACR classification criteria calculator is designed to evaluate the likelihood of diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by assigning scores based on a variety of clinical and laboratory findings. It begins with requiring positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) at a titer of ≥ 1:80, which contributes 100 points to the score, serving as a crucial entry criterion. Absence of this test awards no points.

The following features each add specific point values to the overall score:

- **Constitutional Symptoms**:

- **Fever**: 2 points

- **Hematologic Features**:

- **Leukopenia**: 3 points
- **Thrombocytopenia**: 4 points
- **Autoimmune hemolysis**: 4 points

- **Neuropsychiatric Presentations**:

- **Delirium**: 2 points
- **Psychosis**: 3 points
- **Seizure**: 5 points

- **Mucocutaneous Involvement**:

- **Non-scarring alopecia**: 2 points
- **Oral ulcers**: 2 points
- **Subacute cutaneous or discoid lupus**: 4 points
- **Acute cutaneous lupus**: 6 points

- **Serosal Involvement**:

- **Pleural or pericardial effusion**: 5 points
- **Acute pericarditis**: 6 points

- **Musculoskeletal Involvement**:

- **Joint involvement**: 6 points

- **Renal Involvement**:

- Proteinuria > 0.5 g/24 hours: 4 points
- **Renal biopsy Class II-V lupus nephritis**: 8 points
- **Renal biopsy Class III-IV lupus nephritis**: 10 points

### Genetic analysis of asymptomatic antinuclear antibody production [^114zxVoe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are associated with several immune‐mediated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren disease, and others. The population prevalence of ANA positivity in the United States was estimated to be 13.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.2%–15.5%), with evidence suggesting a rising prevalence of autoimmunity over recent decades. However, variability in ANA test methods and titer interpretation leads to differences in reported ANA positivity prevalence across studies. Environmental factors such as body mass index and parity status have been shown to be associated with ANA positivity, but the role of genetic factors in ANA production is less defined. Only one genome‐wide association study (GWAS) has been performed, showing the association of a variant near the HLA‐DRA gene with ANA positivity in Japanese individuals.

Previous research showed that ANA production precedes the onset of clinical symptoms in patients with SLE, suggesting that asymptomatic ANA positivity might be an intermediate state on the pathway to the development of clinical autoimmunity. However, most individuals who are ANA positive do not develop any immune‐mediated disease. Because autoimmune diseases are complex conditions that arise from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, understanding the genetic factors associated with asymptomatic ANA production could provide insights into the early pathways of autoimmunity development and differentiate them from the terminal pathways that lead to clinical pathology. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of genetic susceptibility in ANA production in a large cohort across multiple populations.

### Incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus: what remains after application of American College of Rheumatology and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics criteria? [^111zBp8Y]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by formation of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and is known to have a wide range of clinical features 1. The judgment of experienced physicians is generally accepted as the gold standard for the diagnosis of SLE; however, especially for research aims, accurate disease classification is important to create comparable, consistent study groups. For that purpose, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SLE were proposed 2, 3. A patient is classified as having SLE when 4 of 11 cumulative clinical and immunologic ACR criteria are met (Table 1) (3). In order to increase sensitivity, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) more recently composed new criteria that were validated in 2012 4 (Table 1). The most important differences between the ACR 1997 criteria and the SLICC 2012 criteria include the merging of criteria for subacute or acute cutaneous lupus and photosensitivity and addition of alternative forms of chronic cutaneous lupus; the addition of nonscarring alopecia as a clinical criterion; the redefinition of arthritis; the redefinition of the hematologic criteria; the separation and extension of immunologic criteria; the allowance of biopsy‐confirmed lupus nephritis in the presence of ANAs or anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) to be sufficient for classification of SLE; and the requirement of at least 1 immunologic and 1 clinical criterion for SLE classification. Currently, new classification criteria for SLE are under review by a ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) collaboration 5.

### Antinuclear antibody testing for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113bfRPo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory condition that may involve multiple organ systems. Although the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive in nearly every case of SLE, it is not specific for this disease and must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Key features that warrant ANA testing include unexplained multisystem inflammatory disease, symmetric joint pain with inflammatory features, photosensitive rash, and cytopenias. ANA staining patterns and more specific autoantibody testing may be helpful in diagnosis of suspected SLE or ANA-associated disease. For patients with nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue, ANA testing is of limited value.

### Longitudinal anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) seroconversion in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective study of Swedish cases with recent-onset disease [^1145NKGp]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy remains a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Whether or not IF-ANA status varies over time is controversial. We therefore designed a prospective study with longitudinal follow-up of patients with recent-onset SLE. The study population consisted of 54 recently diagnosed SLE cases, all meeting the 1982 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and/or the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. Clinical follow-up data, including disease activity, organ damage and sera, were collected from clinical onset of SLE and onwards, in most cases yearly (0–96 months). IF-ANA was analysed on human epithelial cells-2 (HEp-2) cells and categorized regarding staining patterns. Using an addressable laser bead assay (FIDIS™ Connective profile), we measured IgG-ANA fine specificities against Ro52/SSA, Ro60/SSA, Sjögren's syndrome type B antigen (La/SSB), Smith antigen (Sm), Smith antigen/ribonucleoprotein (Sm/RNP), U1 RNP (U1RNP), dsDNA, ribosomal-P protein and histone. At baseline, all patients were judged ANA-positive at an abnormal titre corresponding to the 95th percentile of healthy blood donors, but seven of 54 patients (13%) lost ANA-positivity over time. Homogeneous (AC-1; 46%) and speckled (AC-4 or 5; 31%) were the most frequently observed patterns at inclusion, whereas 7% switched pattern at least once during follow-up. Established associations between ANA fine specificities and clinical data were confirmed. Levels of anti-Sm/RNP, but not of anti-dsDNA, correlated with clinical disease activity [modified SLE disease activity 2000 (mSLEDAI-2K)]. Our data indicate that a considerable proportion of Swedish patients with SLE lose ANA-positivity over time, whereas consistent staining patterns were frequent. The clinical and mechanistic relevance of ANA seroconversion remains uncertain. Further prospective evaluations in larger SLE populations with more diverse ethnicities are warranted.

### Autoantibody-based subgroups and longitudinal seroconversion in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus [^114Vo1Pp]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and result in significant organ damage and failure. Approximately 15%~20% of patients with SLE develop the disease before their 18th birthday and are therefore diagnosed with juvenile-onset SLE (JSLE).JSLE is characterised by multiorgan impairments with great variability and with scarce data in early ages. Although advances in the management of JSLE have led to a remarkable improvement in the survival of patients, severe organ involvement or flare over time still leads to unfavourable outcomes. Therefore, to judge prognosis and determine medication, further study in JSLE is of great clinical significance.

There is an extensive heterogeneity and frequency of autoantibodies in SLE. Therefore, the diagnostic entities in SLE are delineated by sets of consensus criteria. In order to improve the understanding of underlying pathogenesis, diagnostics and disease prognosis, prior findings suggest that subgroups can be identified on the basis of the autoantibody profile in adult SLE and distinct autoantibody-defined phenotypes may exist.

Furthermore, autoantibodies do fluctuate during treatment in the setting of adult lupus. However, the clinical relevance of indirect immunofluorescence-ANA (IF-ANA) seroconversion remains uncertain. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated subgroups based on autoantibodies and longitudinal seroconversion in JSLE before. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate autoantibody-based subgroup framework and to examine the clinical value of autoantibody fluctuation in JSLE.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^111pEjJz]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This situation would benefit greatly from improved diagnostic tests with robust sensitivity and specificity and quantitative outputs. These tests would not circumvent the eventual need for specialist evaluation, which requires complex analysis and specialised training. Instead they would be most useful for detecting and triaging patients who are urgently in need of referral to see the specialist. While the presence of antibodies to double-stranded DNA is a long-standing and useful specific biomarker for SLE, the low sensitivity of this test, as well as its low predictive value in individuals with non-specific symptoms, makes it a less than robust screening tool. Similarly, serum levels of complement proteins C3 and C4 correlate with formation of immune complexes that are central to the pathogenesis of SLE, but while low complement levels are informative about activity in established SLE, early, undifferentiated disease may be less commonly associated with depressed complement levels. In a recent study of patients with three American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, who were considered to have probable SLE, less than 10% had hypocomplementemia.

### Are anti-nucleosome antibodies a better diagnostic marker than anti-dsDNA antibodies for systemic lupus erythematosus? A systematic review and a study of metanalysis [^113JS1X9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Methods to detect anti-nucleosome antibodies (ANuA) have been available for more than 10 years and the test has demonstrated its good sensitivity and high specificity in diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite these data produced through clinical and laboratory research, the test is little used.

Objective

To verify the diagnostic performance of methods for measuring ANuA and to compare them with those for anti-dsDNA antibodies.

Data Sources

A systematic review of English and non-English articles using MEDLINE and EMBASE with the search terms "nucleosome", "chromatin", "anti-nucleosome antibodies" and "anti-chromatin antibodies". Additional studies were identified checking reference lists in the selected articles.

Study Selection

We selected studies reporting on anti-nucleosome tests performed by quantitative immunoassays, on patients with SLE as the index disease (sensitivity) and a control group (specificity). A total of 610 titles were initially identified with the search strategy described. 548 publications were subsequently excluded based on abstract and title. Full-text review was undertaken as the next step on 62 publications providing data on anti-nucleosome testing; 25 articles were then excluded because they did not include either SLE patients or a control group, and 37 articles were selected for the metanalysis. Finally, a sub-metanalysis study was conducted on the 26 articles providing data on both ANuA and anti-dsDNA antibody assays in the same series of patients.

Data Extraction

Extraction of data from selected articles was performed by two authors independently, using predefined criteria: the number of patients with SLE as the index case, and the number of healthy or diseased controls; specification of the analytical method used to detect anti-nucleosome and anti-dsDNA antibodies; the cut-off used in the study; and the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Demographic and clinical data on the population investigated (adults or children; lupus patients with or without nephritis; patients with active or inactive disease) were also recorded and analyzed in a separate evaluation.

Results

The systematic review and metanalysis showed that the overall sensitivity of the ANuA assay is 61% (confidence interval-CI, 60–62) and the specificity 94% (CI, 94–95). The overall positive likelihood ratio is 13.81 (CI, 9.05–21.09) and the negative likelihood ratio 0.38 (CI, 0.33–0.44). The odds ratio for having SLE in ANuA-positive patients is 40.7. The comparative analysis on anti-dsDNA antibodies conducted on the 26 studies which provided data for both antibodies showed that ANuA have greater diagnostic sensitivity (59.9% vs 52.4%) and a specificity rating only slightly higher (94.9% vs 94.2%). The probability that a subject with positive ANuA have SLE is 41 times greater than a subject with negative ANuA, while for anti-dsDNA the probability is 28 times greater. These figures are even more impressive in children, in whom ANuA have an odds ratio for the diagnosis of SLE of 146, compared to 51 for anti-dsDNA antibodies. In selected studies, ANuA (p < 0.0001) but not anti-dsDNA antibodies (p = 0.256) were significantly associated with disease activity measured by the international score systems. However, neither antibody appears to correlate with kidney involvement.

Conclusions

Data from the metanalysis have shown that ANuA have equal specificity but higher sensitivity and prognostic value than anti-dsDNA antibodies in the diagnosis of SLE. Despite a certain heterogeneity among the various studies, the use of ANuA appears more efficacious than anti-dsDNA.

### Performance of the proposed ACR-EULAR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a cohort of patients with SLE with neuropsychiatric symptoms [^112DGwYz]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The second explanation relates to limitations we encountered using the proposed ACR–EULAR criteria. First of all, ANA has been proposed as entry criterium. However, in our cohort, we found nine patients with the clinical diagnosis of SLE and a sufficient amount of points for the proposed criteria, but with negative ANA. All but one of these patients also had negative anti-dsDNA. Seven of these patients had biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN), of which five had LN class IV, one LN class V and one LN class III. In addition, two patients had LN for which they received immunosuppressive treatment (class unknown). When ANA was not used as entry criterium, sensitivity increased to 90% (95% CI 87% to 94%), while specificity remained similar. As a consequence, using the proposed criteria would exclude patients with ANA-negative LN from (future) clinical studies. In addition, it is known from previous studies that patients with early SLE can have negative ANA as well. Therefore, we think that using ANA positivity as an entry criterium should be reconsidered, especially in the case of biopsy-proven LN.

### The clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody test result [^112xNQSS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This retrospective study investigated the clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test performed outside of the rheumatology setting. Prior studies have investigated the frequency of ANA positivity within the general population. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical utility of a positive ANA test result in a real-world setting by reviewing the final diagnoses of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for evaluation of a positive ANA test result.

Methods

We reviewed the records of patients presenting to the authors between July 2007 and July 2009. Patients were included in the evaluation if they were referred for a positive ANA test result. All relevant descriptive and laboratory data were collated, as were the initial reasons for ordering ANA testing and the ultimate diagnoses reached. Positive predictive values for a "positive ANA test result" were calculated for all antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic diseases and for lupus specifically.

Results

A total of 232 patients were referred for a positive ANA test result. The positive predictive value of a positive ANA test result in this cohort was 2.1% for lupus and 9.1% for any antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease. No antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease was identified in patients with an ANA < 1:160. The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was widespread pain (54/232, 23.2%).

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, more than 90% of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for a positive ANA test result had no evidence for an ANA-associated rheumatic disease. The poor predictive value of a positive ANA in this cohort was largely attributable to unnecessary testing in patients with low pretest probabilities for ANA-associated rheumatic disease.

### Information on diagnosis and management of systemic lupus erythematosus derived from the routine measurement of 8 nuclear autoantibodies [^111ANDc4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the value of routine measurement of a panel of 8 nuclear autoantibodies (ANA/8) for the diagnosis and management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

To estimate disease sensitivity of ANA/8, we studied 25 patients with new SLE and 114 with new and established SLE. To estimate disease specificity, 100 patients with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included. We used computerized statistical analysis of the level of 8 ANA in relation to clinical activity determined as Systemic Lupus Activity Measure disease activity scores (DAS). Data were collected retrospectively from the charts of 114 patients with 698 visits and evaluated by multiple and piece-wise linear regression analysis (PWLRA) and correlation and cluster analyses.

Results

The disease sensitivity of the 3 types of SLE profiles identified was 100% for new SLE patients (n = 25) and 87% for mixed SLE patients; the disease specificity was 98%. Autoantibody levels of anti-ssDNA, dsDNA, and Scl-70 were the best individual correlates of general and organ-specific DAS. Twenty-four percent (R²) of the variability in the general DAS was explained by the multiple regression (R = 0.49), with significant contribution made by anti-Scl-70 (β = 0.39), dsDNA (β = 0.17), Sm (β = 0.10), and SSA (β = 0.08). PWLRA indicated that for 68% of the 698 clinical presentations (average 6/patient), the observed DAS and the predicted DAS from autoantibody levels were both low and clustered; they were partially discrepant for the remaining 32%, which was explained by the relatively high correlation of DAS with prior changes in autoantibody levels (R = 0.6). The changes in DAS and in anti-dsDNA levels were significantly predicted by the multiple regression at one prior visit, with anti-ssDNA as the main contributor.

Conclusion

The ANA/8 profile showed ~ 100% sensitivity and ~ 98% specificity for SLE and correlated with contemporary and subsequent changes in DAS and autoantibody levels. Among autoantibodies of this profile, anti-ssDNA (ssDNA) was the most sensitive indicator of SLE and the main contributor to prediction of subsequent changes in DAS.

### Don't order ANA and other autoantibody testing on a child… [^114t92Ww]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The ANA has a high sensitivity for only one disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, but has very poor specificity for systemic lupus erythematosus and every other rheumatic disease. Therefore, it is not useful or indicated as a general screen of autoimmunity. A positive ANA may occur secondary to polyclonal activation of the immune system following an infection, or it may be positive without any identifiable reason/disease in up to 32% of the population. Limiting patients on which to order ANA would reduce unnecessary physician visits and laboratory expenses, as well as parental anxiety. "Lupus panels" and other similar panels should also not be ordered without concerns for specific autoimmune disease. Additionally, since the ANA may always be positive and may fluctuate in titer, it is not recommended to retest it unless there is some new clinical concern.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^113Sm7Dn]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Establishing a diagnosis of SLE is currently based on clinical acumen, laboratory testing and adaptive use of criteria that were designed to classify participants for clinical research. A young woman presenting with a photosensitive malar rash, non-erosive arthritis and typical autoantibodies would not stump an experienced rheumatologist or dermatologist. Complicated diagnostic algorithms in such a scenario are unnecessary. However, the problem of lupus diagnosis extends far beyond this type of presentation on both sides of the equation, the patient and the provider. On the patient side, early detection of SLE remains a challenge. Recent analyses suggest that many patients with SLE present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, fatigue or arthritis, rather than more typical lupus findings such as malar rash. On the provider side of the equation, such patients are most likely to present to primary care physicians or advanced practice providers who are unlikely to be thinking of a rare disease like SLE, and who may not see a need for rheumatological consultation. Delay in getting such a patient to a rheumatologist or lupus specialist is further complicated by the poor performance of the ANA which is the major screening diagnostic. The ANA is extremely sensitive for lupus, but has a high prevalence in the normal populationmaking it too non-specific to be very useful as a screening test. When an ANA-positive patient is referred to a busy rheumatology practice, there is no sense of urgency if other lupus-suggestive symptoms or laboratory tests are not present. In some rheumatology practices, more than 10%–15% of incoming requests for consultation are for evaluation of ANA positivity, so this is not a small problem. Some of these ANA-positive individuals are in an early stage of an evolving lupus syndrome, but identification of those who are at risk is not readily accomplished with available laboratory tests. Therefore, during what can be a long wait time to evaluation, it is likely that some of these ANA-positive patients will have evolution of disease with development of damage at the time of presentation to the lupus specialist. Even nephropathy has been seen in a significant proportion of early lupus cohorts.

### Clinical utility of antinuclear antibody tests in children [^112wnHjB]. BMC Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests are frequently used to screen children for chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the diagnostic utility of this test is limited because of the large number of healthy children who have low-titer positive tests. We sought to determine the clinical utility of ANA tests in screening children for rheumatic disease and to determine whether there are specific signs or symptoms that enhance the clinical utility of ANA tests in children.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective analysis of 509 new patient referrals. Charts of patients referred because of results of ANA testing were selected for further analysis. Children with JRA, SLE, and other conditions were compared using demographic data, chief complaints at the time of presentation, and ANA titers.

Results

One hundred ten patients were referred because of an ANA test interpreted as positive. Ten patients were subsequently diagnosed with SLE. In addition, we identified one patient with mixed connective tissue disease, and an additional child with idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon. Eighteen children of the children referred for a positive ANA test had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Another 80 children with positive ANA tests were identified, the majority of whom (n = 39, 49%) had musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Neither the presence nor the titer of ANA served to distinguish children with JRA from children with other musculoskeletal conditions. Children with JRA were readily identified on the basis of the history and physical examination. Children with SLE were therefore compared with children with positive ANA tests who did not have JRA, designated the "comparison group". Non-urticarial rash was more common in children with SLE than in children without chronic inflammatory disease (p = 0.007). Children with SLE were also older (mean ± sd = 14.2 ± 2.5 years) than the comparison group (11.0 ± 3.6 years; p = 0.001). ANA titer was also a significant discriminator between children with SLE and children without chronic inflammatory disease. The median ANA titer in children with SLE was 1: 1,080 compared with 1:160 for other children (p < 0.0001). ANA titers of ≥ 1,080 had a positive predictive value for SLE of 1.0 while titers of ≤ 1: 360 had a negative predictive value for lupus of 0.84.

Conclusion

Age and ANA titer assist in discriminating children with SLE from children with other conditions. ANA tests are of no diagnostic utility in either making or excluding the diagnosis of JRA.

### New classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^112pyiZY]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To compare the recently published European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for SLE with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Centers (SLICC) criteria and the earlier ACR criteria, focusing on their key concepts.

Recent Findings

Although the SLICC criteria introduced numbers of new criteria items, the new EULAR/ACR criteria added only noninfectious fever, based on an early SLE cohort study and an SLE patient survey, and condensed hematological, mucocutaneous and neurological items. Whereas the SLICC criteria maintained the overall structure familiar from the ACR criteria, the EULAR /ACR criteria use antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an obligatory entry criterion, have weighted criteria and group these in domains. Where the SLICC criteria greatly increased sensitivity, losing some specificity, the EULAR/ACR criteria increased specificity again, for excellent classification criteria performance.

Summary

Despite differences in structure and statistical performance, the EULAR/ACR and SLICC criteria agree on the importance of both immunological and clinical findings, on the high impact of lupus nephritis by histology, and on most clinical items.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^113kKUDP]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the EULAR and the ACR jointly published new classification criteria that incorporated state-of-the-art knowledge about the role of serological findings in SLE. The working group employed sophisticated methodology. The new classification was meticulously derived from a carefully curated cohort of patients with lupus and non-lupus, and the initial publication included a carefully assembled validation cohort. The non-lupus subjects in this cohort had 'conditions mimicking SLE', and prior to both derivation and validation, all subjects were centrally adjudicated for the absence or presence of SLE.

The sensitivity of the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification was improved over the 1997 version and comparable to the 2012 SLICC classification. The specificity of the 2019 classification was 93% in the validation cohort, which was equal to the 1997 ACR classificationwhen applied to the same cohort, and superior to the 2012 SLICC classification, which, interestingly, exhibited the same specificity as in the initial publication (84%). Overall, the 2019 criteria had a larger combined sensitivity and specificity than the 1997 and the 2012 criteria (1.90 vs 1.76 and 1.80, respectively, in the validation cohort).

Importantly, the 2019 classification declared a history of antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity as an entry criterion. This excludes a small number of patients with lupus who have never had a positive ANA test from being classified as SLE, which the authors deemed acceptable for the purpose of recruiting for clinical trials.

Derivation and validation of the 2019 EULAR/ACR were extremely well done, and the new classification was implemented immediately by rheumatologists worldwide. But how does the classification perform in daily clinical practice, where recruitment for studies takes place? Here we report the application of the criteria in a cohort of patients with SLE, patients with non-SLE ARD, and patients with hepatic diseases from a large outpatient clinic of a university medical centre in Germany.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and primary fibromyalgia can be distinguished by testing for cell-bound complement activation products [^113z6Ych]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains the prototypical autoimmune systemic disease in which hyperactivity of the immune system and production of autoantibodies lead to a variety of symptoms including chronic pain, arthralgia, fatigue, morning stiffness and, most importantly, damage in key organs including the kidney and central nervous system. Because SLE is a serious chronic condition associated with significant mortality and burden to the healthcare system, early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy (eg, immunosuppressants, antimalarials and corticosteroids) is important. However, many patients with SLE present with symptoms that are non-specific, do not fulfil formal classification criteria of the disease (eg, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria)and thus may remain undiagnosed for a prolonged time.

This challenge in correctly identifying and diagnosing SLE is further complicated by the low prevalence of the disease (∼1/1000 in the USA) in comparison with other more prevalent rheumatic disorders whose symptoms mimic those of SLEsuch as rheumatoid arthritis, and primary fibromyalgia (FM). In particular, SLE can sometimes be difficult to identify and differentiate from FM, because the prevalence of FM is at least 10-fold greater than that of SLE, and most symptomatic patients (eg, with chronic widespread pain) are initially evaluated by primary care physicians who lack expertise in diagnosing the disease. Moreover, FM is a non-inflammatory pain syndrome, whereas SLE is a systemic inflammatory illness and thus there a significant treatment and prognostic differences between those two conditions.

Traditionally, clinicians distinguish SLE from other illnesses by a combination of clinical history, demographic, age at disease onset together with examination and the determination of laboratory tests that include antinuclear antibody (ANA) among other SLE-specific autoantibodies. ANA is a sensitive test for SLE, and more than 95% of SLE are ANA positive during the course of their disease. However, about 14% of the general population is also ANA positive, and 15%–25% of patients with FM have been reported to be positive for ANA. It follows that the risk of misdiagnosing SLE could be significant, as the vast majority of patients presenting with symptoms mimicking SLE will turn out to have FM and not SLE, even if the ANA test is positive. Other diagnostic tests such as anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) can be helpful in diagnosing SLE, but their utility is limited by their poor sensitivity.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSR 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that ANA are present in ∼95% of patients with SLE. Recognize that the clinical probability of SLE is low if the test is negative. Recognize that a positive ANA test occurs in ∼5% of the adult population, and alone it has poor diagnostic value in the absence of clinical features of autoimmune rheumatic disease.

### Autoantibody-positive healthy individuals display unique immune profiles that may regulate autoimmunity [^115XJMU8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are detected in almost one‐fifth of the general population, yet few individuals are diagnosed as having an autoimmune disease 1, 2. Thus, a substantial percentage of the population carries detectable levels of circulating autoantibodies without developing clinical symptoms. Autoantibodies are also present in the sera of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), many years before clinical disease onset 3, 4. Although some ANA‐positive healthy individuals eventually develop clinical autoimmunity, many do not. The transition to clinical SLE has been correlated with autoantibody profiles combined with female sex, but other risk factors, including age, ANA titer, number of autoantibody specificities, and type I interferon (IFN) signature, do not definitively identify ANA‐positive healthy individuals in whom autoimmune disease develops eventually 5, 6, 7, 8. Comparing ANA‐positive healthy individuals with SLE patients and ANA‐negative healthy controls provides a unique perspective in the dissection of pathogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity and may reveal the means to provide regulatory control.

A delicate balance of inflammatory and regulatory immune cells is required to control infection without promoting autoreactivity. Evolving work has suggested that interactions between both the adaptive and innate immune systems are critical for autoimmune disease pathogenesis 9, 10, 11, 12. For example, IFN‐associated gene signatures are elevated in peripheral blood of SLE patients and correlate with increased disease activity 13, 14, 15, 16. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) are a primary source of type I IFN in SLE 17, 18 and produce type I IFN upon Toll‐like receptor (TLR) stimulation, particularly TLR‐7 and TLR‐9. These receptors may be activated by immune complexes containing double‐stranded DNA (dsDNA) and/or RNA‐associated binding proteins in SLE 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. The IFN signature in SLE is detected in leukocytes involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, such as B cells, T cells, neutrophils, and myeloid cells. However, whether ANA‐positive healthy individuals have a heightened IFN response remains unknown 15, 16.

### Antinuclear antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus in an international inception cohort [^1159nru1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The spectrum of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) is changing to include both nuclear staining as well as cytoplasmic and mitotic cell patterns (CMPs) and accordingly a change is occurring in terminology to anticellular antibodies. This study examined the prevalence of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) anticellular antibody staining using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics inception cohort.

Methods

Anticellular antibodies were detected by IIF on HEp-2000 substrate using the baseline serum. Three serologic subsets were examined: ANA positive (presence of either nuclear or mixed nuclear/CMP staining), anticellular antibody negative (absence of any intracellular staining), and isolated CMP staining. The odds of being anticellular antibody negative versus ANA or isolated CMP positive was assessed by multivariable analysis.

Results

A total of 1,137 patients were included; 1,049 (92.3%) were ANA positive, 71 (6.2%) were anticellular antibody negative, and 17 (1.5%) had an isolated CMP. The isolated CMP-positive group did not differ from the ANA-positive or anticellular antibody-negative groups in clinical, demographic, or serologic features. Patients who were older (odds ratio [OR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00, 1.04]), of white race/ethnicity (OR 3.53 [95% CI 1.77, 7.03]), or receiving high-dose glucocorticoids at or prior to enrollment (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.39, 4.12]) were more likely to be anticellular antibody negative. Patients on immunosuppressants (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.19, 0.64]) or with anti-SSA/Ro 60 (OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.23, 0.74]) or anti-U1 RNP (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20, 0.93]) were less likely to be anticellular antibody negative.

Conclusion

In newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus, 6.2% of patients were anticellular antibody negative, and 1.5% had an isolated CMP. The prevalence of anticellular antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus will likely decrease as emerging nomenclature guidelines recommend that non-nuclear patterns should also be reported as a positive ANA.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^11348V3X]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic autoimmune multisystem condition with a preponderance for affecting women of childbearing age. Higher disease activity, glucocorticoid exposure and increased numbers of flares have each been demonstrated to increase the risk of irreversible organ damage. Therefore, SLE patients require long term monitoring of disease activity in order to reduce the development of damage. Disease activity monitoring has been difficult to standardize given the heterogeneous nature of SLE; some patients have only mild manifestations with no evidence of damage, whereas others have severe disease with end stage organ damage. Monitoring patients using tools that predict flare is potentially of value to identify addressable risk factors for poor outcomes.

Several studies have sought to determine whether biomarkers can predict flare in SLE, including titres of autoantibodies to double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). However, studies of flare prediction lack standardized methodology, and analyses of cross-sectional data have limited ability to guide strategies in the clinic. Furthermore, some patients are persistently serologically active, and the utility of repeating anti-dsDNA tests in this context is poorly understood, while a subgroup of SLE patients are clinically quiescent despite being serologically active, and fluctuations in anti-dsDNA and complement do not appear to predict flare in these patients. Lastly, providers use different assays to measure anti-dsDNA, thus encumbering standardization, monitoring and cross-referencing.

Despite these limitations, anti-dsDNA measurement is often performed repeatedly during SLE management. Widely used disease activity indices such as the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) require anti-dsDNA antibody test results to assign a score. Attainment of the lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) has been demonstrated to reduce damage accrual in SLE, but SLEDAI is included in the definition of LLDAS, meaning serological testing is required to assess LLDAS attainment. As new treatments for SLE emerge, and treatment targets become part of routine practice, SLEDAI or other formal disease activity measurements may be required as part of reimbursed drug access, meaning the potential for a surge in the serial use of these tests, despite limited understanding about cost-effectiveness. We have recently reported very low utility of repeat testing for other common autoantibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies and extractable nuclear antibodies, albeit in the setting of diagnostic screening rather than monitoring of established disease. Should anti-dsDNA antibodies be serially tested in patients in whom the result is always positive?

### Relative value of commercial kits for ANA testing [^115q5VKi]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

We have tested the relative performance of 20 commercial ANA test kits along with that of our own laboratory to assess whether one was clearly superior.

Methods

The sera were drawn from 3 pools that had all been pre-tested in our laboratory: patients with definite SLE; patients with non-connective tissue diseases (CTD), but where a positive FANA had been found; and normal blood donors. The tests were used in accordance with the recommendations of the specific supplier but in a routine serology laboratory.

Results

Sensitivity and specificity ranged between 38 and 100%. While the negative predictive value of 4 ELISA kits was 100%, and most others were close, the HEp-2 kits were 100% in only 1 case. A positive predictive value of 100% was also seen with 1 kit.

Conclusion

Some of the tests are clearly better than others, but the choice may differ depending on the clinical needs, e.g. preference for a good positive or negative predictive value. However, the ELISA kits offered better results than the immunofluorescent technique. Two of them had sensitivity/specificity of > 90%.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^113m6VC4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The question why the ANA test is so frequently positive in populations without an autoimmune disease remains a fascinating one. It suggests that the breaking of immunological tolerance is really quite common, but that this tolerance breakdown only rarely leads to disease. It is possible that antinuclear antibodies have some useful function that is not yet fully understood.

However, the ANA test has such a high false-positivity rate that a positive test is of little, if any, clinical utility as a screening test and should not be ordered routinely to screen children with musculoskeletal complaints. Its use should be limited to the diagnosis of SLE, MCTD, and similar systemic illnesses. If the test is performed, low titer ANA results (< 1:640) in most cases should be ignored unless the child is systemically ill and shows signs of SLE or a similar systemic disease.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^117FEDUY]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

As already pointed out, classification criteria are not intended to be used to make a diagnosis. Notwithstanding, if the 2019 criteria were indeed used to diagnose patients with SLE at our centre, 13% of patients would not be diagnosed. With the 1997 ACR criteria, the sensitivity of 81.4% means that almost one in five patients who were already diagnosed and treated for SLE would not be considered to have SLE, had the classification criteria been applied as diagnostic criteria. This highlights the importance of clinical judgement in the management of SLE.

Still, clinical judgement may not always be accurate, especially in cases of early SLE that may be mistaken for other conditions, including 'undifferentiated' connective tissue disease. This may result in specificities that are lower than expected, especially against the background of the published literature.

The 2019 classification introduced a history of ANA detection as an entry criterion for the classification as SLE. This increases specificity from 97.2% to 98.1%, although at the cost of a loss of sensitivity, which decreases from 92.4% to 87% when the entry criterion is applied. As remarked on by the authors of the original publication, maximum specificity is desired in order for the criteria to serve their purpose, which is to identify a homogeneous patient population for the inclusion in clinical trials. The decreased sensitivity must be kept in mind when using the criteria as a support tool for clinical decision-making. The classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, and to rely solely on these criteria will leave some patients with SLE undiagnosed and, consequentially, untreated.

To our knowledge, this is the largest study of the performance of the 2019 classification in an unselected cohort of patients from an academic tertiary care centre, which regularly participates in clinical trials of patients with lupus. As such, it provides important information about the actual implementation of this new classification system, which is highly relevant for the selection of a homogeneous group of patients for these trials. We deliberately chose to also include patients from the hepatology clinic at our centre in order to better understand the performance of the classification. Autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis are two autoinflammatory diseases whose signs and systems might also be mistaken for lupus if these patients are referred to a rheumatologist by a primary care provider. The subjects with hepatocellular cancer are included in our continuous scientific data collection, and we did not exclude them from the data set for the current study in order to be able to better judge how the lupus classification discriminates against clearly non-inflammatory disease.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^112GFTfv]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for the classification of SLE are the most recent and up-to-date effort to provide a clear framework for the identification of patients with SLE that can be included in clinical trials. SLE is a heterogeneous disease, more a chameleon than a wolf, and this makes it particularly challenging to design and carry out trials of novel medications. Lupus trials are notoriously prone to fail to demonstrate benefit. Being able to clearly define the study cohort is one important prerequisite to pave the way to success.

For the purpose of generating homogeneity, the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification includes a history of ANA positivity as an entry criterion. This provided for maximum specificity, which was one goal of the EULAR/ACR working group, at the expense of decreased sensitivity. Importantly, the classification criteria were not designed to make the diagnosis of SLE, which remains a clinical decision. Nonetheless, all of the items in the classification are typical features of SLE, and as a matter of fact, SLE classification criteria have been useful as an adjunctive tool to make the clinical diagnosis ever since the first inception.

### Uncommon types of autoantibodies-detection and clinical associations [^11138uKU]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Immunofluorescence is a basic method for detection of autoantibodies in serum. It is used as screening for people with symptoms suggesting autoimmune process and disease. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) assay detecting antibodies against nuclear proteins used commonly for diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease, although antibodies against cytoplasmic components and mitotic structures are usable in clinic. The majority of ANA nuclear patterns have been comprehensively studied with increasing data. However, the cytoplasmic and mitotic patterns are underestimated and still require further assessment. In this review the clinical associations and significance of uncommon types of autoantibodies are presented and discussed.

### 2019 European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus [^113ZHKpZ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop new classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) jointly supported by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).

Methods

This international initiative had four phases. 1) Evaluation of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion through systematic review and meta-regression of the literature and criteria generation through an international Delphi exercise, an early patient cohort, and a patient survey. 2) Criteria reduction by Delphi and nominal group technique exercises. 3) Criteria definition and weighting based on criterion performance and on results of a multi-criteria decision analysis. 4) Refinement of weights and threshold scores in a new derivation cohort of 1,001 subjects and validation compared with previous criteria in a new validation cohort of 1,270 subjects.

Results

The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE include positive ANA at least once as obligatory entry criterion; followed by additive weighted criteria grouped in 7 clinical (constitutional, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, mucocutaneous, serosal, musculoskeletal, renal) and 3 immunologic (antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, SLE-specific antibodies) domains, and weighted from 2 to 10. Patients accumulating ≥ 10 points are classified. In the validation cohort, the new criteria had a sensitivity of 96.1% and specificity of 93.4%, compared with 82.8% sensitivity and 93.4% specificity of the ACR 1997 and 96.7% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 2012 criteria.

Conclusion

These new classification criteria were developed using rigorous methodology with multidisciplinary and international input, and have excellent sensitivity and specificity. Use of ANA entry criterion, hierarchically clustered, and weighted criteria reflects current thinking about SLE and provides an improved foundation for SLE research.

### Utility of the AVISE connective tissue disease test in predicting lupus diagnosis and progression [^113KGQwX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
(A) Percentage of AVISE-positive and AVISE-non-positive patients without a diagnosis of SLE at baseline whose diagnosis changed at t = 2. (B) Percentage of AVISE-positive and AVISE-non-positive patients without a diagnosis of SLE at baseline who developed SLE by t = 2. ✱✱✱✱ p < 0.0001.

Patients without an established baseline diagnosis who tested positive fulfilled significantly more total SLICC classification criteria at t = 0 (3.8 ± 2.1) than those who tested non-positive (1.9 ± 1.1) (p = 0.001) (table 2). Similarly, at 2 years, positive patients fulfilled a total of 4.5 ± 2.2 criteria, compared with 2.1 ± 1.2 in non-positive patients (p < 0.0001) (table 2). Looking at the clinical classification criteria alone, scores were still significantly higher in the positive group at baseline (2.1 ± 1.5 vs 1.1 ± 0.8, p = 0.015) and at 2 years (2.4 ± 1.6 vs 1.3 ± 0.8, p = 0.006) (table 2).

Table 2
Number of ACR/SLICC classification criteria fulfilled and SDI at baseline and 2 years for AVISE positive and non-positive patients

For comparison, we examined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of traditional biomarkers for SLE (dsDNA, C3 and C4), ANA and AVISE at t = 0 in predicting a diagnosis of SLE at t = 2. Elevated dsDNA, low C3 and low C4 at t = 0 had good specificity (> 90%), but poor sensitivity (< 20%) for predicting a diagnosis of SLE at t = 2; in contrast, ANA positivity at t = 0 had good sensitivity (87%) but low specificity (39%) (online supplementary table 1). AVISE positivity demonstrated a specificity of 93%, with a sensitivity of 57%, PPV of 65% and NPV of 90% (online supplementary table 1). Using logistic regression, only AVISE positivity was significantly associated with a confirmed diagnosis of SLE at t = 2, with an OR of 10.7 (95% CI 2.6 to 44.9, p = 0.001) (online supplementary table 2).

### Cell-bound complement activation products in systemic lupus erythematosus: comparison with anti-double-stranded DNA and standard complement measurements [^114qH1xC]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains challenging partly because of the heterogeneity of the disease, its evolutive nature and also because there are significant limitations with currently available diagnostic immunology tests. In addition, SLE can be associated with irreversible and unpredictable organ damage, and the disease results in substantial economic burden to the patient and healthcare system. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis is critical. Currently, the diagnosis of SLE rests on a combination of clinical features (history and physical examination), other tests and immunological testing along with classification criteria.

Among the immunological laboratory measurements performed routinely, the detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is pivotal for screening purposes, owing to its high sensitivity. However, the ANA test is imperfect with a 10%–25% false positive rate among healthy individuals. More specific immunological tests such as antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and/or anti-Smith (anti-Sm) are also useful in diagnosing SLE, but these markers lack sensitivity. Other autoantibodies to cellular antigens including antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA: Sjogren's syndrome (SS)-A/Ro, SS-B/La, Centromere (CENP), Jo-1 U1RNP, scleroderma (Scl)-70) are also routinely measured in the clinical immunology laboratory, and while of value, none of these markers have sufficient predictive value on their own to differentiate SLE from other connective tissue diseases. Since patients with SLE often share many clinical features with other connective tissue diseases, the potential for misdiagnosis is not insignificant. It follows that the availability of more sensitive and specific diagnostic tests is highly desirable.

### Incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus: what remains after application of American College of Rheumatology and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics criteria? [^115WsshC]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Requirement of consensus definition for iSLE

Currently, researchers use various definitions for iSLE, which hinders comparability between different studies. Ideally, a classification system would include patients who are at the highest risk of developing SLE or serious organ damage and exclude those who have prolonged mild symptoms or develop other autoimmune diseases. Prospective documentation of a consistent group of patients with iSLE is required in order to better define the high‐risk group and to determine predictive biomarkers. We therefore ask for the development of a consensus on the definition of iSLE in order to, ideally, combine forces and start prospective documentation of patients with iSLE.

Definition of iSLE involves a very heterogeneous group of patients and should include patients at the highest risk of developing SLE. Mucocutaneous symptoms, serositis, renal symptoms, anticardiolipin antibodies, low complement, and anti‐dsDNA are all associated with progression to SLE. Table 3 shows our proposed definition of iSLE, which aims at including patients with a high risk of developing SLE or serious organ involvement. ANA positivity at a titer ≥ 1:80 should be present in order to be classified as iSLE, as this is a key feature of SLE. A recent systematic review and metaregression 22 on the diagnostic value of ANAs reported 97.8% sensitivity and 74.7% specificity for ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80. Also, in an observational study 23 on 616 patients who were referred due to possible SLE, 99.5% of patients with early SLE were ANA positive. The ACR/EULAR international collaboration on development of new classification criteria for SLE has also reached consensus on using positive ANA at a titer ≥ 1:80 as entry criterion 5.

### Applying the 2019 EULAR / ACR lupus criteria to patients from an established cohort: a latin American perspective [^112nCtmB]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinicians rely on their experience and clinical acumen to diagnose and treat patients with lupus. However, for the conduct of clinical studies, being those observational or randomised clinical trials (RCTs), criteria are needed so that patients identified and selected for a given study share defined clinical and laboratory features. Establishing criteria that have good psychometric properties are crucial. Although the 1982 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, modified in 1997 although never validated, have been widely used worldwide, that is not to say that they are perfect. A major effort to develop new criteria was marshalled by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) in the early 2000; this effort resulted in the 2012 SLICC criteria, which have been used as an alternative to the ACR criteria or in conjunction with them. More recently, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the ACR have jointly developed a new set of criteria using a four-phase process: (1) Determining the sensitivity and specificity of AntiNuclear Antibodie (ANA) positivity and establishing it as the entry point and list all possible clinical manifestations of lupus, (2) Item reduction using a nominal group technique and comparing these manifestations in lupus patients and patients with related conditions. In this phase, a group of German patients with early lupus responded to a survey about their clinical manifestations; at the end of this phase, 21 manifestations remained. (3) Weighting of the 21 items selected in phase 2 grouped in two domains: clinical and immunological, and (4) Testing the new criteria in large independent lupus cohorts. There are two main differences between this set of criteria and the previous ones: (1) The premise that to enter the classification criteria, a patient had to be ANA positive and (2) That different criteria exert a different weight towards its fulfilment; the overarching goal of these new criteria is to be able to classify patients as having lupus earlier than with the 1982/1997 ACR or the 2012 SLICC criteria and be able to include them in RCTs and/or longitudinal observational studies. We have now examined whether in fact patients from uncontrolled real-life clinical settings would be classified earlier using the 2019 EULAR/ACR than the 1982/1997 ACR or the 2012 SLICC criteria; to this end, we have used the database from a large, multiethnic, multinational Latin America lupus cohort.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^114YZEX5]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Candidate diagnostic biomarkers for SLE

Other soluble mediators also have potential to detect patients with immune activation in preclinical stages. Some of these may appear even before autoantibodies are measurable. The B cell stimulator BlyS, for example, shows elevated levels in patients with ILE, though lower than the levels in SLE, suggesting an intermediate and possibly evolving stage of B cell activation. Many other circulating cytokines are dysregulated prior to onset of SLE, though not all of these are disease specific. The signature that reflects activation by Type I interferon, for example, is typical of SLE but is also present in patients with RA. A disease-specific preclinical cytokine cocktail has not been described.

Complement activation, which is the basis for the AVISE test, is an immune feature that has relatively greater specificity for SLE compared with other autoimmune conditions, such as RA or autoimmune thyroid disorders, that contribute to ANA positivity. Furthermore, activation of complement is associated with organ damage, especially lupus nephritis. It therefore follows that measurement of CBCAPs has potential to distinguish which ANA-positive individuals are at risk for development of more serious disease. A recent report suggests that patients with newly diagnosed SLE have significantly greater prevalence of hypocomplementemia than patients with conditions that mimic SLE, including undifferentiated connective tissue disease. The patients in this study were collected in clinics staffed by experts in SLE diagnosis and management, which increases the likelihood that disease features would be recognised or measured. Whether AVISE or other tests would be sufficiently informative to risk-stratify ANA-positive patients who are seen in primary practice settings prior to specialty evaluation remains untested.

The field of SLE diagnostics is clearly moving forward at a rapid pace. New test platforms using multiplex approaches are in development for many applications in SLE, including prediction of flare and quantitation of disease activity. In addition to these tests that will help manage patients with established SLE, the need for early risk assessment tools is currently unmet. Most reported studies described here have been carried out in academic rheumatology clinics or specialty practices, rather than at the primary care frontier where the ANA-positive patient, often without any SLE-specific symptoms, is first seen. Bringing testing to this interface will be a necessary step for development of a useful tool to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of SLE.

### Limited sensitivity and specificity of the ACR / EULAR-2019 classification criteria for SLE in JSLE?-observations from the UK JSLE cohort study [^117Awux1]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

As classification criteria aim at high specificity while potentially accepting slightly reduced sensitivity, we investigated an unselected cohort of ANA-positive CYP. Five patients were falsely classified as having JSLE using the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria, while this was the case in four patients when using the SLICC-2012 criteria and in two individuals when using the ACR-1987 criteria. Thus, specificity of the EULAR/ACR-2019 criteria may indeed be limited when compared with that of other sets of criteria, resulting in false-positive results. Other immune complex–mediated conditions with ANA positivity and renal involvement are of particular concern (e.g. IgA vasculitis).

Taken together, while it is challenging to propose changes to consensus-based classification criteria developed following a stringent process, including access to patient data and clinical findings across large (adult) SLE cohorts, from a paediatric perspective, main concerns in relation to false-positive or -negative classification include (i) ANA antibody positivity as an entry criterion (missing a significant proportion of young JSLE patients (]), and (ii) the combination of ANA positivity and immune complex vasculitis triggering classification as SLE (as this may be present in IgA vasculitis, a relatively common condition in childhood). Thus, additional studies further investigating the performance of the ACR/EULAR-2019 classification criteria in multi-ethnic cohorts, across ages, and at different disease stages are warranted. Inclusion of subcohorts of CYP with different systemic inflammatory diseases will be critical for reliably evaluating specificity and sensitivity.

The absence of widely accepted diagnostic tools for JSLE meant that the ACR-1997 criteria needed to be used as a reference standard. Particular strengths of this cohort are the availability of longitudinal data in a national cohort, allowing assessment of classification criteria performance at different disease stages (first vs last visits). This, and the significantly larger sample size are key enhancements when compared with the two previous studies comparing the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria with the ACR-1997 and SLICC-2012 criteria in JSLE cohorts. Future assessment of how these criteria perform in an international cohort of JSLE patients is also warranted.

### Development of autoantibodies before the clinical onset of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111DqJLg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although much is known about the natural history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the development of SLE autoantibodies before the diagnosis of the disease has not been extensively explored. We investigated the onset and progression of autoantibody development before the clinical diagnosis.

Methods

The Department of Defense Serum Repository contains approximately 30 million specimens prospectively collected from more than 5 million U.S. Armed Forces personnel. We evaluated serum samples obtained from 130 persons before they received a diagnosis of SLE, along with samples from matched controls.

Results

In 115 of the 130 patients with SLE (88 percent), at least one SLE autoantibody tested was present before the diagnosis (up to 9.4 years earlier; mean, 3.3 years). Antinuclear antibodies were present in 78 percent (at a dilution of 1:120 or more), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies in 55 percent, anti-Ro antibodies in 47 percent, anti-La antibodies in 34 percent, anti-Sm antibodies in 32 percent, anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies in 26 percent, and antiphospholipid antibodies in 18 percent. Antinuclear, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-Ro, and anti-La antibodies were present earlier than anti-Sm and anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies (a mean of 3.4 years before the diagnosis vs. 1.2 years, P = 0.005). Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, with a mean onset 2.2 years before the diagnosis, were found later than antinuclear antibodies (P = 0.06) and earlier than anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies (P = 0.005). For many patients, the earliest available serum sample was positive; therefore, these measures of the average time from the first positive antibody test to the diagnosis are underestimates of the time from the development of antibodies to the diagnosis. Of the 130 initial matched controls, 3.8 percent were positive for one or more autoantibodies.

Conclusions

Autoantibodies are typically present many years before the diagnosis of SLE. Furthermore, the appearance of autoantibodies in patients with SLE tends to follow a predictable course, with a progressive accumulation of specific autoantibodies before the onset of SLE, while patients are still asymptomatic.

### Appropriateness in anti-nuclear antibody testing: from clinical request to strategic laboratory practice [^115SqYa4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

As a result of rapid changes in laboratory technology, clinical behaviour and patients' expectations, along with limited economic resources, there is a greater requirement for an appropriate use of autoantibody testing. We examine the various aspects and the most controversial points of the diagnostic procedure in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and make recommendations for the most efficient approach to autoantibody testing, based on selected publications and the relevant literature. Appropriateness is a complex task that can be achieved only by combining the efforts from the laboratory and the clinic, thereby using scientific knowledge, inter-disciplinary consultation and expert clinical investigation.

### Genetic relationships between systemic lupus erythematosus and a positive antinuclear antibody test in the absence of autoimmune disease [^113YMN6H]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

In BioVU, there were 12 639 individuals with genotype data available and an ANA test done as part of their clinical care. We excluded individuals with at least one diagnostic code for SLE or common autoimmune diseases known to be associated with a positive ANA (n = 4424, online supplemental table S1), those without an ANA titre reported or with a titre of 1:40 (n = 863), those who were also included in the eMERGE cohort (n = 801) and those from ancestries other than European (n = 1177). Characteristics of the eligible ANA individuals are shown in online supplemental table S2. In addition, there were 65 374 general controls and 662 patients with SLE.

In eMERGE, individuals with an ANA test performed as part of their clinical care (n = 4896) were selected, and individuals with a diagnostic code for a common autoimmune disease (n = 2688) as well as those from ancestries other than European (n = 1495) were excluded.

### Performance of the 2019 EULAR / ACR systemic lupus erythematosus classification criteria in a cohort of patients with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis [^1165a6KT]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with various clinical manifestations in multiple organs including kidney damage.SLE classification criteria have traditionally been focused on by rheumatology clinics rather than non-rheumatology clinics. Particularly, this may be relevant to nephrologists, because patients with renal biopsy findings reminiscent of lupus nephritis (LN) would readily be evaluated based on the criteria to determine the classification. Remarkably, the definition of biopsy-confirmed LN needs to be specified in both SLE classification and histopathological classification. Therefore, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification contains additional cases with 'renal lupus only' provided they are biopsy proven together with detectable ANA and/or anti-Smith antibodies and/or anti-double-stranded (ds)DNA antibodies.SLICC 2012 classification addressed the importance of valid SLE classification criteria in the nephrology clinic by increasing the weight of renal lupus to help distinguish patients with LN better.

The recently developed European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) 2019 criteria set was noted to perform more excellently than previous SLE classification criteria including the 1997 revised ACR SLE classification criteria and 2012 SLICC classification criteria. This classification criteria renewed two novel concepts, namely ANA as an entry criterion along with variably weighed features including seven clinical domains and three immunological items. A total score of 10 points is considered as a cut-off for SLE classification. And these new criteria still reserve the earlier classification of LN based mainly on kidney biopsy. If the entry criterion is fulfilled, for the patients with renal biopsy, they are classified into SLE when they met the criteria of biopsy-proven class Ⅲ or Ⅳ LN or biopsy-proven class Ⅱ or V LN with at least one more criterion.

### Limited sensitivity and specificity of the ACR / EULAR-2019 classification criteria for SLE in JSLE?-observations from the UK JSLE cohort study [^1146wGBY]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to test the performance of the new ACR and EULAR criteria, that include ANA positivity as entry criterion, in JSLE.

Methods

Performance of the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria were compared with Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC-2012), using data from children and young people (CYP) in the UK JSLE Cohort Study (n = 482), with the ACR-1997 criteria used as reference standard. An unselected cohort of CYP positive for ANA (n = 129) was used to calculate positive/negative predictive values of the criteria.

Results

At both first and last visits, the number of patients fulfilling the different classification criteria varied significantly (P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the SLICC-2012 criteria was higher when compared with that of the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria at first and last visits (98% vs 94% for first visit, and 98% vs 96% for last visit; P < 0.001), when all available CYP were considered. The ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria were more specific when compared with the SLICC-2012 criteria (77% vs 67% for first visit, and 81% vs 71% for last visit; P < 0.001). Significant differences between the classification criteria were mainly caused by the variation in ANA positivity across ages. In the unselected cohort of ANA-positive CYP, the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria produced the highest false-positive classification (6/129, 5%).

Conclusion

In CYP, the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria are not superior to those of the SLICC-2012 or ACR-1997 criteria. If classification criteria are designed to include CYP and adult populations, paediatric rheumatologists should be included in the consensus and evaluation process, as seemingly minor changes can significantly affect outcomes.

### New insights into the role of antinuclear antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112DeUmt]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) that form immune complexes that mediate pathogenesis by tissue deposition or cytokine induction. Some ANAs bind DNA or associated nucleosome proteins, whereas other ANAs bind protein components of complexes of RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Levels of anti-DNA antibodies can fluctuate widely, unlike those of anti-RBP antibodies, which tend to be stable. Because anti-DNA antibody levels can reflect disease activity, repeat testing is common; by contrast, a single anti-RBP antibody determination is thought to suffice for clinical purposes. Experience from clinical trials of novel therapies has provided a new perspective on ANA expression during disease, as many patients with SLE are ANA negative at screening despite previously testing positive. Because trial results suggest that patients who are ANA negative might not respond to certain agents, screening strategies now involve ANA and anti-DNA antibody testing to identify patients with so-called 'active, autoantibody-positive SLE'. Evidence suggests that ANA responses can decrease over time because of the natural history of disease or the effects of therapy. Together, these findings suggest that, during established disease, more regular serological testing could illuminate changes relevant to pathogenesis and disease status.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus classification and diagnosis [^116BFcgW]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology 2019 classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were published, they were externally validated by groups worldwide. In particular, the new criteria worked well also in East Asian and pediatric cohorts. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) as an entry criterion were critically discussed, but the group of ANA-negative patients is small (< 5%) worldwide. Specificity of the criteria is dependent on correct attribution only of those criteria that are not better explained by other causes. Although the classification criteria should not be used for diagnosis, many novel aspects inform diagnostic considerations.

### Fifty years of anti-ds DNA antibodies: are we approaching journey's end? [^111aPsXu]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The year 2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the identification of antibodies to double-stranded (ds) DNA. Whilst widely regarded as synonymous with patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), doubts have been raised about their significance and the extent to which they are genuinely part of the pathogenesis of the disease rather than being mere bystanders. Problems with assays used to detect them are still evident but they remain widely utilized both to help establish the diagnosis of SLE and to monitor the progress of the disease. This review explores each of these aspects and concludes that whilst some way short of ideal, their measurement remains a useful criterion for the disease and some of these antibodies do appear to be genuinely pathogenic. However, further research is needed to establish beyond 'reasonable doubt' whether they are merely part of the spectrum of anti-nucleosome antibodies, the precise mechanisms by which they 'exert' their pathogenic effects and to what extent blocking them would be a useful therapeutic goal.

### Abnormal antinuclear antibody titers are less common than generally assumed in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus [^112dPEs7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests in established cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (F-ANA) and enzyme-immunoassays detecting antinucleosomal antibodies (ANSA-EIA).

Methods

Sera from 50 patients with SLE and 65 patients with RA were analyzed regarding abnormal concentrations of F-ANA (serum dilution ≥ 1:200 = 95th percentile among 300 healthy blood donors). The sera were also analyzed with 2 commercial ANSA-EIA kits.

Results

An abnormal F-ANA titer occurred in 76% of the SLE sera compared to 23% in RA, and was not related to present use of antirheumatic drugs. At dilution 1:50, 84% of the SLE sera were F-ANA-positive compared to 20% of healthy women. Forty percent and 56%, respectively, of the SLE sera tested positive in the 2 ANSA-EIA kits. By the most sensitive assay, 96% of the ANSA-positive SLE sera produced a homogenous (chromosomal) F-ANA staining pattern compared to 18% of the ANSA-negative SLE sera. Ten of the 15 F-ANA-positive RA sera (63%) generated homogenous F-ANA staining and 13 (20%) tested positive in the most sensitive ANSA-EIA, but with no correlation to the F-ANA staining pattern.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of F-ANA at an abnormal titer was surprisingly low (76%) in established cases of SLE. ANSA occurred in 56% of the SLE sera, but also in a fair number (20%) of RA sera. Practically all ANSA-positive SLE sera were identified by chromosomal F-ANA staining. We conclude that the antigen-specific antinucleosomal EIA does not have high enough diagnostic specificity to justify use of this analysis for routine diagnostic purposes.

### Variability in antinuclear antibody testing to assess patient eligibility for clinical trials of novel treatments for systemic lupus erythematosus [^11673yfL]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the development of novel therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity represents a criterion for trial eligibility. Since as many as 30% of patients enrolled in trials have been ANA negative, we evaluated the performance characteristics of immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) for ANA determinations for screening.

Methods

This study used 5 commercially available IFAs to assess the ANA status of 181 patients enrolled in a phase II clinical trial for an anti-interleukin-6 antibody. Enrollment included a detailed review of medical records to verify a historical ANA value. IFA results were related to various clinical and serologic features at enrollment.

Results

While the frequency of ANA negativity assessed by the central laboratory was 23.8% in a cohort of 181 patients, the evaluated IFA kits demonstrated frequencies of negativity from 0.6 to 27.6%. With 2 IFA kits showing a significant frequency of ANA negativity, positive and negative samples differed in levels of anti-double-stranded DNA, C3, and presence of other ANAs as well as the frequency of high interferon (IFN) expression.

Conclusion

These findings indicate that, when used for screening, IFAs can vary because of performance characteristics of kits and thus can affect determination of trial eligibility. With kits producing a significant frequency of ANA negativity, ANA status can be associated with other serologic measures as well as the presence of the IFN signature, potentially affecting responsiveness to a trial agent.

### Limited sensitivity and specificity of the ACR / EULAR-2019 classification criteria for SLE in JSLE?-observations from the UK JSLE cohort study [^116XY43G]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, the ACR and the EULAR proposed a new set of classification criteria for SLE (ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria), validated in large adult SLE cohorts. ANA positivity is a mandatory entry criterion (an ANA titre of ≥ 1:80 on human epithelial type 2 cells or equivalent positive test result). Thereafter, a weighted scoring system requires the patient to score ≥ 10 points to be classified as SLE. Similar to the SLICC-2012 criteria, the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria are separated into clinical and immunological features. Based on data from adult cohorts, the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria show better sensitivity than the ACR-1997 criteria (96% vs 83%) and comparable sensitivity with the SLICC-2012 criteria (97%). Specificity is the same for the ACR/EULAR-2019 and ACR-1997 criteria (both 93%) and lower for the SLICC-2012 criteria (84%).

Data on performance of ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria in JSLE is limited to two relatively small cohorts that both suggested limited specificity when compared with ACR-1997 or SLICC-2012 criteria. These studies did not include longitudinal assessment of the ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria.

This study aimed to: (i) test performance of the ACR/EULAR-2019 classification criteria in the UK JSLE Cohort Study population longitudinally (first vs last visits) and in relation to age at diagnosis (pre-/peri-/post-pubertal); (ii) investigate ACR/EULAR-2019 criteria in an unrelated cohort of ANA-positive individuals; and (iii) compare the performance of the ACR/EULAR-2019 classification criteria with that of the ACR-1997 and SLICC-2012 criteria.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^112HJL82]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

For diagnosis, it is important to stress that the sensitivity of ANA of 96–99% means that truly and persistently ANA-negative SLE is possible, although uncommon. Moreover, there are disquieting data that ANA sensitivity may be seriously deficient on some HEp-2 or HEp-2000 cell substrates, even when a highly experienced laboratory performed the IIF assay as the gold standard. The same may be even more troublesome for other test systems, and it is important to know the true performance characteristics of the ANA test in local use. With an appropriately sensitive ANA test, however, an uncommon disease will be quite unlikely with the ANA screening test being negative.

Positive ANAs in SLE are mostly caused by antibodies to chromatin components, i.e. dsDNA and histone proteins that together form nucleosomes, and by RNA binding proteins, which are usually also found in the cytoplasm. Of the antibodies against RNA binding proteins, those against the Smith (Sm) antigen are specific for SLE, while isolated anti-U1RNP antibodies are the hallmark antibody of MCTD and anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are even more common in SS and may occur in SSc. Accordingly, anti-Sm antibodies are included in the 1982 and 1997 ACR classification criteria, the 2012 SLICC criteria and now the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria, where they have a weight of 6, more than half of the necessary 10 points needed for the classification cut-off.

### Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus [^116UdRoD]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem inflammatory disease that is often difficult to diagnose. Before the diagnosis can be established, four of 11 clinical and laboratory criteria must be met. Antinuclear antibody titer is the primary laboratory test used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the low prevalence of the disease in primary care populations, the antinuclear antibody titer has a low predictive value in patients without typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, as specified by the American College of Rheumatology, this titer should be obtained only in patients with unexplained involvement of two or more organ systems. Patients with an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 and characteristic multiorgan system involvement can be diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus without additional testing; however, patients with an antibody titer of 1:40 who fail to meet full clinical criteria should undergo additional testing, including tests for antibody to double-stranded DNA antigen and antibody to Sm nuclear antigen. While an antinuclear antibody titer of less than 1:40 usually rules out systemic lupus erythematosus, patients with persistent, characteristic multisystem involvement may be evaluated for possible antinuclear antibody-negative disease.

### Genetic relationships between systemic lupus erythematosus and a positive antinuclear antibody test in the absence of autoimmune disease [^113jt3bc]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANAs are a diverse group of antibodies that are routinely measured as part of the clinical evaluation for the diagnosis of SLE and several other autoimmune disorders. A positive ANA test at a titre of 1:80 or greater is a requirement to meet the classification criteria for SLE; however, approximately 12%–20% of the general population have a positive ANA in the absence of an autoimmune disorder, and 2% have high titres.

In some autoimmune diseases such as SLE, ANAs play a role in disease pathogenesis through the deposition of immune complexes in tissues, promotion of cytokine production, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and cross-reactivity with different cellular antigens. The role of ANAs occurring in the absence of autoimmune disease is, however, unclear. Some studies have suggested associations with atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events, several types of cancerand all-cause mortality. We previously found that a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease was associated with an increased risk of Raynaud's syndrome and alveolar/perialveolar-related pneumopathies. Moreover, the immunological profile of people with a positive ANA without autoimmune disease is altered and characterised by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, antibody production and upregulation of genes involved in autoimmune diseases.

These observations suggest that people without autoimmune diseases who have a positive ANA test may share some of the immunological dysregulation characteristics of SLE and, thus, may have a similar genetic predisposition. Accordingly, comparing the genetic predisposition with SLE and a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease could provide insights into shared biology. The genetics of SLE are well-characterisedand twin studies have shown that ANA production in SLE has a genetic component; however, the genetic architecture of ANA production is not well-defined and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for positive ANA have not been performed in populations of European ancestry.

We hypothesised that individuals with a positive ANA in the absence of autoimmune disease and SLE would only partially overlap genetic architectures. Thus, defining the architecture of ANA positivity could improve our understanding of the biology of these diagnoses and identify genetic factors that discriminate individuals at risk for SLE from those with a positive ANA. To define the genetic architecture of a positive ANA without an autoimmune disease, we performed a GWAS using the current recommended titre threshold for ANA positivity (≥ 1:80)and compared the SNPs associations with those in patients with SLE to better understand their genetic relationships.

### Validation of the 2019 EULAR / ACR classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in an academic tertiary care centre [^113vLC69]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Items' performance of the 2019 classification system

When the individual items of the 2019 EULA/ACR classification were analysed for the current cohort, the entry criterion of a history of ANA positivity had a sensitivity of 94.9% (95% CI, 92.8% to 96.5%; table 4), making ANA positivity the single most sensitive item. The next most sensitive item was detection of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies (78.9%; 95% CI, 75.4% to 82.1%; table 4).

Among the 31 (5.1%) of patients with SLE who did not have documented ANA positivity, 14 had dsDNA antibodies and 18 had malar rash. Three had lupus nephritis, and in 13 cases, complement (C3/C4) was depleted.

Two items of the 2019 classification were highly specific for SLE: class III/IV lupus nephritis and the combination of low C3 and low C4 complement levels were each 100% specific with narrow CIs (table 4), followed by class II/V lupus nephritis, either low C3 or low C4 complement levels, delirium, psychosis and autoimmune haemolysis, that each had 99.9% specificity.

Considering the individual non-SLE diagnoses, specificities of low C3 and low C4 were 100% for each diagnosis. Specificities of either low C3 or low C4 were 100% for all diagnoses but two: vasculitis and undifferentiated connective tissue disease, where one patient from both groups met this criterion.

As expected, the least specific item was a history of ANA positivity (66.6%), followed by thrombocytopenia (87.2%; table 4). Interestingly, even anti-dsDNA antibodies were only 91.1% specific (table 4). Leucopenia was 94.6% specific. All other items had specificities of at least 96.1% (table 4).

### Recommendations for the use of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in the diagnosis and follow-up of systemic lupus erythematosus – A proposal from an expert panel [^112Vfhrv]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies are listed as one of the classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are relatively effective indicators for monitoring disease activity and treatment response. Therefore, clinicians rely on them to diagnose and adjust medication and treatment strategies for SLE patients. However, the use of anti-dsDNA antibodies is not free from controversy. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that anti-dsDNA antibodies are found in several disorders, besides SLE. In addition to this, anti-dsDNA antibodies are a heterogeneous group of antibodies, and their determination still lacks proper standardization. Moreover, anti-dsDNA testing specificity and diagnostic performance change depending on the population under study. These and other issues result in inconsistency and encumber the clinical use of anti-dsDNA antibodies. A panel of medical laboratory and clinical experts on SLE discussed such issues based on their clinical experience in a first meeting, establishing a series of recommendations. The proceedings of this first meeting, plus an exhaustive review of the literature, were used to compose a paper draft. The panel subsequently discussed and refined this draft in a second meeting, the result of which is this paper. This document is relevant to clinical laboratories as it guides to improving diagnosis and monitoring of SLE. Simultaneously, it will help laboratories compile more informative reports, not limited to a mere number. It is also relevant to clinical doctors who wish to better understand laboratory methods so that they can do a more efficient, better-aimed laboratory test ordering.

### Prevalence of neuropsychiatric lupus in psychosis patients who have tested positive for antinuclear antibodies [^114NasVb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Psychosis is a rare manifestation of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Current guidelines do not make a recommendation regarding the use of antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing in the assessment of patients with psychosis. The present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of NPSLE in patients with psychosis who were positive for ANAs.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients who were admitted to the mental health service of 2 metropolitan tertiary referral centers with a diagnosis of psychosis and had been tested for ANAs was conducted. A diagnosis of SLE was made when the 2019 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification criteria were fulfilled. Attribution of psychosis-related events to NPSLE were made according to validated criteria.

Results

There were 10,205 mental health admissions with diagnoses of psychosis representing 4,766 individual patients, 911 patients (19%) were tested for ANAs, 135 (15%) of those tests returned a positive result with a titer of ≥ 1:160. The mean ± SD follow-up time was 47 ± 26 months. At discharge, there were 4 patients who met 2019 ACR/EULAR criteria for SLE, 2 of whom met criteria for NPSLE (2 patients had other manifestations of SLE), yielding an NPSLE prevalence of 1.5% (2 of 135) among patients who were positive for ANAs, and 0.2% (2 of 911) among all patients who underwent testing for ANAs.

Conclusion

The prevalence of NPSLE in patients with psychosis who were positive for ANAs was low, at 1.5%. The low rate of clinically significant positive results would argue against routine testing for ANAs in patients with psychosis.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^112fxUrv]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One approach to making better diagnostics is to multiplex tests, combining ones that each have predictive value but that are not correlated with each other. In a Bayesian analysis, the increased probability of disease gained from a positive result in a test associated with the condition can be augmented by a negative result in a test that rules it out. The AVISE Connective Tissue Disease test uses this approach and consists of two parts. The first is a series of autoantibodies whose Bayesian combination produces a numerical result that is akin to a post-test probability. The second and unique component of this test is measurement of cell-bound complement C4 activation products (CBCAPS). Circulating immune complexes are felt to be central to the pathogenesis of lupus by activating neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Measurement of complement activation on cell surfaces is a convenient and reproducible method of assessing these soluble immune complexes. A two-tier test strategy is proposed. If a patient has any of the highly specific tests (high titre anti-dsDNA, high titre anti-Sm or extremely high titre cell-bound C4d) they are likely to have SLE. While anti-DNA and anti-Sm levels are commonly measured in the evaluation of patients suspected of having lupus and are highly specific biomarkers, they do not identify all patients due to low sensitivity. The addition of cell-bound C4d added approximately 10% to the diagnostic accuracy, as judged by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve when compared with the use of hypocomplementemia or anti-DNA titre alone. However, only 2% of patients with lupus had extremely elevated erythrocyte C4d and only 14% of patients with lupus had extremely elevated B cell C4d such that they could be used to signify lupus by themselves, underscoring the importance of autoantibody testing in addition to the CBCAPS. If none of these biomarkers (anti-Sm, anti-DNA or CBCAPS) are highly positive, then an 'index' consisting of various antibody titres and more moderate, but still elevated, levels of cell-bound C4d is calculated. If either the tier 1 or tier 2 test is positive, then the overall test is considered positive. When the test was used in a heterogeneous group of subjects including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory myositis and healthy controls, the overall sensitivity for lupus was 80%, which is lower than what would be optimal for a screening test. The test has fair specificity for discriminating lupus from other connective tissue diseases (70%–92%) and high specificity for discriminating lupus from healthy controls (98%). It also has been shown to distinguish patients with SLE from those with fibromyalgia (FM) with 100% specificity, meaning that none of the patients with FM had a positive CBCAPS test result. Overall, the positive likelihood ratio for the test was 5.6 when trying to differentiate lupus from other rheumatic diseases and 40 when used to distinguish lupus from healthy controls. While these studies suggest that the CBCAPS test characteristics are better than the stand-alone antibody tests in this population, no studies have looked at the cost-effectiveness of the CBCAPS test strategy versus standard antibody testing interpreted by an experienced rheumatologist or the potential population health consequences of using CBCAPS as a screening test and missing 20% of lupus cases.

### A multianalyte assay panel with cell-bound complement activation products demonstrates clinical utility in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112KuAmk]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rheumatologists often rely on traditional biomarkers, such as autoantibodies and complement levels, to facilitate the differential diagnosis of SLE, even if these biomarkers have suboptimal diagnostic accuracy. The superior clinical validity and accuracy of novel diagnostic tests over traditional biomarkers is insufficient to satisfy the scrutiny from stakeholders in the healthcare system, including payors, clinicians and patients. Thus, new diagnostic technologies need to demonstrate their clinical utility in improving patient outcome.

This study strengthens previous data that demonstrated the clinical utility of the MAP test. By reviewing medical records of a large number of patients suspected of SLE — with positive and negative MAP scores — at three time points over the course of approximately 1 year, this study demonstrates that the MAP test has a favourable impact on physician behaviour. In particular, a positive test increased the confidence in ruling-in SLE while a negative test increased the physician confidence that SLE was an unlikely diagnosis. Importantly, the MAP also informed appropriate treatment decisions.

Virtually all patients with SLE are ANA positive at presentation. Because the study aimed to evaluate physician behaviour in patients for whom the rheumatologist had a suspicion of SLE, we included in the study only ANA-positive patients as determined at Exagen laboratory. As SLE has low incidence and prevalence even in rheumatology practices, the majority of patients for whom the MAP is ordered obtain a negative score. Thus, to evaluate physician behaviour based on both positive and negative test results, the patient selection was conducted to enrich the study for patients with positive results (n = 98, 61%). The ability to rule-out SLE in symptomatic patients is equally important, as misdiagnosis can cause stress in patients without autoimmune diseases and can lead to unnecessary rheumatology consultations, further testing and inappropriate treatment. Thus, the study also included 63 patients (39%) with a negative score (< −0.1). To decrease risk of bias, positive and negative patients were selected from the same practice and 12 rheumatology practices throughout the USA participated in the study. Overall, the patient population included in the study was typical of patients suspected of SLE, with ANA, arthritis and cutaneous manifestations being the most common ACR classification criteria at study entry (online supplemental material).

### Unusual presentations of systemic lupus erythematosus: a narrative review [^1132D5Yw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an almost 10:1 female predominance, the presence of deleterious nuclear autoantibodies, a tendency for flare, and striking protean manifestations. Early diagnosis is associated with less damage accrual, lower costs, and improved quality of life due to timely treatment. However, early disease may not uncommonly show nonspecific presentation, a single classification criterion, or an unusual organ involvement contributing to frequent, often substantial diagnostic delays. We reviewed the literature (1982–2022) to accumulate and classify all reports of rare, atypical, and unusual presentations. These can involve almost every organ and system, and thus, present to physicians in every discipline and setting. Increasing physicians' awareness of the potential of occult SLE to appear in varied, diverse, and unexpected presentations, may encourage the inclusion of SLE in the differential. Informed history and examination focusing on systemic and joint symptoms and mucocutaneous involvement, and basic tests (focusing on leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria; followed by antinuclear antibodies and complement levels) will correctly diagnose most patients on presentation or within the following months and enable timely treatment.

### The performance of different classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus in a real-world rheumatology department [^1171k4PV]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Classification criteria are used every day by rheumatologists. The intent of developing new classification criteria is to improve the sensitivity and specificity compared with older sets of criteria, particularly in specific subgroups such as in early disease. The ideal tool has both high sensitivity and specificity. Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models, taking into account the number of correct predictions from the total number of predictions.

Among the SLE classification criteria, the SLICC 2012 was reported to have a higher sensitivity than older ACR 1997 criteria and introduced the concept of having both clinical and immunological features to support the diagnosis of SLE. The EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria further explored the concept for a requirement to have a positive ANA at entry. In the validation study the EULAR/ACR 2019 had a greater sensitivity and specificity than the ACR 1997, but a lower sensitivity than SLICC 2012 criteria.

Our data confirmed the slightly lower sensitivity by EULAR/ACR 2019, predominantly due to the entry criterion of positive ANA. In contrast to the earlier report, we have found that the EULAR/ACR 2019 did not have a higher specificity when compared with the SLICC 2012 criteria in our study. This is likely because of the controls that were used, as we intentionally included patients who had diagnoses such as other non-SLE connective tissue diseases or other systemic vasculitis. The lower specificity of EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria when used against other rheumatological conditions may be due to the attribution rule, but it is still of interest to rheumatologists when trying to apply the criteria in individual cases. Interestingly the ACR 1997 criteria performed well in the differentiation between SLE vs non-SLE in our study.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^111BdaAR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

ANA in clinic populations-ANA titers

Chudwin et al. in 1983 evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings in 138 children with a positive ANA test. The authors interpreted the fact that two-thirds of the patients had a specific connective tissue disease as being indicative that the ANA test is useful. Yet the fact that one third did not have a definitive inflammatory disease indicates that the ANA test has a very high false positivity rate.

We evaluated the results of all the ANA tests performed at British Columbia's Children's Hospital over a 5 year span. We found that the ANA test was positive at a titer of 1:20 or greater in 41% of all sera tested, and in 65% of all patients in whom a diagnosis could be obtained from the ordering physician. The frequency was the same for those children with or without a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease. At a screening serum dilution of 1:40 a positive test had a sensitivity of only 63% and a positive predictive value (the frequency that a positive test is indicative of disease) of only 33% for any rheumatic disease.

For SLE, MCTD or overlap syndrome, the ANA had a very high sensitivity of 98%, but a very low positive predictive rate of only 10%. Positive and negative predictive values are affected by the prevalence of the disease being tested. Therefore one might expect somewhat better predictive values from a pediatric rheumatology clinic than from a wide population of ill children. We concluded from this study that although a negative ANA test made the diagnosis of SLE or MCTD extremely unlikely, a positive test at even moderately high titers of 1:160 has little or no diagnostic value.

Comparison of the different sets of classification criteria

Table 1 summarizes the diagnostic characteristics of the different sets of classification criteria. The SLICC 2012 and SLERPI 2020 criteria both had the highest sensitivity out of the four sets of criteria evaluated. Specificity was highest using ACR 1997 criteria, at 95.9% (95% CI: 90.8, 98.7%). The SLICC 2012 criteria has the highest overall accuracy at 94.4% (95% CI: 91.7, 97.1%).

Overall performance of SLE classification criteria

The EULAR/ACR 2019 classification criteria had a slightly lower sensitivity based on a false-negative rate of 5.1% (20/394). The misclassified cases were mostly due to a lack of positive ANA (12/20, 60%), despite having a range of compatible clinical features such as classic malar rash, mouth ulcers, positive anti-dsDNA, biopsy proven lupus nephritis or a number of haematological manifestations. The rest of the misclassified cases were patients with inflammatory arthritis or cutaneous lupus, with some but insufficient serological features to meet criteria.

Conversely the EULAR/ACR 2019 had a false-positive rate of 12.2% (15/123), including patients with an alternative connective tissue disease diagnosis (5/15, 33.3%), inflammatory arthritis (5/15, 33.3%), vasculitis (3/15, 20%), Still's disease (1/15, 6.7%) and sarcoidosis (1/15, 6.7%). Clinical features such as inflammatory arthritis, which could account for 6 points in the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria, was present in 11/15 cases (73.3%). A variety of other criteria such as hypocomplementaemia (9/15, 60%), haematological manifestations (2/15, 13%) and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (2/15, 13%) were also seen in the controls.

### Evaluation of structured data from electronic health records to identify clinical classification criteria attributes for systemic lupus erythematosus [^11698KYf]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SLE is a complex disease with highly variable presentation that makes it difficult to identify and characterise. We examined whether rule-based algorithms for SLE classification criteria could be used to detect attributes of the criteria in the structured EHR data of persons with lupus and distinguish them from our healthy cohort. Our results, based on an SLE cohort with linked medical records that had been fully adjudicated for the ACR classification criteria, demonstrate that all three existing classification criteria (ACR, SLICC and EULAR/ACR) have the potential to describe persons with lupus in EHR data and distinguish them from a known healthy patient cohort and that the algorithms have high overall sensitivity and specificity. Thus, classification criteria-based algorithms may be a foundation for characterisation and identification of people with lupus.

The overall performance of the algorithms to discriminate between people with and without lupus was similar, consistent with the significant attribute overlap between the ACR, SLICC and EULAR/ACR criteria definitions and how those attributes are assessed. The SLICC-based algorithm demonstrated higher sensitivity than those based on ACR and EULAR/ACR, likely due to the stronger reliance of the SLICC criteria on individual laboratory attributes compared with clinical attributes, which were easier to detect in EHR data and had generally higher sensitivity and specificity than clinical attributes. In particular, SLICC scores individual laboratory attributes, while the ACR criteria incorporate them in composites (immunological and haematological disorders) thus reducing their power to define 'definite lupus' compared with clinical attributes in this context. The EULAR/ACR classification criteria require a positive ANA test as an entry criterion before the rest of the attributes are assessed. Depending on policies in the care environment, the ANA test may not be repeated if evidence of a historic positive test is present. Some patients in our SLE cohort have a long history of lupus and their ANA tests were performed prior to entering the CLD or receiving care documented in the EHR. The ANA test for these patients was documented in their clinical notes and could not be detected as a laboratory result, reducing the number of patients who were assessed for the full set of criteria and the overall sensitivity of the EULAR/ACR-based algorithm in our data set. Given that one of the stated goals of the EULAR/ACR criteria was to include attributes that were found earlier in the development of disease, such as fever, this problem may be less relevant when assessing the information of newly identified patients with lupus. Importantly, while the SLICC algorithm had the best overall performance in this study and may be a good choice for general studies using EHR data, all three algorithms are viable for use in medical records and different populations of patients with lupus, research applications and EHR documentation approaches may make a given algorithm preferable in different environments.

### Finding lupus in the ANA haystack [^1132MwPs]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of SLE in early stages is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of presenting symptoms and the poor performance metrics of the screening ANA test. Even the more specific double-stranded DNA autoantibody has relatively low predictive value in early disease. A consequence is delayed referral, with the likelihood that some patients have progression of disease prior to specialist evaluation. Tests that might fill this diagnostic gap are therefore needed. The AVISE Connective Tissue Disease Test that uses a multiplex approach to detect autoantibodies and cell-bound complement products has shown utility in distinguishing SLE from other rheumatological conditions. Whether it might be useful in early disease stages to predict progression is addressed in a recent study by Liang and colleagues, who tested clinic patients who had non-specific findings with the objective of determining whether AVISE could predict onset of SLE. While this test provided more useful prognostic information than other available diagnostics, it had relatively low sensitivity, suggesting that significant numbers of patients with preclinical SLE would be missed by this screening. The need remains for development of diagnostics with robust sensitivity and specificity in early disease that would also deliver prognostic information about risk for SLE. Such tests would have great value as a tool for primary providers to more efficiently triage ANA-positive patients for appropriate specialty evaluation.

RESULTS

Distinct rates of seroconversion between specific

To study whether differences in seroconversion exist between specific ANAs, historical laboratory data from EHRs of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE were analyzed. For each ANA, more than 200 patients had multiple measurements for which the range of variation over time could be assessed (Supplementary Table 4). Representative examples of antibody fluctuations are shown in Figure 1A and B. Figure 1C–H displays the range of antibody levels per ANA, with each bar representing an individual patient. With the exception of anti‐dsDNA, upper limits of routine care measurements are applicable; variation above this limit is unknown. Although restricted by this measurement limit, it appears that especially for anti–SS‐A and anti–SS‐B levels, fewer patients have a wide range of antibody levels. Anti‐Sm/RNP, on the other hand, seem to display antibody level ranges similar to anti‐dsDNA.

### Performance of the 2019 EULAR / ACR systemic lupus erythematosus classification criteria in a cohort of patients with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis [^116UoqCA]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These proposed EULAR/ACR criteria have strong operating characteristics using the structure and weighting in classification of SLE, promoting our understanding of the disease to help guide treatment strategies. Furthermore, the unique separation of renal biopsy findings addresses the importance of their differential impact on the SLE classification and underlying disease pathogenesis. As a new tool for classification and research, the newly developed criteria would be undoubtedly useful in the clinical practice of nephrology clinic. Herein, we reported the first study to evaluate the performance of EULAR/ACR criteria for SLE in an Asian validation cohort of patients on the basis of the renal biopsy findings.

Our findings show that, due to the ANA entry requirement, the new criteria performed a sensitivity of 95% in our cohort were comparable with those of the 2012 SLICC criteria. Without their renal biopsies, the sensitivities of the new criteria were decreased from 95.24% to 89.68%, which showed renal biopsy in patients help to optimise the classification of SLE. Similar to our results, the sensitivity of 2012 SLICC criteria is 100% in a cohort of patients with full house glomerular deposits. Additionally, it could be concluded that overall, the EULAR/ACR classification performed well in our cohort, but the entry criterion of positive ANA (≥ 1:80) compromised the sensitivity, which is consistent with the recent findings. It has been reported that the 2019 criteria for SLE possibly misclassify the real SLE cases as non-SLE, especially if patients have a low titre (< 1:80) of ANA. Notably, cut-off titres for mmunofluorescence (IF)-ANA differs among laboratories, depending on various factors. Consequently, it is doubtful whether a cut-off for IF-ANA of 1:80 is universal to use worldwide. This entry criterion has limited influence on increasing specificity of SLE classification.

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^115amtqm]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria maintained specificity at the level of the ACR criteria and increased sensitivity almost to the level of the SLICC criteria, but erring on the side of higher specificity, where necessary. This and the attempt to keep the list relatively short have led to the exclusion of uncommon criteria items and of lymphopenia. Some of this reductionist approach has been criticized. We think that it was necessary for classification, and the EULAR/ACR criteria were designed for classification, not diagnosis. Even though the same formally holds true for the SLICC criteria, their considerably longer list contains additional items that may play a role in diagnosing SLE. Likewise, many of the exclusions listed in the ACR and SLICC criteria may be good reminders.

Twenty years into the 21st century, both SLE classification and diagnosis still rely on clinical manifestations and autoimmune serology. While modern science approaches will change this approach at some point, we do not expect major changes in the near future. However, additional markers, e.g. the type I interferon signature, may well add to our repertoire of meaningful tests relatively soon, presumably starting with diagnosis and finding their way into classification once established worldwide. For classification, the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria are now the standard, and many of their central rules, some taken from the older ACR and SLICC criteria, also educate diagnostic thinking: it is important to have both clinical and immunological findings, and most SLE patients are ANA positive. SLE manifestations may develop over time and need not exist simultaneously. Items should only be attributed to SLE if there are no explanations that are more likely. Manifestations within one organ domain are interrelated and not independent of each other. Items do have different weights in reality, which for the list of criteria have been quantified in the EULAR/ACR criteria approach. What all these facts show is a disease manifested by several autoantibodies and immune complexes and the resulting variable organ manifestations.

Significance — initial and standard therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Hydroxychloroquine should be standard therapy for all people with SLE unless contraindicated, glucocorticoids should be used primarily for initial control of immune-mediated inflammation and during flares as needed, with tapering as soon as possible, and early introduction of immunosuppressive therapies (conventional and/or biologic) for ongoing SLE activity is encouraged to achieve control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduction in SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimization of glucocorticoid-related toxicities.

### Different indirect immunofluorescence ANA substrate performance in a diagnostic setting of patients with SLE and related disorders: retrospective review and analysis [^11123ciQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, ANA seroconversion (negative to positive) occurred even within 2 years of initial testing using the same assay. In 2002, an ACR committee suggested that due to a lack of evidence, 'serial ANA testing is of unknown value'. ANA positivity may change with fluctuations in antibodies such as anti-dsDNA, which in turn correlate with disease activity, and it has also been established that autoantibodies start to be detectable and specificities accumulate prior to the onset of SLE. One retrospective cohort study of 36 715 ANA tests done in 28 840 patients found that 19% of patients with an initially negative ANA HEp-2 test had a positive result on at least one repeat test on the same ANA kit over a 7-year period (median time to first positive result 1.74 years). In addition, patients with SLE may lose ANA positivity with decreasing ANA titres over the disease course, as shown in a small prospective study of 54 recently diagnosed SLE cases followed up to 96 months. We recommend that future larger studies should longitudinally examine different ANA, autoantibodies and their assays to maximise the utility of diagnosis and monitoring of SLE and other ARDs.

### Antinuclear antibody testing-misunderstood or misbegotten? [^115Mm26w]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a diverse group of autoantibodies that recognize nuclear macromolecules and their complexes. ANAs represent key biomarkers in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases, most prominently systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ANA testing is commonly performed in the clinical setting. In addition, ANA testing is now used to assess eligibility for participation in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents for SLE. ANAs can be assayed by various techniques, with the fluorescent ANA assay often viewed as the gold standard. Whereas a positive ANA test represents a classification criterion for SLE, up to 20–30% of the healthy population, depending on the assay used, is positive for an ANA, complicating the use of this test for diagnosis or the detection of preclinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, ANAs might be expressed in SLE less commonly than often thought. This Perspectives article discusses important questions about the use of ANA testing in both the clinical and research settings.

### Understanding and interpreting antinuclear antibody tests in systemic rheumatic diseases [^112GZC8e]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are valuable laboratory markers to screen for and support the diagnosis of various rheumatic diseases (known as ANA-associated rheumatic diseases). The importance of ANA testing has been reinforced by the inclusion of ANA positivity as an entry criterion in the 2019 systemic lupus erythematosus classification criteria. In addition, specific ANAs (such as antibodies to Sm, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), SSA/Ro60, U1RNP, topoisomerase I, centromere protein B (CENPB), RNA polymerase III and Jo1) are included in classification criteria for other rheumatic diseases. A number of techniques are available for detecting antibodies to a selection of clinically relevant antigens (such as indirect immunofluorescence and solid phase assays). In this Review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of these techniques, as well as the clinical relevance of the differences between the techniques, to provide guidance in understanding and interpreting ANA test results. Such understanding not only necessitates insight into the sensitivity and specificity of each assay, but also into the importance of the disease context and antibody level. We also highlight the value of titre-specific information (such as likelihood ratios).

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the archetypal autoimmune disease given its complex clinical and molecular manifestations. Like the other rheumatic diseases, appropriate management is critically dependent upon the proper assessment of disease activity, organ damage, and quality of life. Here, we describe the components of the comprehensive assessment of SLE, including accurate physical and laboratory diagnosis, monitoring of disease activity, recording of accumulated organ morbidity, and integration of these with the patient's own perceptions of health status and quality of life. In doing so, we will review the most appropriate laboratory tests and indices currently used in standard clinical care and in clinical research.

### Antinuclear autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [^116aZm32]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The production of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens is the hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus. Among the large number of autoantibodies known, only a limited number appear to be clinically important. The various autoantibodies have different clinical significance in lupus patients. In this review, we will discuss the various antinuclear autoantibodies detected in lupus patients, their potential pathogenic role, and their usefulness in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Recent advances include the clear demonstration of autoantibody transport into living cells, a process that clearly includes interactions with a number of cellular components that may play a role in cellular dysfunction and disease. Also, the anti-Sm B/B' response originates from a single antigenic epitope that appears to be the same structure in different patients, before spreading to other epitopes and becoming the typically mature, complex humoral autoimmune anti-Sm autoantibody response.

Summary

The existing data strongly support a central role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of lupus. Better characterization of autoantibodies, their mechanisms of production, and their interactions with various cellular constituents will clarify the pathogenesis of this disease.

### Don't order antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear… [^113MEpFB]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Testing for antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen should be avoided in the investigation of widespread pain or fatigue alone. Instead, testing should be performed only in patients suspected to have a diagnosis of a connective tissue disease. ANA positivity can be as high as 20% in patients with nonrheumatic conditions and healthy individuals. For this reason, proper pretest probability is important, and false-positive results may lead to further unnecessary testing. Repeat testing is also not recommended unless the clinical picture changes significantly.

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114mkVCZ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The variation in ANA dynamics previously observed across different studies may be attributed to three potential factors. First, several studies date back to the 1980s and 1990s, a period when treatment protocols differed significantly from contemporary practices, often involving medications with a lesser impact on autoantibodies. Second, the studies employed different assay methodologies, such as the use of qualitative rather than quantitative approaches. Lastly, some studies feature small sample sizes, particularly concerning SS‐B, which increases the risk of bias.

Regarding pathogenicity, analysis of the correlation between clinical outcomes and specific autoantibody titer reductions has been suggested as an approach to provide insight into the contribution of autoantibodies to disease pathogenesis. The reasoning is that if an autoantibody is pathogenic and the titer is strongly reduced, it should coincide with the reduction of clinical symptoms. Such an analysis can only be performed for autoantibodies whose titers considerably diminish after treatment. In our study, we analyzed the association of anti‐dsDNA and anti‐Sm titer reduction with clinical outcomes and found only anti‐dsDNA titer reductions to associate with renal responses, UPCR reduction, and normalization of complement levels. These results were somewhat unexpected because anti‐Sm positivity has been associated with lupus nephritis and disease severity in some studies, anti‐Sm antibodies have been eluted from lupus nephritis kidneys, and anti‐Sm antibodies are capable of fixating complement. The lack of association could be due to lower power for anti‐Sm related to their lower frequency in SLE, leading to lower power to detect associations of titer changes to disease activity compared to anti‐dsDNA. However, there was no trend of any kind for an association of anti‐Sm titer reductions to clinical outcomes or normalization of complement levels.

### SMART-SLE: serology monitoring and repeat testing in systemic lupus erythematosus-an analysis of anti-double-stranded DNA monitoring [^114KXFUs]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Disease activity monitoring in SLE includes serial measurement of anti-double stranded-DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, but in patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive, the utility of repeated measurement is unclear. We investigated the usefulness of serial anti-dsDNA testing in predicting flare in SLE patients who are persistently anti-dsDNA positive.

Methods

Data were analysed from patients in a multinational longitudinal cohort with known anti-dsDNA results from 2013 to 2021. Patients were categorized based on their anti-dsDNA results as persistently negative, fluctuating or persistently positive. Cox regression models were used to examine longitudinal associations of anti-dsDNA results with flare.

Results

Data from 37582 visits of 3484 patients were analysed. Of the patients 1029 (29.5%) had persistently positive anti-dsDNA and 1195 (34.3%) had fluctuating results. Anti-dsDNA expressed as a ratio to the normal cut-off was associated with the risk of subsequent flare, including in the persistently positive cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% CI: 1.30, 1.87; P < 0.001) and fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.66), both for a ratio > 3. Both increases and decreases in anti-dsDNA more than 2-fold compared with the previous visit were associated with increased risk of flare in the fluctuating cohort (adjusted HR 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65; P = 0.008) and the persistently positive cohort (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.71; P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Absolute value and change in anti-dsDNA titres predict flares, including in persistently anti-dsDNA positive patients. This indicates that repeat monitoring of dsDNA has value in routine testing.

### Complement activation in patients with probable systemic lupus erythematosus and ability to predict progression to American College of Rheumatology-classified systemic lupus erythematosus [^111ToWQa]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The number of organ manifestations at enrollment did not contribute to progression. Among the 69 patients with probable SLE who had a follow‐up visit, 41 (59%) had 1 organ manifestation (including hematologic, excluding immunologic), and 28 (41%) had 2. Of the 41 patients with 1 organ involved, 14 (34%) transitioned to classifiable SLE, whereas of the 28 patients with 2 organs involved, 6 (21%) transitioned. This difference was not significant (P = 0.29).

At follow‐up, HCQ use increased from 63% to 74%. Among the 20 patients who converted to classifiable SLE, HCQ use increased from 75% to 80% (data not shown).

Biomarker analysis at baseline and follow‐up

Most patients with SLE and probable SLE were ANA‐positive on the day of the enrollment visit (Table 1). The ANA IFA assay used in this study was more sensitive than an ELISA in most cases, although ANA positivity is known to vary greatly depending on the assay platform or kit used 25, 26. Specificity of ANA for SLE was low, while anti‐dsDNA had a high specificity for SLE, as 2% of the patients with SS and none of the patients with other diseases were anti‐dsDNA–positive. Anti‐dsDNA sensitivity was low for SLE (38%) and even lower for probable SLE (11%), although among patients with probable SLE, positivity for anti‐dsDNA was more frequent in those who fulfilled the SLICC criteria than in those who did not (20% versus 5%; P = 0.039). Unsurprisingly, anti‐SSA and anti‐SSB positivity rates were highest among SS patients 27, whereas RF and anti‐CCP positivity was observed mainly in RA patients 28 (Table 1).

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^117RTs4n]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect virtually every organ system. SLE can be perceived as a prototypical autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies directed to nuclear antigens (antinuclear antibodies [ANAs]) are a preponderant feature. Among ANAs, anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) antibodies are highly associated with SLE. They are present in the majority of patients with SLE and can reflect disease activity. Anti‐Smith (anti‐Sm) is another ANA considered specific for SLE, although it is present less frequently than anti‐dsDNA. Other SLE‐associated antibodies are anti‐U1RNP, anti‐SS‐A (also called Ro), and anti‐SS‐B (also called La); these are also associated with other autoimmune diseases. Together with anti‐Sm, these are grouped as antibodies against RNA‐binding proteins (RBPs).

### ANA as an entry criterion for the classification of SLE [^114XjZ9i]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with highly variable clinical and immunological manifestations. In the classification of patients with this condition, the presence of an antinuclear antibody (ANA) is an important element, with new criteria from the American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism positioning ANA positivity by an immunofluorescence assay on HEp2-cells (HEp2-IFA) or by an equivalent solid phase assay as the entry criterion. This positioning is based on assumptions about the frequency of ANA positivity in SLE as well as the reliability of the assays. Studies indicate that these assumptions are still a matter of uncertainty since both types of assay show considerable variability and patients with SLE may display negative results in ANA testing. These findings suggest caution in positioning ANA positivity as an entry criterion for classification and point to the value of alternative serological approaches for ANA determinations.

### Cell-bound complement activation products in SLE [^111ZwKTu]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The difficulties associated with SLE diagnosis suggest that biomarkers are needed to help identify and treat patients with early-stage SLE. Tests for detection and quantification of autoantibodies are commonly used for the diagnosis and classification of SLE and other autoimmune diseases. In particular, ANA, antibodies directed against double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and Smith antigen (anti-Sm), and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) are important in SLE and are part of both ACRand SLICCclassification criteria. ANAs are present in the vast majority of patients with SLE; however, several issues need to be considered regarding the usefulness of ANA for the diagnosis of SLE. First, ANA are also found in patients with other diseases and in healthy individuals, leading to high sensitivity but low specificity for SLE. In addition, some studies reported sensitivity of ANA in established SLE lower than expected (70%–80%), possibly because some patients may lose ANA positivity over time due to treatment or other causes. Differences in sensitivity and specificity may also be related to the assay employed, as different ANA assays can give different results. As ANA positivity is part of the SLE classification criteria and is commonly performed to aid the diagnosis of SLE, ANA test results need to be interpreted with caution. In contrast, anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies have high specificity but low sensitivity for SLE. Similar to ANA, assays for anti-dsDNA antibodies lack standardisation.aPL are a heterogeneous subset of autoantibodies directed against protein–phospholipid complexes. They are common in SLE; however, sensitivity is lowand assays have limitations due to lack of standardisation and poor reproducibility.

We also studied patients with SS, since they can exhibit numerous autoantibodies and low serum complement levels 40. We observed an increased frequency of positive CB‐CAPs compared to low serum complement levels (10% versus 2%) in SS patients, but these were not significantly different from frequencies in the control group with other rheumatic diseases. However, the MAP did show a higher positivity rate than in the control group (27% versus 4%), possibly because of the high titers of ANA found in our SS cohort (data not shown), which can influence the results of the algorithm. Since only 2% of the SS patients exhibited low serum C3 or C4 levels, it is possible that our group of 50 patients is not representative of the large cohorts that have been studied in the past 40.

A limitation of this study is the small cohort size of patients with probable SLE for whom we have follow‐up data, as well as the relatively short follow‐up period. However, 20 of the 69 patients (29%) who had a follow‐up visit within 18 months fulfilled a fourth ACR criterion in this time frame, confirming our expectation that this cohort from academic lupus centers might be more likely to progress to classifiable SLE than prior studies have suggested. Another limitation is that retrospective determination of whether patients fulfill classification criteria is dependent on a comprehensive review of prior medical records and laboratory test results (including the presence of leukopenia or lymphopenia), and these may not have been available for all patients at every site. The adjudicators often requested and received additional records. However, the records we received may have been incomplete, as data on the lupus anticoagulant test, for example, were rarely reported. One strength of our study is that the probable SLE group is well defined and not classified by physician judgment alone.

### Performance of the 2019 EULAR / ACR systemic lupus erythematosus classification criteria in a cohort of patients with biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis [^1154PN4G]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparison of EULAR/ACR domains of patients based on the EULAR/ACR classification criteria status

As shown in online supplemental table 1, we compared the baseline clinical characteristics, clinical and immunological manifestations between the non-SLE group and SLE groups based on the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria status. The two groups did not show any significant difference in terms of mean age and sex. Disease activity assessed by the SLEDAI showed no significant differences between the groups either. The mean SLEDAI score was 18.0 for those who did not meet the new SLE criteria and 18.48 for those who did.

As ANA acts as an entry criterion, patients who did not fulfill the criteria had completely different ANA titres than patients who fulfilled the criteria: one had an ANA titre of 1:20, five had an ANA titre of 1:40. Among six patients with the ANA titre of < 1:80, one with weak positive anti-Sm antibody and one with weak positive anti-dsDNA antibody. We then looked at the individual criteria scores within the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification schema. Compared with the group that did not meet the criteria, the total EULAR/ACR criteria mean score in the group that met the criteria was higher, although resulting in no statistically significant difference (p = 0.098). Different from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) SLE cohort, the two groups of patients did not present a statistically significant difference in each individual criteria of clinical manifestation. In view of the immunology domains, highly specific SLE antibodies were noted to be less frequent in the group that did not fulfil the criteria (p = 0.019), although individual anti-Sm or anti-dsDNA antibodies did not differ significantly in the two groups. All but one patient did not have anti-Sm antibodies. Similarly, anti-dsDNA antibodies were not detected in five out of six patients. Altogether, the subjects who met new criteria had a higher incidence of ANA, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, compared with the ones who did not.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus one disease or many? [^116upXV2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) characterizes by a variety of clinical manifestations and the presence of a wide profile of autoantibodies. This clinical and serological heterogeneity raised the question: is SLE a single disease with varied phenotypes, or a similar phenotype shared by different diseases with diverse pathogenic mechanisms? Herein we debate the clinical, genetic, hormonal and serological differences typically observed in SLE on the one hand, and the numerous similarities between subtypes of this disease on the other. Leading to the conclusion that SLE may be considered not as a single disease but rather as a single syndrome, which defines by a set of signs, symptoms, or phenomena that occur together and suggest a particular abnormality. Additionally, the accumulated knowledge on gene expression pathways, autoantibodies clusters, hormonal and environmental factors associated with SLE may allow a better classification of this syndrome and updating of SLE criteria. This may further allow targeted biologics and other therapies as well as "personalized medicine" to begin.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^114d6T7p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The antinuclear antibody test (ANA) is a much overused test in pediatrics. The ANA does have a role in serologic testing but it should be a very limited one. It is often ordered as a screening test for rheumatic illnesses in a primary care setting. However, since it has low specificity and sensitivity for most rheumatic and musculoskeletal illnesses in children, it should not be ordered as a screening test for non-specific complaints such as musculoskeletal pain. It should only be used as a diagnostic test for children with probable Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, (MCTD) and other possible overlap-like illnesses. Such children should have developed definite signs and symptoms of a disease before the ANA is ordered. This review presents data supporting these conclusions and a review of the ANA literature in adults and children. By limiting ANA testing, primary care providers can avoid needless venipuncture pain, unnecessary referrals, extra medical expenses, and most importantly, significant parental anxieties. It is best not to do the ANA test in most children but if it ordered and is positive in a low titer (< 1:640), the results can be ignored if the child is otherwise well and does not have other features of a systemic illness.
