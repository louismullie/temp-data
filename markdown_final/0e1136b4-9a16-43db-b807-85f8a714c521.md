## Question

Partial prothrombin time 36.8

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 36.8 seconds and what actions to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the laboratory's reference range and whether 36.8 seconds is normal or prolonged. Then, I should verify pre-analytical issues that could artifactually prolong PTT. Next, I will consider clinical context, including bleeding history, anticoagulant use, and liver disease. After that, I should review what a mildly prolonged PTT does and does not predict about bleeding risk. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise workup if the result is truly abnormal and summarize when no further testing is needed if it is normal for that lab [^117MLTmF].

> Let me first confirm the reference interval, because PTT ranges vary by reagent and instrument; many adult reference intervals span roughly 25–35 seconds, so 36.8 seconds could be normal in some laboratories and only mildly prolonged in others, and I should not jump to conclusions before checking the lab's specific range and units [^111sKrn9] [^117HjHLV].

> Wait, let me verify pre-analytical factors before interpreting the number; underfilled citrate tubes, prolonged time between draw and testing, and hemolysis can spuriously prolong PTT, so if the clinical picture is discordant, I should repeat the test with proper collection technique and a fresh sample to exclude artifact, and I should also confirm that the specimen was not contaminated with heparin from an indwelling line or drawn through a heparinized catheter [^117JtNFu] [^111RXp2H].

> Next, I should review the clinical context; I need to check for a personal or family history of abnormal bleeding, recent or current anticoagulant exposure (especially unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, or direct oral anticoagulants), liver disease, recent massive transfusion or trauma, and whether any invasive procedure is planned, because these factors change the significance and urgency of a mildly prolonged PTT [^116izDRZ] [^112iKb8B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bleeding risk; a mildly prolonged PTT alone is a poor predictor of peri-procedural or spontaneous bleeding, and routine PTT screening in low-risk patients often yields false positives without improving outcomes, so I should avoid over-calling risk based solely on a borderline PTT value [^117MLTmF] [^116QaEcJ].

> If the lab's reference range confirms that 36.8 seconds is prolonged and the result persists on repeat, I should proceed with a focused evaluation; first, I will order PT/INR and a platelet count to define the pattern, then consider a mixing study if the PTT is prolonged with a normal PT to distinguish factor deficiency from an inhibitor, and if the PT is also abnormal, I should broaden to liver function tests and consider disseminated intravascular coagulation or combined pathway defects, guided by the clinical scenario [^115GcFLB] [^1127G8Mt] [^1172MVUu].

> I need to ensure I account for anticoagulants; unfractionated heparin prolongs PTT in a dose-dependent fashion and even prophylactic subcutaneous heparin can nudge PTT upward, low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux can modestly prolong PTT, and direct oral anticoagulants may variably affect PTT, so medication reconciliation is essential before chasing a bleeding disorder workup [^115M7J2U] [^117UpxCy] [^111yXEGR].

> But wait, what if the patient is peri-procedural; I should confirm whether the planned procedure truly warrants correction of a mildly prolonged PTT, because routine preoperative coagulation screening is discouraged in the absence of clinical suspicion, and plasma transfusion solely to normalize a mildly prolonged PTT or INR in a nonbleeding patient is generally not indicated and may cause harm [^116QaEcJ] [^115eu1cT].

> Let me reconsider the original interpretation; if 36.8 seconds falls within the lab's reference interval, no further workup is needed, and if it is only mildly prolonged and the patient has no bleeding history, no anticoagulant exposure, and no procedure imminent, observation and selective testing are reasonable, whereas persistent unexplained prolongation merits the structured approach above with mixing studies and targeted factor assays as indicated [^115GcFLB].

A PTT of 36.8 seconds is **mildly prolonged** (typically 25–35 s) and suggests a minor intrinsic pathway defect or anticoagulant effect. It is **not dangerous on its own** and does not predict bleeding risk [^113GJiwi] [^112iKb8B]. Confirm the result, review anticoagulant use, and **order a mixing study** if unexplained to distinguish factor deficiency from inhibitor [^111AKW4p] [^1127G8Mt]. No immediate treatment is needed unless there is bleeding or a planned procedure; manage based on the underlying cause [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of PTT 36.8 seconds

- **Mild prolongation**: 36.8 s is a mild prolongation (typically 25–35 s) and suggests a minor intrinsic pathway defect or anticoagulant effect [^111dAeDv] [^113YwziS].

- **Not dangerous**: This degree of prolongation is not inherently dangerous and does not predict bleeding risk [^113GJiwi] [^112iKb8B].

- **Common causes**: Heparin exposure, lupus anticoagulant, mild factor deficiencies, or laboratory artifact [^113YwziS] [^111RXp2H].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Confirmatory testing

Confirm the result with a **repeat PTT** to exclude laboratory error, and **review anticoagulant use** (heparin, DOACs, warfarin) and recent administration [^116uXSbD] [^111yXEGR].

---

### Further diagnostic evaluation

If unexplained, **perform a mixing study** to distinguish factor deficiency from inhibitor [^111AKW4p] [^1127G8Mt]. If the mixing study is abnormal, **obtain factor assays** (VIII, IX, XI, XII) and a lupus anticoagulant panel [^111RXp2H] [^114cDChK].

---

### Clinical context assessment

Assess for **bleeding history** — personal or family — and for symptoms or signs of thrombosis, and review medications for agents that may prolong PTT [^116izDRZ] [^113njy2S].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **No immediate treatment**: No immediate treatment is needed unless there is bleeding or a planned invasive procedure [^1172MVUu].

- **Procedure management**: For procedures, manage based on the underlying cause and clinical bleeding risk, not PTT alone [^112iKb8B].

- **Follow-up**: Monitor for bleeding or thrombotic events and reassess if clinical status changes [^113njy2S].

## Interpretation and management of PTT 36.8 seconds

| **Step** | **Action** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Repeat PTT | Confirm result |
| 2 | Review anticoagulant use | Identify drug-related prolongation |
| 3 | Mixing study | Differentiate deficiency vs inhibitor |
| 4 | Factor assays and lupus panel | Identify specific deficiency or inhibitor |
| 5 | Assess bleeding history | Guide management |
| 6 | Manage based on cause | No treatment unless bleeding or procedure |

---

A PTT of 36.8 seconds is a **mild prolongation** that warrants confirmation and targeted evaluation, but it is not dangerous by itself. Management should be **cause-specific** and guided by clinical context.

### Evaluation of guidelines for ordering prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times [^111p63J7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Existing clinical practice guidelines for ordering prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests in the emergency department (ED) include physician expectation of an invasive procedure as a criterion. This study sought to determine whether this criterion accurately identifies patients who undergo an invasive procedure and whether an amalgam of these guidelines identifies patients at low risk of an adverse medical outcome.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort study of adults treated in a university medical center ED between July 1997 and March 1998. Physicians were surveyed at order placement to determine the presence of guideline criteria. Adverse clinical outcomes defined as an International Normalized Ratio [INR] > 1.3 or PTT > 39.9 seconds combined with consequent directed medical therapy were abstracted from ED and the first 24 hours of inpatient medical records.

Results

The sensitivity of ED physician expectation of an invasive procedure was 60.0%; therefore, it was excluded from both the PT and PTT guidelines. There were 553 patients with a PT test order; test order indications were absent in 190 (34.4%), of which one (0.5%, 95% CI = 0.1% to 2.9%) had adverse outcomes. There were 547 patients with a PTT test; test order indications were absent in 226 (41.3%), of which three (1.3%, 95% CI = 0.4 to 3.8%) had adverse outcomes. All three were taking warfarin when they presented to the ED.

Conclusions

Emergency department physician expectation of an invasive procedure for patients with PT or PTT test orders is an insensitive predictor of patients who undergo such procedures. Clinical practice guidelines that exclude this criterion identify ED patients at the time of ED presentation at low risk for adverse medical outcomes in the ED or shortly after admission.

### To bleed or not to bleed? Is that the question for the PTT? [^113GJiwi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

The activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is the grandchild of the Lee-White whole blood clot time (WBCT). Both tests were developed to assist the diagnostic process for patients who exhibited features consistent with hemophilia, i.e., the pretest probability was extremely high. Probably < 0.1%-1.0% of PTTs ordered in current medical practice fit that indication with the most common indication now being routine admission order; i.e., a pretest probability that is extremely low. The question asked of the PTT has evolved from 'why does this patient bleed?' to 'will this patient bleed?' As the PTT was never intended to answer that question, one must be careful regarding interpretation of results of that test. As many situations not related to hemorrhage are associated with perturbations of the PTT, a prolonged PTT is not strongly predictive of hemorrhage nor does a normal PTT provide shelter against hemorrhagic risk.

### The isolated prolonged PTT [^115GcFLB]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

It is increasingly difficult to choose the proper tests to investigate an abnormal laboratory result, delaying the time to reach the correct diagnosis and increasing the cost of care. A wrong choice may also lead to clinically significant errors, which can be life threatening. To show how errors in test selection occur in routine medical practice, the authors describe an algorithm to evaluate patients with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and a normal prothrombin time. This exercise challenges the commonly held belief that errors in laboratory utilization occur primarily with esoteric and/or genetic testing, rather than in patients with common abnormalities such as a prolonged PTT.

### Critical values in the coagulation laboratory: results of a survey of the north American specialized coagulation laboratory association [^112SoYxq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Critical values are vital to safe clinical and laboratory practice. To address the lack of information on critical values in coagulation, pattern-of-practice surveys were distributed to members of the North American Specialized Coagulation Laboratory Association. More than 70% of respondents had critical values for commonly performed tests. Median values were as follows: prothrombin time, more than 37 seconds; international normalized ratio, more than 5; activated partial thromboplastin time, more than 100 seconds; and fibrinogen level, less than 100 mg/dL. Critical value reporting generated a significant workload, with up to 15% of these tests yielding critical results. The median time to report critical values was 7 minutes for inpatients. Despite the lack of guidelines surrounding critical values in coagulation, this survey confirms that laboratories have reasonable and uniform practices. It also provides critical value medians and ranges for a wide range of tests. Laboratories without critical values or in the process of reviewing their values may find this survey of their peers useful.

### Timing and volume of fluid administration for patients with bleeding [^111Ni2Z6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of haemorrhagic shock involves maintaining blood pressure and tissue perfusion until bleeding is controlled. Different resuscitation strategies have been used to maintain the blood pressure in trauma patients until bleeding is controlled. However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early versus delayed, and larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the specialised register of the Injuries Group, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register and the Science Citation Index. We checked reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of the timing and volume of intravenous fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding. Trials in which different types of intravenous fluid were compared were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions and patient populations were so diverse. Early versus delayed fluid administration. Three trials reported mortality and two coagulation data. In the first trial (n = 598) relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval of 1.00–1.58). The weighted mean differences (WMD) for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 2.7 (95% CI 0.9–4.5) and 4.3 (95% CI 1.74–6.9) seconds respectively. In the second trial (n = 50) RR for death with early blood transfusion was 5.4 (95% CI 0.3–107.1). The WMD for partial thromboplastin time was 7.0 (95% CI 6.0–8.0) seconds. In the third trial (n = 1309) RR for death with early fluid administration was 1.06 (95% CI 0.77–1.47). Larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration. Three trials reported mortality and one coagulation data. In the first trial (n = 36) RR for death with a larger volume of fluid resuscitation was 0.80 (95% CI 0.28–22.29). Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 14.8 and 47.3 seconds in those who received a larger volume of fluid, as compared to 13.9 and 35.1 seconds in the comparison group. In the second trial (n = 110) RR for death with a high systolic blood pressure resuscitation target (100mmHg) maintained with a larger volume of fluid, as compared to low systolic blood pressure resuscitation target (70mmHg) maintained with a smaller volume of fluid was 1.00 (95% CI 0.26–3.81). In the third trial (n = 25) there were no deaths.

Reviewer's Conclusions

We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against early or larger volume of intravenous fluid administration in uncontrolled haemorrhage. There is continuing uncertainty about the best fluid administration strategy in bleeding trauma patients. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the most effective fluid resuscitation strategy.

In the third trial (n = 25) there were no deaths.

Reviewer's Conclusions

We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials to support early or larger volume of intravenous fluid administration in uncontrolled haemorrhage. There is continuing uncertainty about the best fluid administration strategy in bleeding trauma patients. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the most effective fluid resuscitation strategy.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113YwziS]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — laboratory and metabolic assessment. Control of hypertension, blood glucose, and lipids has been proven effective in reducing ischemic stroke risk; fasting is not routinely required for lipid testing except for patients with nonfasting triglycerides of > 440 mg/dL, who should have fasting levels drawn. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing can detect new type 2 diabetes in ≈11.5% and prediabetes in 36.2% of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. In lacunar infarction, chronic kidney disease is associated with a 50% increase in risk of recurrent stroke. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing screens for relevant clotting and bleeding disorders; an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time can be seen with heparin use, lupus anticoagulant, or clotting factor deficiencies.

### International council for standardization in haematology field study evaluating optimal interpretation methods for activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time mixing studies [^111AKW4p]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

The prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are screening tests used to detect congenital or acquired bleeding disorders. An unexpected PT and/or APTT prolongation is often evaluated using a mixing test with normal plasma. Failure to correct ("noncorrection") prolongation upon mixing is attributed to an inhibitor, whereas "correction" points to factor deficiency(ies).

Objective —

To define an optimal method for determining correction or noncorrection of plasma mixing tests through an international, multisite study that used multiple PT and APTT reagents and well-characterized plasma samples.

Design —

Each testing site was provided 22 abnormal and 25 normal donor plasma samples, and mixing studies were performed using local PT and APTT reagents. Mixing study results were evaluated using 11 different calculation methods to assess the optimal method based on the expected interpretation for factor deficiencies (correction) and noncorrection (inhibitor effect). Misprediction, which represents the failure of a mixing study interpretation method, was assessed.

Results —

Percentage correction was the most suitable calculation method for interpreting PT mixing test results for nearly all reagents evaluated. Incubated PT mixing tests should not be performed. For APTT mixing tests, percentage correction should be performed, and if the result indicates a factor deficiency, this should be confirmed with the subtraction III calculation where the normal pooled plasma result (run concurrently) is subtracted from the mixing test result with correction indicated by a result of 0 or less. In general, other calculation methods evaluated that performed well in the identification of factor deficiency tended to have high misprediction rates for inhibitors and vice versa.

Conclusions —

No single method of mixing test result calculation was consistently successful in accurately distinguishing factor deficiencies from inhibitors, with between-reagent and between-site variability also identified.

### What is the role of hemodialysis for dabigatran-associated major bleeding? [^113369c4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who is being anticoagulated with dabigatran etexilate presents to the emergency room with melena. He reports taking his most recent dose of dabigatran more than 2 hours ago. On examination, he is hypotensive and tachycardic, and he continues to have melanotic stools. Laboratory testing reveals a calculated creatinine clearance of 15 mL/min, a prothrombin time of 16.5 seconds (reference range: 11.8–15.2 seconds), an international normalized ratio of 1.2 (reference range: 0.9–1.2), and an activated partial thromboplastin time of 50 seconds (reference range: 22.2–33.0 seconds). You are asked by the emergency medicine physician whether hemodialysis should be considered to decrease the patient's plasma dabigatran level.

### Time course of hemostatic disruptions after traumatic brain injury: a systematic review of the literature [^111sKrn9]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Coagulation Cascade

PT, PTT and APTT

We included 12 studies with PT, PTT and/or APTT data. Most of these studies noted that TBI was followed by a decrease in markers of coagulation cascade function. In the largest study of 441 patients with isolated TBI, mean APTT was increased during the first 12 h after injury, with a mean value of 16 s (reference range: 10.3–13.4 s). A similar pattern, although within reference ranges, was seen in another study of 234 adult severe TBI patients, where APTT and INR significantly increased during the first 3 h after injury, reaching median values of 29.2 s (reference range: 24–36 s) and 1.07 (reference range: 0.8–1.2), respectively. These observations were further supported by three smaller studies that all identified posttraumatic abnormally increased PT, INR and PTT that peaked at 2–6 h after injury. In addition, one study found that Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was inversely proportional to PT, indicating that severer TBI cases induce a more pronounced coagulation cascade dysfunction. Following the initial phase, values then seemed to return to normal after 12 h to several days following injury. Two studies saw no significant change in these coagulation cascade assays over time (Table 3).

TAT and F1 + 2

We included 5 studies with TAT and/or F1 + 2 data. All of these studies found that TAT and F1 + 2 were elevated during the first day of injury. In the largest study, which included 28 patients with isolated TBI, mean TAT was elevated on admission (mean 8.6 h after injury) and then decreased to reference levels after 5 days. The other studies reported a similar pattern of increased TAT and/or F1 + 2 levels on admission that then decreased, reaching reference ranges from 24 h up to one week after injury (Table 4).

### Screening coagulation testing using the APTT: which reagent to choose? [^114cDChK]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

APTT testing is integral to hemostasis testing. A prolonged result, however, can be difficult to interpret, depending on the APTT reagent's sensitivity to the lupus anticoagulant. This often generates additional laboratory testing for both factor deficiencies and the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, and in so doing, delays patient management. We have found it useful to provide APTT testing with both a lupus anticoagulant sensitive and insensitive reagent, to facilitate the rapid exclusion of significant factor deficiencies. The following case report illustrates the utility of this approach and provides a backdrop for necessary discussions between laboratories and clinicians regarding which APTT reagent best meets their clinical need for screening hemostasis testing.

### Systemic light chain amyloidosis, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116hynyE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Systemic light chain amyloidosis — coagulation testing and factor X deficiency: The Panel recommends comprehensive coagulation studies if indicated, including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin (PTT), and Factor X; patients are at risk of acquired factor X deficiency due to binding of factor X to amyloid fibrils, and this deficiency typically responds to treatment of the underlying amyloidosis.

### Implications of deranged activated partial thromboplastin time for anaesthesia and surgery [^111RXp2H]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Bleeding during and after surgery ranges from trivial to fatal. Bleeding is in part determined by the patient's coagulation status. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends a pre-operative clotting test for patients with a history of abnormal bleeding. Anaesthetists are familiar with the prothrombin time assay, used to monitor warfarin effect, but anaesthetists may be less familiar with the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which tests the function of the 'intrinsic' clotting pathway. The activated partial thromboplastin time may be prolonged due to contamination, anticoagulant therapy, clotting factor deficiencies, lupus anticoagulant or acquired inhibitors of specific clotting factors. A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time should lead to: further testing to exclude heparin contamination or therapy, mixing studies to identify factor deficiencies and if necessary dynamic studies, such as the dilute Russell's viper venom time and the Actin FS-activated partial thromboplastin time, to identify direct factor inhibitors. These tests identify abnormalities and their implications for bleeding, helping anaesthetists and haematologists to manage haemostasis for individual patients.

### Evaluation of activated partial thromboplastin time mixing studies using several methods [^115hRKw3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), a vital screening test for coagulation, can be due to deficiencies in coagulation factors and the existence of factor inhibitors or antiphospholipid antibodies. APTT mixing studies are being optimized to help find the cause.

Objective —

To optimize APTT mixing studies, we evaluated existing standards and explored when and how to combine 1:1 and 4:1 mixing.

Design —

Patients with a prolonged APTT but otherwise normal prothrombin time and thrombin time were enrolled in our hospital from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. All samples were subjected to 1:1 mixing studies, while 134 were subjected to 4:1.

Results —

A total of 251 samples were involved, including 116 with factor deficiencies, 75 with FVIII inhibitors, and 60 with antiphospholipid antibodies. A Rosner index less than 11% or an extended incubation time of more than 3 seconds was better than other existing standards in differentiating factor deficiencies from inhibitors and in differentiating time-dependent inhibitors from time-independent inhibitors, but the approach presented here improves upon those. For the best diagnostic accuracy, samples with a Rosner index between 5.0% and 9.1% need a 4:1 mixing study, while others need 1:1. A combination of Rosner index and percent-extended incubation time-P seemed to offer objective and effective criteria for interpreting the results.

Conclusions —

APTT mixing studies had overall good sensitivity and specificity in differentiating factor deficiencies from inhibitors, or time-dependent from time-independent inhibitors. The combination of 1:1 and 4:1 mixing studies can improve the diagnostic ability compared with 1:1 alone.

### Association of prothrombin time, thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time levels with preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FMCWi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia (PE), an obstetric disorder, is categorized as mild PE if the patient's blood pressure (BP) ranges from 140/90 to 160/110 mmHg and they exhibit proteinuria of ≥ 1, and as severe PE if BP is ≥ 160/110 mmHg, with proteinuria exceeding 3 + along with edema and other significant symptoms. It affects approximately 2–5% of pregnancies globally, remaining one of the leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. Each year, approximately 4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with PE. Sadly, this disease claims the lives of an estimated 76,000 women, along with half a million fetuses and neonates, on a global scale annually.

Uncontrolled PE can result in maternal complications such as multi-organ failure, eclampsia, seizures, hemorrhagic stroke, adult respiratory distress syndrome, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), placental abruption, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal failure, and pulmonary edema. Neonatal complications may encompass intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, and mortality. In clinical practice, achieving precise diagnosis and consistently predicting PE has proven to be a challenging issue.

The pathophysiological changes observed in PE patients stem from vascular endothelial injury. Placental and immunologic irregularities prompt the release of inflammatory cytokines which trigger inflammatory responses, vascular endothelial injury, and the exposure of collagen and tissue factors beneath the endothelium. Consequently, alterations occurring in the hemostasis system. This sequence of events can lead to fetal demise in utero, dysontogenesis, and various adverse obstetrical outcomes.

Assessing the status of hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems in PE patients is crucial for determining disease severity, facilitating early clinical intervention, and improving the prognosis of maternal and infant health conditions. In clinical practice, commonly utilized laboratory tests for assessing hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis function include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), thrombin time (TT), antithrombin (AT), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), among others.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111yXEGR]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Rivaroxaban — monitoring anticoagulant intensity — The predictable pharmacologic profile of rivaroxaban allows administration at fixed doses without the need for routine laboratory monitoring or dose adjustments, though there may be rare situations (overdose, unexpected bleeding, compliance assessment, drug interactions, or drug accumulation in renal or hepatic impairment) when a quantitative clotting assay might be valuable; however, there are currently no validated laboratory assays that can be recommended to monitor rivaroxaban or any recommendations for dose adjustments based on observed test results. Thromboplastins used for prothrombin time (PT) assays have differing sensitivities to factor Xa inhibitors, the INR does not adequately correct for these differences, and PT ratios measured after adding rivaroxaban 1 µg/mL to plasma varied from 2.25 to 7.32 with different thromboplastins; in assay evaluations, there was a concentration-dependent prolongation of the PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the effect on the aPTT was weaker than on the PT, and rivaroxaban also prolonged thromboelastograph parameters. Neither the PT (expressed either in seconds or as a ratio) nor the aPTT should be used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban.

### Fiix-prothrombin time versus standard prothrombin time for monitoring of warfarin anticoagulation: a single centre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^114cRvMJ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid fluctuations in factor VII during warfarin anticoagulation change the international normalised ratio (INR) but contribute little to the antithrombotic effect. We aimed to assess non-inferiority of anticoagulation stabilisation with a warfarin monitoring method affected only by factors II and X (Fiix-prothrombin time [Fiix-PT]) compared with standard PT-INR monitoring that includes factor VII measurement as well.

Methods

The Fiix trial was a single centre, double-blind, prospective, non-inferiority, randomised controlled clinical trial. Ambulatory adults on warfarin with an INR target of 2–3 managed by an anticoagulation dosing service using software-assisted dosing at the National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, were eligible for inclusion in this study. We excluded patients undergoing electroconversion and nursing home residents. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the Fiix-PT monitoring group or the PT monitoring group by block randomisation. A blinded research INR (R-INR) based on results of the respective test was reported to the dosing staff. Participants were contacted by a study nurse at 4-week intervals to elicit information about thromboembolism or bleeding otherwise unknown to the anticoagulation management centre. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of objectively diagnosed non-fatal and fatal arterial or venous thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction and transient ischaemic attacks, assessed in all eligible patients who were randomised (intention-to-monitor population). The safety endpoint was major bleeding or other clinically relevant bleeding, assessed in the per-protocol population. We assumed a 3% annual thromboembolism incidence and a non-inferiority margin of 2·5%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01565239.

Findings

Between March 1, 2012, and Feb 28, 2014, we enrolled 1156 patients. 573 patients were assigned to Fiix-PT and 575 to PT-INR monitoring after exclusion of four patients from each group for various reasons. Median follow-up was 1·7 years (IQR 1·1–1·9). During days 1–720, ten (1·2% per patient year) thromboembolic events occurred in the Fiix-PT group versus 19 (2·3% per patient year) in the PT group (relative risk [RR] 0·52, 95% CI 0·25–1·13; pnon-inferiority < 0·0001). Major bleeding occurred in 17 of 571 patients in the Fiix group (2·2% per patient year) versus 20 of 573 patients in the PT group (2·5% per patient year; RR 0·85, 0·45–1·61; pnon-inferiority = 0·0034). Anticoagulation stability was improved with Fiix-PT monitoring as manifested by fewer tests, fewer dose adjustments, increased time in range and less INR variability than reported with standard PT monitoring.

Interpretation

Monitoring of warfarin with Fiix-PT improved anticoagulation and dosing stability and was clinically non-inferior to PT monitoring. Results from this trial suggest that during vitamin K antagonist treatment INR monitoring could be replaced by Fiix-PT and that this would lead to at least a non-inferior clinical outcome compared with monitoring with PT-INR.

### Predicting abnormal coagulation in ischemic stroke: reducing delay in rt-PA use [^111VWGr9]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Normal prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are recommended for administration of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in stroke, but waiting for results can delay use. We examined the charts of 365 stroke patients to assess predetermined risk factors associated with elevated PT/PTT. Elevated PT/PTT can be predicted in patients taking warfarin or heparin/heparinoid or on hemodialysis, according to emergency department triage, with 100% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity. These results could be applied to rt-PA candidates and reduce potential delays.

### Neglected vitamin K deficiency causing coagulation dysfunction in an older patient with pneumonia: a case report [^115x8dE4]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of coagulation disorders can be dangerous and fatal in the older people, especially those with multiple medical conditions. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorders are easily overlooked when anticoagulant drugs are not used and the patient shows no signs of bleeding.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 71-year-old male suffering from pulmonary infection with severe coagulation disorder without bleeding symptoms. He also had a history of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cardiac insufficiency. Coagulation tests were normal at the time of admission, prothrombin time (PT) is 13.9 (normal, 9.5–13.1) seconds and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 30.2 (normal, 25.1–36.5) seconds. But it turned severely abnormal after 20 days (PT: 136.1 s, APTT: 54.8 s). However, no anticoagulants such as warfarin was used and no bleeding symptoms were observed. Subsequent mixing studies with normal plasma showed a decrease in prothrombin times. Vitamin K deficiency was thought to be the cause of coagulation disorders considering long-term antibiotic therapy, especially cephalosporins, inadequate diet and abnormal liver function. After supplementation with 20 mg of vitamin K, coagulation dysfunction was rescued the next day and serious consequences were effectively prevented.

Conclusions

Overall, timely vitamin K supplementation with antimicrobials that affect vitamin K metabolism requires clinician attention, especially in older patients who are multimorbid, frail or nutritionally compromised, and are admitted to hospital because of an infection that needs antimicrobial therapy are at risk of clotting disorders due to abnormal vitamin K metabolism secondary to altered gut flora, which can exacerbate existing nutritional deficiencies.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^116QaEcJ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Preoperative coagulation testing before endoscopy — prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) — in patients without evidence of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy neither predicts nor correlates with intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage. In the absence of clinical suspicion, abnormal PT results are found in less than 1% of patients, while abnormal PTT results are encountered in approximately 6.5% of patients, with reports as high as 16.3%. The PTT is not sensitive for hemophilia and has a false-positive rate of approximately 2.3%, and the calculated incidence of hemophilia in males without a family history of the disease or a history of major trauma or surgery is only 0.0025%, therefore a screening PTT for hemophilia is not recommended in the absence of clinical suspicion. An abnormal PTT result does not reliably predict perioperative hemorrhage, and a study of 1000 patients found that all patients with a prolonged PTT had clinical risk factors for bleeding. In children undergoing endoscopic procedures, abnormal PT and/or PTT test results occurred in 16.8% of patients, but these results did not predict bleeding episodes. Routine PT and PTT measurements are not clinically useful unless the patient has a history of abnormal bleeding or known bleeding disorder or malnutrition; is receiving prolonged therapy with antibiotics associated with clotting factor deficiencies; is receiving anticoagulant therapy; or has prolonged biliary obstruction, and in summary, in the absence of clinical suspicion, routine preoperative screening for coagulopathy with PT, INR, PTT, platelet count, or bleeding time, either alone or in combination, is not recommended.

### Does prehospital fluid administration impact core body temperature and coagulation functions in combat casualties? [^112QnXHs]. Injury (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of large amounts of fluids to trauma patients, in the absence of surgical control, may increase bleeding, cause hypothermia and coagulopathy which may worsen the bleeding and increase morbidity and mortality. The purpose of our study is to examine the impact of prehospital fluid administration to military combat casualties on core body temperature and coagulation functions.

Methods

Prospective data were collected on all cases of moderately (9 ≤ ISS ≤ 14) and severely (ISS ≥ 16) injured victims wounded in South Lebanon, treated by Israeli military physicians and evacuated to hospitals in Israel, over a two-year period. Data regarding prehospital phase of injury (timetables, amount of fluids) and upon hospital arrival (initial core body temperature, prothrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT]) were examined for monotonic relation using Spearman's non-parametric test.

Results

Fifty-three moderately injured and 31 severely injured patients were included in the study. The average evacuation time for the moderately injured group was 109.3 ± 44.8 min, and for the severely injured 100.3 ± 38.4 min (P value = NS). The mean volume of fluids administered was 2.39 ± 1.52 and 2.49 ± 1.47 l, respectively (P = NS). No statistical correlation was found between core body temperature, PT or PTT, measured upon hospital arrival, and prehospital fluid treatment. In addition, no correlation was found between core body temperature on hospital arrival and prehospital time, or between prehospital fluid volumes and prehospital time. The mean core body temperature of the moderately injured patients was 36.8 degrees C, and that of severely injured was 35.8 degrees C (P = 0.026).

Conclusions

With proper control of blood loss and avoidance of excessive fluid administration, moderately and severely injured combat casualties in 'low intensity conflict' in South Lebanon can be resuscitated with fluid volumes that do not result in a coagulation deficit or hypothermia. The core body temperature on arrival at the hospital is related to the severity of the injury.

Reasons for Not Administering Alteplase in Patients on

Of 5118 patients with AIS who did not receive IVT in the NCVC Stroke Registry, 302 patients took DOACs before stroke onset (Figure S1). Of these, 204 patients (67.5%) arrived at our hospital > 4.5 hours from stroke onset or the last known well time, 58 (19.2%) patients had a mild neurological symptom or rapid symptom improvement, 17 (5.6%) had a large early ischemic change on admission imaging, 9 (3.0%) had a PT‐INR of > 1.7 or APTT of > 40 seconds, and the remaining 4 (1.3%) developed stroke immediately after taking DOACs (Table S3).

COVID-19 VTE diagnosis — D-dimer and other biomarkers: There are few studies evaluating D-dimer or other laboratory values to predict a diagnosis of VTE in patients with COVID-19, and the lack of systematic surveillance for DVT and PE has severely limited the ability to establish a meaningful context; two studies described biomarkers, including D-dimer, but did not describe systematic evaluation for suspected VTE, and one study reported only DVT rather than DVT and PE with a 94% negative predictive value for D-dimer cutoff of 1.0 μg/mL and correlations of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and lymphocyte count with increased risk of VTE, while another did not report on D-dimer levels but noted prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 seconds.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^111kqU82]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

It is often misunderstood that the conventional coagulation screens [PT and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)] only provide information on levels of coagulation factor. These values, therefore, will typically appear normal during early blood loss, despite the potential for an underlying activation of coagulation and thrombus formation. The turnaround time for results of VEM [TEG®, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®)], as for POC PT/INR, has been shown to be significantly shorter than conventional laboratory testing, with a time saving of 30–60 min. VEM may also be useful in the detection of coagulation abnormalities associated with the use of direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin or hirudin, although these tests cannot discriminate between the effects of inhibitors and the impact of traumatic coagulopathy.

VEM provides a rapid assessment of haemostasis to support clinical decision-making. This in turn has generated a growing confidence in these methods and increased use in children, adolescent and adult patients. To date, however, only one open randomised controlled study has been completed, which involved 111 injured patients from an academic level-1 trauma centre meeting criteria for massive transfusion protocol activation. Patients were randomised to receive either a massive transfusion protocol goal-directed using TEG® or by conventional coagulation assays (CCA). Survival at 28 days in the TEG® group was significantly higher than the CCA group, with 20 deaths in the CCA group (36.4%) compared with 11 in the TEG® group (19.6%) (p = 0.049). Most bleeding deaths occurred within the first 6 h following patient arrival at the clinic (21.8% CCA group vs 7.1% TEG® group) (p = 0.032). CCA patients required a similar number of RBC units as the TEG® patients but more plasma units [CCA, 2.0 (0–4); TEG®, 0.0 (0–3)] (p = 0.022), and more platelet units [CCA, 0.0 (0–1); TEG®, 0.0 (0–0)] (p = 0.041) in the first 2 h of resuscitation. Despite these very promising results, it should be noted that this study was open, unblinded, and that randomisation into either of the two treatment modalities was based on alternating weeks, which potentially introduces a bias into the care of the patients.

### The effect of specimen hemolysis on coagulation test results [^117JtNFu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Hemolyzed specimens are rejected for coagulation testing based on concerns of artifactual interference. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and selected factor assay test results for consecutive pairs of hemolyzed and subsequently recollected (mean, 72 minutes later) nonhemolyzed patient specimens were compared. Specimens from healthy human subjects were subjected to mechanically induced hemolysis, and PT and aPTT results compared with concurrently drawn nonhemolyzed control samples. In 50 paired patient specimens, there were statistically significant differences in PT (15.8 ± 8.4 vs 16.3 ± 8.7 seconds, P < .01) and aPTT (31.6 ± 18 vs 32.5 ± 19 seconds, P < .01) between hemolyzed and nonhemolyzed specimens, respectively. Specimens from healthy subjects showed no difference in PT and a minor difference in aPTT. A policy of rejecting hemolyzed specimens for coagulation tests should be revisited because the observed difference, when present, is unlikely to be considered clinically meaningful.

### The capacity limits of moving objects in the imagination [^112NU77R]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Task and results (n = 36 participants) of Experiment 3, tracking two objects in the imagination with strong grouping cues.

Circles and triangles indicate mean responses for different true impact time and response order ('1st ball' refers to the ball participants responded to first, and '2nd ball' to the ball they responded to second), error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM), colored lines show best linear fit, shaded area is 95% confidence interval (CI), and dotted line shows hypothetical perfect performance (where the subjective impact time equals the true impact time), as reference.

Participants performed the task reasonably well, and the subjective impact times were linearly modulated by true impact time, F(1.05, 36.8) = 36.84, p = 3.5 × 10 −7, partial η 2 = 0.51; linear trend: t(105) = 10.51, p = 4.3 × 10 −18, 95% CI for Mean Difference = [515, 755] ms. As can be seen in Fig. 5 (right), the second responses were still much slower than the first, F(1, 35) = 62.65, p = 2.6 × 10 −9, partial η 2 = 0.64, in a way that interacted with true impact time, F(2.16, 75.84) = 4.1, p = 0.02, partial η 2 = 0.1, this time because of a larger difference for larger impact times. The average difference between the first and second responses was 328 ms (95% CI for the intercept of the first response: [−461, 47] ms, second response: [−670, 28] ms), which was smaller than in Experiment 1b, F(1, 70) = 17.13, p = 9.6 × 10 −5, partial η 2 = 0.2, but larger than in Experiment 2, F(1, 70) = 31.17, p = 4.2 × 10 −7, partial η 2 = 0.31. Accordingly, we found an intermediate pattern based on the fit between participants' data and our computational models: the Serial Model explained 69% of the variance in responses, MSE = 0.04, and the Parallel Model explained 86% of the variance, MSE = 0.02. The results suggest that grouping could relax the single-item bottleneck of imagination tracking somewhat, but not eliminate seriality completely, even with identical motion sequences and an opportunity to use heuristics.

### Home prothrombin time monitoring: a literature analysis [^114cRU6Q]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

The anticoagulant activity of warfarin sodium is monitored by the prothrombin time (PT) using the international normalized ratio (INR). Standard oral anticoagulant therapy monitoring requires frequent patient visits to physicians' offices and/or laboratories to optimize warfarin dosage. Home PT monitoring by patients can increase testing frequency and may thus decrease complications associated with oral anticoagulant therapy. Clinical studies suggest that home PT monitoring is more effective than uncoordinated management and is as effective as care through specialized anticoagulation clinics for keeping INRs within a therapeutic range. There are accurate and reliable instruments available, but paramount to the success of home PT monitoring is sound patient selection, appropriate patient training, and consistent quality control.

### Laboratory coagulation parameters in extremely premature infants born earlier than 27 gestational weeks upon admission to a neonatal intensive care unit [^113x3S9g]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Few published data exist to guide interpretation of coagulation times in extremely premature infants.

Objective

To determine coagulation reference ranges on day 1 of life in extremely premature infants.

Methods

A retrospective review of day 1 coagulation tests was performed in 144 infants < 27 weeks' gestation between 2004 and 2010 in a tertiary neonatal unit. Samples were drawn through a non-heparinized umbilical or peripheral venous catheter as part of routine clinical care.

Results

Mean (SD) and median (range) prothrombin times (PT) of 21.5 (5.3) and 20.2 (13.3–39) s, respectively, activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) of 75.2 (27.8) and 67.4 (34.9–191.6) s, respectively, and plasma fibrinogen levels of 1.9 (1.1) and 1.4 (0.5–4.8) g/l, respectively, were reported. Using reference intervals derived from the 2.5th to 97.5th centiles, ranges of 14.4–36.7 s, 40.5–158.5 s and 0.7–4.8 g/l were determined for PT, APTT and plasma fibrinogen levels, respectively. In a subcohort with grade 0–2 intraventricular haemorrhage (n = 92), mean PT and APTT were 20.9 and 71.3 s, respectively, versus mean PT and APTT of 23.1 and 88.4 s (p = 0.06 and p = 0.03), respectively for those with grade 3–4 intraventricular haemorrhage. Mean PT and APTT in a cohort of infants defined to be small for gestational age were 22 and 76.8 s. These results did not differ significantly from non-small for gestational age infants, with a mean PT and APTT of 19.5 and 73.4 s (p = 0.09 and p = 0.7).

Conclusions

Reference ranges based on retrospective data were determined for PT, APTT and fibrinogen in a large cohort of extremely preterm infants.

### Does routine repeat testing of critical values offer any advantage over single testing? [^116eK4Aq]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Before being communicated to the caregiver, critical laboratory values are verified by repeat testing to ensure their accuracy and to avoid reporting false or erroneous results.

Objective

To determine whether 2 testing runs offered any advantage over a single testing run in ensuring accuracy or in avoiding the reporting of false or erroneous results.

Design

Within the hematology laboratory, 5 tests were selected: hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. A minimum of 500 consecutive critical laboratory test values were collected retrospectively for each test category. The absolute value and the percentage of change between the 2 testing runs for each critical value were calculated and averaged for each test category and then compared with our laboratory's preset, acceptable tolerance limits for reruns.

Results

The mean results obtained for the absolute value and the percentage of change between the testing runs were 0.08 g/dL (1.4%) for hemoglobin levels, 50 cells/µL (10.2%) for white blood cell counts, 1500 cells/µL (9.9%) for platelet counts, 0.7 seconds (1.4%) for prothrombin time, and 5.1 seconds (4.4%) for activated partial thromboplastin time (all within our laboratory's acceptable tolerance limits for reruns). The percentage of specimens with an absolute value or a mean percentage of change outside our laboratory's acceptable tolerance limits for reruns ranged between 0% and 2.2% among the test categories. No false or erroneous results were identified between the 2 testing runs in any category.

Conclusions

Routine, repeat testing of critical hemoglobin level, platelet count, white blood cell count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time results did not offer any advantage over a single run.

### A practical approach to pediatric patients referred with an abnormal coagulation profile [^116uXSbD]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Workup for prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a frequent referral to a Hematology and Coagulation Laboratory. Although the workup should be performed in a timely and cost-effective manner, the complete laboratory assessment of the coagulation state has not been standardized.

Objective

To determine which clinical and laboratory data are most predictive of a coagulopathy and to formulate the most efficient strategy to reach a diagnosis in patients referred for abnormal coagulation profiles.

Design

Retrospective case review. Medical records of 251 patients referred for prolonged PT and/or PTT to our Hematology Service between June 1995 and December 2002 were reviewed.

Results

The study included 135 males and 116 females with a mean age of 7.0 years. A personal history of bleeding was reported in 137 patients, and a family history of bleeding was reported in 116 patients. Fifty-one patients (20%) had a coagulopathy (ie, a bleeding risk). Factors predictive of a bleeding risk were a positive family history of bleeding (P < .001) and a positive personal history of bleeding (P = 0.001). Of 170 patients with findings of normal PT and PTT values on repeat testing, 14 were subsequently diagnosed with a coagulopathy. Two of these patients reported no positive personal or family history of bleeding.

Conclusions

Coagulopathy was identified in 20% of the children referred for abnormal PT and/or PTT. In the absence of a personal or family history of bleeding, a normal PT and/or PTT on repeat testing has a negative predictive value of more than 95%.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112ML7w1]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — monitoring anticoagulant intensity by the international normalized ratio (INR) relies on PT-based calibration and has early-therapy caveats: The PT test is the most common test used to monitor VKA therapy, and during the first few days of warfarin therapy the PT reflects mainly a reduction of factor VII, the half-life of which is approximately 6 h. PT monitoring of VKA treatment is not standardized when expressed in seconds, or as a simple ratio or percentage, so a calibration model adopted in 1982 converts the local PT ratio into an INR, calculated as follows: INR = [patient PT/mean normal PT]^ISI or log INR = ISI(log observed PT ratio). For calibration, patients' samples should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5 to 4.5 INR range, and outliers with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual SDs from the line of relationship should be rejected. Because the half-life of prothrombin is about 60 to 72 h, at least 5 days of overlap is necessary, and the INR is based on ISI values derived from the plasma of patients who had received stable anticoagulant doses for at least 6 weeks; as a result, the INR has not been validated and should be viewed with some skepticism early in the course of warfarin therapy, particularly when results are obtained from different laboratories.

### Altered thrombin generation with prothrombin complex concentrate is not detected by viscoelastic testing: an in vitro study [^113DcyQy]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Editor's key points

- The viscoelastic testing-derived parameters of clot initiation, clotting time (CT) and activated clotting time (ACT), might not reflect the clinically relevant interaction of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors as revealed by thrombin generation assays.
- The ability of CT and ACT to indicate thrombin generation activity was tested in vitro in whole blood obtained from 13 healthy volunteers after simulated dilutional coagulopathy with or without spiking with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC).
- Dilution of whole blood markedly increased thrombin generation owing to imbalance of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, with a further increase after spiking with 4F-PCC, whereas CT and ACT were prolonged.
- Treatment algorithms using prolonged CT and ACT as a trigger for administration of PCC to augment thrombin generation could result in dangerous hypercoagulability, a finding that should be confirmed in vivo.

Coagulopathy and severe bleeding are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Standard coagulation tests (SCTs), such as prothrombin time (PT), international normalised ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT) time, are still used to diagnose coagulation abnormalities and serve as surrogate parameters for altered thrombin generation. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process. It cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, and activates platelets and a variety of procoagulants and anticoagulants. Impaired thrombin generation is related to a loss of coagulation factors as a result of dilution or consumption, hypothermia, acidosis, or use of antithrombotic agents such as vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants. Critically low levels of thrombin generation are associated with a clinically apparent bleeding tendency. However, SCTs halt when only 5–7% of total thrombin is generated. Moreover, SCTs do not fully display the anticoagulant counterpart, which limits their use in assessing haemostatic balance in vivo and questions their use for predicting bleeding. Studies in trauma patients and patients with liver disease have demonstrated that despite prolonged SCTs, thrombin generation activity can be upregulated. In contrast, prolonged PT accurately displays diminished thrombin generation in warfarin-treated patients, whereas prolonged aPTT is a sound surrogate for reduced thrombin generation in patients with haemophilia. Thus, agreement between SCTs and thrombin generation is determined by the clinical scenario and ultimately by the underlying coagulation abnormality.

### Variability in international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time after injury are not explained by coagulation factor deficits [^112Y4fV4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional coagulation assays (CCAs), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), detect clotting factor (CF) deficiencies in hematologic disorders. However, there is controversy about how these CCAs should be used to diagnose, treat, and monitor trauma-induced coagulopathy. Study objectives were to determine whether CCA abnormalities are reflective of deficiencies of coagulation factor activity in the setting of severe injury.

Methods

Patients without previous CF deficiency within a prospective database at an ACS-verified Level I trauma center had CF activity levels, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels measured upon emergency department arrival from 2014 to 2017. Linear regression assessed how CF activity explained the aPTT and PT/INR variation. Prolonged CCA values were set as INR greater than 1.3 and aPTT greater than 34 seconds. CF deficiency was defined as less than 30% activity, except for fibrinogen, defined as less than 150 mg/dL.

Results

Sixty patients with a mean age of 35.8 (SD, 13.6) years and median New Injury Severity Score of 32 (interquartile range, 12–43) were included; 53.3% sustained blunt injuries, 23.3% required massive transfusion, and mortality was 11.67%. Overall, 44.6% of the PT/INR variance and 49.5% of the aPTT variance remained unexplained by CF activity. Deficiencies of CFs were: common pathway, 25%; extrinsic pathway, 1.7%; and intrinsic pathway, 6.7%. The positive predictive value for CF deficiencies were: (1) PT/INR greater than 1.3:4.4% for extrinsic pathway, 56.5% for the common pathway; (2) aPTT greater than 34 seconds:16.7% for the intrinsic pathway, 73.7% for the common pathway.

Conclusion

Almost half of the variances of PT/INR and aPTT were unexplained by CF activity. Prolonged PT/INR and aPTT were poor predictors of deficiencies in the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways; however, they were indicators of common pathway deficiencies.

### Coagulation factor levels in neurosurgical patients with mild prolongation of prothrombin time: effect on plasma transfusion therapy [^113K4Q7e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Neurosurgical patients often have mildly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR). In the absence of liver disease this mild prolongation appears to be due to the use of very sensitive PT reagents. Therefore, the authors performed relevant coagulation factor assays to assess coagulopathy in such patients. They also compared plasma transfusion practices in their hospital before and after the study.

Methods

The authors tested 30 plasma specimens from 25 patients with an INR of 1.3–1.7 for coagulation factors II, VII, and VIII. They also evaluated plasma orders during the 5-month study period and compared them with similar poststudy periods following changes in plasma transfusion guidelines based on the study results.

Results

At the time of plasma orders the median INR was 1.35 (range 1.3–1.7, normal reference range 0.9–1.2) with a corresponding median PT of 13.6 seconds (range 12.8–17.6 seconds). All partial thromboplastin times were normal (median 29.0 seconds, range 19.3–33.7 seconds). The median factor VII level was 57% (range 25%-124%), whereas the hemostatic levels recommended for major surgery are 15%-25%. Factors II and VIII levels were also within the hemostatic range (median 72% and 118%, respectively). Based on these scientific data, plasma transfusion guidelines were modified and resulted in a 75%-85% reduction in plasma orders for mildly prolonged INR over the next 2 years.

Conclusions

Neurosurgical patients with a mild prolongation of INR (up to 1.7) have hemostatically normal levels of important coagulation factors, and the authors recommend that plasma not be transfused to simply correct this abnormal laboratory value.

### Effect of fondaparinux on coagulation assays: results of college of American pathologists proficiency testing [^111rH1DV]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Fondaparinux, a factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for thromboprophylaxis after orthopedic surgery and for treatment of venous thromboembolism. It may also be efficacious, safe, and cost-effective for other patients; thus, more widespread use of fondaparinux is likely. The effect of fondaparinux on coagulation testing needs to be thoroughly examined.

Objective

To report the effects of fondaparinux on coagulation tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin, factor VIII, thrombin time, anti-factor Xa) across diverse methodologies.

Design

Samples with different concentrations of fondaparinux (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 2.0 microg/mL) were sent to laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists Comprehensive Coagulation proficiency survey (N = 898). Laboratory-specific methods were used to assay coagulation parameters.

Results

Prophylactic or therapeutic fondaparinux prolonged the prothrombin time by approximately 1 second and the activated partial thromboplastin time by 4 to 5 seconds, and reduced factor VIII from 119% to 107% and 102%, respectively. Supratherapeutic fondaparinux reduced factor VIII to 85%. The activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged in 19%, 29%, and 52% of laboratories with prophylactic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic fondaparinux levels, respectively. Fibrinogen, antithrombin, and thrombin time assays did not show clinically significant changes. When measuring fondaparinux concentration using an anti-factor Xa assay, the most accurate results were obtained when fondaparinux was used as the calibrator.

Conclusions

Fondaparinux, even in prophylactic doses, slightly prolongs the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and can interfere with factor VIII assays, but it has no clinically relevant effect on fibrinogen, antithrombin, or thrombin time. A fondaparinux standard curve should be used for reporting fondaparinux levels using an anti-factor Xa assay.

### Oral anticoagulants in the elderly [^115oUm92]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

Over a 1-year period, 34,998 prothrombin time tests were performed on 2,379 patients aged 40–89 years with a recommended target International Normalized Ratio (INR) value of 2.5. At least one INR value of ≥ 5 was found in 507/2,379 patients (21.3%). The elderly demonstrated higher maximum and lower minimum INR values, lower warfarin doses, and an increased number of tests performed. After adjustment for these factors, the risk of INR values ≥ 5 increased with age by 15% every 10 years (95% CI 4–28%). We conclude that age is a risk factor for more unstable prothrombin time results.

### Recommendations for appropriate activated partial thromboplastin time reagent selection and utilization [^117HjHLV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is widely used as a screening coagulation test and for monitoring unfractionated heparin therapy. Various commercial reagents are available, with different performance characteristics, particularly responsiveness to the lupus anticoagulant (LA). Because aPTT reagent selection significantly affects the interpretation of results, we reviewed College of American Pathologists proficiency testing data involving approximately 4,000 coagulation laboratories, and conducted a survey of coagulation laboratories (n = 93) using The Fritsma Factor hemostasis Web site to determine the basis for aPTT reagent selection. The data demonstrate that for routine aPTT testing, most laboratories use reagents with high/moderate responsiveness to LA. Significant misunderstanding was apparent regarding the use of appropriate aPTT reagent for routine testing and LA identification. We recommend aPTT reagents with low LA responsiveness to screen for coagulation factor deficiencies and heparin monitoring, and suggest continued education of laboratory professionals and reagent manufacturers about appropriate aPTT reagent use.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization failed to detect PML-RARA or variant RARA fusions. Consistently, cytogenetic studies revealed 46, XX, t(5;11)(q31; p15)[20] (Figure 1B), indicating the absence of RARA translocations. No somatic mutation/copy number change in 141 myeloid-related genes (supplemental Table 1) including FLT3, NPM1, WT1, CEBPA, KIT, and K/NRAS was detected by targeted next-generation sequencing. In view of the PML-RARA negativity, ATRA was stopped after administration for 6 days and a shortened prothrombin time (12.9 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (36.8 seconds) was noted. A diagnosis of AML not otherwise specified was made and the patient was treated with the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology-AML 2004 protocol. Complete remission was achieved after the first induction course. However, the patient developed cardiac failure after the sixth course of high-dose cytarabine and etoposide and died 9 months after the initial diagnosis.

### Use of the activated partial thromboplastin time for heparin monitoring [^115M7J2U]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the relationship between heparin concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) results, define a heparin concentration-derived therapeutic range for each aPTT instrument, compare aPTT- and heparin concentration-guided dosage adjustment decisions, and compare laboratory- and bedside aPTT-guided decisions. In phase 1, 102 blood samples were analyzed for bedside and laboratory aPTTs and heparin concentration (used to establish aPTT therapeutic range). In phase 2, 100 samples were analyzed in the same manner. Correlations for aPTT compared with heparin ranged from 0.36 to 0.82. Dosage adjustment decisions guided by the aPTT agreed with those based on heparin concentration 63% to 80% of the time. Laboratory and bedside aPTT dosage adjustment decisions agreed 59% to 68% of the time. The correlation of aPTT with heparin concentration and agreement between aPTT- and heparin-guided decisions vary with the aPTT instrument. Decisions guided by laboratory aPTT results often disagree with decisions guided by bedside aPTT results.

### Mixing studies in patients with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time [^1127G8Mt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting for surgery may have isolated or combined prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and/or prothrombin time (PT). In patients not receiving anticoagulants or with no identifiable cause for abnormal clot formation, a mixing study is performed. The index of circulating anticoagulant (ICA) has been used to predict the presence of an inhibitor, usually a lupus anticoagulant.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the results of mixing studies performed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, between January 1, 2010 and February 29, 2012. We determined the number of samples that normalized or remained prolonged, the clotting factors associated with prolonged test results, and the presence of coagulation inhibitors. We calculated the ICA in the samples with prolonged aPTT and PT to determine its ability to predict a lupus anticoagulant. The primary comparison of interest was the diagnostic utility of the ICA at cutoff values of 11% for predicting the presence of lupus anticoagulant.

Results

There were 269 mixing studies performed: 131 samples with prolonged aPTT; 95 with prolonged PT; and 43 with both prolonged aPTT and prolonged PT. Of the samples with a prolonged aPTT, 55 of 131 (42%) normalized, 36 of 131 (27%) partially corrected, and 40 of 131 (31%) remained prolonged. Thirty-three of 95 samples (35%) with prolonged PT normalized, while 62 of 95 (65%) remained prolonged. Eight of 43 (19%) mixing studies of patients with prolonged PT and aPTT normalized; the aPTT normalized, but the PT remained prolonged in 17 of 43 (39%); the PT normalized, but the aPTT remained prolonged in 7 of 43 (16%); and both tests remained prolonged in 11 of 43 (26%) samples. Prolongations in the aPTT were primarily associated with low activities of CF XII, while the majority of the prolongations in PT were secondary to low activities in CF VII. Combined prolongations were secondary to deficiencies in both the intrinsic and extrinsic as well as the common pathways. An ICA > 11% had 100% (95% CI, 59%-100%) sensitivity, 53% (95% CI, 35%-70%) specificity, and 77% (95% CI, 62%-92%) accuracy in predicting the presence of lupus anticoagulant in patients with prolonged aPTT.

Conclusions

Normalization of the aPTT and PT in a mixing study was associated with low clotting factor activity. The ICA may be helpful in predicting the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. As anesthesiologists take ownership of the perioperative surgical home, we need to understand the clinical implications of the results of mixing studies.

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^113rGhxB]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Coagulopathy and disseminated Intravascular coagulation

Coagulation is the process of changing the physical state of the blood from liquid to semi-solid. In vertebrates, coagulation is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that maintains haemostasis, in cases of blood vessel damage, by preventing bleeding. Overall, coagulation has four stages of clot formation, including constriction of the blood vessel, formation of a temporary platelet plug, activation of the coagulation cascade, and formation of the final clot. The system is tightly regulated by the complex interaction of 20 pro-coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, thrombin, prothrombin, von Willebrand factors, among others. When the system is under equilibrium, the clotting formation process is balanced by fibrinolysis, which is the enzymatic breakdown of the fibrin in blood clots. Once vascular repair is achieved, the fibrinolytic factors plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator are attracted by the clot through lysine residues of fibrin and start clot digestion. Disturbances in these haemostatic processes lead to several problems, including thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be classified into hyperfibrinolytic coagulation, which will lead to thrombotic events, or hypofibrinolytic coagulation, which leads to excessive bleeding. Disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported in patients with EHS. For example, a 38-year-old male recreational athlete presented in the emergency room with a history of sudden loss of consciousness during a 10 km run. He did not have a history of cardiovascular or respiratory disease and did not have similar loss of consciousness episodes previously. His level of fibrin degradation product, small pieces of protein that stay in the circulation when a blood clot dissolves, was substantially elevated at 0.8 mg/L (normal < 0.05 mg/L). Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, indicators of the time required for clot formation in a blood sample, were 29.7 seconds (normal time 12.3 seconds) and 33.5 seconds (control time 26.38 seconds), respectively. He also presented bilateral intracerebral bleeding, consistent with hypofibrinolytic disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Rivaroxaban — antithrombotic mechanism and kinetic parameters — acts as a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa with a concentration-dependent effect and an inhibitory constant of 0.4 ± 0.02 nM, and has 10,000-fold greater selectivity for factor Xa than for other serine proteases. The onset of action is rapid and reversible, with a kinetic association rate constant of 1.7 × 10⁷ mol/L⁻¹/s⁻¹ and a kinetic dissociation rate constant of 5 × 10⁻³/s⁻¹; inhibitory activity is maintained when factor Xa is complexed with factor Va and Ca²⁺ on a phospholipid membrane (prothrombinase bound) and when factor Xa is bound to the clot. In plasma, endogenous human factor Xa is inhibited to cause dose-dependent prolongation of both the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with the PT being more sensitive than the aPTT.

Plasma products (fresh frozen plasma [FFP], PF24, or thawed plasma) — indications, non-indications, and dosing: FFP is indicated for correction of microvascular bleeding (i.e., coagulopathy) in the presence of an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than 2.0 in the absence of heparin; for correction of excessive microvascular bleeding secondary to coagulation factor deficiency in patients transfused with more than one blood volume (approximately 70 ml/kg) and when prothrombin time (PT) or INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) cannot be obtained in a timely fashion; for urgent reversal of warfarin therapy when PCCs are not available; and for correction of known coagulation factor deficiencies for which specific concentrates are unavailable. FFP is not indicated if PT or INR and aPTT are normal or solely for augmentation of plasma volume or albumin concentration. Administer FFP in doses calculated to achieve a minimum of 30% of plasma factor concentration, noting that four to five platelet concentrates, 1 unit single-donor apheresis platelets, or 1 unit fresh whole blood provide a quantity of coagulation factors similar to that contained in one unit FFP.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin which has antithrombotic properties.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ± SD, 14.0 ± 3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean ± SD, 1.22 ± 0.13). Increases of up to 1.8 times the control values were seen in the thrombin time (TT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Enoxaparin at a 1 mg/kg dose (100 mg/mL concentration), administered subcutaneously every 12 hours to patients in a large clinical trial resulted in aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in the majority of patients (n = 1607). A 30 mg intravenous bolus immediately followed by a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous administration resulted in aPTT postinjection values of 50 seconds. The average aPTT prolongation value on Day 1 was about 16% higher than on Day 4.

Table 2

a INR, international normalised ratio; FFP, fresh frozen plasma; ICU, intensive care unit.

Comparing FFP transfusions for which the clinical indication was recorded as coagulopathy plus bleeding with the nonbleeding categories indicated that pretransfusion INR values were more frequently either normal or only mildly prolonged when bleeding was present (P = 0.006; χ 2 test). A similar pattern was observed when FFP transfusions administered on days with clinically significant haemorrhage were compared with those administered on days with no recorded haemorrhage (P = 0.002). These data show that although a high proportion of FFP treatments associated with bleeding were preceded by normal or mildly prolonged INR, as might be expected from clinical practice, this was also a feature of prophylactic or preprocedural transfusions.

Smaller doses of FFP were administered to patients when the transfusion was given outside episodes of PT prolongation (median 570 ml) or in patients who never had PT prolongation (median 568 ml) (Table 1). The dose of FFP administered in relation to increasing pretransfusion INR is shown in Table 3, which confirmed the trend for FFP dose to increase with higher INR value. There were 56 patients who received 64 FFP treatments in the ICU but never had documented INR prolongation at any stage. Clinical factors for this group have been reported previously. To also explore the potential importance of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values, we extracted the APTT value prior to FFP transfusion. For 24 of these 64 treatments, no APTT value was measured during the 24 hours prior to FFP administration, and for the other 40 treatments, APTT was measured but was only mildly prolonged in most cases (median APTT value 42 seconds (interquartile range 33.5 to 51.5 seconds)).

### Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate use for bleeding management in adult trauma [^112HtzkY]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Robust evidence for clinical use of PCC in severe trauma and the risk of massive transfusion comes from the PROCOAG trial, despite some methodologic limitations. The trial's reliance on PT ratios to define coagulopathy, rather than global coagulation assessments like viscoelastic testing, limits the generalizability of its findings. PT values can indicate a deficiency in procoagulants but do not account for concurrent deficiencies in anticoagulants. Although PT has been used to predict early coagulopathy and guide plasma transfusion in trauma, it has not been a reliable predictor of perioperative bleeding. The PROCOAG trial hypothesized that combining 4F-PCC with a ratio-based transfusion strategy (packed red blood cells [PRBCs]:FFP ratio of 1:1 to 2:1) would be superior to the ratio-based strategy alone in reducing 24-h blood product consumption. The trial included patients at risk of massive transfusion, defined as those requiring at least 1 unit of PRBC during prehospital care or within 1 h of admission, an assessment of blood consumption score greater than or equal to 2, or those needing 3 units or more PRBCs within the hour of admission or 10 units or more PRBC within 24 h. Of 4,313 admitted patients, 327 were randomized, and 324 were analyzed (160 in placebo group and 164 in the 4F-PCC group). At randomization, about two thirds of the patients had a PT ratio greater than 1.2, and one-quarter had a PT ratio greater than 1.5. Both groups were comparable regarding the need for surgical/interventional hemorrhage control, although more patients in the placebo group received tranexamic acid (86% vs. 76%) and a higher median dose of fibrinogen concentrate. The median 24-h blood product consumption was not significantly different between the groups (12 units [5 to 19] in 4F-PCC group vs. 11 units [6 to 19] in the placebo group; absolute difference, 0.2 units; 95% CI, −2.99 to 3.33; P = 0.72). However, thromboembolic events (superficial and deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and extremity ischemia) were more frequent in the 4F-PCC group, with 56 patients (35%) experiencing at least one event compared to 37 patients (24%) in the placebo group (absolute difference, 11% [95% CI, 1 to 21%]; relative risk, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.04 to 2.10]; P = 0.03). This study recognizes as a limitation the possible bias of having administered 4F-PCC and FFP together, which would mask a possible excess of procoagulant factors and their influence on the results of thromboembolic events. Among other methodologic limitations, such as the lack of monitoring of thrombin generation deficiency before administration of 4F-PCC and its raw comparative administration versus FFP, we must consider all its results as valid but without extrapolating the generalization of a risk of serious adverse effects that would discourage their use in traumatic bleeding. We advocate the development of new randomized clinical trials to contrast these results. Previous studies have explored the effects of FFP-only strategies versus FFP plus 4F-PCC, and a single-center open-label trial has compared a combination of fibrinogen concentrate, factor XIII, and 4F-PCC versus FFP. All of these studies reported reductions in blood product consumption with the administration of 4F-PCC. The ongoing Trauma and Prothrombin Complex Concentrate trial aims to determine whether 4F-PCC can reduce mortality in patients predicted to require large volume of blood transfusions (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05568888). This trial is expected to provide further insights into the effectiveness and safety of 4F-PCC in trauma settings, potentially influencing future guidelines and clinical practice.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113B9zZj]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

International normalized ratio (INR) monitoring and laboratory handling — vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are better tracked with INR than the unconverted prothrombin time (PT) ratio, and calibration/sample practices materially affect accuracy. The INR is more reliable than the unconverted PT ratio and its use is thus recommended during both the initiation and maintenance of VKAs. The College of American Pathologists has recommended that laboratories should use thromboplastin reagents that are at least moderately responsive (ie, ISI < 1.7) and reagent/instrument combinations with established and validated ISI; manufacturer-provided ISI values may not be correct locally, so local calibrations using plasma samples with certified PT values should be used to determine the instrument-specific ISI, the mean normal plasma PT is not interchangeable with a laboratory control PT, and the mean normal PT should be determined for each new batch of thromboplastin with the same instrument. Higher citrate concentrations (eg, 3.8%) lead to higher INR values and underfilling tubes spuriously prolongs PT, whereas using collection tubes containing 3.2% citrate and adequately filling tubes can reduce this problem.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^1172MVUu]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of < 50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (< 1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of < 30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).

### Effect of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin prophylaxis on activated partial thromboplastin time: a retrospective evaluation [^111dAeDv]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Characterize the incidence of elevated aPTT results in patients treated with prophylactic, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Design

Retrospective, cohort analysis.

Setting

Single-center, university hospital.

Measurements

Evaluation of 257 patients with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) testing both prior to and following subcutaneous (SC) unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy.

Main Results

Evaluated patients received UFH 5000 units every 8 hours. Baseline aPTT values were within the normal range (mean ± SD, 32.0 ± 8.5 seconds). After initiation of UFH, aPTT values increased (mean ± SD, 37.6 ± 15.2 seconds). After 24 hours of SC UFH, mean aPTT values (mean ± SD, 38.6 ± 15.5) exceeded the normal laboratory range (23.3–35.7 seconds). An elevated aPTT result after UFH was associated with baseline aPTT, length of therapy, and weight-based UFH dose. A significant association was not identified between aPTT elevation and age, race, sex, history of liver disease, type of admission, or transfusion of blood products.

Conclusions

Treatment with UFH resulted in a small, but significant, increase in aPTT.

### Prophylactic correction of the international normalized ratio in neurosurgery: a brief review of a brief literature [^112EHDHB]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Prophylactic fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion is often undertaken in hemodynamically stable patients with a minimally elevated international normalized ratio (INR) prior to invasive procedures, despite little evidence in support of this practice. The authors review the current literature in an attempt to clarify best clinical practice with regard to this issue. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time-INR are useful laboratory tests to measure specific clotting factors in the coagulation cascade, in the absence of active bleeding or a preexisting coagulopathy, their utility as predictors of overall bleeding risk is limited. Several studies have shown an imperfect correlation between mild elevations in the INR and subsequent bleeding tendency. Furthermore, FFP transfusion is not always sufficient to achieve normal INR values in patients who have mild elevations (< 2) to begin with. Finally, there are risks associated with FFP transfusion, including potential transfusion-associated [disease] exposures as well as the time delay imposed by laboratory testing and transfusion administration prior to initiation of procedures. The authors propose that the current concept of a "normal" INR value warrants redefinition to make it a more meaningful clinical tool. Based on their review of the literature, the authors suggest that in a hemodynamically stable patient population there is a range of mildly prolonged INR values for which FFP transfusion is not beneficial, and is potentially harmful.

### Evaluation of prolonged aPTT values in the pediatric population [^113iFaPq]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the likelihood of significant bleeding disorders in children with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs), a retrospective chart review was performed. Data analyses determined that in the absence of symptoms and a negative family history, the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder was unlikely in an individual with a prolonged aPTT (negative predictive value = 80%). Conversely, a prolonged aPTT was predictive (positive predictive value = 62%) in the presence of both clinical symptoms and a documented family history. The scope of laboratory investigation in any child with a prolonged aPTT should be tempered by the clinical presentation and the associated personal and family histories.

### Variations of prothrombin time and international normalized ratio in patients treated with warfarin [^1116RqqG]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time is a standard screening test to monitor patients treated with oral anticoagulants. We hypothesize that INR measurements will not vary a lot within a given day in a given patient. The present study was thus conducted to compare the change of the international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time (PT) within 1 day in patients treated with warfarin. Thirty such patients and nineteen healthy controls were enrolled into this study. PT was performed in four time points of a day in all subjects, two in the morning and two in the afternoon. The four INR values obtained were compared with each other to find little change in the series of time either in patients or in healthy controls. Neither were they affected by renal function, liver function, sex, age, hemoglobin, white cell count, platelet, treatment duration of warfarin, or alcoholic drinking. INR could be measured in any time of a day to have values equally valuable in clinical use.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^114o8aje]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guideline on coagulation disorders in cirrhosis — background and conceptual framework states that cirrhosis is accompanied by alterations in platelet count (PLT) and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) used to estimate clotting, but it has become clear that neither thrombocytopenia nor elevated PT/INR predicts bleeding outcomes in most patients and that the severity of coagulopathy by these parameters is not predictive of bleeding complications, including variceal hemorrhage. The text also describes that patients are at risk for thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, or stroke), notes clinician trepidation treating with conventional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and cautions that PT/INR-based strategies to estimate bleeding risk and monitor VKA endpoints may not be relevant in cirrhosis; more integrative approaches using measurements of fibrin clot formation and lysis have been tested.

### TEG® and ROTEM® in trauma: similar test but different results? [^116A11Uv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulation is a complex, dynamic, highly regulated and interwoven process involving a myriad of cells, molecules and structures. Only recently, the unique changes in coagulation caused by trauma are starting to be understood, but remain mostly unknown. Trauma patients are among the largest consumers of blood and blood products and the decision of what, when and how much blood and blood product to transfuse is often empiric or based on traditional coagulation lab tests such as INR/PT, PTT and platelet count. However, traditional lab tests have been heavily criticized for their limitations in assisting the physicians with the clinical decision to transfuse, and alternatives are warranted.

The traditional laboratorial evaluation of coagulation evolved initially to quantify specific cellular, molecular or factor deficiencies. Numeric values (quantity) of individual elements do not necessarily indicate how well hemostasis is functioning. As an example, a cirrhotic patient with low platelet count and an abnormal INR of 2 does not necessarily bleed and probably can tolerate minor invasive procedures. In contrast, a hypothermic trauma patient with normal platelet count and INR might bleed to death. Another limitation of traditional lab tests is the prolonged time to obtain the results or turnaround time. Dealing with rapid changes as frequently occurs in massively bleeding trauma patients, is challenging. In such situations, any delay in obtaining the lab results can lead to inadequate transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality. Thus in trauma, global, functional and immediately available laboratorial evaluation of hemostasis can improve both patient management and outcome.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^117Cragf]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants — periprocedural principles and laboratory assessment — Anti-Xa anticoagulants are best assessed by anti-Xa levels with drug-specific calibrators, whereas prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are crude and may be minimally prolonged or normal; normal results rule out high circulating drug levels, there is no reliable serum assay to assess anticoagulant activity at this time, and interpretation of activated partial thromboplastin time requires caution due to a ceiling effect. In the periprocedural period, key considerations are time to maximum effect, half-life, and drug excretion; these agents have a short time to maximal effect (2–4 hours with rivaroxaban, 1–3 hours with apixaban), a half-life ranging from 8 to 15 hours, and renal excretion variability (rivaroxaban 66% and apixaban 25%). To minimize bleeding risk, these medications should be stopped for at least 2 half-lives before high-risk procedures and dosing adjusted for renal impairment.

### The effect of graded hypothermia (36 ° C-32 ° C) on hemostasis in anesthetized patients without surgical trauma [^111wubok]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The isolated effects of hypothermia on hemostasis have not been investigated in healthy humans. We cooled 16 anesthetized patients scheduled for elective intracranial surgery to 32 degrees C body core temperature and assessed prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombelastogram (TEG), closure time, and platelet count at 36 degrees C, 34 degrees C, and 32 degrees C body core temperature after the induction of anesthesia but before surgical intervention. Activated partial thromboplastin time, hematocrit, and closure time did not change, whereas PT and platelet count decreased during cooling. Platelet count decreased without a decrease in hematocrit; hence, a dilution by administered fluids seemed unlikely. The small decrease of platelet count is probably clinically irrelevant in patients with normal platelet count and function. The small decrease in PT indicates an alteration of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. TEG measurements showed a delay of clot formation in temperature-adjusted measurements but showed no change if the test temperature was 37 degrees C. This indicates that hypothermia reduces plasmatic coagulation and platelet reactivity. However, the clot strength is not altered by hypothermia. All coagulation variables remained within the normal ranges. Our results may indicate that moderate short-term (4-h) hypothermia has only minor adverse effects in healthy humans. We can make no statement about the effects of hypothermia of longer duration.

Implications

This study investigated the isolated effects of hypothermia in healthy anesthetized humans. We found only minor effects of body temperature reduction to 32 degrees C on assessed coagulation variables, indicating only minor effects in otherwise healthy humans.

Mild Inherited and Acquired Coagulation Disorders

Detection of Mild Inherited Bleeding Disorders

Massive hemorrhagic diathesis can be caused by disorders of primary hemostasis (von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders), secondary hemostasis (hemophilia A and B), and disturbance of the fibrinolytic system, connective tissue, or vascular formation. These conditions are mostly diagnosed before adulthood. However, less severe disorders might have gone undiagnosed and contribute to unexpected bleeding in major surgery. The first step in the diagnostic approach is quantifying bleeding symptoms resulting from minor hemostatic challenges, including dental extraction, minor surgery or trauma, epistaxis, or menorrhagia. The bleeding assessment tool of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis can be used for adults and children. A severity score is calculated, and for patients at increased risk (score 4 or greater in men, 6 or greater in women, 2 or greater in children), this examination should be followed by a systematic diagnostic laboratory workup.

In patients with an increased bleeding risk of major surgery, it is important to identify these potential inherited bleeding disorders. The activated PTT is often prolonged in factor deficiencies such as hemophilia A and B, hemophilia C, sometimes in von Willebrand disease (as domains of this macromolecule bind and protect factor VIII) in rare isolated factor deficiencies and in dys- or hypofibrinogenemia. However, prolongation of the activated PTT is also observed in common conditions that are usually not associated with increased bleeding, such as deficiencies of the contact activation factors (e.g. factor XII) and anticardiolipin antibodies due to antiphospholipid syndrome. Preoperative bleeding risk evaluation with the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding assessment tool and laboratory testing with prothrombin time and activated PTT do not accurately detect mild bleeding disorders in patients undergoing elective surgery. In a study of 1,502 surgical patients, 5.5% had a positive questionnaire and/or abnormal coagulation test results for PTT/INR. None of these patients reported major bleeding. However, even when combining the questionnaire with more extensive laboratory testing including thrombin time, euglobulin lysis time to assess fibrinolysis, and the Platelet Function Analyzer-100 (USA) in vitro bleeding time to assess primary hemostasis, results remained unsatisfactory. In only 8.8% of patients with reported bleeding symptoms, hemostatic abnormalities were found, while in 10.5% of patients without reported bleeding symptoms, test results were abnormal. In this regard, the diagnostic workup revealed a high specificity but low sensitivity.

### Clot waveform analysis: from hypercoagulability to hypocoagulability: a review [^112PQFGR]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are coagulative screening tests used for the diagnosis of several pathologic conditions, such as liver failure, coagulation factor deficiencies, anti-phospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant), and factor VIII inhibitors. A new test was developed several years ago to detect the amount of thrombin generated during plasma clotting, using low tissue factor concentrations and fluorogenic substrates, and it has since been used successfully in conditions ranging from hypocoagulable to hypercoagulable states. However, the test is expensive and difficult to perform in nonspecialized laboratories, and efforts have thus been made to find an economic and easily implementable test suitable for routine use, even in nonspecialist laboratories.

Objective —

To evaluate clot waveform analysis (CWA) of PT and aPTT, aiming to show the dynamics of clot formation; that is, the "hidden" features of both tests. CWA can be implemented by using an automated coagulometer with dedicated software. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether CWA is able to detect both hypercoagulative and hypocoagulative states.

Data Sources —

Using MedLine, we searched and retrieved articles relating to CWA. We only considered articles published in English, but with no limits in terms of article type, publication year, or geography.

Conclusions —

CWA was shown to be a reliable test in patients with both hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states. It represents a simple and inexpensive global test that can easily provide information on the behavior of the coagulation system. Both the first and second derivatives are computed by using dedicated software implemented with an on-board algorithm in a routine automated coagulometer.

Liver biopsy — prebiopsy testing practices and limitations: Common practice includes measurement of the complete blood count, including platelet count, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), sometimes the activated partial thromboplastin time, and/or cutaneous bleeding time before biopsy, but the utility of these tests in predicting bleeding risk is "uncertain and generally not supported by the available literature". Complex hemostatic defects such as hyperfibrinolysis are not detected by conventional tests and "some 10%-15% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis appear to have this particular problem"; hyperfibrinolysis "should be suspected when there is late (hours) postprocedure bleeding".

### Clinical evaluation of bleeding and bruising in primary care [^116izDRZ]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Bleeding and bruising are common symptoms in the primary care setting. The patient history can help determine whether the bruising or bleeding is abnormal. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis has developed a bleeding assessment tool that can be used to indicate possible pathology. A family history of bleeding problems may suggest a hereditary coagulation defect. Such a history is especially important in children who may not have experienced a major bleeding episode. Medication review can identify pharmacologic causes of the bleeding or bruising. Physical examination findings such as mucocutaneous bleeding suggest that the underlying condition is caused by platelet dysfunction, whereas hemarthroses or hematomas are more common in coagulopathy. If the history and physical examination findings suggest a bleeding diathesis, initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). A normal PT and PTT indicate a platelet disorder, the most common of which is von Willebrand disease. A normal PT and prolonged PTT signal a deficit in the intrinsic pathway, and a mixing study should be performed. A vitamin K challenge is indicated in patients with an abnormal PT and normal PTT. A workup for liver failure is warranted in patients with prolonged PT and PTT. If initial testing does not reveal an etiology in a patient with a high suspicion for a bleeding disorder, the patient should be referred to a hematologist for additional evaluation.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^1154tjq4]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) Surgical Management of Stones — preoperative coagulation studies: The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) addresses periprocedural assessment for percutaneous nephrostomy, categorizing it as a procedure with "significant bleeding risk, difficult to direct or control", and based on this designation advises routinely obtaining pre-procedural international normalized ratio (INR) to assess standardized prothrombin time (PT) in all patients before nephrostomy tube placement, although there was no consensus on obtaining pre-procedural partial thromboplastin time (PTT). In contradistinction, the ASA discourages routine preoperative testing in unselected patients and states coagulation studies should be selectively obtained based upon clinical characteristics, including documented or suspected bleeding disorders, hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction; those on anticoagulant medications may require coagulation studies preoperatively. The Panel, concurrent with the ASA, concludes that in the absence of clinical indications, coagulation studies should not be routinely obtained prior to surgical management of urinary stone disease.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^114SdugS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and factor Xa.

Subcutaneous LMWH and fixed dosed heparin require laboratory monitoring. For patients on therapeutic UFH, serial monitoring of (PTT; also known as APTT) or factor Xa is suggested. The benefit of monitoring IV heparin once a therapeutic threshold has been exceeded is not well defined.

Anticoagulation Forum and American College of Chest Physicians both recommend monitoring anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH because of baseline artefactual abnormalities in PTT and a potential for heparin resistance. None of the guidelines recommend dosing of LMWHs based on anti-Xa levels given lack of evidence on outcomes for thrombosis or bleeding. Body weight–adjusted doses for LMWH appear safer, which may be particularly effective in overweight patients. Elevated PT or PTT is not a contraindication to thromboprophylaxis in the absence of active bleeding. A platelet count < 25 × 10 9 /L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/L constitutes a bleeding risk, warranting holding of standard dose VTE prophylaxis, whereas therapeutic anticoagulation should be withheld if platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /L or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L.

The role of serial hemoglobin monitoring in COVID-19 patients on therapeutic anticoagulation is poorly defined.

We found no data from LMICs regarding the diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Speculative explanations for this finding include limited availability of laboratory assays for serological confirmation of HIT, expense associated with using nonheparin anticoagulants, and a lack of awareness of the guidelines.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

A study from Nigeria identified the inability to monitor as a primary reason for reduced clinician adherence to anticoagulation guidelines. In a separate multicenter survey from six southeastern Nigerian tertiary hospitals, most respondents were able to recognize PT and APTT, but not anti-Xa assay, as laboratory monitoring tools for anticoagulation therapy. This finding correlated with heparin and warfarin as the most commonly administered anticoagulants among respondents.

D -dimer testing might not be readily available in some LMICs and likely would incur a higher cost, although specific pricing in various LMIC environments remains unclear. Early COVID-19 studies suggest wide use of these tests in China, an upper middle-income country.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112CqVA1]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Perioperative blood management — monitoring for coagulopathy: Monitoring for coagulopathy includes standard coagulation tests (e.g. INR, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen concentration), as well as platelet count, with additional options including tests of platelet function and viscoelastic assays (e.g. TEG, ROTEM). An observational study of point-of-care aPTT and prothrombin time reported shorter times for obtaining test results with point-of-care monitoring and significant correlations with traditional laboratory tests (Category B2-B evidence). An observational study examining platelet count during cardiopulmonary bypass to predict excessive blood loss reports a sensitivity value of 83% (Category B2-B evidence). An RCT reported equivocal findings for blood loss and transfusion requirements when TEG is compared with standard laboratory coagulation tests (Category A3-E evidence), and an RCT reported equivocal findings with ROTEM versus non-fibrinolysis monitoring for RBC, FFP, and platelet transfusion requirements (Category A3-E evidence).

### Test of the month: the chromogenic antifactor Xa assay [^117Do328]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

As the number of anticoagulant drugs increases and new ones are brought to market, the utility of the routine screening coagulation tests of today — namely the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time — will be significantly reduced in many clinical situations. Although the new anticoagulants are designed to require less frequent monitoring, it is imperative that the proper test is selected in situations where monitoring is needed. In addition, tests that are designed for the new generation of drugs may be informative in certain situations for monitoring the anticoagulants that have been in use for many years. Here, we present the chromogenic antifactor Xa assay and demonstrate its utility and its limitations in monitoring three anticoagulant drugs (unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux) as well as one emerging anticoagulant, rivaroxaban.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111cfqGi]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves — key directives state that pregnant women with mechanical prostheses should receive therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent monitoring during pregnancy, and women unable to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent monitoring should be counseled against pregnancy. Women and their providers should use shared decision-making to choose an anticoagulation strategy for pregnancy, and women should be informed that VKA during pregnancy is associated with the lowest likelihood of maternal complications but the highest likelihood of miscarriage, fetal death, and congenital abnormalities, particularly if taken during the first trimester and if the warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/d. For planned delivery, those on warfarin should switch to twice-daily LMWH with a target anti–Xa level of 0.8 U/mL to 1.2 U/mL at 4 to 6 hours after dose or to intravenous UFH with an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 2 times control at least 1 week before planned delivery; patients on LMWH should switch to UFH with an aPTT 2 times control at least 36 hours before planned delivery, and UFH should be stopped at least 6 hours before planned vaginal delivery. If labor begins or urgent delivery is required while therapeutically anticoagulated with a VKA, cesarean section should be performed after reversal of anticoagulation. For women requiring a warfarin dose ≤ 5 mg/d to maintain a therapeutic INR, continuation of warfarin for all 3 trimesters is reasonable after discussion of risks and benefits; if dose requirements are > 5 mg/d, dose-adjusted LMWH with a target anti–Xa level of 0.8 to 1.2 U/mL at 4 to 6 hours after dose at least 2 times per day during the first trimester, followed by warfarin during the second and third trimesters, is reasonable. If dose-adjusted LMWH is unavailable for those requiring > 5 mg/d, dose-adjusted continuous intravenous UFH during the first trimester (with aPTT 2 times control), followed by warfarin for the second and third trimesters, is reasonable.

### Timing for assessment of bleeding diathesis in pediatric blunt traumatic brain injury [^116rQdcy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Intracranial hemorrhage may complicate blunt traumatic brain injury (TBI) or result from underlying bleeding disorders, and coagulation studies/factor level assays may be abnormal for both. Current studies do not identify when testing can reliably differentiate between traumatic injuries and bleeding disorders. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities in the initial 36 hours after presentation for blunt TBI and determine a time period for subsequent normalization.

Methods

Patients under 18 years old with blunt TBI were identified from our institutional trauma registry from 2020 to 2022. Data collected included coagulation studies [prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT)], complete blood count, factor levels, final suspected/proven diagnosis, mechanism of injury, patient demographics, radiographic findings, and clinical interventions. Comparisons were made between laboratory values obtained and normal references, and differences were described.

Results

Two hundred sixty-eight patients were identified. The majority were male, and the median age was 8.5 months (interquartile range 4–45.3 mo). The coagulation studies and factor level assays were more often completed for patients who suffered child physical abuse, whereas testing was obtained in < 10% of patients following unintentional trauma. The mechanism of injury was unintentional blunt injury in 70.1%, abusive TBI in 27.2%, and a medical cause in 3%. Intracranial hemorrhage was identified in 49.2% of patients. Within 36 hours after presentation, the most common laboratory abnormality was significantly elevated PT [median 13.65 s (interquartile range 13.1–14.8 s)] as compared with the normal range (P < 0.001). This did not differ significantly based on the mechanism of trauma. Significant elevations were also seen for von Willebrand factor antigen and d-dimer. There were no patients with significant factor level deficiencies. Although 64% of patients had follow-up, only 11.8% had repeat laboratory testing, with persistent abnormalities observed in up to 7%.

Conclusions

Coagulation studies and factor level assays were not routinely obtained following blunt head trauma in pediatric patients. Coagulation abnormalities were, however, observed in > 50% of patients who underwent testing. These patients may have coagulation abnormalities that persist for 2 weeks after injury without an underlying bleeding disorder. Further delineating the time frame of these abnormalities may inform practice guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation of underlying bleeding disorders and follow-up.

### TEG® and ROTEM® in trauma: similar test but different results? [^115q5wPK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Additional analysis of individual parameters from TEG ® and ROTEM ® in trauma

The additional PUBMED search identified 24 manuscripts, of which TEG ® was tested in 10, rapid-TEG in 6 and ROTEM® in 9. Two studies compared TEG ® with rapid-TEG ®. No randomized controlled trial was found, 16 manuscripts analyzed data prospectively collected, 6 were retrospective and 2 were "before and after" studies. The techniques used to perform TEG ® and ROTEM ® in these 24 studies were noticeably heterogeneous. Different activators were used and different parameters evaluated making general comparisons difficult. Table 2 summarizes the main findings of the 24 manuscripts reviewed according to the test parameters evaluated and whether TEG ® or ROTEM ® were used to diagnose early coagulopathy, guide transfusion or indicate prognosis.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116Vtu4t]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative laboratory measurement of DOAC therapy — background: The role of measuring DOAC levels before a surgery/procedure is uncertain; unlike an international normalized ratio (INR) measurement where a level < 1.5 is considered safe to allow most surgery/procedures to proceed, thresholds with DOACs are uncertain, with levels of < 30 ng/mL or < 50 ng/mL suggested. A subanalysis of the PAUSE study suggested that pre-operative DOAC levels < 30 ng/mL or 30 to 50 ng/mL were not associated with an increased risk for perioperative bleeding but was underpowered, and further research is needed to define safe pre-operative DOAC levels according to surgery/procedure-related bleeding risk. Potential barriers such as relatively high costs and limited availability can be mitigated if laboratories are configured to run assays with similar 20- to 30-minute turnaround times as with the INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and provide requisite quality control measures.

### Analysis of partial thromboplastin times in patients with pulmonary embolism during the first 48 hours of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin [^114vpaXr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to determine the proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) who achieved therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values within 48 hours of treatment.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a PE response team (PERT) database was performed at a large, urban, academic teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute PE for whom the PERT was consulted and who received anticoagulation (AC) with UFH according to guideline standard dosing. aPTT values during 6-hour time periods during the first 48 hours of AC were collected and analyzed.

Results

A total of 505 patients met inclusion criteria. For patients receiving a bolus and infusion of UFH, the proportions (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients in the therapeutic range were 19.0% (14.2% to 25.0%) at 12 hours, 26.3% (26.3% to 33.1%) at 24 hours, 28.3% (22.0% to 35.4%) at 36 hours, and 28.4% (20.8% to 37.5%) at 48 hours. For titrated infusion only, the proportions (95% CIs) of patients were 23.3% (16.2% to 32.3%) at 12 hours, 41.4% (31.6% to 51.9%) at 24 hours, 37.0% (26.8% to 48.5%) at 36 hours, and 42.1% (30.2% to 55.0%) at 48 hours. No patient had all therapeutic aPTT values.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with acute PE spend most of their first 48 hours outside of the therapeutic range of AC when treated with guideline standard dosing of UFH. Over half of the patients fail to achieve any therapeutic PTT level within 24 hours of UFH initiation, and no patient had all therapeutic aPTTs. Future research should focus on identifying factors associated with achieving therapeutic AC with UFH.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Monitoring Parameters

There are no FDA‐approved method to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time can be used as first‐line tests if evaluation for medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect as seen with INR for management of VKA therapy. Quantitative measures exist such as anti–factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time to directly assess anticoagulation effects. 90, 91 However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role, since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes. Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine (see Table 5). These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiation of a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or more frequent follow‐ups based on patient‐specific characteristics is recommended in provider plans.

Table 5
DOAC Laboratory Monitoring

In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, a comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach should include the following items assessed at each follow‐up:
Current health status.
Adherence and cost.
Bleeding/thromboembolic events.
Adverse effects.
Complete medication review for drug interactions.
Reassessment of appropriateness of therapy.
Repeat warranted laboratory parameters.
Continuing follow‐up appointments for patients.

### Opinions of practicing surgeons on the appropriateness of published indications for use of damage control surgery in trauma patients: an International cross-sectional survey [^111rrnpy]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Variation in use of damage control (DC) surgery across trauma centers may be partially driven by surgeon uncertainty as to when it is appropriately indicated. We sought to determine opinions of practicing surgeons on the appropriateness of published indications for trauma DC surgery.

Study Design

We asked 384 trauma centers in the United States, Canada, and Australasia to nominate 1 to 3 surgeons at their center to participate in a survey about DC surgery. We then asked nominated surgeons their opinions on the appropriateness (benefit-to-harm ratio) of 43 literature-derived indications for use of DC surgery in adult civilian trauma patients.

Results

In total, 232 (64.8%) trauma centers nominated 366 surgeons, of whom 201 (56.0%) responded. Respondents rated 15 (78.9%) preoperative and 23 (95.8%) intraoperative indications to be appropriate. Indications respondents agreed had the greatest expected benefit included a temperature < 34°C, arterial pH < 7.2, and laboratory-confirmed (international normalized ratio/prothrombin time and/or partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal) or clinically observed coagulopathy in the pre- or intraoperative setting; administration of > 10 units of packed red blood cells; requirement for a resuscitative thoracotomy in the emergency department; and identification of a juxtahepatic venous injury or devascularized or destroyed pancreas, duodenum, or pancreaticoduodenal complex during operation. Ratings were consistent across subgroups of surgeons with different training, experience, and practice settings.

Conclusions

We identified 38 indications that practicing surgeons agreed appropriately justified the use of DC surgery. Until further studies become available, these indications constitute a consensus opinion that can be used to guide practice in the current era of changing trauma resuscitation practices.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^1123TQJY]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guideline on coagulation disorders in cirrhosis — scope and key questions explains that the guideline provides recommendations on hemostasis of bleeding and on prevention and treatment of thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis and is accompanied by a technical review (TR) with systematic review and meta-analysis addressing the following: testing strategies for bleeding risk assessment; whether preprocedure prophylaxis to correct coagulation parameters and/or PLT level reduces bleeding; whether platelet transfusion should be used prophylactically; whether patients with cirrhosis should be screened for non tumoral portal vein thrombosis (PVT); what data exist on specific anticoagulant therapies for non tumoral PVT; and whether anticoagulation is safe and effective for patients with atrial fibrillation and cirrhosis.

### Paving the way for establishing a reference measurement system for standardization of plasma prothrombin time: harmonizing the manual tilt tube method [^115xYeq7]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Metrological traceability is defined as the "property of a measurement result whereby the result can be related to a stated reference through a documented unbroken chain of calibrations, each contributing to the measurement uncertainty". 12 The measurement uncertainty of the PT/INR results should remain within allowable specifications in order to be fit‐for‐clinical use. When the metrological traceability of the INR is considered, we should admit that the INR is not "measured" but is calculated from the patient's PT, the MNPT, and the ISI. Metrological traceability of the MNPT cannot be achieved, because the MNPT is defined with fresh local plasmas and there is no commonly accepted reference. 13 Traceability of the ISI can be achieved because there are commonly accepted references. A proposed traceability chain for ISI determination is shown in Figure 2. In this scheme, a single WHO International Standard for thromboplastin is used with the harmonized MTT as RMS. 14 Secondary standards must be calibrated with the RMS. Each calibration must be performed with fresh plasma samples from healthy ("normal") adults and from patients who are in the steady phase of VKA treatment. In the past, secondary standards have been calibrated in multicenter studies with 20 laboratories participating. It is likely that many participants of the earlier multicenter studies did not use a harmonized MTT. In the future, when the harmonized MTT has been adopted and validated, it may be possible to substantially reduce the number of centers participating in the calibration of secondary standards. It would have the additional advantage of economizing the use of the primary WHO International Standard. The traceability chain of the calibration may be modified by replacing fresh plasma samples by frozen or lyophilized samples if commutability of the latter has been established. One of the contributors to lack of agreement between results among different measurement procedures (MPs) is using noncommutable reference materials as calibrators in the calibration hierarchy for clinical laboratory (end‐user) MPs. 15 Recently, new guidelines have been published for assessing commutability of reference materials as calibrators. 15, 16, 17 Certified frozen or lyophilized plasmas may be used for local ISI calibration or direct INR determination by end users. 18 The certification (ie, value assignment to calibrator plasmas) is the responsibility of the manufacturer and should be performed by Joint Committee of Traceability in Laboratory Medicine‐listed reference laboratories. The measurement uncertainty of the PT/INR results should remain within allowable specifications to be fit for clinical use.

### Haemostatic profile of children with nephrotic syndrome attending university of Nigeria teaching hospital ituku-ozalla, Nigeria [^114ri3rv]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Antithrombin (AT)

The median values of AT were 141%, 142%, 144% and 131% in onset, relapse, remission and controls respectively. AT values did not differ significantly between various disease states when compared in pairs (p > 0.05).

Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)

The median APTT values were 43 s, 46 s, 46 s and 42 s in onset, relapse, remission and controls respectively. Three out of 7 (42.8%) children with onset and 7 out of 19 (36.8%) children in relapse had prolonged APTT while 4 of 20 (20%) children in remission had prolonged APTT. Median APTT values were longer in children with nephrotic syndrome in various disease states compared with controls, although no significant difference was observed (Group p = 0.148) Table 3.

Prothrombin time (PT)

The prothrombin time was the same in onset, relapse and remission. The difference between PT in various disease states compared with controls was significant (p = 0.024; Table 4). Seventy one percent of children with onset, 95% (19 out of 20) of children in remission and 95% (18 out of 19) of children in relapse had prothrombin time within normal reference range. Children with nephrotic syndrome had relatively shorter PT compared with controls (= 0.024; Table 4).

The median total time to fibrinogen result from the standard laboratory coagulation tests was 48 (40, 60) minutes, whereas the Quantra provided completed results within 12.3 (12.1, 12.4) minutes after the blood sample was inserted. The median within-patient difference between these two devices was 36 (28, 48) minutes.

By using a partial Pearson correlation adjusted for age, BMI, race and ethnicity, there was a high correlation between FCS and fibrinogen level with r = 0.67 (Fig. 2 A). When comparing PCS to platelet count, a moderate correlation was noted (r = 0.52) as shown in Fig. 2 B. CT showed a weak correlation to PTT (r = 0.38) (Fig. 2 C).

### Effects of mild hypothermia on blood coagulation in patients undergoing elective plastic surgery [^113wW9xZ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this prospective, controlled study was to evaluate the effects on coagulation function of active patient warming during elective plastic surgery.

Methods

Seventy-six patients undergoing elective plastic surgery (additive and reductive mastoplasty, rhinoplasty, and liposuction) were either covered with standard sterile drapes (control group, n = 38) or actively warmed during surgery with countercurrent fluid warming and forced-air skin warming (treatment group, n = 38). Complete evaluation of the coagulation activity was performed 1 hour before general anesthesia was induced and then at the end of surgery.

Results

Although no differences in preoperative core temperature were observed (36.0 ± 0.5 degrees C in the control group and 36.1 ± 0.4 degrees C in the treatment group; p = 0.12), core temperature was lower at the end of surgery in the control group (34 ± 1.0 degrees C) than in the treatment group (36 ± 0.6 degrees C) (p = 0.0005). No differences in prothrombin time and fibrinogen plasma concentrations were observed between the two groups. At the end of surgery, control group patients showed significantly larger activated partial thromboplastin times (36.8 ± 3.5 seconds) and bleeding times (8.1 ± 1.6 minutes) as compared with patients maintained normothermic during surgery (34.0 ± 2.9 seconds and 4.3 ± 1.1 minutes; p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0005, respectively).

Conclusion

Actively maintaining intraoperative normothermia allows patients to maintain normal coagulation function during elective plastic surgery lasting longer than 2 hours, potentially reducing the occurrence of bleeding-related complications after plastic surgery.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Laboratory tests used in the evaluation of hemostasis — The prothrombin time (PT) assesses the tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway and the activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) assesses the intrinsic pathway, but mild to moderate prolongation of these values has not been shown to predict bleeding risk in a nonbleeding patient; the International Normalized Ratio (INR) was developed to standardize warfarin monitoring and INR is calculated as PTR^ISI with a WHO standard that has an ISI of 1.0. Other tests include thrombin time, fibrinogen assay, and D‑dimer; D‑dimers are produced by plasmin acting on cross‑linked fibrin and are used to diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation or to aid in ruling out acute thrombosis. Various coagulopathies, anticoagulant medications, or liver disease can cause abnormalities on these tests, and the entire clinical picture must be taken into consideration to understand the patient's true bleeding risk.

### Avoid routine prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin… [^117MLTmF]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The 1989 Medical Necessity Project of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, endorsed by the American College of Physicians, found that at least 70% of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time tests were not clinically indicated. Subsequently, nine observational studies, including three prospective trials, reported that prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time positive predictive values for bleeding complications ranged from 0. 03 to
0. 22, whereas computed 95% confidence intervals for each assay generates a 2. 5% false-positive rate. A review of 27, 737 prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time results over two decades showed that only 8% of prothrombin times and partial thromboplastin times were clinically indicated based on current or prior patient history of bleeding. A study of general hospital unregulated coagulation screening requests produced few abnormal results with no evidence that they were associated with an increased bleeding risk.

In this study, all bleeding cases could be attributed to an underlying condition. The risk of intraoperative bleeding is best predicted from a careful history that includes a questionnaire-based bleeding assessment test.

### Tests of blood coagulation and hemostasis… [^115XoZ65]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Probably the most widely used of all clotting tests, Quick's prothrombin time 1 is perhaps the least well understood. Despite its name, we now know that the PT is relatively insensitive to prothrombin. The test measures the rate of conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of a tissue extract and calcium ions, followed by the polymerization of fibrinogen by thrombin to fibrin. The PT is influenced by the concentrations of four clotting factors besides prothrombin: I, V, VII, and X. In addition, heparin prolongs the PT, a point frequently overlooked in managing patients treated with anticoagulants. However, the sensitivity of the PT to many factors is the very reason that it is so useful clinically. In patients receiving anticoagulants orally, deficiencies develop in four clotting factors: prothrombin, VII, IX, and X.
