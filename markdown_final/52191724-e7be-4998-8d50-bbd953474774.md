## Question

Can a heterogeneous appearing thyroid gland on ultrasound images be seen in individuals without thyroid disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a heterogeneous-appearing thyroid gland on ultrasound can be seen in individuals without thyroid disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "heterogeneous" is defined sonographically and what a truly normal thyroid looks like. Then, I should verify whether any benign variants or technical artifacts can mimic heterogeneity. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence linking heterogeneity to thyroid disease, especially autoimmune thyroiditis. After that, I should check for any exceptions or edge cases where heterogeneity might occur without overt disease. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline practical next steps if heterogeneity is encountered on ultrasound.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: a normal thyroid gland on high-resolution ultrasound is typically homogeneous in echotexture, without focal or diffuse inhomogeneity, and this homogeneity is a key anchor for recognizing diffuse disease when it appears [^115ZBHf1].

> Wait, let me verify what "heterogeneous" connotes clinically. In thyroid ultrasound parlance, heterogeneity reflects a diffusely inhomogeneous echotexture that is most classically associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, where lymphocytic infiltration and architectural disruption produce patchy hypoechogenicity and micronodularity; this pattern is well described in both radiology and endocrinology literature and is often accompanied by positive thyroid antibodies and abnormal thyroid function, though not invariably [^117QGMzi] [^116xZmMN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could heterogeneity arise from benign variants or technical factors rather than disease? I need to check that. Authoritative reviews emphasize that the normal thyroid is homogeneous and that apparent heterogeneity should prompt evaluation for diffuse disease; while artifacts and suboptimal technique can degrade images, they do not typically create a true heterogeneous parenchymal pattern in a truly normal gland, so persistent heterogeneity on a well-performed study is not a normal variant [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the evidence quantifying the link between heterogeneity and thyroid disease. In a cohort of children with goiter, 74.8% had heterogeneous glands on ultrasound, and heterogeneity correlated with positive thyroid antibodies and higher TSH, reinforcing that heterogeneity tracks with autoimmune thyroiditis; similarly, in adults with Hashimoto thyroiditis, background heterogeneity is common and can exceed 50%, whereas it is far less frequent in antibody-negative individuals, underscoring its disease association rather than a normal variant [^1112pq6J] [^115TVdjd].

> But wait, what if heterogeneity appears in someone who is euthyroid with negative antibodies — does that negate disease? I should double-check that nuance. Structural changes in autoimmune thyroiditis can precede seroconversion or persist after seroreversion, so a heterogeneous gland may still reflect early or burnt-out autoimmune disease even when antibodies and TSH are normal at a single time point; this means heterogeneity without overt biochemical disease can occur, but it still signals underlying thyroid pathology rather than a normal state [^116xZmMN] [^114cf7Hy].

> I will now examine whether any credible sources describe a heterogeneous thyroid as a normal finding. Let me reconsider the baseline references: core ultrasound teaching and reviews consistently describe the normal thyroid as homogeneous; I do not find high-credibility sources that characterize heterogeneity as a normal sonographic appearance, which supports the conclusion that heterogeneity is not a feature of a truly normal gland [^115ZBHf1].

> Synthesis and clinical implication: Heterogeneity on thyroid ultrasound is not expected in individuals without thyroid disease; when present, it should be interpreted as abnormal parenchyma and prompts correlation with clinical history, thyroid function tests, and thyroid antibodies, with follow-up ultrasound if initial studies are equivocal or if the patient is high risk; this aligns with guideline-based practice to integrate sonographic findings with clinical and laboratory context rather than overcalling or ignoring them [^115ZBHf1] [^115KVv34] [^111UKVvF].

> Practical next steps if heterogeneity is seen: I need to ensure we do not overreact while still being thorough. Obtain or review thyroid function tests and TPO antibodies, assess for goiter or symptoms, and if the patient has risk factors or suspicious features, proceed with targeted ultrasound evaluation of nodules and cervical nodes; conversely, avoid reflex ultrasound for abnormal labs alone in the absence of clinical indications, to minimize overdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures [^113wowdY] [^112aFnq4] [^111MKgC7].

---

In sum, **a heterogeneous thyroid on ultrasound is not normal** and reflects underlying pathology such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multinodular goiter, or other diffuse disease [^117QGMzi] [^1115HuhJ]. A normal thyroid appears **homogeneous and isoechoic** to surrounding muscle on ultrasound [^115ZBHf1]. Heterogeneity warrants clinical correlation with thyroid function tests and antibodies, and further evaluation if indicated [^116xZmMN].

---

## Normal thyroid ultrasound appearance

On ultrasound, a normal thyroid gland has the following characteristics:

- **Echogenicity**: Homogeneous and isoechoic or slightly hyperechoic compared to adjacent strap muscles [^115ZBHf1] [^114pYwvw].

- **Texture**: Uniform echotexture without focal abnormalities or nodules [^115ZBHf1].

- **Size**: Typically 4–6 cm in length, 1–1.8 cm in width, and 1–2 cm in thickness, though size varies with age, sex, and body habitus [^notfound].

- **Vascularity**: Minimal to moderate on color Doppler, reflecting normal perfusion [^notfound].

---

## Definition of heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound

Heterogeneity refers to a **non-uniform echotexture**, with mixed echogenicity and irregular architecture [^notfound]. This pattern reflects diffuse parenchymal changes, such as lymphocytic infiltration, fibrosis, or nodularity, and is distinct from focal nodules or discrete lesions [^112WKWsE].

---

## Conditions associated with heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound

Several **thyroid conditions** are associated with heterogeneous ultrasound findings:

| **Condition** | **Ultrasound features** |
|-|-|
| Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) | - Diffuse heterogeneous echotexture <br/> - Hypoechoic <br/> - Micronodular pattern <br/> - Increased vascularity in early stages [^117QGMzi] [^115TVdjd] |
| Multinodular goiter | - Multiple nodules of varying sizes <br/> - Mixed echogenicity <br/> - Irregular gland contour [^1123oZXo] |
| Graves' disease | - Diffuse heterogeneous echotexture <br/> - Hypervascularity ("thyroid inferno" sign) [^113ZKt6Y] |
| Subacute thyroiditis | - Patchy hypoechoic areas <br/> - Heterogeneous echotexture <br/> - Absence of nodules [^1115HuhJ] |
| Thyroid carcinoma (papillary, follicular) | - Heterogeneous echotexture <br/> - Hypoechoic nodules <br/> - Irregular margins <br/> - Microcalcifications [^112G23bH] |

---

## Prevalence of heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound findings

Heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound findings are common in clinical practice, especially in populations with autoimmune thyroid disease or iodine deficiency. Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects **approximately 1–2% of the general population**, with higher prevalence in women and older adults [^notfound]. Multinodular goiter is common in iodine-deficient regions, with prevalence estimates ranging from 5–10% in some populations [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound

Heterogeneous thyroid ultrasound findings are clinically significant because they often indicate underlying thyroid pathology, warranting further evaluation. The clinical implications include:

- **Autoimmune thyroid disease**: Heterogeneity is a hallmark of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, often associated with hypothyroidism and positive thyroid antibodies [^117QGMzi] [^116xZmMN].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Heterogeneous echotexture correlates with thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism [^1112pq6J].

- **Increased risk of malignancy**: Heterogeneous glands may harbor nodules with suspicious features, necessitating careful evaluation and possible biopsy [^112G23bH] [^112PYsD4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **correlating ultrasound findings with clinical context, thyroid function tests, and serologic markers**. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) recommend obtaining thyroid ultrasound in patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules or diffuse thyroid disease, and using standardized risk stratification systems (e.g. ACR TI-RADS, EU-TIRADS) to guide management decisions [^117BQi5Q] [^113wowdY].

---

## Conclusion

A heterogeneous thyroid gland on ultrasound is **not normal** and indicates underlying pathology, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, multinodular goiter, or thyroiditis. Heterogeneity reflects diffuse parenchymal changes and requires clinical correlation with thyroid function tests, serologic markers, and clinical context. Current clinical guidelines recommend standardized risk stratification and appropriate follow-up or intervention based on ultrasound findings and clinical suspicion [^116dV7gT] [^112NbJkF].

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^112PYsD4]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

### Thyroid computed tomography imaging: pictorial review of variable pathologies [^113Hjgbn]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Although the correlation between thyroid nodule size and malignancy risk is limited, nodule size affects prognosis in malignant nodules. Small thyroid cancers (less than 2 cm) tend to have an indolent course, with favourable prognosis even if not treated. Less than 7% of the imaging-detected ITNs are seen in younger populations. However, Shetty et al. found a higher rate of malignancy in the ITNs detected on CT scans among patients younger than 35 years. Ito et al. found a higher tumour progression risk among young patients (< 40 years) with subclinical, low-risk PTCs who undergo observation rather than surgery. Therefore, nodule size and patient age should determine the need for workup in the general population without suspicious imaging features and with normal life expectancy. Further evaluation with ultrasound is required for patients less than 35 years old with nodules measuring more than 1 cm in the axial plane. The cutoff size for further evaluation is raised to 1.5 cm for patients more than 35 years old. This recommendation should be applied to the largest thyroid nodule in cases of multiple thyroid nodules. Incidentally discovered heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid glands should undergo dedicated ultrasound if the patient has no limited life expectancy or serious comorbidities.

### Sonographic appearance of thyroid cancer in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis [^115TVdjd]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the sonographic appearance of thyroid cancer differs in patients with and without Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Methods

Patients with histologically proven thyroid cancer who had thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies measured and sonography performed preoperatively were included. We evaluated each nodule for size, echogenicity, composition, margins, halo, and vascularity and evaluated the background heterogeneity of the gland.

Results

There were 162 thyroid cancers in 145 patients. Forty-two patients (29.0%) had Hashimoto thyroiditis with positive TPO antibodies, and 103 patients (71.0%) had negative TPO antibodies. The background echogenicity was more often heterogeneous in TPO antibody-positive patients compared to those who had negative TPO antibodies (57.1% versus 26.2%; p = 0.0005). Comparing cancers in TPO antibody-positive to TPO antibody-negative patients, there was no significant difference in the size, echogenicity, composition, margins, halo presence, calcification presence and type, or vascularity of the cancerous nodule (P > .05). Among TPO antibody-positive patients, comparing thyroid cancerous nodules in patients with heterogeneous glands to those with homogeneous glands, there was no significant difference in any sonographic characteristic except the margin of the nodule, which was more often irregular or poorly defined in heterogeneous glands and more often smooth in homogeneous glands (P < .05).

Conclusions

Sonographic features of thyroid cancer are similar in patients with and without Hashimoto thyroiditis. Among patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and thyroid cancer, the sonographic appearance of the cancerous nodule is similar, except that cancerous nodule margins are more likely to be irregular or poorly defined when the gland is heterogeneous.

### Thyroid ultrasound: diffuse and nodular disease [^1136p5x2]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound with gray-scale and color Doppler is the most helpful imaging modality to differentiate normal thyroid parenchyma from diffuse or nodular thyroid disease by evaluating glandular size, echogenicity, echotexture, margins, and vascularity. The various causes of diffuse thyroid disease often have overlapping sonographic imaging features. Thyroid nodules may be hyperplastic or neoplastic, with most due to benign hyperplastic changes in architecture and benign follicular adenomas; only a small percentage are malignant. A systematic approach to nodule morphology that includes evaluation of composition, echogenicity, margin, shape, and any echogenic foci can guide decision to biopsy or follow nodules.

Background

High-resolution ultrasound is considered the best imaging technique for evaluating the thyroid gland, as it is accessible, non-invasive, and highly sensitive concerning the detection and characterization of thyroid nodules. However, a background knowledge of the normal ultrasound anatomy of the thyroid gland, adjacent structures, and its anatomical variants is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis in daily practice. Through this pictorial review, we intend to.

### Imaging "Thyroiditis": a primer for radiologists [^1168Csdg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

A variety of inflammatory disorders, generically classified as "thyroiditis", can affect the thyroid gland diffusely, generating distinctive radiographic patterns. While a precise diagnosis can seldom be made based on sonographic appearance alone, interpreting these patterns in the correct clinical and biochemical context will help support the most appropriate diagnosis. We believe that the generic term "thyroiditis" is often not helpful and often may be incorrect. Therefore, it is important for radiologists to understand the sonographic and functional correlations to provide the most appropriate differential diagnosis in their reports. This brief review is designed to provide information and guidance for radiologists when dealing with various thyroid disorders which cause diffuse changes in the thyroid and underline the pitfalls most often encountered in clinical practice.

Fig. 4
47-Year-old male with PTC in left thyroid lobe (arrow). The image illustrates incorrect placement of calipers for measurement of size (distances A and B on the image) of the PTC. Distance A and distance B have been measured in the plane of the thyroid gland, whereas ACR TI-RADS describes measurements should be recorded along the orientation of the nodule, i.e. axes of maximum dimension of the nodule in the transverse image and maximum dimension perpendicular to the first measurement. The two lines drawn perpendicular to one another in the image represent the accurate technique for measuring size of nodules. Inaccurate placement of calipers for measuring a PTC on AS at baseline or follow-up may lead to false impression of progression and discontinuation of AS

Apart from interobserver variability and accurate placement of calipers for reassessing size of nodule, there are other factors which may hinder accurate nodule size measurement at follow-up.

Background thyroid parenchyma

The echogenicity of the thyroid gland is normally higher than that of the adjacent strap muscles. The majority of micropapillary carcinomas and PTCs < 2 cm are well-defined nodules and manifest as hypoechoic echogenicity compared to the background thyroid parenchyma, which allows precise caliper placement and accurate nodule size measurement at baseline and follow-up. However, in the setting of thyroiditis the background thyroid parenchyma is altered and may have a diffusely heterogenous echotexture. A decrease in thyroid echogenicity with inflammatory hypoechoic areas in the setting of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or Grave's disease can therefore lead to loss of conspicuity of nodule margins and limit accurate reproducible measurements of thyroid nodules (Fig. 5). This makes it even more critical in patients on AS where a size discrepancy of 3 mm in any one plane at follow-up can lead to a false interpretation of disease progression and discontinuation of AS. Therefore, PTCs in patients with thyroiditis and heterogenous background thyroid echogenicity should be assessed carefully to evaluate eligibility for AS.

The background thyroid parenchyma has a heterogenous echotexture which leads to loss of conspicuity of nodule margin and therefore limits accurate measurement of the nodule. PTCs in patients with thyroiditis and heterogenous background thyroid echogenicity should be assessed carefully to evaluate eligibility for AS

Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and Hürthle cell tumors — US appearance of follicular thyroid cancers (FTCs) is frequently different from PTCs because the classic signs of malignancy may be absent, with hypoechogenicity seen only in a minority (30–35%) of FTCs and a hypoechoic halo reported in up to 87% of FTCs; microcalcifications are reported in only 5 to 20% of cases, and most FTCs are solid tumors but a partially cystic component is more frequent (up to 18%) than in PTC (about 4–6%). These characteristics are shared by both benign and malignant follicular lesions, but the presence of hypoechogenicity, the irregular thickness of the peripheral halo, and the large size are suggestive of an FTC. Hürthle cell neoplasms present with a heterogeneous appearance, the echogenicity is usually reduced but hyperechoic tumors are not rare, vascular organization may range from intense and diffuse to scarce, and similar to FTCs, a large size, irregular margins with an irregularly thickened halo, and an inhomogeneous solid texture are common findings.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^112G23bH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound and sonographic risk-stratification systems

Thyroid ultrasonography (US) is the first-line tool for thyroid imaging. The thyroid gland is superficial in the neck, with the posterior border usually located less than 4 cm below the skin surface. High-resolution linear probes provide excellent image definition of the gland. The examination is safe and painless, requires no preparation, and can be performed rapidly in different care settings. To characterize thyroid nodules and obtain an initial estimate of their risk for malignancy, the examiner should focus on the echogenicity of the nodule; its composition (solid, cystic, mixed), shape, and margins; the presence within the nodule of calcifications or other hyperechoic foci; and the characteristics of all cervical lymph nodes. Findings consistently associated with malignancy include hypoechogenicity; infiltrative, irregular, or lobulated margins; intranodular microcalcifications; and a taller-than-wide shape. In addition to the nodule itself, all US studies must include a thorough exploration of all cervical lymph node compartments, and the presence of any suspicious lymph nodes should be noted. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these features vary, and no single feature has proved capable of reliably distinguishing malignant lesions from those that are benign. In addition, recognition and reporting of these features are characterized by substantial interobserver and even intraobserver variability.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood, treatment or only follow-up? [^114yBAKw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Mean baseline TSH concentrations differed among the 3 groups (p = 0.012), significant differences were found in TSH values between G1 and G3 (F = 4.768; p = 0.016) whereas no differences were found between G1 and G2 or between G2 and G3. No differences were found in fT4 concentrations at baseline among the 3 groups (F = 3.083; p = 0.053) (Fig. 1). The percentage change of TSH at follow-up with respect to baseline was 47.8% decrease in group 1, a 6.9% decrease in group 2 and a 24.7% increase in group 3 (Table 2).

Fig. 1
TSH values at baseline and follow-up. Patients were classified into three groups according TSH levels at the end of the follow up. Group 1 (G1): TSH ≤ 5μUI/mL (n: 44); Group 2 (G2): TSH 5–10μUI/mL, normal fT4 and negative TPOAb/TgAb (n: 14); Group 3 (G3): suitable for thyroxin therapy due to TSH ≥ 10μUI/mL or TSH 5–10μUI/mL and positive TPOAb/TgAb (n: 7)

BMI evolution was evaluated during the study and no significant difference was found in obesity (BMI-SD > 2) prevalence during follow-up in all patients (13,8 to 10.7%). In terms of height there were no differences.

Thyroid autoimmunity was observed in 85% of patients of G3 and none of G1 and G2 (p > 0.001). The risk of developing overt hypothyroidism in patients with positive anti-thyroid antibodies with respect to those who normalized TSH was 45 (95%CI 6.5–312.5).

Of all the patients, 35,3% underwent a thyroid ultrasound and a structure suggestive of thyroiditis (heterogeneous, hypoechoic and in some cases enlarged ultrasound pattern) was found in 6 patients, all in the G3. There was 1 patient with nodules on ultrasound without other significant findings; the rest of the patients presented a normal ultrasound.

### Diagnostic use of ultrasonography in patients with nodular thyroid disease [^1133Sh4E]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published reports pertaining to the diagnostic utility of ultrasonography for evaluation of thyroid nodules.

Methods

Various roles for diagnostic thyroid ultrasonography and screening ultrasound studies of the thyroid are discussed, and ultrasound characteristics of thyroid nodules and their association with malignant potential are described.

Results

In two studies that correlated ultrasound findings with physical examination findings in patients with a solitary thyroid nodule detected by palpation, 16% of such patients had no corresponding nodule evident on ultrasonography, and 45% of such patients had an additional nodule detected by ultrasonography. Similarly, approximately 18% of patients with a palpable multinodular thyroid had no nodules larger than 1 cm in diameter on ultrasound studies. Thyroid nodules larger than 1 cm have been found by ultrasonography to be present in from 2 to almost 5% of the population with normal findings on examination of the thyroid. Use of screening ultrasound study of the thyroid has been suggested for patients with a history of childhood irradiation to the head and neck or a family history of thyroid cancer. Numerous investigations that have evaluated ultrasound features of thyroid nodules have suggested five characteristics as suggestive of malignant potential — hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular or microlobulated border, absent or irregular thick halo, and increased intranodular vascularity.

Conclusion

Correlation of ultrasound and palpation findings will provide a comprehensive evaluation of nodular thyroid disease. Moreover, real-time ultrasonography facilitates characterization of features associated with an increased risk of a malignant lesion. High-resolution thyroid ultrasonography is a dynamic tool for endocrinologists.

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: a review [^112KELhd]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Observations

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with 1 or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended for nodules at least 1.5 cm in patients 35 years or older and for nodules at least 1.0 cm in patients younger than 35 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only a few select incidental thyroid nodules require further evaluation with ultrasonography based on recommendations that aim to diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers while reducing unnecessary workup and provide guidance for clinical practice.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^112sqzP7]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

Thyroid nodule echogenicity — malignancy risk metrics: "Most thyroid carcinomas present as hypoechoic solid lesions, but notably, about half of benign thyroid nodules share the same US appearance". Thus, "hypoechogenicity in a solid thyroid nodule is a sensitive (80–85%), yet poorly specific (15–25%), predictor of malignancy". "Marked hypoechogenicity — defined as a US texture that appears darker than the prethyroid muscles — provides a relevant risk of malignancy with a reported positive predictive value (PPV) up to 94%", while interobserver variability is acknowledged as a limitation of echogenicity assessment.

### Ultrasound in active surveillance for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer: imaging considerations in case selection and disease surveillance [^112p5bAZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) of small, low-risk papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) is increasingly studied in prospective observational studies. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for case selection. While researchers have put forward selection criteria for PTCs based on size, absence of suspicious lymph nodes and tumor location, there are limited reported data highlighting inherent ultrasound limitations and guidelines for case selection and follow-up. We report our experience including imaging limitations encountered in the ongoing AS prospective observational study for PTCs measuring < 2 cm at our institute. We define disease progression as an increase in size of > 3 mm in the largest dimension of nodule or evidence of metastatic disease or extrathyroidal extension. Accurate, consistent and reproducible measurements of PTCs are essential in risk stratifying patients for the option of AS or disease progression. Interobserver discrepancy, shadowing from coarse calcification and background parenchyma heterogeneity or thyroiditis can limit accurate PTC size assessment and therefore hinder patient eligibility evaluation or AS follow-up. Following the ACR Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) protocol of three-axes technique to measure a thyroid nodule enables reproducibility of measurements. In patients with multi-nodular goiter, accurate identification and labeling of the PTC is important to avoid mistaking with adjacent benign nodules at follow-up. Ultrasound assessment for extrathyroid extension of PTC, and relationship of PTC to trachea and the anatomic course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve are important considerations in evaluation for AS eligibility.

Goiter

A goiter is an abnormal thyroid gland proliferation that manifests as multi-nodular, uni-nodular, or non-nodular diffuse glandular enlargement. A goiter is formed of solid matrix, colloid cysts, blood products, calcification, and fibrosis, and this heterogeneity may lead to variable appearances on a CT scan (Figs. 13, 14 and 15). US is more sensitive in evaluating thyroid nodules within a goiter; however, a symptomatic goiter may require surgical treatment with total thyroidectomy, and in this case CT plays an additional role in preoperative evaluation. Specific aspects for examination on a CT scan during the preoperative evaluation for goiter include extension, mass effect, and suspicious features of malignancy.

### The thyroid incidentaloma – ignore or investigate? [^116uBZjM]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential importance and need for further investigation of thyroid lesions detected during imaging investigations unrelated to the thyroid gland (thyroid incidentalomas). The management of these lesions is controversial because most malignancies detected will be papillary microcarcinomas, which will not manifest as overt disease.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed, including the MEDLINE (1951 to date) and EMBASE (1974 to date) databases, using the Dialog DataStar and PubMed search engines and the Cochrane database.

Results

Relevant studies were reviewed, together with consensus documents, looking at the prevalence of thyroid incidentalomas and associated malignancy and the use of ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination in further investigation of incidentalomas.

Conclusions

The management and importance of the thyroid incidentaloma remain controversial, although problems relating to these issues are likely to become increasingly common in radiologic practice. Once an incidentaloma has been observed, formal clinical and sonographic assessment should be considered, with fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination as appropriate, after an informed discussion with patient.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodules — ultrasound (US) indications and objectives: High-resolution US is the most sensitive test available for detecting thyroid nodules, measuring their dimensions, identifying their content, and evaluating any associated changes in the thyroid gland. If results of palpation are normal, US should be performed when a thyroid nodule is suspected on clinical grounds or risk factors have been recognized. In all patients with palpable thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters (MNGs), US should be performed to achieve the following: aid in the diagnosis of diffuse causes (e.g., chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), look for coincidental thyroid nodules or diffuse thyroid gland changes, detect US features suggestive of malignancy and select the lesions for biopsy, assess the presence of extracapsular growth or suspicious lymph nodes, and obtain an objective measure of the baseline volume of the thyroid gland and of lesions assigned to follow-up or nonsurgical therapy.

### The incidental thyroid nodule [^114wxKwK]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidental thyroid nodules that are found on an imaging study performed for reasons other than thyroid pathology represent a common scenario encountered by health care providers. The initial workup for these nodules comprises a thorough history and physical examination, thyroid function tests, a dedicated thyroid ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration of any suspicious lesions. Management ranges from observation and reassurance to surgical resection and depends on the cytologic diagnosis. In cases of cytologically indeterminate or discordant nodules, surgical excision (lobectomy) offers a definitive diagnosis, although molecular testing or a reasonable period of observation may be useful as less invasive adjuncts.

Thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) epidemiology — prevalence, ultrasound detection, cancer risk, and incidence trends — are described: the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is approximately 5% in women and 1% in men in iodine-sufficient regions, while high-resolution ultrasound (US) can detect thyroid nodules in 19%–68% of randomly selected individuals. Thyroid cancer occurs in 7%–15% of thyroid nodules, and DTC comprises the vast majority (> 90%) of all thyroid cancers. In the United States, approximately 63,000 new thyroid cancer cases were predicted for 2014 compared with 37,200 in 2009, and the incidence has nearly tripled from 4.9 per 100,000 in 1975 to 14.3 per 100,000 in 2009. Tumor size distribution shifted, with 25% of new thyroid cancers ≤ 1 cm in 1988–1989 compared with 39% in 2008–2009, and one study predicts papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) will become the third most common cancer in women by 2019 at a cost of $19–21 billion in the United States.

Incidental thyroid findings on CT scan

The thyroid gland can have variable CT scan findings, such as calcifications, single or multiple nodules, cysts, or diffuse enlargement.

Thyroid calcifications on a CT scan can be seen in both benign and malignant thyroid lesions. Sonographic examination of the thyroid can differentiate between micro-calcifications, which are highly associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and eggshell calcifications, which favour a benign process such as colloid cysts (Figs. 1 and 2). In a retrospective review of preoperative CT scan, 35% (135 of 383) of the patients had detectable intra-thyroidal calcifications. Among them, 48% had a histopathologically proven thyroid cancer. Calcified nodules had a significantly higher incidence of thyroid cancer and lymph node metastases. The incidence of thyroid cancer among nodules with different calcifications patterns were 79% of nodules with multiple punctate calcifications, 58% of nodules with a single punctate calcification, 21% of nodules with coarse calcification, and 22% of nodules with peripheral calcification. Most of the single calcified nodules were malignant. However, this did not include patients with ITNs and the sample is skewed towards malignancy. Another study evaluated the presence of ITNs on CT scans and found that 12% of thyroid nodules were calcified, with no significant correlation between malignant or potentially malignant histology and punctate calcifications. As a result, some researchers believe that calcification per se is not a suspicious CT sign, and have suggested that calcified thyroid nodules on CT scans should be treated the same as non-calcified nodules.

Thyroid nodule size and growth — surveillance and risk considerations: Currently, about 50% of cytologic diagnoses of thyroid malignancy relate to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) ≤ 10 mm in diameter. Even when size does not predict benign versus malignant, consideration should be given that the risk of cancer is slightly higher in nodules > 4 cm, and a large size (> 4 cm) is a risk factor for a more advanced stage in differentiated thyroid carcinoma. During follow-up, the appearance of suspicious changes at ultrasound (US) examination should prompt repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Growth is not synonymous with malignancy because benign hyperplastic nodules may have a slow constant growth, whereas PTMC may be stable for years, and rapid growth is observed only in rare aggressive tumors and is usually associated with major US and clinical signs of aggressiveness. Rather than a sign of malignancy, steady nodule growth is a relevant issue when deciding an appropriate shift to active clinical management, and US monitoring is critical for assessing the response to nonsurgical therapies. Measurement of the major nodule diameter is of limited value and should not be considered a reliable index due to interobserver variability quantified in about 20%.

### Prevalence of thyroid nodules and characteristics of thyroid ultrasound in children with goiter: a single center experience [^117FSGoV]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Goiter is a common presenting sign of various thyroid diseases in children. Thyroid nodules are clinically and/or radiologically significant findings due to their high malignancy rate. The ultrasound (US) characteristics of pediatric patients with goiter are rarely reported in literature; thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the characteristics of thyroid US and the prevalence of thyroid nodules in pediatric patients with goiter.

Methods

A retrospective review of children and adolescents under the age of 18 (2015–2020) referred for neck ultrasound due to goiter in clinical examination.

Results

A total of 262 patients were included with a mean age of 13.77 ± 3.7 years. Thyroid antibodies were positive in 119/262 (45.4%) patients. Thyroid US reported to be abnormal in 210/262 (80%) patients. Thyroid nodule were found in 33.6% (n = 88/262) of patients with goiter and in 41.9% (n = 88/210) of patients with abnormal thyroid US result. Patients with positive antibodies had more of heterogeneity and hypervascularity of the gland on thyroid US (P < 0.001). On the other hand, thyroid nodules were more likely to be presented in patients with negative thyroid antibodies (P = 0.025). The heterogeneity within the thyroid positive group was significantly correlated with increasing TPOAb (P < 0.001) and TSH levels (P < 0.028). Heterogeneity on US had a positive predictive value (P = 0.041), while hypervascularity had low prediction for thyroid nodules (P = 0.022). Age, gender, family history of thyroid diseases, antibodies status and echogenicity in US did not show any significant associations with thyroid nodules. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in six patients and one of these patients was positive for thyroid antibodies.

Conclusion

Thyroid nodules are quite common in our population. Thyroid nodules were significantly associated with heterogeneity in US. Although, no clinical or biochemical factors could predict the presence of thyroid nodules on thyroid US in our cohort, the absence of thyroid antibodies should lower the threshold for performing thyroid US.

### Study of the ultrasound appearance of the normal parathyroid using an intraoperative procedure [^116SFe4v]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to confirm the echogenicity of normal parathyroid glands using intraoperative ultrasound (US).

Methods

Between October 2015 and January 2016, normal parathyroid glands were examined with an intraoperative US transducer during thyroidectomy procedures in 13 patients with thyroid disease. According to the findings from intraoperative US, routine percutaneous US of normal parathyroid glands was performed in a group of adults. On the basis of previous information on normal parathyroid echogenicity, a series of parathyroid diseases that were proved by surgery and histopathologic analyses were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of residual normal parathyroid in the lesion on US imaging, which was defined as the residual parathyroid sign in this study, was reviewed and correlated with histopathologic results.

Results

In the intraoperative US group, 23 parathyroid glands were scanned intraoperatively, and 21 (91.3%) were hyperechoic, homogeneous in texture, and oval. In the routine percutaneous US group, 106 parathyroid glands were found in total, and 96 (90.5%) of the glands had hyperechoic and homogeneous echogenicity, with 75 (70.8%) being oval. In the review of parathyroid diseases, 33 parathyroid glands in 30 cases were reviewed, with a positive residual parathyroid sign in 7 (21.2%) parathyroid glands, presenting with a hyperechoic rim in the margin, and 4 of them (12.1%) were confirmed by histopathologic results.

Conclusions

The normal parathyroid had hyperechoic echogenicity on both intraoperative and percutaneous US imaging. Residual tissue of parathyroid glands can also be observed in some parathyroid abnormalities with an echogenic appearance on US imaging and confirmed by histopathologic results.

On the other hand, neck ultrasounds are frequently performed for diffuse goiter or non-thyroid conditions. Yet, an ultrasound is not required to make a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis and small cysts and nodules discovered incidentally often lead to unjustified concerns about neoplasia.

Thyroid cancers

Epidemiology

Primary thyroid carcinomas include papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic carcinomas. Lymphoma and metastasis of other primary malignancies to the thyroid gland represent a minority of thyroid carcinomas. Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) originate from follicular epithelial cells and encompass PTCs and follicular thyroid carcinomas, including the Hurthle cell variant of follicular carcinoma. DTCs have an excellent prognosis and fortunately represent the majority of thyroid carcinomas. PTCs and follicular thyroid carcinomas represent 88% and 8%, respectively, of all thyroid malignancies. Medullary thyroid carcinoma arises from neuroendocrine C-cells and has a good prognosis. Anaplastic carcinoma is an aggressive undifferentiated tumour that usually affects the elderly and tends to have a worse prognosis.

Role of imaging

Surgery is the primary mode of treatment for DTCs. Post total thyroidectomy radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is an option, especially in patients with distant metastasis, tumours larger than 4 cm, or extra-thyroidal disease extension. Ultrasound examination is usually adequate in evaluating primary tumours and cervical lymph nodes. Preoperative cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is indicated if there is a concern for local invasion that may alter the patient's staging as well as surgical approach (Figs. 4, 5 and 6). Some thyroid primaries may be small, diffuse, or multifocal and therefore may be occult on imaging (Fig. 4).

### Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^116XUpdQ]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tin the general population, and their detection is increasing with the widespread use of ultrasound (US). The prevalence of thyroid nodularity varies from 19% to 67%, and increases with age, affecting about 50% of the population older than 40 years of age. The clinical significance of thyroid nodules relates to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is found in 5–15% of cases, depending on sex, age, and exposure to other risk factors. The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased about fivefold in the last 50 years, mostly due to small papillary thyroid cancers, the most indolent form of thyroid cancer.

Some US parameters, such as microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, absence of a halo, increased intranodular vascularity, nodule shape or irregular margins, have been traditionally associated with increased risk of malignancies. However, none of these characteristics seems sufficiently reliable in isolation to diagnose malignancy. Diagnostic sensitivity ranges from 26.5% to 87.1% for hypoechogenicity, 54.3% to 74.3% for intranodular vascularity, and 26.1% to 59.1% for microcalcifications, whereas specificity ranges from 43.4% to 94.3%, 78.6% to 80.8%, and 85.8% to 95%, respectively. More recently, US determination of tissue elasticity (elastography) has been suggested to detect malignancy in thyroid nodules. A meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90% using this technique. However, only a few studies were included, and only three used histopathology of surgical specimens for final diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is considered the most accurate procedure to identify malignant nodules. To implement biopsies in all patients harboring a thyroid nodule is too burdensome, and the results of FNA have some limitations. The indications are broad and vague, and usually include patients with a family history of thyroid cancer, or those who have had significant radiation exposure, or those who have a combination of suspicious US features. However, there is no information about the probability of the US features associated with malignancy and which combination would be more clinically useful. US features may be also useful in clinical decision making for patients with FNA specimens insufficient for diagnosis (10%) or where specimens are indeterminate (15–30%), the latter carrying a 20–30% risk of malignancy. A recent meta-analysis evaluating the accuracy of US to predict malignancy in thyroid nodules found sensitivities ranging from 26% to 87%, and specificities from 40% to 93%. In this study, a taller than wide shape showed the highest diagnostic odds ratio (OR) for cancer. However, that meta-analysis included studies that used cytology, instead of histology, as a final diagnosis for benign nodules. Besides, it did not evaluate the accuracy of elastography to predict malignancy. Moreover, there was no description of the probability — likelihood ratio — of US characteristics associated with malignancy. The likelihood ratio would provide more information to be used in the clinical decision making of thyroid nodules than just sensitivity and specificity.

Results

The sample consisted of 262 patients (mean age ± SD 13.77 ± 3.8 years, 84.4% (n = 221) were female). They were referred for thyroid US between 2015 and 2020 due to a clinical finding of goiter. The antibody status was positive in 45.4% (n = 119/262) of patients. The mean TSH level was 8.03 ± 31.62 IU/L (Table 1). US results were abnormal in 80.2% (n = 210/262) of patients while all sonographic parameters were normal in 19.8% (n = 52/262). Thyroid gland was found to be heterogeneous in 74.8% (n = 157/210), homogenous in 20% (n = 42/210), and it was not documented in 5.2% (n = 11/210). In relation to echogenicity, the gland was hypoechoic in 5.7% (n = 12/210), hyperechoic in 1% (n = 2/210), and normal in 93.3% (n = 196/210). In terms of vascularity, the thyroid gland appeared hypervascular, hypovascular, and normal in 64.8% (n = 136/210), 1.4% (n = 3/210) and 33.8% (71/210), respectively. Thyroid nodules were found in 41.9% (n = 88/210) of patients with abnormal US result and in 33.6% (n = 88/262) of patients with goiters. In the regression analysis of 88 patients with thyroid nodules in thyroid US, the likelihood of the presence of nodules was four times greater in heterogeneous glands and significantly lower in hypervascular glands (P = 0.022, OR 0.222, 95% CI: 0.061–0.806)(Table 2).

### Prevalence of thyroid nodules and characteristics of thyroid ultrasound in children with goiter: a single center experience [^114cf7Hy]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Whilst thyroid nodules have been previously reported in 13% of children and adolescents with goiter, the 33% prevalence rate reported in this study is similar to that of another large, multicenter study with thyroid nodules detected in 31.5% of patients with autoimmunity. In our cohort, the prevalence of thyroid nodules was detected in 26.5% of patients with positive thyroid antibodies. The slightly higher prevalence of thyroid nodules in our cohort could be attributed to an increased rate of iodine deficiency among Saudis, which has been reported to affect a quarter of Saudi school-children in a national study, with the southern region of Saudi Arabia being the lowest urinary iodine concentration. Iodine deficiency has been linked to the incidence of thyroid nodules and other thyroid conditions. As our community has a high rate of consanguinity marriage, another explanation for the high frequency of thyroid nodules in our cohort could be related to the genetic predisposition; a family history of various thyroid illnesses was recorded in 41% of our patients, which is a well-known risk factor for thyroid nodules. Our cohort included cases with a clinical diagnosis of goiter, which may further explain the high prevalence of thyroid nodules.

Although thyroid nodules were likelier to occur in patients with negative thyroid antibodies, antibody status did not predict the presence of thyroid nodules in our cohort. Heterogeneity in the US was associated with a higher risk of thyroid nodules. However, age, gender, family history of thyroid diseases, and echogenicity in thyroid US did not show significant associations. Heterogeneity in the US is a common finding in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. In our cohort, positive antibodies were associated with a high prevalence of heterogeneity, hypervascularity, and normal echogenicity. In addition, heterogeneity was positively associated with TPO and TSH levels. This finding is inconsistent with other reports from previous studies on pediatrics and adults with AT. AT is a potential risk factor for thyroid nodules, antibody status was not a contributing factor in our cohort and this could be explained by the fact that patients who were negative for antibodies could have AT with normal antibodies, giving that antibodies fluctuate over time during the course of thyroid disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, more specifically with respect to follow-up evaluation, indeterminate by FNA, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to repeat ultrasound at 12–24 months in patients with thyroid nodules with low-to-intermediate suspicion ultrasound pattern. Consider repeating FNA or obtain observation continued with repeat ultrasound, with repeat FNA in case of continued growth, in case of ultrasound evidence of growth (20% increase in at least 2 nodule dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm or > 50% change in volume) or development of new suspicious ultrasound features.

### It's not all about the thyroid! extrinsic and unusual pathology affecting the thyroid gland: a pictorial review [^116JWQuP]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a growing epidemic of thyroid nodules, commonly detected as incidental imaging findings. The vast majority of nodules are benign and of primary thyroidal origin. However, a multitude of non-native, extrinsic or systemic conditions may affect the thyroid and mimic primary thyroid nodules. Contributing factors may include the glands' location in an anatomically dense area, rich vascular and lymphatic network, and embryological origin. In this article we describe a variety of extrinsic and unusual pathology which can affect the thyroid gland. Conditions are classified into benign congenital, benign acquired, cancers which secondarily involve the thyroid gland and unusual cancers arising from within the gland itself. The imaging findings, primarily on high-resolution ultrasound, are reviewed and illustrated with examples. Where possible, imaging features which suggest a specific pathological category or entity are highlighted. It is important that those performing ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland are aware that thyroid nodules may not exclusively represent pathology native or intrinsic to the gland itself.

Introduction

The thyroid gland is the most affected organ by autoimmune diseases. Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) represents the foremost prevalent endocrine disorder and the principal cause of hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of HT requires an evaluation including clinical features, serological detection of antibodies against thyroid antigens, such as thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin, and characteristic findings on thyroid ultrasound. Anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) emerge as the best serologic hallmark for establishing an HT diagnosis due to their specificity and sensitivity. TPOab are detectable in nearly 95% of HT patients while rare in healthy controls, in contrast to anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tgab), antibodies against the most abundant protein on the thyroid gland, which are positive in approximately 60 − 70% of patients (less sensitive) and are also present in a higher number and proportion of healthy controls (less specific).

Hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's disease becomes more common with advancing age, with a predilection for women and individuals with concomitant autoimmune conditions. Clinical hypothyroidism is defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations surpassing the reference range alongside decreased free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations, while subclinical hypothyroidism delineates TSH concentrations above the reference range despite normal FT4 concentrations.

Thyroid glands affected by autoimmune diseases can show a hypoechogenic pattern. These structural changes usually precede autoantibodies detection and other laboratory alterations. Although about 50% of HT patients demonstrate normal thyroid volume, there is a notable dispersion in volume values when compared to healthy controls. Patients with smaller thyroid volume have more pronounced hypothyroidism, while those with subclinical hypothyroidism predominantly have goiter. In the initial phase, there is lymphocytic infiltration, culminating in thyroid volume augmentation. After that, subsequent atrophy precipitates progressive volume reduction.

### Atypical ultrasound features of parathyroid tumours may bear a relationship to their clinical and biochemical presentation [^114djPsj]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that can result from adenoma or hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. In 80–90% of cases it occurs as a result of benign adenoma of the parathyroid gland. Sonography and Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy are the imaging modalities of choice in arriving at a diagnosis. Surgical management is most common and provides symptomatic cure as well as biochemical normalisation.

Ultrasonography is a convenient and inexpensive imaging modality in the evaluation of the thyroid and parathyroid glands with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 88%. The grey scale appearances and Doppler features favouring a diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma are well described. The classical imaging features on grey scale include oval or lobulated extra-thyroidal hypoechoic lesions with a well-defined margin. On colour Doppler these lesions are very vascular and typically show a peripheral vascular arc and prominent polar feeding vessel arising from the branches of inferior thyroidal artery. Other features include vascular asymmetry of the thyroid gland on the side of the lesion and hyperechoic capsule.

However, there is little literature on atypical ultrasound features of parathyroid lesions, their prevalence and relevance while evaluating parathyroid lesions. The atypical features so far described in the literature include purely cystic parathyroid adenomas reported in 4% of all adenomas, cystic degeneration in solid adenomas, giant adenomas, inhomogeneous, multi-lobulated and calcified parathyroid tumours.

The purpose of this study was to describe the atypical ultrasound features of parathyroid lesions, to study how they correlate with Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy and histopathology and clinical parameters.

Table 4 — ultrasound (US) features of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: Benign indicators include an isoechoic spongiform appearance (microcystic spaces comprising > 50% of the nodule), simple cyst with thin regular margins, mostly cystic (> 50%) nodules containing colloid (hyperechoic spots with comet-tail sign), and regular "eggshell" calcification around the periphery of a nodule. Malignant indicators include a solid hypoechoic nodule that may contain hyperechoic foci without posterior shadowing (microcalcifications), a solid hypoechoic nodule with intranodular vascularity and absence of peripheral halo, a "taller-than-wide" nodule (AP > TR diameter when imaged in the transverse plane), a hypoechoic nodule with spiculated or lobulated margin, a hypoechoic mass with a broken calcified rim and tissue extension beyond the calcified margin, a follicular neoplasm (either follicular adenoma or carcinoma), and an isoechoic or mildly hypoechoic homogeneous nodule with intranodular vascularization and well-defined halo.

### US features of thyroid malignancy: pearls and pitfalls [^113ihfFN]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common and occur in up to 50% of the adult population; however, less than 7% of thyroid nodules are malignant. High-resolution ultrasonography (US) is commonly used to evaluate the thyroid gland, but US is frequently misperceived as unhelpful for identifying features that distinguish benign from malignant nodules. Microcalcifications are one of the most specific US findings of a thyroid malignancy. Other useful US features include a marked hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and the absence of a hypoechoic halo around the nodule. Lymphadenopathy and local invasion of adjacent structures are highly specific features of thyroid malignancy but are less commonly seen. The number, size, and interval growth of nodules are nonspecific characteristics. Suspicious US features may be useful for selecting patients for fine-needle aspiration biopsy when incidental nodules are discovered and when multiple nodules are present. Common interpretative pitfalls that may lead to failure to recognize a malignancy include mistaking cystic or calcified nodal metastases for nodules in a multinodular thyroid, mistaking diffusely infiltrative thyroid carcinomas and multifocal carcinomas for benign disease, and failing to recognize microcalcifications in papillary thyroid cancer.

Thyroid nodules: The Scope of the Problem — definition and epidemiology are outlined as follows: A thyroid nodule is "a distinct lesion that may be differentiated from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma by US examination or other sensitive imaging", and "clinically detected nodules need confirmation by US or, more rarely, thyroid scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination". Prevalence varies by detection method, with inspection/palpation studies that "reported a 3 to 7% prevalence", while clinically inapparent nodules are "detected by US in 20% to as many as 76% of the general population". Among patients with one palpable nodule, "20 to 48% of patients with 1 palpable thyroid nodule are found to have additional nod ules". Thyroid nodules are "more common in elderly persons, females, subjects from iodine-deficient geographic areas, and those with a history of radiation exposure". The population burden is substantial: "The estimated annual incidence rate of 0.1% in the U.S. indicates that 350,000 new nodules will be discovered in that country this year". Many are incidental findings; "Thyroid nodules are frequently detected in the course of a neck imaging study performed for reasons unrelated to thyroid disease", and "thyroid incidentalomas are detected in 9.4 to 27.0% of carotid duplex studies".

Ultrasound elastography (USE) for thyroid nodules demonstrates variable diagnostic performance and limited applicability: the positive predictive value (PPV) of USE was only 36%, the NPV of USE was 97% in a population with cancer prevalence of 9%, and USE can only be effectively applied to solid nodules with some patients not candidates for USE. As a result, at present, USE cannot be widely applied to all thyroid nodules, the committee cannot presently recommend its universal use or widespread adoption, and the ability to perform (or not perform) USE should not modify the recommendation for traditional gray-scale sonographic evaluation.

Ultrasound risk stratification — We suggest the use of a simplified 3-class ultrasound (US) rating system for risk of thyroid carcinoma that is associated with a progressive risk of malignancy, with classes defined as follows: Class 1 (low-risk thyroid lesion) includes mostly cystic (> 50%) nodules with reverberating artifacts and spongiform nodules not associated with any suspicious US or elastographic findings (expected risk of malignancy, about 1%). Class 2 (intermediate-risk thyroid lesion) includes slightly hypoechoic or isoechoic nodules with ovoid-to-round shape and smooth or ill-defined margins, with either intranodular vascularization, macro- or continuous rim calcifications, increased stiffness at elastography, or hyperechoic spots of uncertain significance (expected risk of malignancy, 5–15%). Class 3 (high-risk thyroid lesion) includes nodules with at least 1 of the following findings: marked hypoechogenicity, spiculated or microlobulated margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, or presence of extrathyroidal growth or pathologic lymphadenopathy (expected risk of malignancy, 50–90%, according to the presence of 1 or more suspicious findings).

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) ultrasound variants — The follicular variant of PTC may exhibit a non-suspicious US appearance, with an oval shape, well-defined and regular margins, and an absence of microcalcifications, and the follicular variant of PTC is usually larger than the classic PTC. The tall-cell variant of PTC usually shows the traditional US signs of malignancy; these tumors frequently appear as deeply hypoechoic nodules with lobulated margins and microcalcifications, and extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases may also be evident at US examination. The diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC poses a diagnostic challenge at US examination because the gland may appear enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic, as in Hashimoto thyroiditis, and multiple fine and scattered hyperechoic microcalcifications may confer a "starry night" appearance to wide portions of the thyroid.

### Prevalence and outcomes of incidental imaging findings: umbrella review [^114XcN5U]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research and next steps

Our review highlights some clear gaps in the literature. We found no systematic reviews quantifying the prevalence of incidentalomas on any type of radiography (x ray) or ultrasonography. Similarly, future systematic reviews addressing the outcomes of incidentalomas of the liver, pancreas, lungs, and spleen would be advantageous. Further, given the emerging evidence that orthopaedic procedures of degenerative joints are of limited benefit, systematic reviews quantifying the prevalence and outcome of incidentalomas from imaging of the joint (eg, knees, hips, shoulders) would be valuable. Furthermore, guidelines stipulating what constitutes an incidentaloma and what does not, stratified by organ, would be advantageous for clinicians, radiologists, and researchers. Efforts from radiological professional societies to standardise definitions of incidentaloma thresholds, especially for organs where we documented very large heterogeneity, would be useful. Lastly, incidentalomas of the breast and thyroid had the highest rates of malignancy. Cancers of both these organs are known to be commonly overdiagnosedand it is plausible that incidentally diagnosed breast and thyroid cancers might represent (in part) overdiagnosis. Long term follow-up of breast and thyroid cancers diagnosed incidentally would be advantageous to quantify how likely incidentally diagnosed cancers are non-progressive or never grow to cause a patient harm.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — Thyroid sonography and lymph node survey (Recommendation 6) states that thyroid sonography with survey of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed in all patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Diagnostic thyroid/neck ultrasound (US) should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, or a radiographic abnormality suggesting an incidentally detected thyroid nodule (including CT, MRI, or 18FDG-PET uptake). US should evaluate thyroid parenchyma and gland size; nodule size, location, and characteristics; and the presence or absence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, and the report should document three-dimensional nodule size, location, and detailed features (composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, shape if taller than wide, and vascularity). In patients with low serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) who have radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy suggesting nodularity, US should also be performed to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that do not require FNA and nonfunctioning nodules that meet sonographic criteria for FNA.

Ultrasound

The thyroid gland is a superficial structure that can be imaged by ultrasonography with a high-frequency linear array transducer (10–15 MHz) at a resolution of 0.7 to 1.0 mm. Ultrasound imaging, performed in the longitudinal and axial planes, can be used to investigate the absence or presence, size, echogenic texture, and structure of a thyroid gland in situ. However, it cannot always detect lingual and sublingual thyroid ectopy, although the use of color Doppler facilitates the identification of thyroid tissue by demonstrating marked increases in blood flow. Ultrasonography is highly observer-dependent, and investigators should be particularly wary of misdiagnosing nonthyroidal tissue in the thyroid fossa as a dysplastic thyroid gland in situ. Thyroid tissue is more echogenic than muscle but less echogenic than fat. In the absence of thyroid tissue in the normal location, small hyperechoic structures of approximately the same echogenicity as fat are found laterally on both sides of the trachea, mimicking the appearance of a thyroid gland. Cysts have also been described within the empty thyroid area.

Scintigraphy and ultrasound combined

Combining scintigraphy and thyroid ultrasound in the individual patient helps to: 1) improve diagnostic accuracy; 2) identify a eutopic gland, which may be normal, enlarged, or hypoplastic, thus guiding further diagnostic investigations, including molecular genetics studies; 3) prevent the incorrect diagnosis of athyreosis in the context of an absence of uptake on scintigraphy when ultrasound shows a normal gland in situ; and 4) detect thyroid ectopy reliably. Table 1 shows the diagnostic patterns to be found in thyroid dysgenesis, dyshormonogenesis, and some forms of transient CH when ultrasound, scintigraphy, and serum thyroglobulin measurement are combined.

Autoimmune

Autoimmune conditions are generally systemic, with some demonstrating propensity for specific organs, including those traversing the thoracic inlet. For example, systemic sclerosis can affect the esophagus causing esophageal dilatation. Autoimmune thyroiditis such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis causes thyroid enlargement with nodules and can have an association with lymphoma. Antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with venous and arterial thrombosis.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis

Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of thyroiditis and hypothyroidism. Patients typically present with gradual painless enlargement of the thyroid gland and symptoms related to hypothyroidism. Grayscale ultrasound tends to vary with different stages of the disease and extent of involvement. The thyroid is typically enlarged with heterogeneous echotexture. Multiple, discrete hypoechoic micronodules from 1 to 6 mm in diameter are strongly suggestive of chronic thyroiditis (Fig. 21). On color Doppler, the thyroid may demonstrate normal or decreased blood flow in later stages; however, it may occasionally be hypervascular, reflecting early phase of the disease and hypertrophic action of thyroid-stimulating hormone (Fig. 21). CT shows symmetric enlargement of thyroid with diffuse decreased density.

### Risk of thyroid cancer based on thyroid ultrasound imaging characteristics: results of a population-based study [^115RjRRJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is wide variation in the management of thyroid nodules identified on ultrasound imaging.

Objective

To quantify the risk of thyroid cancer associated with thyroid nodules based on ultrasound imaging characteristics.

Methods

Retrospective case-control study of patients who underwent thyroid ultrasound imaging from January 1, 2000, through March 30, 2005. Thyroid cancers were identified through linkage with the California Cancer Registry.

Results

A total of 8806 patients underwent 11,618 thyroid ultrasound examinations during the study period, including 105 subsequently diagnosed as having thyroid cancer. Thyroid nodules were common in patients diagnosed as having cancer (96.9%) and patients not diagnosed as having thyroid cancer (56.4%). Three ultrasound nodule characteristics — microcalcifications (odds ratio [OR], 8.1; 95% CI, 3.8–17.3), size greater than 2 cm (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.7–7.6), and an entirely solid composition (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7–9.2) — were the only findings associated with the risk of thyroid cancer. If 1 characteristic is used as an indication for biopsy, most cases of thyroid cancer would be detected (sensitivity, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.94), with a high false-positive rate (0.44; 95% CI, 0.43–0.45) and a low positive likelihood ratio (2.0; 95% CI, 1.8–2.2), and 56 biopsies will be performed per cancer diagnosed. If 2 characteristics were required for biopsy, the sensitivity and false-positive rates would be lower (sensitivity, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42–0.62; false-positive rate, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.07–0.08), the positive likelihood ratio would be higher (7.1; 95% CI, 6.2–8.2), and only 16 biopsies will be performed per cancer diagnosed. Compared with performing biopsy of all thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm, adoption of this more stringent rule requiring 2 abnormal nodule characteristics to prompt biopsy would reduce unnecessary biopsies by 90% while maintaining a low risk of cancer (5 per 1000 patients for whom biopsy is deferred).

Conclusions and Relevance

Thyroid ultrasound imaging could be used to identify patients who have a low risk of cancer for whom biopsy could be deferred. On the basis of these results, these findings should be validated in a large prospective cohort.

### Radionuclide imaging of the thyroid gland: patterns, pearls, and pitfalls [^115Qy9j7]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Optimal thyroid scintigraphy requires an understanding of 1) the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of the thyroid gland; and 2) the properties of the 2 common imaging agents, technetium-99m pertechnetate (Tc-99m) and radioiodine (1–123). The normal gland has a characteristic scintigraphic pattern with these tracers and its uptake can be quantified with 1–123. Thyroid diseases often produce characteristic abnormal patterns. These abnormal patterns could be described as diffuse or focal, homogeneous or heterogeneous, increased or decreased. "Extrathyroidal" localization can be seen with esophageal activity, ectopic tissue, thyroglossal duct cyst, and substernal goiter. Thyroid scintigraphy of neonates, as a follow up to abnormal blood screening, demonstrates typical etiologic patterns. The first step in evaluating a patient with suspected thyroid disease is correlating the normal or abnormal scintigraphic pattern with available biochemical data, clinical history, and physical examination. By integrating the interpretive and technical "pearls" and "pitfalls" outlined in this article, the radiologist can be more confident in establishing a proper diagnosis.

### Reference intervals of serum thyroid function tests in a previously iodine-deficient area [^115Zsr3X]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

We undertook the present study to establish reference data for serum thyroid function tests in a previously iodine-deficient area.

Methods

Data from 4298 individuals, 20–79 years of age were available for the present analysis. Thyroid function (thyrotropin [TSH], free triiodothyronine [FT(3)], and free thyroxine [FT(4)]) and serum autoantibodies to thyroperoxidase (anti-TPOAb) were evaluated from blood samples. Thyroid structure and size were measured by ultrasound.

Results

A reference population was selected comprising 1488 persons (825 men) by excluding subjects with known thyroid diseases, and with yet unknown thyroid disorders such as goitre, inhomogeneous thyroid pattern, nodules, hypoechogenicity and anti-TPOAb seropositivity. Reference intervals for serum TSH, FT(3), and FT(4) were 0.25–2.12 mIU/L, 3.8–7.0 pmol/L, and 8.3–18.9 pmol/L, respectively. Reference serum TSH levels were not comparable to the reference values that were recently established for the U.S. population and most reference values slightly differed from the reference values provided by the manufacturers.

Conclusions

The reference ranges of thyroid function tests in this formerly iodine-deficient region are distinct from the reference ranges that were established in areas with iodine sufficiency. Creating a reference population in the present setting should include thyroid ultrasound in order to exclude yet undiagnosed thyroid disorders.

Nondiagnostic cytology — management and performance include the following: For a nodule with an initial nondiagnostic cytology result, FNA should be repeated with ultrasound (US) guidance and, if available, on-site cytologic evaluation (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). A 3-month waiting period after a nondiagnostic biopsy is likely not necessary. Repeat FNA with US guidance will yield a diagnostic cytology specimen in 60%–80% of nodules, particularly when the cystic component is < 50%. Nondiagnostic samples constituted 2%–16% of all FNA samples, of which 7%–26% were eventually resected and malignant in 9%–32% of those resected. Of 104 nodules with two nondiagnostic cytology results, thyroid cancer was found in 25% of those with microcalcifications, irregular margins, taller than wide shape, or hypoechogenicity, but in only 4% lacking these features. Repeatedly nondiagnostic nodules without a high suspicion sonographic pattern require close observation or surgical excision for histopathologic diagnosis (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Surgery should be considered for histopathologic diagnosis if the cytologically nondiagnostic nodule has a high suspicion sonographic pattern, growth of the nodule (> 20% in two dimensions) is detected during US surveillance, or clinical risk factors for malignancy are present (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory FNA biopsies are those that fail to meet adequacy criteria, i.e., the presence of at least six groups of well-visualized follicular cells, each group containing at least 10 well-preserved epithelial cells.

### Screening, diagnosis and management of congenital hypothyroidism: European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guideline [^111j4EaD]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Medium credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) — thyroid ultrasound technique and cautions: The thyroid can be imaged by ultrasonography with a high-frequency linear array transducer (10–15 MHz) at a resolution of 0.7 to 1.0 mm to assess presence, size, echogenic texture, and structure; however, it cannot always detect lingual and sublingual thyroid ectopy, though color Doppler facilitates identification by demonstrating marked increases in blood flow. Ultrasonography is highly observer-dependent, and investigators should be particularly wary of misdiagnosing nonthyroidal tissue in the thyroid fossa as a dysplastic thyroid gland in situ; thyroid tissue is more echogenic than muscle but less echogenic than fat.

### First reported case of unilateral Graves' disease in the left lobe of a bilobar thyroid gland [^113ZKt6Y]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Unilateral Graves' disease is a rare disease variant that can occur in a bilobar thyroid gland. We report the first documented case of unilateral Graves' disease in the left lobe of a bilobar thyroid gland and review the pertinent literature.

Patient Findings

A 48-year-old man presented in June 2010 with thyrotoxicosis. I-131 radioisotope uptake was elevated at 33.4%, and scintigraphy revealed that uptake of the radioisotope was uniformly increased in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland revealed a non-nodular, enlarged, and heterogeneous left lobe; Doppler investigation of the lobe showed hypervascularity classically seen in Graves' disease. The right lobe of the thyroid, on the other hand, appeared homogeneous and hypovascular on ultrasonography. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was significantly elevated at 191% (reference range < 140%). Unilateral Graves' disease was the most likely diagnosis.

Summary

As has occasionally been described in the literature, unilateral involvement of the thyroid gland is a rare presentation of Graves' disease. Pre-existing functional or structural differences (either congenital or acquired) between the two lobes may contribute to this rare presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of unilateral Graves' disease presenting in the left lobe of a bilobar thyroid gland.

Conclusion

Although the pathophysiology of unilateral Graves's disease has not been clearly elucidated, clinicians should be aware that Graves' disease can present unilaterally in either lobe of the thyroid gland.

Thyrotoxicosis factitia — diagnosis hinges on evidence of exogenous hormone ingestion with characteristic laboratory and imaging patterns, and management options in overdose have been described. Thyrotoxicosis factitia includes all causes of thyrotoxicosis due to the ingestion of thyroid hormone; clues to this diagnosis are an absence of goiter, a suppressed serum thyroglobulin level, and a decreased RAIU, though in the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies the distinction from painless thyroiditis can be difficult. In both situations there will be elevated levels of T4, a high T3 to T4 ratio (with exogenous levothyroxine), a small thyroid, and a low thyroidal RAIU, and thyroid ultrasound may be helpful because the thyroid has a heterogeneous echotexture and is normal size or slightly enlarged in painless thyroiditis, while is small with a normal echotexture in an otherwise normal individual who is ingesting thyroid hormone surreptitiously. Fecal levothyroxine has been measured as a means of distinguishing surreptitious use of thyroid hormone from painless thyroiditis, and a disproportionately elevated T3 level suggests that the patient may be ingesting liothyronine or a combination T4/T3 preparation; severe thyrotoxicosis and rarely, thyroid storm, have been reported after overdose or poisoning, and treatment with cholestyramine and charcoal hemoperfusion have been used in this circumstance.

### Thyroid nodule ultrasound: technical advances and future horizons [^112NW36i]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasound (US) examination of the neck is a commonly performed investigation and thyroid nodules are a highly prevalent finding. As the vast majority of nodules are non-malignant, the accurate discrimination of a benign from cancerous lesion is an important and challenging feature of thyroid US. Whilst single US features remain of limited accuracy, constellations of findings enable thyroid nodules to be accurately stratified on a 'risk-of-malignancy' basis and form the basis of several guidelines. Imaging features that confer a high positive predictive value and specificity for malignancy are valuable as they enable suspicious lesions to be identified and targeted for pathological analysis (typically fine-needle aspiration cytology, FNAC). The ubiquitous nature of thyroid nodules and the limitations of cytology mean that the confident identification of benign nodules is also important. US characteristics that carry a high negative predictive value for malignancy enable an evidence-based decision not to investigate further, allowing unnecessary FNAC and/or surgery to be avoided in a very large population. Many of these key thyroid nodule features are heavily dependent on recent advances in high-resolution ultrasound technology and are therefore altered and influenced by US machine settings. In an era of wider US use by different groups (e.g. endocrinologists, surgeons), the high-resolution features of thyroid disease — and the technical factors, which create and alter these valuable signs — must be familiar to the operator.

US elastography (USE) is a recent technological advance that measures tissue elasticity or stiffness properties objectively and has been available in recent years on many state-of-the-art clinical US machines. USE is classified as diagnostic ultrasound and is safe, non-invasive and requires no costly consumables. Importantly, USE can be performed in real-time alongside conventional sonography, providing objective stiffness data that can be used to influence clinical decisions during US examinations. The clinical potential of USE relies on the same principles as clinical palpation, namely that processes such as malignancy and fibrosis alter elasticity. Numerous clinical applications of USE are under investigation at different body sites. To date, over 100 preliminary studies on USE for thyroid nodules for malignancy have been published, with promising but controversial results, as will be discussed.

This article will focus on two aspects of thyroid ultrasound: first, technical advances in high-resolution US are discussed with relevance to specific features of thyroid cancer, benign disease and emerging developments. The second part of the article provides a concise overview of the current role of elastography and how elasticity imaging may supplement high-resolution ultrasound in the pursuit of accurate thyroid nodule assessment.

### Evaluation of the thyroid characteristics of patients with growth hormone-secreting adenomas [^115VncDr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromegaly is highly associated with thyroid disorders. However, the clinical characteristics of thyroid nodules in individuals with acromegaly who present with thyroid diseases have not been completely elucidated.

Methods

Overall, 134 consecutive participants with growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenoma (n = 67) and non-functioning (NF) pituitary adenoma (n = 67) were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient patient department of The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University from August 2015 to August 2017. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed using an ultrasound system. The cytopathological results of fine-needle aspiration biopsy were analyzed by a pathologist according to the Bethesda system. Twenty-one patients with GH-secreting adenoma and thyroid disease underwent transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection and were followed up for 1 year.

Results

The prevalence of thyroid disease increased in the GH-secreting adenoma group compared with that in the NF pituitary adenoma group. The number of hypoechoic, isoechogenic, heterogeneous, and vascular thyroid nodules increased in patients with GH-secreting adenoma plus thyroid disease compared with that in patients with NF pituitary adenoma plus thyroid disease. Finally, we found significant decreases in the morphology of solid nodules and significant increases in the morphology of cystic nodules after surgery compared with those before surgery in the cured group. Moreover, the numbers of heterogeneous and vascular thyroid nodules decreased significantly after surgery compared with those before surgery in the cured group. However, the characteristics of the thyroid nodules did not change after surgery compared with those before surgery in the non-cured group.

Conclusions

The numbers of hypoechoic, isoechoic, heterogeneous, and vascular thyroid nodules increased in patients with GH-secreting adenomas. In these patients, surgery resulted in significant changes from solid to cystic nodules and also reduced the numbers of heterogeneous and vascular thyroid nodules.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the small organs in children [^116DSspK]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules

By palpation, the incidence of thyroid nodules in the adult population is approximately 4–7%. However, that number increases up to 30% with the use of high-resolution US of the thyroid gland in clinical practice. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in children ranges between 1% to 2% and is significantly lower compared to adults. Most nodules in adults are benign, with fewer than 5% classified as malignant. However, in children thyroid nodules carry a far greater risk of harboring malignancy than in adults, at a rate of approximately 26.4%.

In the CEUS literature, thyroid nodules can be characterized and differentiated by qualitative and quantitative CEUS imaging parameters. Qualitative parameters describe nodule perfusion compared to the surrounding thyroid tissue and include observations of enhancement such as intensity, homogeneity, vascular distribution pattern and rate of contrast uptake. The main CEUS features that are highly suspicious for malignancy are hypoenhancement of the nodule throughout the enhancement phases and heterogeneous enhancement. In one adult study, six qualitative CEUS features were considered significant for predicting malignant thyroid nodules: slow entry of contrast agents during the enhancement phase (odds ratio [OR] = 15.6, P = 0.001), slow time-to-peak (OR = 7.4, P = 0.002), non-uniform enhancement (OR = 10.1, P = 0.023), irregular enhancement pattern (OR = 36.2, P = 0.002), unclear enhancement boundary (OR = 25.3, P = 0.012) and absence of ring-like enhancement (OR = 25.3, P = 0.004). On the contrary, uniform enhancement and ring enhancement are typical findings for predicting benignity. However, the CEUS enhancement patterns of both malignant and benign nodules can overlap. Because of the subjectivity in this assessment, a quantitative approach has been the subject of much research. Quantitative CEUS with time-intensity curve analysis can be performed following image acquisition using special software programs embedded on the US unit or on separate computers. This analysis requires that regions of interest be placed in the nodule and the adjacent normal tissue. Imaging parameters obtained from time-intensity curves including wash-in-slope, peak intensity, time-to-peak, area under the curve (AUC), mean transit time, and washout time have great potential to provide objective information for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules. In quantitative CEUS evaluations, later arrival time of contrast, later time-to-peak with earlier start of the washout phase, lower peak intensity and overall smaller AUC were strongly associated with malignancy. Some adult studies, however, showed differences in CEUS quantitative parameters between small (< 1 cm) and large (> 1 cm) malignant thyroid nodules. Specifically, larger malignant nodules had a steeper slope of the wash-in curve, faster time-to-peak and slightly higher peak intensity compared with smaller malignant nodules. This could be because in smaller malignant nodules neoangiogenesis is incomplete, whereas in larger malignant nodules aberrant neo vessels result in more blood flow. Larger malignant nodules tend to have areas of necrosis, calcifications and fibrosis that diminish blood flow compared to benign nodules. Still, as further validation of these CEUS parameters for thyroid nodules continues, they should be interpreted only with the use of clinical and laboratory findings, as well as with elastography.

Thyroid nodule ultrasound (US) features — malignancy associations and odds ratios: Meta-analytic data indicate associations for microcalcifications (OR, 6.76), irregular margins (OR, 6.12), hypoechogenicity (OR, 5.07), solid nodule structure (OR, 4.69), and intranodular vascularization (OR, 3.76). In a further study of 2,000 nodules (63.4% benign and 36.6% malignant), odds ratios for malignancy were: deeply hypoechoic (OR, 6.8), spiculated or microlobulated margins (OR, 5.9), microcalcifications (OR, 3.8), solid nodular structure (OR, 2.6), slightly hypoechoic (OR, 2.6), nonparallel (taller than wide) growth (OR, 2.3), and irregular shape (OR, 1.3). US signs alone are not clearly predictive in most nodules and absence of suspicious features is not fully diagnostic for benignity; however, the coexistence of 2 or more suspicious US criteria greatly increases the risk of thyroid cancer.

### Clinical significance of patterns of incidental thyroid uptake at (18) F-FDG PET / CT [^116yQJzh]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Incidental uptake of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) in the thyroid gland is not uncommonly encountered in day-to-day practice of oncological (18)F-FDG positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). These are often felt to be "nuisance lesions" by referring clinicians and radiologists alike. However, recognition of the importance of different patterns of FDG uptake in the thyroid gland and knowledge of the possible underlying aetiologies are crucial in ensuring that patients are managed appropriately in the clinical context of their primary diagnosis, as the underlying pathological condition may be clinically important in a significant minority of such cases. This review describes the various patterns of (18)F-FDG uptake within the thyroid and discusses the clinical significance and possible impact on patient management. Incidental low-grade homogeneous diffuse increased thyroid (18)F-FDG uptake is usually seen in the patients with chronic thyroiditis, Grave's disease, and hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests and antibody profiling are advised in these patients. Incidental focal (18)F-FDG thyroid uptake should raise the possibility of underlying malignancy. Ultrasound with or without fine-needle aspiration cytology is usually recommended for the evaluation of these lesions. Heterogeneous uptake with prominent focal uptake in the thyroid should be further evaluated to exclude malignancy.

### Sonographic evaluation of intrathyroid metastases [^116U6fag]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intrathyroid metastases from extrathyroid primary tumors are rare. Clinical findings may be subtle, but detection of intrathyroid metastases has improved with sonography. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sonographic appearance of intrathyroid metastases.

Methods

Patients with thyroid masses with cytopathologic features matching those of an extrathyroid primary tumor were retrospectively identified. The appearances of intrathyroid metastases on sonography were reviewed for the following features: size, margin regularity, echogenicity, echotexture, vascularity on power or color Doppler ultrasonography, and the presence or absence of any associated cervical adenopathy.

Results

The study included 52 patients. The most frequent primary tumor sites were lung, head and neck, and breast. Intrathyroid metastases presented as a discrete nodule in 34 patients and as diffuse infiltration of the gland in 18 patients. The discrete nodules ranged in size from 1.1 to 5.6 cm (mean ± SD, 2.5 ± 1.2 cm). Thirty-three lesions (63%) had irregular margins, and 19 (37%) had well-defined margins. Most of the lesions were heterogeneously hypoechoic (n = 50, 96%). Vascularity was present in 32 of 50 measured lesions (64%) that were evaluated with Doppler sonography. Cervical adenopathy was present in 37 patients (71%).

Conclusions

Intrathyroid metastases have sonographic characteristics similar to those described for both benign and malignant thyroid diseases. In patients with a previous or current extrathyroid malignancy, thyroid nodules or diffuse infiltration of the thyroid gland on sonography should be viewed as a potential intrathyroid metastasis and evaluated via ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration regardless of the site of the primary tumor.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^115oSHAB]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Endocrine — thyroid and parathyroid ultrasound is motivated by the facts that thyroid nodules are the most common lesions seen in the head and neck and that a major consideration in the evaluation of thyroid nodules is the potential for malignancy. Ultrasound evaluation of a thyroid nodule, frequently coupled with an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), is the most reliable means to assess for potential malignancy. Hyperparathyroidism is a common clinical entity; while surgical excision via 4-gland exploration can be offered as therapy, directed exploration with excision of an abnormal gland is more frequently performed in patients with preoperative localization, and while sestamibi imaging is commonly used, ultrasound can accurately identify the abnormal gland. Indications for an ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid and parathyroid glands include but are not limited to the following: evaluation of the location and characteristics of palpable neck masses; evaluation of abnormalities detected by other imaging examinations or laboratory studies, eg, areas of abnormal uptake seen on radioisotope thyroid examinations; evaluation of the presence, size, and location of the thyroid gland; evaluation of high-risk patients for occult thyroid malignancy; follow-up of thyroid nodules, when indicated; and evaluation for recurrent disease or regional nodal metastases in patients with proven or suspected thyroid carcinoma.

Other diagnostic imaging for nodular thyroid disease — MRI and CT should not be routinely used in nodular thyroid disease, though MRI and CT are of value for assessing size, substernal extension, airway compression, or pathologic lymph nodes not visualized by US; CT contrast medium usually contains iodine, decreases subsequent uptake of radioiodine, and may induce hyperthyroidism. For 18FG PET/CT in indeterminate cytology, studies report an advanced NPV of about 90%, but diagnostic accuracy appears close to B-mode US and the added cost and limited accessibility disfavor its routine use. For contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), first- and second-generation contrast agents provide only ancillary data; ring enhancement and homogeneity on CEUS were reported as valuable indicators with ORs > 20, and currently, use of US contrast agents should be restricted to defining necrotic zones after US-guided ablation procedures.

### Thyroid computed tomography imaging: pictorial review of variable pathologies [^111WeT9J]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammatory lesions

Inflammatory thyroid disorders include acute infectious thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis, and granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain's). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. The CT scan findings of thyroiditis are nonspecific and variable (Figs. 14, 15 and 16). The thyroid gland has a very high iodine concentration, resulting in high CT attenuation (80–100 Hounsfield Units). The presence of thyroiditis can be suggested by a diffusely enlarged and hypo-attenuating (around 45 Hounsfield Units) thyroid gland. This is probably due to follicular cell destruction and reduced thyroid iodine concentration. Marked homogenous enhancement is typically expected. Therefore, moderate thyroid enhancement in a case of thyroiditis suggests a diffuse inflammatory process. It is essential to clinically correlate this with a thyroid function test and serum autoantibody levels.

Repeat FNA after benign cytology — suspicious ultrasound (US) features, rather than growth alone, are more predictive and should be the indication for repeat FNA: a significantly higher malignancy rate of 20.4% was seen with marked hypoechogenicity, irregular borders, microcalcifications, or a taller than wide shape versus 1.4% with a 15% volume increase lacking these features; risk did not differ between growth and no interval size change (1.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.18); similarly, cancer occurred in 1.7% with suspicious features versus 1.3% in those that grew using a 50% volume increase criterion; therefore, the use of suspicious US characteristics rather than nodule growth should be the indication for repeat FNA despite an initial benign cytology diagnosis.

### Selenium supplementation in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111oTNGP]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), also referred to as chronic autoimmune or lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most prevalent cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. It affects ∼160 million people globally, with women being 4–10 times more susceptible than men. HT is characterized by chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland, elevated serum antibodies against thyroid antigens, and typical appearance on thyroid ultrasound. Once hypothyroidism develops, the current standard of care is lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT) with levothyroxine (LT4).

Since several trace elements are essential for normal thyroid function, there is increasing interest in their supplementation for the management of HT, in particular the prevention of hypothyroidism. Besides iodine, one of the most discussed candidates is selenium. Selenium intake levels vary by region and are influenced by soil selenium content and selenium availability in the food chain, among other factors. Organ meats and seafoods are common sources of selenium, followed by muscle meats, cereals, and grains. The recommended daily allowance of selenium ranges between 55 and 70 μg for nonpregnant adults, which is often not reached, especially in Europe and some parts of China.

Many thyroid enzymes are selenoproteins, such as the deiodinases that metabolize thyroid hormones and the glutathione peroxidases (GPX) that help to manage oxidative stress in the thyrocyte. Reduced selenium levels have been observed in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, including HT. As a result, supplementing selenium in patients with HT has attracted much attention in recent decades.

So far, it has been suggested that selenium deficiency can exacerbate HT and the development of hypothyroidism. Therefore, preventing selenium deficiencies could be a promising approach to prevent or modify HT-associated hypothyroidism. However, findings from previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effect of selenium supplementation in HT remain inconclusivedue to factors such as a relatively small number of included studies, the inclusion of small and clinical heterogeneous populations (i.e. with and without THRT), and outdated data due to the publication of new trials. In addition, the differences across studies in patient characteristics, outcome definitions, inclusion criteria, and supplementation regimens may result in considerable heterogeneity (I ≥ 75%) and obscure the effect when results are statistically pooled. As a result, selenium supplementation is not currently considered in the guidelines for hypothyroidism or thyroid diseases of the American, European, and South American thyroid associations.

### Physician-reported misuse of thyroid ultrasonography… [^112dZnhg]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In the US, there is an ongoing national dialogue about avoiding unnecessary medical tests, with the Choosing Wisely campaign recommending against ordering thyroid ultrasonographic examinations for abnormal thyroid function test results. 1, 2 However, despite this national dialogue, little is known about physician-reported use of thyroid ultrasonography, a known driver of thyroid cancer incidence. 3, 4. Between October 2018 and August 2019, we surveyed surgeons, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians who were identified as being involved in thyroid cancer care by patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2015 and affiliated with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries of Georgia and Los Angeles, California. 4 This study was approved by institutional review boards of participating institutions. Survey completion was considered implied consent for participation.

Most of the physicians reported use of ultrasonography for clinically supported reasons: palpable nodules, large goiter, nodule seen on another imaging test, and new-onset hoarseness or compressive symptoms. However, a substantial number endorsed use for clinically unsupported reasons: patient request, abnormal thyroid function test results, and positive thyroid antibody test result. Three physicians endorsed use of ultrasonography for fatigue, and no physician endorsed use for routine well-patient visits. To our knowledge, this is the first survey study to evaluate use of thyroid ultrasonography by a diverse cohort of physicians involved in the care of a population-based cohort of patients with thyroid cancer.

A substantial number of physicians endorsed use of ultrasonography for reasons not supported by clinical guidelines and in conflict with the Choosing Wisely recommendations. 2, 5, 6. Our study has limitations in that direct links between physician-reported practice patterns and unnecessary thyroid cancer diagnoses were not possible, and physicians were not asked if they personally performed thyroid ultrasonography examinations or specific details about patients' ultrasonography requests. Despite limitations, this study highlights the need for focused physician education on clinically supported and unsupported indications for use of thyroid ultrasonography, with potential roles for future clinical practice guidelines, patient decision-making aids, and clinical decision-making support tools.

### Don't routinely order a thyroid ultrasound in patients with abnormal… [^111MKgC7]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound is used to identify and characterize thyroid nodules, and is not part of the routine evaluation of abnormal thyroid function tests unless the patient also has a large goiter or a lumpy thyroid. Incidentally discovered thyroid nodules are common. Overzealous use of ultrasound will frequently identify nodules, which are unrelated to the abnormal thyroid function, and may divert the clinical evaluation to assess the nodules, rather than the thyroid dysfunction. Imaging may be needed in thyrotoxic patients; when needed, a thyroid scan, not an ultrasound, is used to assess the etiology of the thyrotoxicosis and the possibility of focal autonomy in a thyroid nodule.

### The significance of incidental thyroid abnormalities identified during carotid duplex ultrasonography… [^114DK4MG]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Measurement of the thyroid mass by carotid duplex strongly correlated with measurement by formal thyroid ultrasound. Two patients with unilateral masses noted on carotid duplex had a normal thyroid formal ultrasound. Conclusions Incidental thyroid abnormalities identified during carotid duplex ultrasound are common and contain clinically significant pathology. A multidisciplinary clinical pathway may facilitate the appropriate evaluation of these abnormalities. Patients without any further evaluation following the initial carotid duplex ultrasound within the prior 6 months were classified as "lost to follow-up. " Those with shorter intervals or recent studies were defined as "ongoing evaluations. " Thyroid abnormalities were defined as any irregular-appearing thyroid glands or specific nodules as seen by the carotid duplex.

The main outcome measures were the prevalence and type of thyroid abnormalities, correlation with a dedicated thyroid ultrasound, and result of histopathologic diagnosis. Sixty-four of 66 patients with thyroid abnormalities seen on screening carotid duplex ultrasound were confirmed by the extended thyroid sonographic examination. There were 2 patients with unilateral masses noted on carotid duplex that had a normal thyroid ultrasound. Both of the patients with eventual parathyroid abnormalities were initially identified as having irregular-appearing thyroid glands with nodules. We were also able to detect 4 follicular adenomas, and 2 cases of parathyroid adenomas with previously undiagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism as a result of abnormalities seen on the duplex. Prior authors have described the use of either parathyroid or thyroid imaging to pick up pathology in the other gland, as well as the potential for coexistent pathology.

20–22 This is not surprising given the embryological origin and anatomic location of the glands, and it serves to emphasize that some abnormalities do require further investigation. A few authors have looked at the role of duplex ultrasonography in evaluating thyroid nodules. One study found duplex with doppler analysis of thyroid nodules was helpful in discriminating the majority of neoplastic from nonneoplastic lesions by identifying intranodular flow in malignant lesions vs avascular or halo-flow lesions only in colloid nodules. 23 Yet increased vascularity seen on duplex ultrasonography can also be seen in benign conditions such as Graves disease24 and thyroiditis. 25 Another study looked at the relationship of thyroid abnormalities and their role on duplex findings of the carotid vessels.

### Ultrasonographic characteristics of thyroid nodules… [^116FeC1h]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background High-resolution real-time ultrasonography can detect characteristics of thyroid nodules, but the US differentiation between malignant nodules and benign nodules is not well described. Hypothesis Ultrasonography is useful for predicting malignancy of thyroid nodules. Design A retrospective study of 329 thyroid nodules in 309 patients comparing US characteristics and pathological results. ULTRASONOGRAPHY is useful for evaluation of thyroid nodules because of its safety, noninvasiveness, nonradioactivity, and effectiveness. Presently, high-resolution real-time US not only detects the presence, site, number, and size of thyroid nodules but also clearly shows the characteristics of thyroid nodules.

Margin, shape, halo sign, echo structure, internal echo, echogenicity, calcification, and invasion to adjacent organs were assessed to make a US diagnosis of either malignant or benign disease. Preoperatively, we considered ill-defined or irregular nodules with heterogeneous internal echo or hypoechogenicity to be malignant. With signs of invasion to adjacent organs, nodules were malignant regardless of the other characteristics. We also considered solitary and solid nodules with homogeneous internal echo to be follicular neoplasms. Considerations of internal echo, invasion, and halo sign were excluded from multiple logistic regression analysis for the following reasons.

When nodules were studied for echogenicity, nodules showing a heterogeneous internal echo appeared hypoisoechoic; thus, a bias existed. Invasion showed a low positivity with 100% sensitivity, and the P value for the halo sign was not significant. Ultrasound can detect the presence, site, size, and number of thyroid nodules, and there have been reports of US characteristics of malignancy, such as ill-defined margin, irregular shape, hypoechogenicity, heterogeneity, absence of cystic lesion and/or the halo sign, the presence of calcification, and invasion to adjacent organs. 1–4, 6–8, 10 However, the characteristics of thyroid nodules on US can vary widely by observer, 19 and a formula for predicting malignancy has not yet been reported.
