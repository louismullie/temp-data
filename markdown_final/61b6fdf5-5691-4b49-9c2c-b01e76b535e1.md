## Question

Best beta-blocker to cure sickle cell vaso-occlusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which beta-blocker could cure sickle cell vaso-occlusion and whether there is a "best" beta-blocker for this purpose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease and whether beta-blockade can reverse it. Then, I should review any direct evidence linking beta-blockers to vaso-occlusion outcomes in SCD. Next, I need to check safety considerations and contraindications for beta-blockers in vasocclusive or vasospastic settings. After that, I will consider theoretical properties of specific beta-blockers that might seem attractive but require scrutiny. Finally, I should synthesize the evidence-based standard of care for VOCs and provide a clear clinical recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions; vaso-occlusive crises are driven by deoxygenated HbS polymerization causing rigid, adhesive erythrocytes that obstruct low-shear venules, with endothelial activation and cell–cell adhesion amplifying flow obstruction, so a drug would need to either prevent HbS polymerization or disrupt the adhesion/flow cascade to be disease-modifying in VOCs, and beta-blockers do neither of these core tasks [^113Tx4eQ] [^112JkrhB].

> Hold on, I should verify the adhesion biology under flow; sickle RBCs adhere via VLA-4/VCAM-1, fibronectin, P-selectin, thrombospondin, and vWF, with peak adhesion at very low shear and notable resistance to detachment once multiple pathways are engaged, which means any proposed therapy must meaningfully blunt these adhesive interactions or the flow conditions that entrench them, not simply affect heart rate or systemic sympathetic tone [^112JkrhB] [^113p5ES6].

> Now, I will examine whether beta-blockers have any credible efficacy signal in SCD; there is a preclinical mouse study where epinephrine increased sickle RBC adhesion and vaso-occlusion via beta-adrenergic stimulation of the LW pathway, and propranolol prevented that epinephrine-induced adhesion and downstream occlusion, but wait, let me verify the nuance — this was preventive against a catecholamine trigger, not therapeutic for established VOC, and there are no human trials or guidelines endorsing beta-blockers for VOC treatment or prevention in SCD [^111Qmk9k] [^112bzAjb].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking sympathetic triggers; mental stress increases sympathetic activity and causes peripheral vasoconstriction in SCD and controls, plausibly increasing VOC risk, but blocking beta receptors systemically does not selectively normalize microvascular flow or reverse HbS polymerization/adhesion, so the pathophysiologic link is not sufficient to recommend beta-blockers clinically for VOCs [^112Wpc83] [^113Tx4eQ].

> Next, I should review safety and mechanistic concerns; non–vasodilating beta-blockers can worsen peripheral vasoconstriction and are cautioned in peripheral occlusive disorders, with nadolol labeling explicitly warning about exacerbating peripheral circulatory disorders like Raynaud's and other occlusive vascular disease, and the ESC advises avoiding beta-blockers in vasospastic angina due to risk of unopposed vasoconstriction, all of which raises red flags in an occlusion-prone vasculopathy like SCD [^112hBSAh] [^115oQ6R1].

> Let me consider drug-specific properties carefully; nebivolol has endothelial NO–mediated vasodilatory actions and beta3-adrenoceptor–linked endothelial effects that theoretically could mitigate vasoconstriction, but wait, I should verify — there is no clinical evidence in SCD, and class effects and contraindication patterns still apply, so this remains speculative rather than practice-changing for VOCs [^115FFYMZ] [^114aNwDW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated beta-adrenergic agonist venodilation with beta-blocker effects; isoproterenol causes venodilation via beta stimulation, but that does not imply that beta-blockade would reproduce beneficial microvascular effects, so I should correct that line of thinking and not infer utility of beta-blockers for VOCs from agonist physiology studies [^115S5pYq].

> I should double-check the standard of care so the recommendation is grounded; disease-modifying and evidence-based options for reducing VOCs include hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, and the P-selectin inhibitor crizanlizumab, along with guideline-based acute management emphasizing timely analgesia and supportive measures, whereas inhaled nitric oxide has not shown consistent benefit in RCTs and LMWH has limited evidence in crisis management, and curative strategies like HSCT markedly reduce VOCs but are not universally feasible [^112bzAjb] [^114Gf7nr] [^117XGCzC] [^1135vwwJ] [^116Eeza2] [^114pstu5].

> But wait, what if propranolol's nonselective blockade helps specifically when catecholamine surges precipitate crises; even then, the evidence is preclinical and preventive against an epinephrine challenge, with no human efficacy or safety data in VOCs, and propranolol's nonselective beta blockade can still promote peripheral vasoconstriction risk in a vasculopathy context, so I should not recommend it outside a trial [^111Qmk9k] [^116MQuxa] [^112hBSAh].

> Synthesizing this, I need to be precise: there is no "best" beta-blocker for sickle vaso-occlusion because beta-blockers neither reverse HbS polymerization nor disrupt the entrenched adhesion-flow pathology, there is no human evidence supporting therapeutic or preventive use in SCD VOCs, and class safety concerns in occlusive or vasospastic settings apply, so the concept is unsupported and potentially harmful, and patients should receive guideline-concordant disease-modifying therapy and acute care rather than beta-blockers for VOCs [^113Tx4eQ] [^112bzAjb] [^112hBSAh] [^115oQ6R1] [^117XGCzC].

Beta-blockers do not cure sickle cell vaso-occlusion, and there is **no evidence** that they prevent or treat vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in sickle cell disease (SCD). They are **not recommended** for VOC management and may worsen microvascular perfusion due to vasoconstriction [^112hBSAh] [^112bzAjb]. The mainstay of VOC care is **supportive therapy** (hydration, analgesia, oxygen) and **disease-modifying agents** such as hydroxyurea [^113Tx4eQ], L-glutamine [^114Gf7nr], crizanlizumab [^117XGCzC], and voxelotor [^114Gf7nr]. Beta-blockers should be used only for **standard cardiovascular indications** in SCD, with caution due to potential adverse effects [^notfound].

## Pathophysiology of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease

Vaso-occlusion in SCD is driven by **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Sickling of RBCs**: Polymerization of deoxygenated HbS causes rigid, sickled RBCs that obstruct microvessels [^113Tx4eQ].

- **Endothelial activation and adhesion**: Upregulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin) promotes RBC and leukocyte adhesion, initiating VOCs [^112JkrhB] [^113p5ES6].

- **Inflammation and oxidative stress**: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and adhesion [^114Gf7nr] [^111PiCUE].

- **Vasoconstriction**: Reduced NO bioavailability and increased endothelin-1 cause vasoconstriction, worsening microvascular obstruction [^113zZwci].

---

## Beta-blockers: pharmacological properties and potential relevance to vaso-occlusion

Beta-blockers **antagonize beta-adrenergic receptors**, reducing sympathetic activity. They differ in beta-1 selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and vasodilatory properties:

- **Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol, nadolol)**: Block beta-1 and beta-2 receptors; beta-2 blockade can cause vasoconstriction and bronchospasm [^116MQuxa] [^112hBSAh].

- **Beta-1 selective blockers (e.g. metoprolol, bisoprolol)**: Primarily block beta-1 receptors, with less beta-2 effect [^115f3q9S].

- **Beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties (e.g. carvedilol, nebivolol)**: Carvedilol has alpha-1 blockade; nebivolol increases NO bioavailability.

---

## Evidence regarding beta-blockers in sickle cell disease

There is **no clinical evidence** that beta-blockers prevent or treat VOCs in SCD. Available data suggest potential risks:

- **Vasoconstriction and reduced microvascular perfusion**: Beta-blockers, especially non-selective agents, may worsen microvascular perfusion by blocking beta-2–mediated vasodilation, potentially increasing VOC risk [^112hBSAh].

- **Bronchospasm and hypoxemia**: Non-selective beta-blockers can cause bronchospasm and hypoxemia, triggering sickling and VOCs [^116MQuxa].

- **Lack of clinical trials**: No randomized controlled trials have evaluated beta-blockers for VOC prevention or treatment.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend** beta-blockers for VOC management. Standard care includes **supportive care** (hydration, analgesia, oxygen, and infection management [^113Tx4eQ]) and **disease-modifying therapies** (hydroxyurea [^113Tx4eQ], L-glutamine [^114Gf7nr], crizanlizumab [^117XGCzC], and voxelotor [^111h2tJj]) to reduce VOC frequency and severity. Beta-blockers are used in SCD only for **standard cardiovascular indications** (e.g. hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias), with caution due to potential adverse effects.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of beta-blockers in sickle cell disease

Beta-blockers may pose **specific risks** in sickle cell disease, including an increased risk of vaso-occlusion, as beta-2 blockade can worsen microvascular perfusion [^112hBSAh]. Non-selective agents may precipitate bronchospasm and hypoxemia, which can trigger VOCs [^116MQuxa]. They can also mask hypoglycemia symptoms, complicating management in patients with SCD and diabetes.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for vaso-occlusion

Several therapies have **demonstrated efficacy** in reducing VOC frequency and severity:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Hydroxyurea | - Increases fetal hemoglobin <br/> - Reduces sickling | Reduces VOC frequency and severity |
| L-glutamine | Reduces oxidative stress | Reduces VOC frequency [^114Gf7nr] |
| Crizanlizumab | - P-selectin inhibitor <br/> - Reduces adhesion | Reduces VOC frequency [^117XGCzC] |
| Voxelotor | - Increases hemoglobin oxygen affinity <br/> - Reduces sickling | Reduces hemolysis and anemia |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Beta-blockers are **not recommended** for preventing or treating VOCs in SCD due to a lack of evidence and potential risks. Management should focus on **supportive care** and **disease-modifying therapies** [^113Tx4eQ]. Beta-blockers should be used only for **standard cardiovascular indications**, with caution regarding adverse effects.

### Sickle cell disease [^113Tx4eQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sickle cell disease:

- **Definition**: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia and end-organ damage.

- **Pathophysiology**: SCD is caused by a mutation in the sixth amino acid of the β-globin gene. Polymerization of abnormal hemoglobin leads to vascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia, which precipitate a cascade of pathologic events. These include vascular-endothelial dysfunction, functional nitric oxide deficiency, hypercoagulability, increased neutrophil adhesiveness, and platelet activation.

- **Epidemiology**: In the United States, the prevalence of SCD is estimated at 30 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Central nervous system injury is the most debilitating frequent complication of SCD and includes stroke, silent cerebral infarct, and cognitive impairment. SCD causes vasculopathy, such as pulmonary hypertension, priapism, and retinopathy, and progressive ischemic organ failure, including renal failure, hyposplenism, liver damage, and bone disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, the median age at death is 42 years for females and 38 years for males. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment but is not feasible for the vast majority of patients suffering from the disease.

### Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease [^114Gf7nr]. Haematologica (2019). High credibility.

Targeting intracellular sickle red blood cell oxidative changes involves antioxidant therapy. Red blood cells (RBCs) are oxygen carriers, which places them in constant danger from the cumulative impact of reactive oxygen species and free radicals formed by oxygen and hemoglobin metabolism inside the RBCs. Sickle RBCs, due to their unique intracellular milieu with high concentrations of HbS forming and re-forming polymers, are at increased risk of oxidative damage. L-glutamine is an amino acid and a precursor used in the synthesis of glutathione and reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide diphosphate, which can protect the sickle RBC from oxidative damage.

A recent multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (NCT01179217) found that oral administration of pharmaceutical-grade L-glutamine (Endari™) reduced the number of vaso-occlusive events and episodes of acute chest syndrome and hospital admissions compared to those in placebo-treated children and adults with SCD. In 2017, Endari™ received orphan drug status and is FDA-approved to reduce acute complications of SCD in patients 5 years or older. However, there remain concerns among many providers regarding the limitations of the study leading to approval for Endari™, along with its potentially prohibitive cost, limited insurance coverage, and twice-daily powder form, which may reduce adherence.

Another antioxidant agent, N-acetylcysteine, maintains and replenishes glutathione, which is an intracellular antioxidant and scavenger of reactive oxygen species. In a phase II trial, N-acetylcysteine reduced vaso-occlusive episodes.

### Inflammatory mediators promote strong sickle cell adherence to endothelium under venular flow conditions [^112JkrhB]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). High credibility.

The adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium in venules is thought to initiate or propagate vaso-occlusive episodes. Due to blood shear forces with normal microvascular flow, adherence in post-capillary venules requires binding via high-affinity receptor-mediated pathways. In sickle patients, microvascular flow is episodic, even in asymptomatic individuals, so adherence may also occur at low shear, not requiring high-affinity binding.

Sickle cell binding to the endothelium was quantified under flow or static incubation with unusually large vWF, thrombospondin, alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1, or alpha(4)beta(1)/fibronectin (FN). Adherence under flow at 0.5 dyne/cm² shear stress leads to the greatest number of adherent sickle cells. Adherence under flow at 1.0 dyne/cm² leads to the strongest adherence. Static incubation conditions promote weak adherence of low numbers of sickle cells to the endothelium.

Following attachment at 1.0 dyne/cm², adherence strength was 2.5 ± 0.1 or 2.6 ± 0.2 dynes/cm² for alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1 or alpha(4)beta(1)/FN pathways, a level 50% greater than adherence strength mediated by thrombospondin or ULvWF (1.7 ± 0.08 or 1.6 ± 0.07 dynes/cm², respectively). Sickle cell adhesion promoted by the simultaneous activation of alpha(4)beta(1)/VCAM-1 and alpha(4)beta(1)/FN pathways is the strongest at 6.2 ± 0.2 dynes/cm², and adherent red cells resist detachment shear stresses up to 10 dynes/cm².

These data demonstrate that sickle cell adhesion to the endothelium is regulated both by receptor/ligand affinity and flow conditions. Thus, both microvascular flow and specific receptor-ligand interactions play a critical role in sickle cell adherence.

### Multiple inducers of endothelial NOS (eNOS) dysfunction in sickle cell disease [^115a7cjj]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

Within the exceedingly complex pathobiology of SCD, there are ten identifiable factors that have been shown, largely in other contexts, to adversely impact eNOS function. At present, it is impossible to identify a single, dominant ECD-inducing agent at which therapy perhaps could be directed. If specific endothelial-sparing therapeutics are considered, this would seem to argue for the application of agents known to exert multiple beneficial effects upon the endothelial cell's biology or for the use of a combination of agents.

In SCD, observation of abnormal flow-mediated dilation, the clinical test commonly used to detect ECD, could plausibly derive from true eNOS dysfunction (as reviewed herein) or from either of the two noted examples of ECD mimicry.

### Epinephrine-induced activation of LW-mediated sickle cell adhesion and vaso-occlusion in vivo [^111Qmk9k]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle red cell (SS RBC) adhesion is believed to contribute to the process of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease (SCD). We previously found that the LW RBC adhesion receptor can be activated by epinephrine to mediate SS RBC adhesion to endothelial alphavbeta3 integrin. To determine the contribution of LW activation to vaso-occlusive events in vivo, we investigated whether in vitro treatment of SS RBCs by epinephrine resulted in vaso-occlusion in intact microvasculature after RBC infusion into nude mice. Epinephrine enhanced human SS but not normal RBC adhesion to murine endothelial cells in vitro and to endothelium in vivo, promoting vaso-occlusion and RBC organ sequestration.

Murine sickle RBCs also responded to epinephrine with increased adhesion to postcapillary endothelium in nude mice. Epinephrine-induced SS RBC adhesion, vaso-occlusion, and RBC organ trapping could be prevented by the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonist propranolol. Infusion of soluble recombinant LW also significantly reduced adhesion and vaso-occlusion. In addition, epinephrine-treated SS RBCs induced activation of murine leukocyte adhesion to endothelium as well.

In conclusion, LW activation by epinephrine via beta-AR stimulation can promote both SS RBC and leukocyte adhesion as well as vaso-occlusion, suggesting that both epinephrine and LW play potentially pathophysiological roles in SCD.

### Management of vasoocclusive pain events in sickle cell disease [^113EXuW6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Vasoocclusive pain events (VOEs) are the primary cause of morbidity and account for most emergency department visits and hospitalizations for patients with SCD in the United States and Europe. The nature of VOE makes its management extremely challenging. There are no large controlled trials of analgesic regimens for VOE, and smaller trials have generally failed to produce an optimal course of therapy. Therefore, treatment recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and anecdotal experience. Although VOEs are not life-threatening, inadequate treatment may result in unnecessary morbidity and life-threatening complications. Health care providers caring for patients with SCD must be well informed about the management of VOE. This continuing medical education article will provide a summary of the management of acute pain events in SCD with particular emphasis on adequate analgesia.

### Low-molecular-weight heparins for managing vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease [^116Eeza2]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease is one of the most common and severe genetic disorders worldwide. It can be broadly divided into two distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by either haemolysis or vaso-occlusion. Pain is the most prominent symptom of vaso-occlusion, and hypercoagulability is a well-established pathogenic phenomenon in people with sickle cell disease. Low-molecular-weight heparins might control this hypercoagulable state through their anticoagulant effect. This is an update of a previously published version of this review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of low-molecular-weight heparins for managing vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches. We also searched abstract books of conference proceedings and several online trials registries for ongoing trials. The date of the last search was 28 September 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled clinical trials and controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of low-molecular-weight heparins in the management of vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses were carried out independently by the two review authors.

### Vasoactive and antifibrotic properties of cannabinoids and applications to vasospastic/vaso-occlusive disorders: A systematic review [^114xdi2t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The management of vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders is a complex challenge, with treatments showing varied success. Cannabinoids have demonstrated both vasodilatory and antifibrotic properties, which present potential mechanisms for therapeutic relief. No existing review examines these effects in peripheral circulation in relation to vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders. This study aims to investigate the vasodilatory and antifibrotic properties of cannabinoids in peripheral vasculature for application in vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders affecting the hand.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted by two independent reviewers across PubMed, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL to identify studies in accordance with the determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Information regarding study design, medication, dosage, and hemodynamic or antifibrotic effects were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study findings as appropriate.

- **Results**: A total of 584 articles were identified, and 32 were selected for inclusion. Studies were grouped by effect type: hemodynamic (n = 17, 53%) and antifibrotic (n = 15, 47%). Vasodilatory effects, including reduced perfusion pressure, increased functional capillary density, inhibition of vessel contraction, and increased blood flow, were reported in 82% of studies. Antifibrotic effects, including reduced dermal thickening, reduced collagen synthesis, and reduced fibroblast migration, were reported in 100% of studies.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, cannabinoids were found to have vasodilatory and antifibrotic effects, suggesting their potential application in managing vasospastic and vaso-occlusive disorders affecting the hand.

### Acute colonic pseudoobstruction in a child with sickle cell disease treated with neostigmine [^115mi4WT]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a disorder that produces significant morbidity and mortality. Vaso-occlusive pain crises are the most common presenting symptom associated with sickle cell patients. A rare, yet important complication of sickle cell disease to recognize is acute colonic pseudoobstruction, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome. These patients may present with symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from other etiologies of abdominal pain, but a thorough diagnostic workup can provide important clues. Furthermore, there is no agreement on optimal treatment of pseudoobstruction. We report the first pediatric case of acute pseudoobstruction secondary to sickle cell disease that was treated successfully with neostigmine. Early recognition of this phenomenon is important as it alters patient management, can be treated medically, and may avoid unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Current and future status of beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension [^113ZnnoC]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension by all Joint National Committees (JNCs) for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) from the first to the last (JNC-7) in 2003. However, several investigators have recently raised questions regarding the antihypertensive effectiveness and safety of these drugs. The Medline literature on this subject was searched and pertinent studies were retrieved. Additional pertinent references from existing publications were also collected and analyzed up to 2007. Furthermore, a historical perspective on the discovery of beta-blockers and their mechanism of action is provided.

- **Clinical trials**: Most of the reviewed short-term and long-term clinical trials demonstrate an effective and safe antihypertensive pattern for beta-blockers.

- **Weaknesses**: The adverse effects identified include the impact of older beta-blockers on glucose control and stroke protection, particularly in older individuals. These adverse effects are attributed to their mechanism of action and BP effectiveness.

Based on the evidence presented, beta-blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs and should still be recommended as first-line therapy in most uncomplicated hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other drugs. However, there are reservations regarding their administration to diabetic and older hypertensive patients. Nevertheless, when compelling indications for their use exist, they should not be withheld.

### Mechanisms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated venodilation in humans [^115S5pYq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors results in both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent venodilation, but results of former studies are inconsistent. This study was designed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of isoproterenol (INN, isoprenaline)-induced venodilation by investigating dorsal hand vein responses.

- **Methods**: In phenylephrine-constricted veins, isoproterenol (2–514 ng/min) was infused with and without oral pretreatment with 1 g acetylsalicylic acid (n = 7) or 5 mg of the selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist bisoprolol (n = 7). In addition, isoproterenol was co-infused with the nitric oxide inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) (6.3 micromol/min [n = 6]), with selective blockers of calcium (Ca(++))-dependent potassium (K(+)) channels (tetraethylammonium, 300 microg/min [n = 6]) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K(+) channels (glyburide [INN, glibenclamide], 20 microg/min [n = 6]) or with the cyclic guanosine monophosphate inhibitor methylene blue (13 microg/min [n = 6]). Finally, L-NMMA was co-infused with potassium chloride (20 mmol/L) to inhibit hyperpolarization (n = 6).

- **Results**: Isoproterenol induced dose-dependent venodilation to 67.4% ± 6.8%. Oral pretreatment with bisoprolol (P = 0.340) or acetylsalicylic acid (P = 0.760) did not affect isoproterenol-induced venodilation. Coinfusion of isoproterenol and L-NMMA relaxed the veins to the same extent as in the presence of isoproterenol alone. Neither inhibition of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (P = 0.196) nor blockade of Ca(++) channels produced significant changes.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^111rynwn]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

**Multi-agent rationale**: As amply demonstrated by malignancies, agents with insufficient efficacy individually may contribute significant benefits when used in a multi-drug regimen. In SCA (sickle cell anemia), a wealth of potential targets reside within a multi-faceted pathobiology. Yet, its vast complexity could mean that therapeutic efficacy from multiple agents will be maximized if they converge upon the same "chokepoint" step in pathobiology. One of these, targeting HbS polymerization, already receives much attention. Here, as our example, we propose targeting another: ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) pathophysiology.

### Tramadol infusion for the pain management in sickle cell disease: A case report [^113jZB5n]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

We present the analgesic management of a 4-year-old child who suffered from severe abdominal and leg pain during his first vaso-occlusive crisis with sickle cell disease, diagnosed as beta/S disease when he was 1 year old. His mother and father were carriers of beta-thalassemia and hemoglobin S, respectively. He had an upper respiratory tract infection which precipitated a vaso-occlusive crisis. On admission to the hospital, fever, and severe abdominal and leg pain were noted. Hemoglobin was 4 g/dL with accompanying prominent reticulocytosis and acute spleen enlargement. These findings indicated a sequestration crisis as well as vaso-occlusive disease. He was transfused with packed red cells.

Paracetamol (40–60 mg/kg/day) and ibuprofen (20 mg/kg/day) were administered to relieve pain. The child experienced moderate to severe pain (Oucher score 60–80) despite nonopioid analgesics, so a tramadol infusion (0.25 mg/kg/h) was started. During the tramadol infusion, no morphine was required; the intensity of pain gradually decreased (Oucher score 20) and the child was able to move his legs. At the end of 3 days, splenomegaly regressed, and no fever and pain were observed, so the infusion was stopped.

In conclusion, tramadol infusion intravenously (0.25 mg/kg/h) combined with nonopioids was effective in relieving moderate to severe pain due to the vaso-occlusive crisis and can be recommended before using morphine in pediatric sickle cell crisis.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^112fER4e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **I/R as a target**: The physical chemistry of HbS dictates that most RBCs cannot sickle within the microvasculature unless their transit time is slowed to overcome the two relevant delay times [2, 3]. Such slowing from blood cell adhesion to the vascular wall [4, 5, 6, 7] requires an adhesion-engendering endothelial surface, in turn requiring inflammation. It has been proposed — and supported experimentally — that I/R (ischemia/reperfusion) is what provokes the robust inflammatory state of SCA (sickle cell anemia). This is reviewed thoroughly elsewhere [8]. Briefly, I/R is the physiology of resolving vascular occlusion, triggered by the restoration of flow and, therefore, oxygen availability [9, 10]. It is unlike hypoxia or unresolved occlusion. In general medicine, I/R underlies consequences of large vessel occlusive events, such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [9, 10]. In SCA, however, I/R probably arises from recurring, smaller, multifocal occlusive events [8]. In particular, I/R in SCA establishes cyclicity to incessantly drive inflammation. In this sense, I/R assumes Janus-like status, comprising both the beginning and the end of the core pathobiologic vector (Figure 1).

	- **Figure 1**: The vicious cycle of SCA, with ischemia/reperfusion pathophysiology as the driver of incessant, systemic inflammation.

- **Initiation of I/R**: Experimental models revealed that I/R initiation involves several prominent actors at the local site of the ischemic event: oxidant generation, NFκB activation, endothelial activation, TNF elaboration, sentinel cell activation (resident macrophages, mast cells), and leukocyte infiltration.

A final challenge: faith-based medicine?

Some may believe that attempting to target the SCA risk state, in the manner described herein, would be "faith-based medicine". Not so, if we believe that clinical disease is actually caused by pathophysiology. Our three-drug example targeting I/R initiation is founded on abundant basic science data providing rationale, unambiguous demonstration of meaningful biological efficacy in sickle mice, and prior regulatory approval, as well as wide clinical use, and established track records. Arguably, this justifies a more favorable benefit-to-risk expectation than is available for newly emergent drugs.

As for all new approaches, the question of whether this will translate into actual clinical benefit can only be answered via clinical application. It remains possible that even successful targeting of the underlying SCA pathophysiology could exhibit another parallel to atherosclerosis. Statins target underlying pathophysiology, but it requires long time periods to see efficacy at the clinical level. With this possibility in mind, should a multi-drug regimen targeting the SCA risk state be tried long term? This has ventured into "faith based medicine". Yet, perhaps we must ask: should the approach be tried, or should anticipated benefits be foregone due to risk aversion? This too needs discussion.

### SPL drug information for nadolol [^112hBSAh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nadolol PO (also known as Corgard):

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Use caution in vasospastic angina, as β-blockers without alpha1-blocking activity can cause unopposed coronary vasoconstriction, worsening symptoms.
- **Exacerbation of bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic diseases, as nadolol may impair bronchodilation by blocking beta2 receptors; its use is generally discouraged.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: Use caution in patients with compensated HF. Monitor closely for signs of decompensation, and discontinue gradually if HF develops.
- **Exacerbation of muscle weakness, double vision**: Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.
- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Use caution in patients with psoriasis.
- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon, peripheral vascular disease**: Use caution in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders, including Raynaud's disease or syndrome and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.
- **Hypertension**: Use extreme caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Ensure adequate α-blockade is achieved before initiating nadolol to prevent a paradoxical increase in BP.
- **Major surgery**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-blockers should not be routinely withdrawn before major surgery, but their effect on adrenergic response may increase anesthesia and surgical risks.
- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of β-blocker therapy to prevent symptom exacerbation or the precipitation of a thyroid storm.

### Potential risks of chronic sildenafil use for priapism in sickle cell disease [^114gFkHN]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Priapism is a common concern in sickle cell disease. With a high frequency of recurrences and serious long-term sequelae, a preventative, rather than traditionally reactive approach, needs to be taken in these patients. Reports have shown successful use of sildenafil as a prophylactic treatment but have failed to address adverse outcomes, including vaso-occlusive pain crises, of chronic sildenafil therapy in sickle cell patients.

- **Aims**: We wish to draw attention to the potential adverse outcomes of this therapy on the overall state of the patient's disease for consideration in future studies.

- **Methods**: We used sildenafil in a patient suffering from almost daily attacks of priapism.

- **Results**: Sildenafil was successful in decreasing the frequency of priapism; however, our patient experienced an increased frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, something not previously addressed.

- **Conclusion**: Future studies of sildenafil use in sickle cell disease need to assess the global state of the disease, not just the frequency of priapism.

### Mental stress causes vasoconstriction in subjects with sickle cell disease and in normal controls [^112Wpc83]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) and occurs when deoxygenated sickled red blood cells occlude the microvasculature. Any stimulus, such as mental stress, which decreases microvascular blood flow will increase the likelihood of red cell entrapment, resulting in local vaso-occlusion and progression to VOC. Neurally mediated vasoconstriction might be the physiological link between crisis triggers and vaso-occlusion.

In this study, we determined the effect of mental stress on microvascular blood flow and autonomic nervous system reactivity. Sickle cell patients and controls performed mentally stressful tasks, including a memory task, conflict test, and pain anticipation test. Blood flow was measured using photoplethysmography, autonomic reactivity was derived from electrocardiography, and perceived stress was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire.

Stress tasks induced a significant decrease in microvascular blood flow, parasympathetic withdrawal, and sympathetic activation in all subjects. Of the various tests, pain anticipation caused the highest degree of vasoconstriction. The magnitude of vasoconstriction, sympathetic activation, and perceived stress was greater during the Stroop conflict test than during the N-back memory test, indicating the relationship between the magnitude of experimental stress and the degree of regional vasoconstriction. Baseline anxiety had a significant effect on the vasoconstrictive response in sickle cell subjects but not in controls.

In conclusion, mental stress caused vasoconstriction and autonomic nervous system changes in both sickle cell patients and normal controls.

### Impaired hemoglobin clearance by sinusoidal endothelium promotes vaso-occlusion and liver injury in sickle cell disease [^1138d9mM]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

We hypothesized that exacerbated LSEC senescence can promote vaso-occlusion and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-associated chronic liver injury. As we found more pronounced LSEC senescence in clodronate-treated sickle cell disease (SCD) mouse liver, we analyzed liver injury in these animals compared to untreated SCD mice. We found a significant increase in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase in clodronate-treated SCD mice compared to untreated SCD mice, which is indicative of exacerbated liver injury in clodronate-treated SCD mice (Online Supplementary Figure S3F). Furthermore, sinusoidal congestion and increased liver injury were more pronounced in clodronate-treated SCD mice than in untreated ones, as shown by staining hepatic tissue with hematoxylin and eosin (Figure 6E).

- **Sirius red and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining**: Revealed more collagen deposition and activated myofibroblasts in the clodronate-treated SCD mouse livers than in untreated ones, suggesting more severe liver fibrosis in the clodronate-treated animals.

- **qLIM analysis**: As shown by qLIM (Figure 6F), SCD mice manifested a loss of blood flow in several regions of the liver at baseline due to sinusoidal vaso-occlusion. Following treatment with clodronate liposomes, SCD mice showed a further increase in areas with vaso-occlusion (Figure 6F; Online Supplementary Figure S4A, Online Supplementary Movies S7 and S8).

- **Depletion of hepatic Küpffer cells**: Resulted in similar enhancement of hepatic senescence (Online Supplementary Figure S4C, D).

### Reduction in vaso-occlusive events following stem cell transplantation in patients with sickle cell disease [^112rbVSf]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Two hundred and three patients with SCD underwent allogeneic HSCT at either the NIH (N = 113) or the CNH (N = 90) between 2005 and 2019. Forty patients were excluded from the analysis due to incomplete documentation (N = 22) or less than 2 years of follow-up at the time of data analysis (N = 18). One hundred sixty-three patients with SCD were included in the analysis. Sixty percent (N = 98) of the patients were male (P < 0.001). Ninety-one percent (N = 148) had HbSS (P < 0.001). The average age at the time of HSCT was 21 years (range, 7 months-64 years). Most patients received nonmyeloablative conditioning (75%, N = 123, P < 0.001) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor (72%, N = 118, P < 0.001).

At the time of data collection, there were 16 deaths reported in 203 patients who were treated between 2005 and 2019. Of these, 9 died within 2 years of transplantation and 1 died after 2 years but had incomplete pretransplant documentation. Therefore, these patients were not included in the analysis. For patients with greater than 2 years of follow-up, the average time to death was 81 months (range, 54–137 months) due to gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or infection/sepsis. Details regarding the 40 patients who were excluded from the analysis, including those who died with less than 2 years of follow-up data, are included in supplemental Table S2.

- **Pain**: Pain was the most frequently reported SCD-related comorbid condition before HSCT (55%, N = 89), followed by acute chest syndrome (ACS) (37%, N = 60).

### Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease [^1135vwwJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In people with sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells cause the occlusion of small blood vessels, presenting as episodes of severe pain known as pain crises or vaso-occlusive crises. The pain can occur in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body, and may last several hours to days. Pain relief during crises includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. The efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in pain crises has been a subject of controversy; hypotheses have suggested a beneficial response due to its vasodilator properties, yet no conclusive evidence has been presented. This review aimed to evaluate the available randomized controlled studies addressing this topic.

- **Objectives**: To capture the body of evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease. Additionally, to assess the relevance, robustness, and validity of the treatment to better guide medical practice in the fields of hematology and palliative care, since recent literature seems to favor the involvement of palliative care for such people.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We searched for unpublished work in the abstract books of the European Haematology Association conference, the American Society of Hematology conference, the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting, the Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings, and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program Annual Meeting.

### P-selectin mediates the adhesion of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium [^113p5ES6]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

The adherence of sickle red blood cells (RBCs) to the vascular endothelium may contribute to painful vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell adherence involves several receptor-mediated processes and may be potentiated by the up-regulated expression of adhesion molecules on activated endothelial cells. Recent results showed that thrombin rapidly increases the adhesivity of endothelial cells for sickle erythrocytes. The report presents the first evidence for the novel adhesion of normal and, to a greater extent, sickle RBCs to endothelial P-selectin.

- **Interaction studies**: Studies of the possible interaction of erythrocytes with P-selectin revealed that either P-selectin blocking monoclonal antibodies or sialyl Lewis tetrasaccharide inhibits the enhanced adherence of normal and sickle cells to thrombin-treated endothelial cells. Both RBC types also adhere to immobilized recombinant P-selectin. Pretreating erythrocytes with sialidase reduces their adherence to activated endothelial cells and to immobilized recombinant P-selectin.

Herein, the first evidence is presented for the binding of normal or sickle erythrocytes to P-selectin. This novel finding suggests that P-selectin inhibition be considered as a potential approach to therapy for the treatment of painful vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease.

### The role of beta-blockers as a cornerstone of cardiovascular therapy [^115f3q9S]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The beta-adrenergic blockade as a therapeutic approach first emerged in the 1950s. Over the past five decades, the total number of indications that have been suggested, alongside the remarkable number approved by regulatory agencies, positions beta-blockade far ahead of all competing treatments, not only in the cardiovascular area but in all of therapeutics. Differentiation of beta-adrenergic blocking agents has been made on the basis of beta1 selectivity, duration of action, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, lipophilicity, and whether or not the beta-adrenergic blocking action is accompanied by an alpha-adrenergic blocking action.

With the development of nebivolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent that also activates nitric oxide synthase in blood vessels, a new therapeutic option has emerged. Endothelial dysfunction with loss of nitric oxide production is a common feature in many cardiovascular diseases. This fascinating class of drugs continues to provide us with new and important therapeutic opportunities.

### Advances in vasospasm treatment and prevention [^113mTo7w]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

The outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) depends on several factors, including the severity of the initial event, perioperative medical management, surgical variables, and the incidence of complications. Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is unable to consistently respond to treatment, emphasizing the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of SAH-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. To this end, our paper reviews the relevant literature on the main therapies employed for CV after aSAH and discusses possible avenues for future investigations. Management of this condition consists of maximal medical therapy, including the triple H regimen and oral administration of calcium antagonists, followed by endovascular balloon angioplasty and/or injection of vasodilatory agents for refractory cases. As the precise pathophysiology of CV is further elucidated, the development of promising investigational therapies will follow.

### Longitudinal assessment of adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 at steady state and during vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease [^111BEto2]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex multisystem organ condition characterized by frequent and unpredictable vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) and significant phenotypic variability. The lack of reliable biomarkers to objectively define VOCs in SCD has hindered the development and FDA approval of SCD-modifying therapies. Therefore, there is a need to identify and validate blood-based prognostic biomarkers to similarly stratify individuals at the highest risk for vaso-occlusive complications earlier in the disease progression to prevent acute VOC, vasculopathy, and other end-organ events.

More than 100 biomarkers have been identified in SCD, although none have been shown to reliably predict VOCs. Pathologic adhesive interactions of sickle erythrocytes (SSRBCs) to the vascular endothelium contribute to VOCs, resulting in impaired microvascular blood flow, tissue ischemia, severe pain, and end-organ damage. Static and flow-based adhesion assays have been used for decades to describe adhesion in SCD since earlier studies demonstrated that SSRBCs are more adherent than non-sickle erythrocytes and observed a link between SSRBC adhesion and SCD severity. Since then, numerous adhesion receptor/ligand pairs, expressed on sickle blood cells, endothelial cells, and the subendothelial matrix that mediate pathologic adhesion in SCD, have been identified. Of these, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4 or alpha4beta1) is among the most well-characterized adhesion receptors in SCD. VLA-4 is expressed on immature red blood cells, which results in increased adhesiveness to the vascular endothelium.

### Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease [^112sRWgk]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide, including approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are numerous and arise due to complex pathological pathways downstream of a point mutation in DNA. These include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia, pain, and ultimately the risk of cumulative organ damage, which reduces the lifespan of affected individuals.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies can be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. As of the time of writing, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children. Gene therapy has significantly ameliorated the condition in a handful of subjects, although they have only limited follow-up thus far.

During a period when over 20 agents were approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine), despite its higher prevalence. This trajectory appears to be changing. The lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry. In the last decade, they have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction.

### Targeting sickle cell disease root-cause pathophysiology with small molecules [^114BHEzY]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) demands practical, accessible oral therapies due to its global impact. It affects millions worldwide, with a particularly high prevalence in pediatric populations in low-income, malaria-belt countries. Developing such therapies is technically feasible as SCD has a single, well-characterized root cause: the polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The hemoglobin molecule comprises two alpha-like and two beta-like protein subunits (α₂β₂), each with a heme moiety for oxygen transport. In SCD, the gene for the beta subunit (HBB) of adult hemoglobin (HbA) contains an 'A' to 'T' mutation in the seventh codon. This mutation results in beta subunits (βS) that substitute a hydrophilic glutamate with a hydrophobic valine, predisposing deoxygenated HbS (α₂βS₂) to polymerization and gelation within red blood cells (RBCs). Consequently, RBC viability, rheology, and adhesiveness are compromised, leading to hemolysis, endothelial damage, occlusion of small blood vessels, and thromboses of large vessels.

The hemolytic anemia is frequently severe and is only partially and non-sustainably compensated by more than tenfold increases in erythropoiesis. The net effect of anemia and vaso-occlusion is decreased oxygen delivery and hypoxic injury to potentially all tissues, clinically manifesting as episodic pain, chronic pain, avascular necrosis of bones, infections, overt and silent strokes, and renal/respiratory complications.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic complications of sickle cell disease [^1153PTnG]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive abnormality of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin (Hb), resulting in poorly deformable sickled cells that cause microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. The spleen is almost always affected by SCD, with microinfarcts within the first 36 months of life resulting in splenic atrophy. Acute liver disorders causing right-sided abdominal pain include acute vaso-occlusive crisis, liver infarction, and acute hepatic crisis. Chronic liver disease might be due to hemosiderosis and hepatitis, and possibly to SCD itself if small, clinically silent microvascular occlusions occur chronically.

Black pigment gallstones caused by elevated bilirubin excretion are common. Their small size permits them to travel into the common bile duct but cause only low-grade obstruction, so hyperbilirubinemia rather than bile duct dilatation is typical. Whether cholecystectomy should be done in asymptomatic individuals is controversial. The most common laboratory abnormality is an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin level. Bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels correlate with one another, suggesting that chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, rather than liver disease, are the sources of hyperbilirubinemia.

Abdominal pain is very common in SCD and is usually due to sickling, which resolves with supportive care. Computed tomography scans might be ordered for severe or unremitting pain. The liver typically shows sickled erythrocytes and Kupffer cell enlargement acutely, and hemosiderosis chronically.

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^113tw7oQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications traditionally considered "cardioprotective". However, their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. In contrast, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta-blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated, systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which reassessed the place of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.

### Resolution of sickle cell disease-associated inflammation and tissue damage with 17-resolvin D1 [^1137VQAR]. Blood (2019). High credibility.

Resolvins (Rvs), endogenous lipid mediators, play a key role in the resolution of inflammation. Sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic disorder of hemoglobin, is characterized by inflammatory and vaso-occlusive pathologies. We document altered proresolving events following hypoxia/reperfusion in humanized SCD mice. We demonstrate novel protective actions of 17 R-resolvin D1 (17 R-RvD1; 7 S, 8 R, 17 R-trihydroxy-4 Z, 9 E, 11 E, 13 Z, 15 E, 19 Z-docosahexaenoic acid) in reducing ex vivo human SCD blood leukocyte recruitment by microvascular endothelial cells and in vivo neutrophil adhesion and transmigration.

In SCD mice exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation, oral administration of 17 R-RvD1 reduces systemic and local inflammation and vascular dysfunction in the lung and kidney. The mechanism of action of 17 R-RvD1 involves:

- **Enhancement of SCD erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocyte efferocytosis** and blunting of NF-κB activation.
- **Reduction in inflammatory cytokines**: vascular activation markers, and E-selectin expression.

Thus, 17 R-RvD1 might represent a new therapeutic strategy for the inflammatory vasculopathy of SCD.

### How carvedilol activates β-adrenoceptors [^111QBzgL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of drug action is not a prerequisite for a drug to obtain approval from regulatory authorities, but it provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making throughout all stages of the drug discovery process. Conversely, if the mechanism of drug action remains enigmatic, or if consensus is lacking on how precisely a drug alters the function of its protein target, the molecular basis for therapeutic efficacy will remain obscure.

Carvedilol, a widely prescribed cardiovascular medication, is a case in point. It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta receptor blockers (β-blockers), which are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. β-blockers are particularly effective in patients where myocardial damage is associated with overstimulation of β-adrenoceptors (βARs). βARs are prototypical class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the targets for the majority of prescription drugs in clinical use. They are also among the most powerful regulators of cardiac function and are the primary targets for the endogenous catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which act as neurotransmitters and hormones to control heart rate and blood pressure. β-blockers oppose the stimulating effects of catecholamines, which explains their efficacy in the clinic to reduce heart rate and contractility and, consequently, lower cardiac oxygen demand.

### A scientific renaissance: Novel drugs in sickle cell disease [^114r5VgQ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

We have entered an era of growing interest in therapeutics for sickle cell disease. The expansion in our understanding of sickle cell disease pathophysiology has broadened the range of potential therapeutic targets. From the induction of fetal hemoglobin to anti-adhesion molecules, we could potentially be on the cusp of making life-altering modifications for individuals with sickle cell disease. This disease population cannot afford to let the momentum wane. Studies exploring combinations of therapies affecting multiple steps in the pathophysiology and exploring novel and clinically relevant outcomes are essential.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^115FW9K4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that affects up to 100,000 people in the United States. The abnormality resides in the hemoglobin molecule with the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the beta globin chain. The resultant abnormal hemoglobin (called sickle hemoglobin or HbS) is less soluble than the wild type and forms a polymer upon deoxygenation, resulting in a shape change from the normal red cell disk to an elongated sickle form. SCD occurs when the HbS mutation is homozygous or is coinherited with another beta globin chain gene mutation, such as beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C. Patients with SCD have chronic hemolytic anemia and intermittent episodes of vaso-occlusion of small blood vessels, leading to acute pain episodes, as well as acute and chronic injury to the lungs, heart, kidneys, bone, and central nervous system.

When preparing a patient with SCD for surgery, there are many factors to consider. Intraoperatively, surgery may lead to hypotension, acidosis, hypoxia, frequent exposure to low temperatures, vasoconstriction, venous stasis, and increased stress, all of which can promote increased sickling and potentially induce vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, patients with SCD have higher risks of perioperative infection due to functional asplenia, and increased risk of perioperative thrombosis as a result of the underlying hypercoagulable state. Preoperative planning is required to help minimize the risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

### Nebivolol: The somewhat-different beta-adrenergic receptor blocker [^115FFYMZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although its clinical use in Europe dates back almost 10 years, nebivolol is a beta-blocker that has been only recently introduced in the U.S. market. Like carvedilol, nebivolol belongs to the third generation of beta-blockers, which possess direct vasodilator properties in addition to their adrenergic blocking characteristics. Nebivolol has the highest beta(1)-receptor affinity among beta-blockers and, most interestingly, it substantially improves endothelial dysfunction via its strong stimulatory effects on the activity of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase and via its antioxidative properties. Because impaired endothelial activity is attributed a major causal role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, the endothelium-agonistic properties of nebivolol suggest that this drug might provide additional benefit beyond beta-receptor blockade.

Although lesser beta-blocker-related side effects have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or impotence taking nebivolol, side effects and contraindications overlap those of other beta-blockers. Clinically, this compound has been proven to have antihypertensive and anti-ischemic effects as well as beneficial effects on hemodynamics and prognosis in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Further studies are now necessary to compare the benefit of nebivolol with that of other drugs in the same class and, most importantly, its prognostic impact in patients with hypertension.

### Vasoactive factors in sickle cell disease: In vitro evidence for endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstriction [^113zZwci]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

While systemic plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels are increased during acute crisis in sickle cell disease, the relative levels of potent vasoactive factors that contribute to the regulation of vascular function, such as ET-1, NO, and cell-free hemoglobin, during the course of periodic vaso-occlusive episodes remain unclear. Moreover, whether and to what extent sickling-induced release of ET-1 alters vascular tone is not completely understood.

To investigate the sequential changes in circulating vasoactive factors, we measured plasma ET-1, NO metabolites (NOx), and cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) before (steady-state), during (crisis), and following a vaso-occlusive (post-crisis) episode. Steady-state ET-1 levels (fmol/mL) increased from 2.3 ± 0.4 to 11.0 ± 1.4 and 4.2 ± 1.0 during crisis and post-crisis periods, respectively. There was no significant difference in plasma NOx levels. Cell-free Hb levels were significantly higher in sickle cell patients in all phases compared to the control group, and especially during crisis, cell-free Hb levels were elevated by 4-fold (209,000 ± 31,000 vs. 46,000 ± 5,300 ng/mL in steady-state).

Conditioned medium from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells exposed to sickled erythrocytes prepared by deoxygenation induced contraction of aortic rings, and this effect was blocked by an ET(A) receptor antagonist. These findings indicate that ET-1 is the predominant contractile factor released by cultured endothelial cells upon exposure to deoxygenated sickled SS erythrocytes, and the ET-1-NO-NO scavenger balance is altered in favor of vasoconstriction.

### Successes and pitfalls in orphan drug development for sickle cell disease [^116xJtzy]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Twenty years of sickle cell orphan drug development has had approximately a 12% success rate, with the highest rates when targeting early pathophysiological steps. Failure rates due to lack of efficacy were highest in the late stages of drug development when vaso-occlusive crisis was the key clinical endpoint.

### Vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease: Pathophysiology and novel targeted therapies [^114ppmh6]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusion are the hallmark of sickle cell disease. Symptomatic management and prevention of these events using the fetal hemoglobin-reactivating agent hydroxyurea are currently the mainstay of treatment. Discoveries over the past two decades have highlighted the important contributions of various cellular and soluble participants in the vaso-occlusive cascade. The role of these elements and the opportunities for therapeutic intervention are summarized in this review.

### Quality assessment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of pregnant women with sickle cell disease using the AGREE II instrument: a systematic review [^114cuFRz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that leads to vaso-occlusive phenomena and hemolysis, alongside numerous potentially life-threatening complications. It is among the most common inherited diseases worldwide and is caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation. Specifically, valine is substituted for glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid of the beta-globin chain, resulting in a poorly soluble hemoglobin variant when deoxygenated. The clinical manifestations, such as vaso-occlusive crises, occur due to the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin S. In pregnant women, SCD is linked to significant maternal morbidity and mortality, with complications including maternal mortality, preeclampsia, eclampsia, venous thromboembolism, cesarean delivery, intrauterine fetal death, and fetal growth restriction.

The prevalence of SCD varies by country. In the United States, data indicate an overall prevalence of approximately 4.83 per 10,000 deliveries, with 28.5% of women with SCD experiencing a crisis during delivery. The maternal mortality rate is reported to be 1.6 per 1,000 deliveries for women with SCD, compared to 0.1 per 1,000 deliveries for those without SCD.

In Saudi Arabia, information on the prevalence of SCD is limited and varies among provinces, with the highest prevalence in the Eastern province, followed by the Southwest province. SCD during pregnancy tends to result in more frequent and severe painful crises.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^115L8Ztg]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Challenges and barriers**: These challenges are several and substantial, and they pertain to any combination of drugs in the universe defined by the nexus we discussed in our initial paragraph. After delineating these challenges, we suggest approaches to their solution.

- **Challenge: Our perceptions are limiting**: The scope of therapeutics considered by our field has been limited by at least three perceptions. We suggest that modification of these perceptions is justifiable and would broaden the universe of therapeutic targets and available drugs worth consideration.

- **Challenge: Defining severity independent of events**: We suspect this can be done via the concept of "robustness". The robustness of the SCA underlying risk state may be quantifiable via the activity level of its causal core biologic process(es), as measured during steady state. Could this be developed and applied as a quantifiable predictor of forward trajectory? Would it enable risk stratification of SCA patients?

- **Events vs. risk state**: Although understandable, our traditional focus upon events (pain crisis, ACS, stroke) restricts the operational definition of efficacy to impacting event occurrence. It may be more helpful — and is pathobiologically more accurate — to emphasize that SCA is not characterized solely by events. Rather, it is a risk state from which events emerge, and substantial pathology progresses regardless of event occurrence. In these respects, SCA is analogous to atherosclerosis in the general population, where disease management requires blunting the underlying risk state.

### Inhaled nitric oxide for treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease [^1139EkdA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

In people with sickle cell disease, sickled red blood cells cause the occlusion of small blood vessels, which presents as episodes of severe pain known as pain crises or vaso-occlusive crises. The pain can occur in the bones, chest, or other parts of the body and may last several hours to days. Pain relief during crises includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. The efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in pain crises has been a controversial issue, and hypotheses have been made suggesting a beneficial response due to its vasodilator properties, yet no conclusive evidence has been presented. This review aims to evaluate the available randomized controlled studies that address this topic.

- **Objectives**: To capture the available body of evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating pain crises in people with sickle cell disease; and to assess the treatment's relevance, robustness, and validity to better guide medical practice in the fields of hematology and palliative care, since recent literature seems to favor the involvement of palliative care for these individuals.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of the European Haematology Association conference, the American Society of Hematology conference, the British Society for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting, the Caribbean Health Research Council Meetings, and the National Sickle Cell Disease Program.

Regarding specific circumstances for sickle-cell disease, particularly concerning pregnant patients (thromboprophylaxis), WHO 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating additional risk factors for thromboembolism in pregnant patients with SCD who are not hospitalized. Such risk factors include prior VTE following vaso-occlusive events. The guidelines advise following local recommendations for initiating thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients with an elevated risk of thrombotic events, considering factors like prior VTE, obesity, and inherited thrombophilia.

### Treatments for priapism in boys and men with sickle cell disease [^1164WwxA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease comprises a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders. The predominant symptom associated with sickle cell disease is pain resulting from the occlusion of small blood vessels by abnormally 'sickle-shaped' red blood cells. Other complications include chronic organ damage and prolonged painful erection of the penis, known as priapism. The severity of sickle cell disease is variable, and treatment is usually symptomatic. Priapism affects up to half of all men with sickle cell disease; however, there is no consistency in treatment. Therefore, we need to determine the best way of treating this complication in order to offer an effective interventional approach to all affected individuals. This is an update of a previously published review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and risks of different treatments for stuttering (repeated short episodes) and fulminant (lasting for six hours or more) priapism in sickle cell disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched trial registries. The date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register was 09 September 2019. The most recent search of trial registries and Embase was on 01 October 2019.

Platelets play a role in sickle cell disease (SCD)-related thromboinflammation through platelet-platelet and platelet-neutrophil interactions. Heeney et al. report on results from a phase 3 international trial studying the efficacy and safety of the P2Y12 (ADP receptor) inhibitor ticagrelor versus placebo for the prevention of SCD crises. Despite successful inhibition of platelet activation, ticagrelor did not decrease the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, underscoring the complexity of factors contributing to SCD-related vaso-occlusion.

### Impact of an individualized pain plan to treat sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive episodes in the emergency department [^115VSkPw]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic hemoglobinopathy associated with several acute and chronic complications that affect multiple organ systems, leading to frequent hospitalizations, poor quality of life, and reduced life expectancy. The leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits for individuals with SCD is acute vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). VOEs occur suddenly and cause acute pain often requiring parenteral opioids, sometimes in high doses. Individuals with SCD report difficulty in obtaining opioid medication, leading to dissatisfaction with ED care. Emergency healthcare providers are reluctant to treat VOEs with high doses of opioids due to the opioid epidemic and state or hospital policies restricting opioid administration. Individuals with SCD are often stigmatized as drug-seeking, resulting in undertreatment of pain.

In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute published evidence-based recommendations to guide ED treatment of VOEs. One important recommendation is the implementation of individualized pain plans (IPPs), which can be written to include patient-specific drug and dose recommendations. Individuals treated with an IPP experienced a greater reduction in pain than those treated with a weight-based opioid protocol. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology recommended using multidisciplinary teams to develop IPPs to treat VOEs and proposed embedding the IPPs in electronic medical records (EMRs).

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116MQuxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **General**: Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent with no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are proportionately decreased. At doses greater than those required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The effects of propranolol are due to selective blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors while leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are found primarily in the heart. The blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of ventricular rate during arrhythmias. The blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve.

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in smooth muscle including vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems.

### Beyond hydroxyurea: New and old drugs in the pipeline for sickle cell disease [^111h2tJj]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of hydroxyurea to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes, sickle cell disease (SCD) continues to be treated primarily with analgesics for pain relief. However, the elucidation of multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to vaso-occlusion and tissue injury in SCD has led to a burgeoning effort to identify new treatment modalities to prevent or ameliorate the consequences of the disease.

The development of new drugs, as well as the investigation of drugs previously used in other settings, has targeted cell adhesion, inflammatory pathways, upregulation of hemoglobin F, hemoglobin polymerization and sickling, coagulation, and platelet activation. Although these efforts have not yet yielded drugs ready for FDA approval, several early studies have been extremely encouraging. Moreover, the marked increase in clinical pharmaceutical research addressing SCD, alongside the new and old drugs in the pipeline, makes it reasonable to expect that new treatments for SCD will soon be available.

### Novel therapies in sickle cell disease [^115FXzBC]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Despite an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD), there remains a paucity of available agents for the prevention and treatment of specific SCD-related complications. Recently, there has been significant progress in the development of novel drugs for this disease. These agents, which increase the production of fetal hemoglobin, improve red blood cell hydration, increase the availability of nitric oxide, and possess anti-inflammatory effects, are in varying stages of clinical development.

With the complex pathophysiology of SCD, it is unlikely that a single agent will prevent or treat all the sequelae of this disease. As a result, patients may benefit from treatment with a combination of agents that possess different mechanisms of action. This overview discusses selected novel agents that appear promising in SCD.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^114RbhCu]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

**Demonstrating biological efficacy**: Few subjects may be needed to demonstrate biological efficacy if longitudinal sampling for an appropriate, biologic, reporter biomarker is used. For example, documenting sulfasalazine's ability to have the effect we sought, such as downregulating the expression of NFκB-dependent endothelial adhesion molecules in SCA, required only three subjects, as illustrated for one in Figure 2B. This approach is analogous to monitoring HbF level as an indicator of desired response to hydroxyurea.

### The missing middle of sickle therapeutics: Multi-agent therapy, targeting risk, using biomarkers [^1162VhDN]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, the SCA "steady state" is anything but steady. In Figure 2A, we illustrate that even subjects with very mild SCA do not exhibit sufficient biomarker instability during a (true) "steady state" for single-timepoint measures to be informative. Combining single-timepoint measures as an "index" simply compounds the potential error. Consequently, we do not even know what the SCA steady state really looks like. Solving this is necessary to construct alternative, valid definitions of severity and to define pre-therapy baselines.

- **Taming the instability of "steady state"**: Figure 2A shows instability of the steady state by biomarkers sampled longitudinally from three historically mild SCA subjects, without symptoms and no acute events more than three months before or after this study. Each symbol type indicates one of the subjects. For each biomarker, the shaded area indicates the range for normal subjects.

- **Testing for efficacy while controlling for instability**: Figure 2B shows the efficacy of oral sulfasalazine for downregulating endothelial adhesion molecule expression in one SCA subject. Activation is expressed as a percentage of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) positive for three adhesion molecules (open symbols) and tissue factor (closed symbol). The steady state baseline is established empirically by all values collected off-drug (the box). Dark bars show days on-drug; the indicated day numbers identify the start and stop dates for the mini-trials. Figure reproduced with permission from Ref. 13.

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of adults with sickle cell disease [^114ETKKc]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of healthcare maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD.

RCTs impacting practices address the use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, the intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria. However, most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied, and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data. While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for the development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies.

This brief review is not a substitute for such processes but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### The effect of hydroxyurea on the coagulation system in sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia intermedia patients: a preliminary study [^111DwmjU]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea (HU) has been shown to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive manifestations in both adults and children with sickle cell disease (SCD), and the induction of hemoglobin F (HbF) is thought to be the underlying mechanism responsible for clinical improvement in some patients. However, there exists no good correlation between the amount of HbF increase and clinical response. Recent studies suggest that increased activity of the coagulation system may be important in the pathogenesis of vascular occlusion in sickle cell disease. To analyze the effect of HU on the coagulation system in children, the authors studied the levels of some coagulation factors and natural inhibitors.

Eleven children who had been treated with HU because of SCD (5 patients), sickle-beta-thalassemia (3 patients), and beta-thalassemia intermedia (3 patients) were enrolled in the study. Levels of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII, and of protein C and protein S, prothrombin times, activated partial thromboplastin times, thrombin times, and reptilase times were measured before the treatment and at the 5th or 6th months of HU therapy when the patients were in a steady-state condition. There was a decrease in all of the coagulation factors except for FIX and FXII and in inhibitors such as protein C and protein S. However, statistically significant decreases were observed only in factor VIII and protein C levels.

The rates of decrease were 54.8% and 12.5% (p = .015 and p = .018) in FVIII and protein C, respectively. This result shows that HU has significant effects on the coagulation system in these patients.

### Acute pancreatitis during sickle cell vaso-occlusive painful crisis [^111GB2JA]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive painful crisis. The vascular occlusion in sickle cell disease is a complex process and accounts for the majority of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Abdominal pain is an important component of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and may mimic diseases such as acute appendicitis and cholecystitis. Acute pancreatitis is rarely included as a cause of abdominal pain in patients with sickle cell disease. When it occurs, it may result from biliary obstruction, but in other instances, it might be a consequence of microvessel occlusion causing ischemia. In this series, we describe four cases of acute pancreatitis in patients with sickle cell disease apparently due to microvascular occlusion and ischemic injury to the pancreas. All patients responded to conservative management. Acute pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in patients with sickle cell disease.

### Activated monocytes in sickle cell disease: Potential role in the activation of vascular endothelium and vaso-occlusion [^111PiCUE]. Blood (2000). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive crises. It is hypothesized that monocytes are activated in sickle cell disease and can enhance vaso-occlusion by activating endothelium. To test this hypothesis, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) with sickle and normal mononuclear leukocytes were incubated, and endothelial activation was measured. Endothelial cells incubated with sickle mononuclear leukocytes were more activated than those incubated with normal mononuclear leukocytes, as judged by the increased endothelial expression of adhesion molecules and tissue factor and the adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Monocytes, not lymphocytes or platelets, were the mononuclear cells responsible for activating endothelial cells. Sickle monocytes triggered endothelial nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation. Cell-to-cell contact of monocytes and endothelium enhanced, but was not required for, activation. Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1beta) blocked activation of the endothelium by monocytes. Peripheral blood monocytes from patients with sickle cell disease had 34% more IL-1beta (P = 0.002) and 139% more TNF-alpha (P = 0.002) per cell than normal monocytes. Sixty percent of sickle monocytes expressed the adhesion molecule ligand CD11b on their surfaces compared with only 20% of normal monocytes (P = 0.002). Serum C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, was increased 12-fold in sickle serum than in normal serum (P = 0.002).

### Endothelial beta3-adrenoreceptors mediate nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation of coronary microvessels in response to the third-generation beta-blocker nebivolol [^114aNwDW]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The therapeutic effects of nonspecific beta-blockers are limited by vasoconstriction, thus justifying the interest in molecules with ancillary vasodilating properties. Nebivolol is a selective beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonist that releases nitric oxide (NO) through incompletely characterized mechanisms. We identified endothelial beta3-adrenoreceptors in human coronary microarteries that mediate endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation and hypothesized that nebivolol activates these beta3-adrenoreceptors.

- **Methods and results**: Nebivolol dose-dependently relaxed rodent coronary resistance microarteries studied by videomicroscopy (10 micromol/L, -86 ± 6% of prostaglandin F2alpha contraction); this was sensitive to NO synthase (NOS) inhibition, unaffected by the beta(1–2)-blocker nadolol, and prevented by the beta(1–2–3)-blocker bupranolol (P < 0.05; n = 3 to 8). Importantly, nebivolol failed to relax microarteries from beta3-adrenoreceptor-deficient mice. Nebivolol (10 micromol/L) also relaxed human coronary microvessels (-71 ± 5% of KCl contraction); this was dependent on a functional endothelium and NO synthase but insensitive to beta(1–2)-blockade (all P < 0.05). In a mouse aortic ring assay of neoangiogenesis, nebivolol induced neocapillary tube formation in rings from wild-type but not beta3-adrenoreceptor- or endothelial NOS-deficient mice. In cultured endothelial cells, 10 micromol/L nebivolol increased NO release by 200% as measured by electron paramagnetic spin trapping, which was also reversed by NOS inhibition. In parallel, endothelial NOS was dephosphorylated.
