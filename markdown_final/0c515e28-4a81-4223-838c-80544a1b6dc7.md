## Question

Reynold's pentad

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Reynolds' pentad in acute cholangitis, including its definition, pathophysiology, diagnostic sensitivity, differential diagnosis, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact definition and historical context. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and why the pentad reflects severe disease. Next, I will examine diagnostic sensitivity and limitations, including how modern guidelines fit in. After that, I need to consider key differentials that can mimic this presentation. Finally, I will outline immediate management priorities and synthesize a practical takeaway for bedside use.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it. Reynolds' pentad consists of Charcot's triad (right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice) plus two additional features indicating systemic sepsis: hypotension and altered mental status, and it is classically associated with acute obstructive cholangitis with septic shock physiology [^113FUext] [^113kxxca].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology linking these features. Obstructing choledocholithiasis or other biliary strictures cause biliary stasis and increased intraductal pressure, allowing bacterial overgrowth and translocation of enteric organisms into the bloodstream, which triggers sepsis with hypotension and encephalopathy; the pentad therefore reflects both local biliary inflammation and systemic septic shock physiology, which is why it portends high mortality without urgent decompression [^113kxxca] [^112xWrHo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic utility. I initially thought the pentad might be a reliable diagnostic criterion, but I should double-check its sensitivity. Contemporary data indicate that the complete pentad is uncommon in practice, with low sensitivity, and relying on it delays recognition; the Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) emphasize a broader constellation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings rather than a rigid pentad, and recent work on acute suppurative cholangitis explicitly notes the low sensitivity of Reynolds' pentad and proposes nomograms to better predict suppurative disease, underscoring that the pentad should be viewed as a severity marker rather than a diagnostic standard [^113kxxca] [^1114LiqG].

> I need to check the differential so I don't anchor on cholangitis alone. Sepsis from other sources can present with fever, hypotension, and altered mentation, and TTP/HUS can mimic sepsis with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis, neurologic changes, and renal dysfunction; importantly, the TTP "pentad" is itself infrequently complete and should not distract from cholangitis when biliary obstruction is present, so I should integrate labs (CBC, LFTs, bilirubin, lactate, blood cultures) and imaging (RUQ ultrasound, MRCP/CT as needed) to distinguish these entities at the bedside [^111d5dDw] [^116m7YCN] [^113kxxca].

> Next, I should review immediate management because timing is life-saving. Severe cholangitis with hypotension or altered mentation requires early goal-directed resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic flora, and urgent biliary decompression within 24 hours, typically via ERCP. If ERCP is not feasible, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) is an acceptable alternative, and delays in source control drive mortality in suppurative cases [^113FUext] [^112xWrHo] [^1114LiqG].

> Let me reconsider how to frame this clinically so it's actionable. The presence of Reynolds' pentad should trigger an automatic sepsis response and expedited biliary intervention rather than a search for the full pentad, because its components reflect organ dysfunction and shock physiology; conversely, its absence does not exclude severe cholangitis, so clinicians should integrate TG18 criteria, labs, and imaging to avoid dangerous delays in decompression and antibiotics [^113FUext] [^113kxxca].

> In summary, I should confirm that Reynolds' pentad remains a useful bedside severity heuristic for acute obstructive cholangitis with septic shock, but it is insensitive and should not be used as a diagnostic gate. Instead, recognize the pattern early, escalate care immediately, and pursue urgent biliary drainage alongside resuscitation and antibiotics to mitigate the high risk of mortality in this fulminant presentation [^116A2CKz] [^113FUext] [^1114LiqG].

---

Reynolds' pentad is the **classic presentation of acute suppurative cholangitis** [^113kxxca], defined by Charcot's triad (fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice) plus hypotension and altered mental status [^112xWrHo]. It signals severe biliary sepsis with high mortality [^113kxxca] and mandates **urgent biliary decompression** (ERCP or PTBD) [^112xWrHo] and broad-spectrum antibiotics [^113FUext]. The pentad is rare but specific; its presence indicates critical illness and the need for immediate intervention [^116A2CKz].

---

## Clinical features of Reynolds' pentad

The five components of Reynolds' pentad are:

| **Component** | **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Fever | Common in cholangitis [^112xWrHo], reflecting systemic infection and inflammation [^notfound] |
| 2 | Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain | Typical of biliary obstruction and inflammation [^116A2CKz] |
| 3 | Jaundice | Indicates biliary obstruction and impaired bile flow [^116A2CKz] |
| 4 | Hypotension | Reflects septic shock and systemic vascular collapse [^notfound] |
| 5 | Altered mental status | Indicates severe sepsis with cerebral hypoperfusion and encephalopathy [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Reynolds' pentad arises from **ascending bacterial infection** of the biliary tree due to obstruction (commonly choledocholithiasis) [^116A2CKz], leading to biliary stasis, increased intraductal pressure, and bacterial proliferation [^112xWrHo]. The resulting sepsis causes hypotension and altered mental status, completing the pentad [^113FUext].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by laboratory and imaging studies:

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), bilirubin, and inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC) [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT to identify biliary obstruction, ductal dilation, or stones; MRCP or ERCP for detailed biliary anatomy and intervention planning [^116A2CKz].
- **Tokyo Guidelines (TG18)**: Provide standardized diagnostic and severity grading for acute cholangitis, emphasizing early recognition and management [^1114LiqG].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Reynolds' pentad signifies **severe cholangitis with septic shock** and carries high mortality if untreated [^113kxxca]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to improving outcomes [^112xWrHo].

---

## Management strategies

Management requires **immediate stabilization** and definitive biliary decompression:

- **Stabilization**: Aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (covering Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms) [^notfound].
- **Biliary decompression**: Urgent ERCP is the gold standard; percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is an alternative if ERCP is unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Intensive monitoring, correction of coagulopathy, and management of complications [^notfound].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Without prompt treatment, Reynolds' pentad can lead to **multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)**, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and death [^notfound]. Early intervention significantly reduces mortality and morbidity [^113kxxca].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Reynolds' pentad is rare, occurring in a minority of cholangitis cases [^notfound]. Risk factors include choledocholithiasis, benign or malignant biliary strictures, and recent biliary instrumentation or surgery [^112xWrHo].

---

## Limitations and controversies

The pentad has **low sensitivity**; many severe cases present without all five features, risking underdiagnosis if clinicians rely solely on it [^113kxxca]. Modern guidelines emphasize early recognition and intervention based on clinical judgment, laboratory results, and imaging rather than strict adherence to the pentad [^113kxxca].

---

Reynolds' pentad is a **critical clinical presentation** of acute suppurative cholangitis, characterized by fever, RUQ pain, jaundice, hypotension, and altered mental status. It signifies severe biliary sepsis and requires immediate recognition, stabilization, and urgent biliary decompression to prevent high mortality [^116A2CKz].

### Micron-scale phenomena observed in a turbulent laser-produced plasma [^115pL2Qa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Calculation of Reynolds number

For the Reynolds number calculation (Re = u L / ν), the characteristic length, L, velocity, u, and viscosity, ν, are needed. The foam viscosity was calculated using the Clérouin formula, which requires the shocked foam temperature (~1 eV), its density (~0.2 g cm −3), its composition and ionisation (calculated through a Thomas-Fermi model). To determine these parameters, we used the above-mentioned simulations performed with the FLASH4. We should note that the temperature and density obtained through simulation were similar to the ones given by the equation of state tables for our measured shock velocity. The characteristic length and velocity can be either taken to correspond to: the plasma extension and bulk velocity, the RTI extension and the associated growth velocity, or the inter-spikes extension and the lateral velocity. The exact definition depends on which scale we consider for energy injection. The first possibility would usually be taken in jet like objects (the global morphology of our expanding plasma), whereas the second and third are more usually used for theoretical study of the RTI and resulting turbulence (usually it is associated with periodic boundaries). We should note that the spacing between spikes grows in time as they diverge from one another due to the curvature of the expanding plasma. In the case of bulk flow, the length is taken to be equal to the plasma expansion: ~400 μm at 50 ns. The velocity was taken to be the post-shock fluid velocity in the foam (~7 km s -1). The resulting Reynolds number is of the order of 10 7, which is consistent with turbulence theories (other possibles values are written in Table 2).

Another estimation of the Reynolds number is possible by using some properties of the turbulent spectrum. In the classical theory, which does not apply in our case (our experiment is neither purely hydrodynamic nor incompressible), the Reynolds number is linked to the injection spatial scale, ℓ, and to the Kolmogorov scale, η, by the formula Re = (ℓ / η) 4/3. Since we do not measure η in our experiment, we can use this formula to calculate the actual dissipation scale. Here, we obtain a Kolmogorov scale of the order of a nanometre (see Tables 1 and 2, and Section III of the Supplementary).

### Alveolar pentraxin 3 as an early marker of microbiologically confirmed pneumonia: a threshold-finding prospective observational study [^113jxAV5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid PTX3 levels and diagnosis of pneumonia

Pneumonia represents one of the most widespread infections in intubated ICU patients and is associated with significant morbidity (for example, prolonged mechanical ventilation, end-stage organ failure), costs and mortality. Timely and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to starting appropriate treatment and improving patients' recovery and survival. However, to date, a rapid and accurate approach to diagnose pneumonia in intubated critically ill patients is lacking. The aim of the present study was to describe the use of PTX3 levels in BAL fluid as a potentially new marker for early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia. The study design was observational in one population of unselected intubated critically ill patients. Our results indicate that rapid assay of PTX3 levels in BAL fluid can predict the presence of lung infection about 48 hours before culture data become available. To help with translation to the clinical setting, we identified a cutoff level of 1 ng/ml as being associated with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity, and we found that this level was associated with high diagnostic accuracy. In particular, PTX3 levels ≥ 1 ng/ml in BAL fluid showed high sensitivity and NPV. This indicates that PTX3 levels ≥ 1 ng/ml in BAL fluid only rarely misclassify a patient with pneumonia as being uninfected. This is probably the most clinically relevant result we can report, as recognition of true negative cases is crucial for antibiotics stewardship aimed at reducing microbial resistance. The same results were confirmed when we performed a post hoc analysis of proven bacterial pneumonia cases, with a higher threshold (7 ng/ml) and, possibly, improved specificity. Moreover, when we restricted our analysis to the subgroup of patients who met clinical criteria for pneumonia at the time of BAL, our results were also confirmed. In this subset of patients, pretest probability was higher and the diagnostic accuracy of a screening test such as PTX3 was expected to be poorer. Another strength of the study is that oxygenation did not differ between infected and uninfected patients. We previously showed that plasma PTX3 level is correlated with the severity of ARDS, but this did not seem to bias the present results. Our data thus lead us to the working hypothesis that PTX3 level in BAL fluid is discriminative of confirmed pneumonia in intubated ICU patients. In the future, adequately powered prospective trials may validate PTX3 level measured in BAL fluid assays as a marker of pneumonia and test whether it has any clinical value in guiding prescription of antibiotics.

### Anatomy of subcritical submarine flows with a lutocline and an intermediate destruction layer [^1111BmYE]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Counter-gradient concentration transport

An important point to note is that counter-gradient transport of momentum does not guarantee counter-gradient transport of concentration, which is an important mechanism by which the sharpness of the lutocline is maintained over long distances. In the near-bed and interface layers, high concentration parcels of fluid are transported upward (and) and lower concentration parcels are transported downward (and) tending to reduce concentration gradient. On the other hand, in the intermediate layer, positive regions of Reynolds fluxare observed in Fig. 2 g. These regions of positive Reynolds flux correlate well with the regions of positive Reynolds stress and are the result of the HV–CV vortex pair (blue and red dashed arrows). In these regions of positive Reynolds flux, parcels of high concentration are transported downward, while parcels of low concentration are transported upward and thereby enhancing concentration gradient in the intermediate layer. This is an essential feature of the self-sharpening of the concentration profile into a lutocline. A 3D view of the positive Reynolds flux events can be seen in Fig. 4 d, where vortex structures HP and CV are presented along with iso-surfaces of(light yellow). Counter-gradient transport of concentration occurs in between the head of the hairpin HV and the counter-clockwise vortex CV (blue dashed arrow) and in the region downstream of the vortex CV (red dashed arrow). However, negative values of Reynolds flux are found in the ejection region of the hairpin (below the head in between the legs, see orange dashed arrow in Fig. 4 c).

### Phenotypic spectrum of pentosan polysulfate sodium-associated maculopathy: a multicenter study [^117QD1W6]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A unique pigmentary maculopathy was recently described in 6 patients with long-term exposure to pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS), a long-standing oral therapy for interstitial cystitis.

Objective

To characterize the exposure characteristics and clinical manifestations of PPS-associated maculopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multi-institutional case series, medical records of patients who exhibited the characteristic maculopathy in the setting of prior PPS exposure were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected from August 1, 2012, to October 1, 2018, and data were analyzed from October 2018 to January 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Drug exposure, visual acuity, and retinal imaging characteristics.

Results

Of the 35 included patients (70 eyes), 34 (97%) were female, and the median (range) age was 60 (37–79) years. The median (range) duration of PPS intake was 15 (3–22) years, and the median (range) cumulative exposure was 1.61 (0.44–4.31) kg. The leading visual symptoms were metamorphopsia, blurred vision, and prolonged dark adaptation. Median (range) logMAR visual acuity of all eyes was 0.10 (-0.12 to 1.18). Fundus examination often revealed hyperpigmented macular spots (34 of 64 eyes [53%]) with interspersed pale-yellow deposits, although less commonly in eyes that exhibited retinal pigment epithelial atrophy (6 of 26 eyes [23%]; P < .001). Optical coherence tomography showed foci of retinal pigment epithelium elevation or thickening associated with hyperreflectance on near-infrared reflectance imaging. Fundus autofluorescence imaging typically revealed a symmetric, confluent pattern of hyperautofluorescent and hypoautofluorescent spots that involved the fovea in all eyes and extended to the retinal periphery in 24 eyes (36%). Longitudinal evaluation demonstrated dynamic changes in pigmentary abnormalities.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that PPS-associated maculopathy is a vision-threatening condition that can manifest in the setting of long-term exposure to the drug. Multimodal imaging posits a distinctive clinical phenotype, characterized in this cohort by dynamic alterations within the retinal pigment epithelium and at the retinal pigment epithelium-photoreceptor interface. Ongoing work might explore causality and direct screening guidelines.

### Stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with the mortality of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients [^115U8fb2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy with a global annual incidence of approximately 1.5–6 per million people and a female predominance. It has a rapid progression with a mortality rate of untreated TTP as high as 90%; this can be reduced to 10 − 20% by early identification, plasma exchange, and immunosuppressive therapy. TTP is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and neurologic deficits (the triad of TTP symptoms); fever and renal involvement encompass the common pentad of symptoms. Unfortunately, TTP is often misdiagnosed or diagnosis is delayed.

TTP results from a severe deficiency of the specific von Willebrand factor (VWF) - cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin - like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). There are two general forms of ADAMTS13 deficiency, congenital TTP (cTTP) and immune TTP (iTTP). In all TTP patients, the activity of ADAMTS13 in the plasma decreases significantly (< 10%); and patients with iTTP often show the presence of ADAMTS13 inhibitors.

Studies have shown that hyperglycemia on admission is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with TTP. A temporary increase in blood glucose can be observed when a relatively severe disease occurs, and stress hyperglycemia has also been found to be associated with increased mortality. In this study, we presented the hospitalization process of 42 patients with TTP in our hospital between 2000 and 2021 and provided a new laboratory basis for clinicians to formulate timely and accurate treatment plans to reduce mortality.

### Accelerating flash droughts induced by the joint influence of soil moisture depletion and atmospheric aridity [^117LaQk1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Assessment of onset development timescales of flash droughts

To facilitate further understanding of flash drought characteristics, we divided the whole world into 21 regions for conducting an in-depth regional analysis of flash droughts (Supplementary Table 1). To conduct a comprehensive assessment of the onset time of flash droughts, we divided flash droughts into five different types according to the longest possible onset development phase of flash droughts (≤ 1 month was proposed by Otkin et al.), including 1 pentad, 2 pentads, 3 pentads, 4 pentads, and 5 pentads. Please note that the onset development phase refers to a rapid onset of drying before drought conditions occur. Figure 2 compares the percentages of flash droughts at different onset times relative to all flash droughts as well as their annual evolutions during the entire study period of 2000–2020. In general, 33.64−46.18% of flash droughts developed in 1 pentad, especially in South Asia, Central Asia, Western Africa, and Amazon Basin. About 20.12−28.17% and 19.32−32.53% of flash droughts occurred in 2 and 3 pentads, respectively. In comparison, there are 5.34−11.22% and 0.99−2.26% of flash droughts developing in 4 and 5 pentads, respectively. In general, more than 70% of flash droughts develop within half a month (≤ 3 pentad), and more than 30% of flash droughts develop only within 5 days (≤ 1 pentad) accompanied by a high intensification rate (≥ 5th percentile), whereas the traditional droughts may take 5–6 months to develop due to the cumulative effects (e.g. P deficit) of related climate variables.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^115FmUo5]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Introduction

The description of presentation of a teenage girl by Moschowitz, in the early 20th century, drew attention towards this previously unnoticed disease affecting multiple organs. Karl Singer, however, introduced the term thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura > 20 years later. In 1964, Amorosi and Ultmann defined the classic pentad of clinical features of TTP, namely thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA), neurological symptoms and signs, renal symptoms and signs, and fever. The evidence favours an autoimmune aetiology in many patients. The association of TTP and SLE has been sporadically reported in the literature. These two separate clinical entities appear to run parallel on multiple fronts leading to diagnostic and management concerns.TTP is not recognised as a criterion for classification of SLE.

Pathogenesis

The main pathogenic feature of TTP is the formation of platelet aggregates within the microcirculation. An autoimmune aetiology is suggested based on multiple observations. Occurrence of TTP in association with autoimmune diseases, especially SLE, is one piece of evidence for an autoimmune aetiology. Furlan et al investigated the prevalence of von Willebrand factor (vwf) cleaving protease (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13)) deficiency in patients with familial and non-familial forms of TTP. Familial deficiency was caused by a constitutional deficiency of the protease, whereas an inhibitor of vwf-cleaving protease was responsible in the non-familial TTP. Tsai et al also studied the activity of ADAMTS-13 and sought inhibitors against this protease in the plasma of patients with acute TTP, patients with other diseases and normal subjects. Inhibitory activity was detected in 26 of 39 plasma samples from patients with TTP. The inhibitors were IgG antibodies.

### Optofluidic fabrication for 3D-shaped particles [^111dYnx3]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Flow shaping via Re number

Previously, changes in pillar numbers and pillar configurations were investigated to exert various secondary flow patterns, but as an alternative flow condition, the Reynolds number can be varied to manipulate flow deformation. In general, a higher Reynolds number indicates higher inertia (that is, more interactions between fluid and structures), leading to an increase of inertial deformation. To demonstrate this, we conducted the particle polymerization in the same manner as shown in Fig. 4 using a thin-slit photomask. Figure 5 shows particles all created at the same location (P3: after passing the third pair of side pillars). At low Reynolds numbers, the particle generated at P3 should remain similar to the particle created at P0. However, slight asymmetry (wider along the particle bottom than that of top) was noticed because the core fluid contained additional photoinitiator (DMPA), resulting in a denser fluid. For the higher Reynolds number cases, faster flow rates allows the core fluid less time to settle towards the channel bottom due to the density difference before reaching P3, allowing for more symmetric-shaped particles. From images taken of the particles, the coordinates of the particle outlines were found, and then plotted using a common origin (Fig. 5b) for a visual comparison of particle shape based on Reynolds number. As expected, higher flow rate (that is, higher inertia) caused increased flow deformation. The deformation characteristic length (particle area/particle perimeter) was also plotted for each Reynolds number case (Fig. 5c), showing a trend similar to pillars 0 to 6 from Fig. 4e.

### Nomogram for assistant diagnosing acute suppurative cholangitis: a case-control study [^1114LiqG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Diagnostic criteria

AC is diagnosed and graded according to the TG18 criteria. ASC is diagnosed based on the Reynolds Pentad and evidence of suppurative bile during drainage. Drainage procedures were performed using percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and surgery. The presence of suppurative bile was evaluated through direct observation by clinicians. Bile cultures were partially conducted to support the diagnosis.

Patients

We retrospectively collected 650 patients between January 2015 and June 2023 and prospectively collected 98 patients between July 2023 and February 2024, who were diagnosed with AC at the Nanjing First Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, by the Electronic Medical Record System. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ≥ 18 years old; (2) diagnosed with AC; (3) detailed and complete medical data. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who did not receive biliary drainage; (2) combined with hematological system disorders or other abnormalities affecting leukocyte and platelet count; (3) Incomplete dataset. Finally, 401 patients were included in the primary cohort and 82 patients were included in the validation cohort. (Fig. 1).

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and human immunodeficiency virus complicating pregnancy [^116DRgyn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare but serious medical complication, but is relatively common among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is characterized by the pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, fever, and renal abnormalities. However, the pentad is often incomplete, especially in HIV-positive patients.

Case

An HIV-positive patient complained of easy bruising, hematuria, fever, myalgias, and headache during the second trimester of pregnancy. Laboratory testing revealed hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with thrombocytopenic purpura. The patient recovered after plasmapheresis. At 36 weeks' gestation, she was delivered for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

Conclusion

Absence of the classic pentad seen in thrombocytopenic purpura among pregnant HIV-positive patients may make the diagnosis of thrombocytopenic purpura challenging. Frequent monitoring of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura for signs and symptoms of preeclampsia and fetal growth assessment is suggested.

### Accelerating flash droughts induced by the joint influence of soil moisture depletion and atmospheric aridity [^111Y5NUK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The frequencies of flash droughts identified by the intensification rate-based definition are lower than those detected by the duration-based definition (Fig. 1c, d). This is because the use of the duration-based definition captures more events that last for only one pentad, whereas the mean duration of events identified by the intensification rate-based definition is longer than one month (Supplementary Fig. 4). Nonetheless, both methods (definitions) indicate that flash droughts are most likely to occur in humid and semi-humid regions (e.g. Southeast Asia, East Asia, Amazon Basin, Eastern North America, and Southern South American) according to the global map of the arid, transitional, and humid regimes (Supplementary Fig. 5). This is consistent with previous studies. Particularly, the hot spots for the high frequency of flash droughts are highlighted, and the contributions to the high frequency of flash droughts are related to different phenomena of atmospheric circulation including monsoons, the upper-level ridge, and land–atmosphere coupling (red boxes in Fig. 1c). The atmospheric circulation may cause the anomalies of P and T, which are likely to trigger flash drought events –. For example, East Asia and Southeast Asia are tropical monsoon climate regions, and during the break of monsoons, the prolonged significant negative anomaly of P may lead to a rise in T, which in turn causes a rapid depletion in SM. Furthermore, the combination of significant negative P and positive T anomalies could lead to an increased atmospheric water demand, accelerating the decline in SM. It should also be noted that Tibet is a drought-prone region, with more than one drought events occurring each year. With high elevations on the Tibetan Plateau, terrestrial ecosystems in this region are vulnerable to climate change. Although this region is also affected by monsoons from East Asia and Southeast, it is obviously dominated by the plateau alpine climate.

### Thrombocytopenia in the ICU: disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies-what intensivists need to know [^111d5dDw]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

DIC is relatively common, developing in 9–19% of ICU patients, usually as a result of sepsis, with an incidence of 18/100,000 in the overall population. By contrast, TTP and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC)-associated HUS have estimated incidences of 6 and up to 29 cases per million, respectively, and atypical HUS (aHUS) a prevalence of 0.2–0.4 cases per million, making these conditions far rarer than DIC. Although TTP is described as a pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, MAHA, renal dysfunction, and neurological impairment, often some of these features are not present. Accordingly, TTP may be confused with HUS, which is most commonly characterized by the triad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and renal dysfunction. These clinical similarities of DIC, TTP, and HUS are a major concern because they pose a risk of misdiagnosis as intensivists are more likely to consider a diagnosis of DIC than of the rarer TTP or HUS, thus delaying potentially lifesaving treatment.

Several diagnostic algorithms for TMA have been published. However, currently the only available guidance specific to the ICU are the recently published expert statements of Azoulay and colleagues. This publication provides an excellent guide for the differential diagnosis of TMAs but only briefly mentions DIC. A concise diagnostic algorithm tailored to intensivists would aid rapid differential diagnosis of TTP and HUS from DIC, and enable early appropriate treatment.

### Nomogram for assistant diagnosing acute suppurative cholangitis: a case-control study [^113kxxca]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute suppurative cholangitis (ASC), an inflammatory disorder caused by suppurative infection of the bile ducts, is accompanied by pus in the bile ducts. The accumulation of pus causes an elevation in bile duct pressure and facilitates the entry of pyogenic bacteria into the bloodstream, leading to severe sepsis. Compared to acute nonsuppurative cholangitis (ANSC), ASC demonstrates a poorer response to antibiotic treatment, with a mortality rate nearing 100% unless urgent biliary decompression is promptly carried out. Timely drainage plays a pivotal role in treating ASC over antibiotic therapy. Therefore, accurate differentiation between ASC and ANSC is crucial. However, ASC lacks recognized preoperative diagnostic criteria. The Reynolds' Pentad, previously considered to be the diagnostic criterion for acute obstructive septic cholangitis, exhibits low sensitivity. The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) does not provide a precise definition of ASC but rather establishes clinical indicators for evaluating patients with mild, moderate, and severe cholangitis. While it has been proposed that ASC should be managed as moderate-to-severe cholangitis, clinicians have observed that some patients with mild cholangitis have suppurative bile during drainage. This suggests that the TG18 classification of acute cholangitis (AC), which relies on clinical symptoms and laboratory indices, may not be effective in diagnosing ASC. There could be other factors closely related to ASC. Thus, our study aimed to identify independent risk factors of ASC and develop a nomogram to predict ASC accurately.

### Did we finally slay the evil dragon of cigarette smoking in the late 20th century? unfortunately, the answer is no-the dragon is still alive and well in the 21st century and living in the third world. shame on us! [^111a34nk]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

If cigarettes were introduced as a new consumer product today, it is unlikely they would receive government regulatory approval. Cigarettes have proven biologic toxicities (carcinogenesis, atherogenesis, teratogenesis) and well-established causal links to human disease. Things were very different in 1913 when the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company introduced the first modern cigarette, the iconic Camel. By the early 1950s, definitive scientific reports linked cigarettes and human disease, but it was more than a half century later (2006) that cigarette manufacturers were found guilty by a federal court of deceptive product marketing regarding the health hazards of tobacco use. In the United States, cigarette smoking remains a major but slowly declining problem. But in developing countries, cigarette use is expanding tremendously. In global terms, the epidemic of smoking-caused disease is projected to increase rapidly in coming decades, not decline. Society may have begun to slowly win the smoking battle in the developed world, but we are resoundingly losing the global war on smoking. All is not lost! There is some good news! The 2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, supported strongly by the American College of Chest Physicians, is the first global public health treaty of the new millennium. Many developed societies have begun planning to rid their countries of cigarettes in what is called the Endgame Strategy, and now is the time for the international medical community to help change tobacco policy to a worldwide endgame approach to rid all humanity of smoking-related diseases.

Table 1
Key Definitions for Key CFD/FSI Parameters, WSS, and Disturbed Coronary Flow

Although the terms disturbed and turbulent flow are used interchangeably, coronary arteries rarely achieve the technical threshold for flow turbulence, which usually occurs in larger arteries such as the aorta. Flow turbulence is measured using Reynolds number, which incorporates density, velocity, viscosity, and diameter. A threshold of Reynolds number < 2000 is considered laminar, values between 2000 and 3500 are transitional, and Reynolds number > 3500 is considered turbulent flow. Some studies propose lower Reynolds number thresholds to define turbulent flow in coronary arteries. However, flow in coronary arteries is usually in the laminar to transitional range, with disturbances to flow in this range referred to as disturbed laminar flow or simply disturbed flow.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^115epCSv]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The 100th anniversary of the first description of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a disease by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz approaches. For many decades, TTP remained mostly a mysterious fatal condition, where diagnosis was often post-mortem. Initially a pentad of symptoms was identified, a pattern that later revealed to be fallible. Sporadic observations led to empiric interventions that allowed for the first impactful breakthrough in TTP treatment, almost 70 years after its first description: the introduction of plasma exchange and infusions as treatments. The main body of knowledge within the field was gathered in the latest three decades: patient registries were set and proved crucial for advancements; the general mechanisms of disease have been described; the diagnosis was refined; new treatments and biomarkers with improvements on prognosis and management were introduced. Further changes and improvements are expected in the upcoming decades. In this review, we provide a brief historic overview of TTP, as an illustrative example of the success of translational medicine enabling to rapidly shift from a management largely based on empiricism to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, for the benefit of patients. Current management options and present and future perspectives in this still evolving field are summarized.

### Expanded clinical spectrum of pentosan polysulfate maculopathy: a macula society collaborative study [^111GpDg4]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Explore the spectrum of clinical manifestations of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) maculopathy observed across a range of practice settings.

Design

Multi-institutional retrospective study.

Participants

Patients exhibiting findings suggestive of PPS maculopathy identified from April 30, 2019, to December 4, 2020.

Methods

Members of the Macula Society submitted cases of presumed PPS maculopathy for consideration in this series. Diagnosis was confirmed by masked review of fundus imaging. Clinical characteristics of confirmed cases were summarized with descriptive statistics.

Main Outcome Measures

Pentosan polysulfate exposure characteristics and fundus imaging features.

Results

There were 74 patients with PPS maculopathy included in the current study. Median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis was 62.0 years (56.0–65.8). The median duration of exposure to PPS was 14.0 years (10.2–18.9), with a median cumulative exposure of 1.5 kg (0.9–2.4). The most common presenting symptom was decreased or blurry vision (66.2%), followed by prolonged dark adaption or nyctalopia (32.4%). The most common referral diagnosis was age-related macular degeneration (54.1%); 16.2% of patients were referred for suspected PPS maculopathy. Novel imaging findings emerged, including highly asymmetric disease in 2 patients and a prominent vitelliform maculopathy in 2 patients.

Conclusions

Most patients with PPS maculopathy exhibit characteristic findings on multimodal fundus imaging in the setting of high cumulative exposure to the oral drug. Some patients in the current study manifested novel imaging findings, expanding our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of this condition. We recommend considering standardized ophthalmic screening of patients treated with PPS.

### Potential new phenotypic presentation of pentosan polysulfate sodium maculopathy [^116hhtcD]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To describe a potential new phenotypic presentation of pentosan polysulfate sodium maculopathy. Methods: An observational case was analyzed. Results: A 55-year-old woman with interstitial cystitis who was treated with oral pentosan polysulfate sodium for 10 years presented with reports of decreased vision and metamorphopsia that had worsened over the past 3 months. On funduscopic examination, there were bilateral areas of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia inferior to the fovea with a surrounding halo of drusenoid material. Neurosensory retinal detachments with drusenoid deposition at the edges of the detachment were seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Conclusions: These findings could be mistaken for age-related macular degeneration, central serous retinopathy, Best disease, or adult vitelliform dystrophy. In this case, a review of pertinent medications assisted in making the diagnosis of toxic maculopathy. Proper diagnosis and prompt discontinuation of the inciting medication are necessary to avoid the risk for potentially irreversible retinal damage and vision loss.

### Anthropogenic shift towards higher risk of flash drought over China [^1129Rbg2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Definition and characteristics of flash drought events

To identify a flash drought event, we consider both the rapid decline rate of soil moisture and the dry persistency in this study: the pentad (5 days) mean root-zone (top 1 m) soil moisture decreases from above 40th percentile to 20th percentile, with an average decline rate of no less than 5% in percentile for each pentad (e.g. June 30–July 14 in Fig. 1); if the declined soil moisture rises up to 20th percentile again, the drought terminates (e.g. July 15–19 in Fig. 1); and the drought should last for at least 3 pentads (15 days). The first two criterions describe the onset and recovery stages of a flash drought event. Although the recovery threshold could increase from 20th to 40th percentile, here the 20th percentile is chosen to exclude many events that can last for more than 3–6 months if the 30th or 40th percentile threshold is used, where those events should be regarded as seasonal droughts instead of flash droughts. The third criterion is the minimal time that the soil moisture remains below 40th percentile, which excludes those events that decrease from above 40th percentile rapidly down to 20th percentile within 10 days, but then recover up to 40th percentile suddenly.

Fig. 1
Illustration of the definition of a flash drought event. The black solid line shows 5 days mean soil moisture percentile (SM) for a grid point (112.75°E, 25.25°N) during the 2013 southern China flash drought. The dates in the horizontal axis are in the middle of the 5 days periods. The blue asterisks and red circles show flash droughts identified by concurrent heat and drought conditions (old; i.e. pentad mean surface air temperature anomaly larger than its standard deviation, and soil moisture percentile lower than 30%) and by the new definition used in this study (new; the pentad mean soil moisture decreases from above 40th percentile to 20th percentile, with an average decline rate of no less than 5% in percentile for each pentad; if the declined soil moisture rises up to 20th percentile again, the drought terminates; and the drought should last for at least three pentads), respectively

### Measuring frailty using self-report or automated tools to identify risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: the million veteran program [^1155PQHU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among older adults in the United States, responsible for over 750 000 deaths among adults aged ≥ 65 in 2020. Managing this burden is critical to meet Healthy People 2030 goals for coronary heart disease and stroke deaths. However, major risk calculators, such as the Framingham Risk Score, Reynold Risk Calculator, and QRISK‐3 have maximum ages of 79, 80, and 84 years, respectively, while the Pooled Cohort Equations have a maximum age of 75 years. Stratification of CVDrisk among older adults is challenging, in part because of physiologic aging that includes inflammation, altered metabolism, genomic alterations, and other changes not included in traditional risk calculators, as well as competing risks from other causes of death.

Frailty may address the challenges of both aging physiology and competing risk when assessing CVD risk in older adults. Defined as the vulnerability to poor health outcomes following a physiologic stressor, frailty is operationalized according to 2 leading theories: (1) physical frailty, which treats frailty as a discrete syndrome of weight loss, exhaustion, fatigue, decreased physical activity, and weakness; and (2) deficit accumulation frailty which considers health‐related deficits spanning morbidity, cognition, function, nutrition and mental health. Both approaches have been associated with major adverse cardiovascular outcomes across the spectrum of CVD and may inform prognostication and management of patients. The application of frailty in the management of patients with CVD first became standard in aiding risk stratification for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures and has subsequently expanded to heart failure prognostication and management and other areas of CV care. Despite the recognition of frailty as a critical tool for risk stratification and management in CVD, among the 60 frailty tools developed based on these 2 theories of frailty, multisociety guideline recommendations lack specific guidance on which available tool is best. In an effort to address the question of optimal frailty assessment we used the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a large, well‐phenotyped cohort of over 900 000 US veterans. We used both a deficit accumulation and a physical frailty approach to examine the relationship between frailty, mortality, and CVD events.

### Accelerating flash droughts induced by the joint influence of soil moisture depletion and atmospheric aridity [^113pDvXf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Identification of global hot spots of flash droughts

We compared the mean variations in SM percentiles for flash drought events of all grid points, identified by the intensification rate (Fig. 1a) and the duration (Fig. 1b) of flash droughts. To satisfy the drought condition, SM should decrease to a critical level (the 20th percentile threshold, which is recommended by the U.S. Drought Monitor) because SM below such a threshold indicates a start of abnormally dry conditions. For the definition from a perspective of the intensification rate, the mean SM from all three datasets should reach below the 20th percentile throughout the same days over the period of 2000 to 2020. By contrast, based on the duration-based definition, about 17.78−23.77% and 6.75−8.28% of the events detected would be viewed as non-drought or non-moderate events for HWFD and PDFD since SM only decreases from above the 40th percentile to above the 20th percentile. Particularly for HWFD, the mean variations of SM percentiles of all flash droughts from all three datasets are between 20th and 30th percentiles (Fig. 1b). As for another feature (flash), the events identified by the intensification rate-based definition present a sharp decrease in SM, on average, from the 52.76−64.12th percentile to the 25.40−39.37th percentile (from the highest point to the lowest point), with a decline rate of larger than the 5th percentile per pentad. In comparison, only 0.20−1.15% and 0.10−1.06% of the events identified by the duration-based definition experience a rapid decline (SM decreases from the 40th percentile to below the 20th percentile) in SM for HWFD and PDFD over the period of onset development phase. And they decrease, on average, from the 23.91−27.27th percentile to the 21.49−22.47th percentile (the lowest point) for HWFD, and from the 17.62−16.39th percentile to the 13.49−14.38th percentile for PDFD (color lines in Fig. 1b). Furthermore, some events with SM decreasing to below the 40th percentile occur, but then rapidly recover up to the 40th percentile within only one or two pentads under abnormally dry conditions (red box in Supplementary Fig. 3). These events cannot be viewed as flash droughts because only one or two pentads are inadequate to diminish crop productivity and yield. Perhaps even if the drought lasts for a short period of time (1 or 2 pentads), it may also affect the growth of crops if accompanied by high temperature and wind, but this situation is not within the scope of our discussion. Therefore, the use of the definition focusing solely on the duration of flash droughts cannot guarantee that all events satisfy the key characteristics (drought severity and flash) of flash droughts.

### The global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome: ready for prime time? [^114PYycV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Matthay and colleagues (pp.) propose a new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This definition extends the Berlin definition of ARDS on three important points: 1) inclusion of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); 2) use of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp O 2)/F O 2 in patients in whom Pa O 2 measurements are not available; and 3) allowance of lung ultrasound (LUS) as an alternative imaging modality to chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography. The panel of 32 experts is to be congratulated for their courage to have challenged such a controversial topic. The purpose of this editorial is to contextualize the proposed changes by asking seven questions that arise after examining the paper.

### Pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron) [^112rzZYf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Retinal Pigmentary Changes

Pigmentary changes in the retina, reported in the literature as pigmentary maculopathy, have been identified with long-term use of ELMIRON®(see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Although most of these cases occurred after 3 years of use or longer, cases have been seen with a shorter duration of use. While the etiology is unclear, cumulative dose appears to be a risk factor. Visual symptoms in the reported cases included difficulty reading, slow adjustment to low or reduced light environments, and blurred vision. The visual consequences of these pigmentary changes are not fully characterized. Caution should be used in patients with retinal pigment changes from other causes in which examination findings may confound the appropriate diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Detailed ophthalmologic history should be obtained in all patients prior to starting treatment with ELMIRON®. If there is a family history of hereditary pattern dystrophy, genetic testing should be considered. For patients with pre-existing ophthalmologic conditions, a comprehensive baseline retinal examination (including color fundoscopic photography, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), and auto-fluorescence imaging) is recommended prior to starting therapy. A baseline retinal examination (including OCT and auto-fluorescence imaging) is suggested for all patients within six months of initiating treatment and periodically while continuing treatment. If pigmentary changes in the retina develop, then risks and benefits of continuing treatment should be re-evaluated, since these changes may be irreversible. Follow-up retinal examinations should be continued given that retinal and vision changes may progress even after cessation of treatment.

### 'From disaster, miracles are wrought': a narrative analysis of UK media depictions of remote GP consulting in the COVID-19 pandemic using burke's pentad [^116rzs5V]. Medical Humanities (2021). Medium credibility.

The elements in Burke's dramatistic pentad are closely aligned with what are sometimes known as the 'five Ws and an H' in journalism — who (agent), what (act), when and where (scene), why (purpose) and how (agency). Burke, however, encourages us to go beyond considering these elements separately and look at the relationships (what he called the ratios) between them, thereby uncovering aspects of motive (and, more widely, plot). Burke later added a sixth element (attitude, by which he meant dispositions, beliefs and judgements about the world) to his pentad.

According to Burke, the trouble in a story tends to result from a mismatch between two or more elements of the dramatistic pentad (eg, between the act and the scene). Narrative scholar Jerome Bruner depicted this trouble in terms of disruption of the expected: '… an initial canonical state is breached, redress is attempted which, if it fails, leads to crisis; crisis, if unresolved, leads eventually to a new legitimate order'.

Inspired by Bruner's reflections on the relationship between narrative and crisis, we decided to apply Burke's pentad to an aspect of the COVID-19 crisis.

### Equalization of four cardiovascular risk algorithms after systematic recalibration: individual-participant meta-analysis of 86 prospective studies [^111PuYxB]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Discrimination abilities of original versions of three risk prediction algorithms compared with the Framingham risk score using alternative CVD definitions. Number of events observed according to CVD definitions used by the Pooled Cohort Equations, the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation and the Reynolds Risk Score respectively were 14 564, 7433 and 17 642. Equivalent event numbers in the subset of participants with complete data for estimation of the Reynolds Risk Score were 6670, 2966 and 7953 respectively. FRS, Framingham risk score; PCE, pooled cohort equations; RRS, Reynolds risk score; SCORE, Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation. ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.001.

For each algorithm-specific outcome, on average across cohorts the predicted 10 year risk was 1.10 times observed risk for FRS, 1.52 for SCORE, 1.41 for PCE, and 0.90 for RRS (P < 0.0001 for goodness of fit/calibration for all algorithms; Figure 2 and Supplementary material online, Figures S5 and S6). On average the extent of relative mis-calibration was similar in men and women, and across all ages for SCORE and PCE (Supplementary material online, Figure S5) which translated to greater discrepancy between absolute predicted and observed risks at older ages when using these algorithms (Supplementary material online, Figure S6). Framingham risk score tended to over-predict in men and younger women but to under-predict in older women. Reynolds risk score underestimated risk somewhat in men, but on average was well calibrated in women (Figure 2, Supplementary material online, Figures S5 and S6). The extent and direction of mis-calibration varied substantially across individual cohorts, ranging from more than 50% underestimation to > 400% overestimation of risk (Supplementary material online, Figures S7 and S8). Heterogeneity in calibration could not be systematically explained by broad geographical region but was partially explained by year of baseline screening (Supplementary material online, Figure S9). After recalibration of algorithms to the incidence of the common CVD outcome and risk factor distribution of the cohorts contributing to the current analysis, the distribution of predicted 10 year CVD risk was similar across the four algorithms we studied (Supplementary material online, Figure S10), yielding good calibration for each algorithm (Supplementary material online, Figure S11). Risk discrimination did not change with recalibration since ranking of participant risk is unaffected by the recalibration methods used (Supplementary material online, Figure S1 and Appendix S3).

### Redefining the spectrum of pentosan polysulfate retinopathy: multimodal imaging findings from a cross-sectional screening study [^115rWUUb]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is growing evidence of a direct association between pentosan polysulfate (PPS) therapy and the development of macular changes. Using standardized visual acuity (VA) testing and multimodal imaging, we investigated the impact of PPS therapy on vision and described an expanded spectrum of imaging findings among PPS users.

Design

Cross-sectional screening study.

Participants

Thirty-nine patients who were current or recent users of PPS.

Methods

The participants underwent a brief eye examination and answered a comprehensive medical and ophthalmic history questionnaire. Color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) were performed. The images were evaluated by expert graders at Wisconsin Reading Center. Abnormalities were categorized as definite toxicity (DT) if seen on both FAF and SD-OCT and as questionable toxicity (QT) if seen on either FAF or SD-OCT.

Main Outcome Measures

ETDRS and Snellen VA, the dosage and duration of PPS exposure, and the prevalence of retinal toxicity on imaging.

Results

The mean ETDRS and Snellen VA of the study cohort were 85 letters and 20/22, respectively. The mean PPS daily dose was 282 mg (range, 88–400 mg), whereas the mean cumulative dose was 915 g (range, 19–3650 g) over a mean period of 8.8 years (range, 2 months-25 years). There was evidence of retinopathy in 41% of the eyes; DT was identified in 24 eyes (31%) and QT in 8 eyes (10%). Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities (thickening or thinning or both) were present in all eyes with DT. Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was seen in 7 eyes (9%). In addition to well-established findings, the unique SD-OCT features of this cohort included interdigitation zone abnormalities and the presence of a flying saucer-type defect. Fundus autofluorescence abnormalities were seen in 24 eyes (30.8%), with 20 (66.7%) of these exhibiting abnormalities located outside the central subfield and extending beyond the arcades.

Conclusions

Findings from the masked grading of multimodal imaging at a centralized reading center suggest a wider phenotypic spectrum of structural abnormalities among patients taking PPS. Macular changes selectively involve the RPE and outer retina, with a range of findings often seen beyond the arcades. The subtle and atypical findings in this cohort should prompt clinicians to consider lowering the threshold for diagnosing PPS retinopathy.

### Kit for the preparation of technetium tc 99m pentetate [^113Mvone]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions (5.1).
Image interpretation risks in lung ventilation studies: If proximal airway deposition is observed, consider additional diagnostic options (5.2).
Radiation exposure risk: Technetium Tc 99m pentetate contributes to a patient's overall long-term radiation exposure (2.1, 2.3, 5.3).
Bronchospasm in lung ventilation studies: Inhalation of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate solution may result in acute bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with heightened bronchoreactivity (5.4).

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions and have access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel.

5.2 Image Interpretation Risks in Lung Ventilation Studies

In patients with obstructive pulmonary disease there may be deposition of particles in the proximal airways influencing image quality and interfering with diagnostic interpretation, therefore to ensure diagnostic quality, careful use of the nebulizer to assure optimal particle delivery is essential. If interfering particle deposition occurs, consider additional diagnostic options.

5.3 Radiation Exposure Risk

Technetium Tc 99m contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Use the lowest dose of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate necessary for imaging. Encourage patients to drink fluids and void as frequently as possible after intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].

Radiation risks associated with the use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate are greater in pediatric patients than in adults due to greater radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy.

5.4 Bronchospasm in Lung Ventilation Studies

As with other inhaled medications, inhalation of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate solution may result in acute bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with heightened bronchoreactivity, such as patients with asthma or other lung or allergic disorders. Monitor all patients for bronchoconstriction.

### Pattern formation by turbulent cascades [^117HEvz3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Pattern-induced cascades beyond odd fluids

Our analysis demonstrates that the non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades provides a mechanism of wavelength selection. The decorrelation of triads by waves and the subsequent emergence of a resonant manifold are not unique to odd fluids (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Cascade-induced pattern formation across domains.

a – d, Cascade-induced scale selection can occur in systems ranging from Navier–Stokes turbulence (a, b) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence (c) to mass cascades (d). a, Chiral active fluids are an example of fluids with odd viscosity. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, these fluids are expected to exhibit a double arrested cascade at high enough ν odd / ν and Reynolds number (see the Methods for a discussion on orders of magnitude). We have interpreted this phenomenon as the result of a decorrelation of wavenumber triads by odd waves. b, In 2D geophysical flows and plasma, an arrested inverse cascade associated with wavelength selection occurs –. It can be seen as the consequence of the decorrelation of triads by Rossby (or drift) waves, which set the characteristic scale k Rh known as the Rhines scale. c, A double arrested cascade has been predicted in the solar wind, based on the properties of inviscid invariants of finite Larmor radius MHD –. This mechanism, known as a helicity barrier, relies on the change of nature of an inviscid invariant, which interpolates between cross-helicity and magnetic helicity (these quantities cascade in opposite directions). d, Scale selection can also occur in mass cascades, ranging from the stationary distribution of raindrop sizes that would occur in steady-state conditionsto smoke aerosols. This arises from the balance between coalescence and breakup of the droplets, which effectively have scale-varying rates (, red and blue curves in the schematic). Similar phenomenology arises in active mixtures –, although not necessarily with a flux across scales. In the Methods, we provide a minimal model of mass cascade exhibiting scale selection.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndromes [^116m7YCN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of patients with suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) continue to be a critical challenge for hematologists. The diagnostic criteria are not precise, often causing uncertainty about whether it is appropriate to initiate plasma exchange (PEX), the essential treatment for TTP. Initiation of PEX remains a clinical decision; severe ADAMTS13 (< 10% activity) deficiency alone is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of TTP. However, patients who do have severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency define the characteristic clinical features of TTP, the response to treatment, and the long-term outcomes. Patients with severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency are predominantly young women and the relative frequency of blacks is increased. Patients may present with only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, neurologic and renal abnormalities are often not present, fever rarely occurs; the complete "pentad" of these clinical features almost never occurs in current practice. Response to PEX is typically rapid but may not be sustained when PEX is stopped. Use of corticosteroids and rituximab has decreased the number of PEX treatments required to achieve a remission and has resulted in fewer PEX-related major complications. Relapse (in approximately 40% of patients) may be the most apparent risk after recovery, but long-term health outcomes are also very important. Minor cognitive abnormalities are common, the frequency of depression is increased, and the frequency of hypertension is increased. Careful long-term follow-up of TTP patients is essential.

### Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity [^116KDRt2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In 1987, Reynolds introduced three basic rules to emulate the flocking behavior of animals: (1) agents must avoid collisions with nearby flock mates (separation), (2) agents must match their velocity with nearby agents (alignment), and (3) agents must move towards the center of mass of the local group of flock mates (cohesion). Models based on Reynolds' rules, known as boids, remain a standard solution in computer graphics for animating group behavior. Beyond computer graphics, these rules have also found interdisciplinary applications in the modeling of sociobiological systems, stimulating research on the conditions required for the emergence of self-organization –. The underlying distributed decision-making strategies observed in animal flocks, which are governed mostly by local interactions, have inspired the design of multi-agent engineering systems, such as swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Swarms of small vehicles offer a cost-effective alternative to large vehicles in a wide variety of applications, ranging from surveillance and reconnaissanceto target tracking, operation management, and transportation. However, the deployment of these technologies faces fundamental challenges associated with controlling a large number of agents –. Overcoming these challenges requires the discovery of scalable decision-making mechanisms that can adapt to dynamic environments, operate under data communication constraints, and coordinate hundreds of agents.

### A balance between aerodynamic and olfactory performance during flight in drosophila [^112pHM7p]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The Reynolds number in forward flight is defined as Re = U ∞ R / v, where U ∞ represents the forward flight speed (0.94 m/s) and v is the kinematic viscosity (1.56 × 10 −5 m 2 s −1) for air at room temperature (27 °C). Based on the definition, the Reynolds number in this study is 173. The reduced frequency is defined as k = fR / U ∞, where f is the flapping frequency. In the unsteady aerodynamics, the reduced frequency is a dimensionless number that used to define the degree of unsteadiness of the flow filed. To change the reduced frequency, we can either adjust the forward flight speed (U ∞) or adjust the wing flapping frequency (f), with the similar effect on aerodynamics. (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, in the current study, we used a single incoming flow velocity and varied the wingbeat frequencies (summarizes Supplementary Table 1). The results may be extrapolated to other forward speeds based on matching Re and reduced frequencies.

### Pentosan polysulfate maculopathy: final outcomes from a 4-year prospective study of disease progression after drug cessation [^117FKEic]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the long-term disease course of pentosan polysulfate (PPS) maculopathy following drug cessation.

Design

Single-institution, prospective case series.

Methods

23 eyes of 12 participants seen at the Emory Eye Center with a diagnosis of PPS maculopathy were included in our study. Participants were enrolled between December 1, 2018, and December 1, 2019, and data were collected annually for four years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in visual function and retinal structure were the primary outcomes measured. Visual function was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ETDRS low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), Minnesota low-vision reading (MNREAD) performance, contrast sensitivity, mesopic and scotopic microperimetry, and dark adaptometry. Patient reported outcomes were assessed with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-39) and Low Luminance Questionnaire (LLQ). Structural outcomes included the presence of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA), atrophic lesion size (in mm 2), macular central subfield thickness (CST), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT).

Results

Of the 12 participants, 11 (91.7%) were female, with a median age at enrollment of 58 years. The median ETDRS BCVA letter score at baseline was 83, with a median change of -5 letters over 4 years (P = 0.005). The median 4-year change in mesopic microperimetry average threshold and percent reduced threshold was -5.4 dB (P = 0.003) and 48.6% (P = 0.004), respectively. MNREAD performance (assessed at 2 and 4 years) declined across all measures, with a median maximum reading speed change of -21 words per minute (P = 0.007). NEI-VFQ-39 and LLQ composite scores significantly decreased over 4 years. At baseline, 9 eyes (39%) had macular cRORA. By the study's end, 5 of the remaining eyes (35.7%) developed new-onset cRORA. The median linearized growth rate of atrophic lesions was 0.23 mm/year. The median 4-year change of CST and SFCT was -7.0 µm (P = 0.055) and -22.0 µm (P = 0.610), respectively.

Conclusion

This prospective study demonstrates continued progression of broad-ranging functional and structural deficits in PPS maculopathy long after drug cessation. These findings should inform PPS prescribing patterns, patient counseling, and disease monitoring strategies.

### Drug-drug interactions: how to manage the risk – A stakeholder approach [^115ocmod]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are well-recognized, chronic, multidimensional issues that have defied efforts to make substantial reductions in the burden of effects on patients and the health care system. This Commentary offers a stakeholder approach to characterizing the problem and identifying potential ways to address the risks posed by DDIs. Stakeholders may comprise 2 groups: a triad consisting of the patient, the prescriber, and the pharmacist and a pentad of institutional stakeholders consisting of institutions of education and training for prescribers and pharmacists, drug development sector companies, regulatory agencies, payer institutions, and publishing companies of journals on healthcare topics. Suggested strategic opportunities to mitigate the risk of harm from DDIs include the following: (1) identify critical leadership to set the agenda, manage the process, and mark progress; (2) enhance self-advocacy skills, particularly for patients; (3) create more opportunities for patients to learn, understand, and participate in the process; (4) establish and enhance partnerships between and among stakeholders; (5) seek broader use of regulatory machinery; (6) institutionalize principles of conservative prescribing and deprescribing in medical education and professional training; (7) establish, highlight, and promote DDI in HEDIS quality metrics, key performance indicators, and balanced scorecards; (8) encourage publishers to engage the issue more deeply by developing dedicated specialty journals for physicians, pharmacists, and cross-professional audiences and encourage journal editors to dedicate sections in pharmacy and clinical journals; and (9) involve the political process to include markers for DDI mitigation and to set performance goals in US Food and Drug Administration-directed legislation.

### The utility of self-expanding metal stents in benign biliary strictures-a retrospective case series [^11553MPE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stricture resolution was defined as lack of significant upstream dilatation of biliary tree on cholangiogram and easy passage of balloon catheter at time of ERCP, as well as resolution of hyperbilirubinemia/elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Stricture recurrence was defined as presence of obstructive pattern on liver enzymes triggering ERCP which demonstrated narrowing of biliary tree with associated upstream biliary dilatation and difficulty passing cholangiogram balloon. All peri-procedure complications were based on standard definitions. Pancreatitis was defined as lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal with associated abdominal pain. Cholangitis was defined by the presence of Charcot's triad or Reynold's pentad as documented in the patient's electronic chart. Gastrointestinal bleed was defined as a drop in hemoglobin from baseline, associated with overt signs of an upper GI bleed, and endoscopic evidence of bleeding. All SEMS were placed with the aid of fluoroscopic guidance to ensure proper placement of the stent across the stricture, and ensure the distal aspect of the stent protruded through the ampulla to allow for easy stent retrieval.

Analysis of the two groups was undertaken using standard statistical methods (mean/percentage), as well as two-sided unpaired t-test with a 95% confidence interval.

### RTI models as alternatives to traditional views of learning disabilities: response to the commentaries [^113yLwrs]. Child Development (2009). Low credibility.

Two commentaries in this issue, one by Torgesen and one by Fuchs and Fuchs, are largely supportive of our views of the value of implementing response to intervention (RTI) models in schools. In contrast, Reynolds and Shaywitz's criticisms of RTI represent traditional and often nonempirical views of learning disabilities (LDs). The evidence base on RTI is not empty, and Reynolds and Shaywitz fail to provide research support for their views of either LDs or RTI.

### Hydrodynamic turbulence cannot transport angular momentum effectively in astrophysical disks [^116ULJgm]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The most efficient energy sources known in the Universe are accretion disks. Those around black holes convert 5–40 per cent of rest-mass energy to radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially inviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational instability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, and therefore essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme Reynolds numbers, keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby transport angular momentum effectively is controversial. Here we report a laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non-magnetic quasi-keplerian flows at Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of turbulence, even in cool disks.

### Poor beard! Charcot's internationalization of neurasthenia, the "American disease" [^114wyXqz]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the role of the seminal 19th-century neurologist, Jean-Martin Charcot, in the internationalization of neurasthenia, previously known as "the American disease".

Background

The New York neurologist, George Beard, first described neurasthenia in 1869 and considered it a disorder related to the particular stress of modern civilization, most typified in the United States.

Methods

Charcot's personal files on neurasthenia from the Bibliothèque Charcot, Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, were studied and his teaching lessons and lectures were examined.

Results

Charcot presented numerous cases of neurasthenia, always crediting Beard with the original name and description. Calling Beard's 1880 work a "remarkable monograph", Charcot emphasized that patients with neurasthenia also comprised the bulk of his own private practice. Focusing on the signs of sexual impotency, fatigue, and a tight band of pressure around the head, Charcot categorically distinguished patients with neurasthenica from patients with hysteria. Like Beard, Charcot concluded that the origin of neurasthenia was psychological stress and felt the European society also fostered the environment to precipitate the disease. Charcot adamantly opposed extrapolations that called for early childhood educational reforms to reduce current classroom stress. Charcot sympathized more with the treating physician than the patient, calling neurasthenics insufferable (insupportables). On the front sheet of his neurasthenia file, he wrote in large script, "Poor Beard!"

Conclusion

By emphasizing the prevalence of neurasthenia and extending Beard's observations, Charcot internationally legitimized the new diagnosis. Adding neurasthenia to the other neurologic descriptions from the United States by Hammond, Mitchell, and Dana, Charcot helped to foster the recognition of the American Neurologic School.

### Implementing cancer symptom management interventions utilizing patient-reported outcomes: a pre-implementation evaluation of barriers and facilitators [^115WUZWa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study explored pre-implementation barriers and facilitators to ePROM implementation in the context of initiating a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized pragmatic trial of a remote symptom management intervention, Enhanced EHR (electronic health record)-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03892967). In E2C2, patients are assigned ePROMs evaluating sleep, pain, and impairment in physical function, anxiety, depression, and fatigue (low e nergy) (making up the SPPADE symptoms) in between oncology visits. The SPADE pentad comprise the most common symptoms experienced by patients in response to disease or treatment side effects, and efforts have been undertaken to validate PROM items in these domains along with impairment in physical function to promote standardization. Patients who report moderate or severe symptoms receive self-management materials; telephone support from a registered nurse trained in cancer symptom management (Symptom Care Manager [SCM]) is offered to those with severe symptoms. E2C2 is built upon the evidence-based collaborative care model; SCMs play a central role in patient care while maintaining connections to the larger care team. To identify pre-implementation barriers and facilitators that could inform intervention modifications and implementation strategies, we interviewed administrative and clinical stakeholders during the months before the first step of clinical practices were randomized to the start of the intervention period (see Fig. 1).

### Small molecule targeting r (UGGAA) disrupts RNA foci and alleviates disease phenotype in drosophila model [^115Sg1AA]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

One of the common structural characteristics observed for the toxic RNAs is the formation of hairpin structures involving multiple mismatched base pairs. The expanded r(UGGAA) n repeat RNA, causing SCA31 likely takes various secondary and tertiary structures, and these structures are under the dynamic equilibrium. We made use of our in-house MBL library containing heterocycles with different hydrogen bonding surface and identified NCD as the hit compound binding to the r(UGGAA) n repeat RNA. The binding site of NCD in r(UGGAA) n repeat RNA was firmly determined to be the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad in the secondary hairpin structure by NMR structural analysis, which also showed the substantial structural changes induced on the RNA. In the NCD-SCA31 RNA complex, NCD bound to the RNA from the minor groove side. Each one of four guanines in the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad formed the hydrogen bonds to the N -acyl-2-amino-1,8-naphthyridine in NCD, and the produced guanine-naphthyridine hydrogen-bonded pairs were stacked inside the π-stack in dsRNA. Remarkably, all four guanosine residues bound by naphthyridine formed a syn conformation regarding the glycosidic bond. Previously, we reported the NMR structure of the complex of CAG/CAG triad DNA with two molecules of naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), where the guanine-naphthyridine and adenine-azaquinolone hydrogen-bonded pairs were produced. In the case of the NA-CAG/CAG triad complex, NA bound to DNA from the major groove side and the glycosidic bond in guanosine and adenosine bound by NA adopt the anti conformation.

### Fluid particle accelerations in fully developed turbulence [^1121gykt]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The motion of fluid particles as they are pushed along erratic trajectories by fluctuating pressure gradients is fundamental to transport and mixing in turbulence. It is essential in cloud formation and atmospheric transport, processes in stirred chemical reactors and combustion systems, and in the industrial production of nanoparticles. The concept of particle trajectories has been used successfully to describe mixing and transport in turbulence, but issues of fundamental importance remain unresolved. One such issue is the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction of fluid particle accelerations, based on the 1941 scaling theory of Kolmogorov. Here we report acceleration measurements using a detector adapted from high-energy physics to track particles in a laboratory water flow at Reynolds numbers up to 63,000. We find that, within experimental errors, Kolmogorov scaling of the acceleration variance is attained at high Reynolds numbers. Our data indicate that the acceleration is an extremely intermittent variable — particles are observed with accelerations of up to 1,500 times the acceleration of gravity (equivalent to 40 times the root mean square acceleration). We find that the acceleration data reflect the anisotropy of the large-scale flow at all Reynolds numbers studied.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^116A2CKz]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mild associated gallbladder wall thickening. b Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen in the same patient, again demonstrating a distended gallbladder with an impacted hyperattenuating stone in the gallbladder neck. There is subtle associated fat stranding. Findings are consistent with a gallbladder mucocoele. The gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding are suggestive of possible empyema

Mirizzi syndrome refers to a gallstone that is impacted in the cystic duct or neck of gallbladder which causes extrinsic compression on the common bile duct resulting in obstructive jaundice (Fig. 18).

Fig. 18
a Maximum intensity projection (MIP). b Axial T2-weighted MRCP image of the biliary tree. The gallbladder is distended with extensive intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct is normal in calibre. Appearances are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome, with a stone in Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct

Both biliary dilatation and the offending gallstone can be seen on ultrasound; however, cross-sectional imaging with MRI or CT, or ERCP, may be needed to confirm that biliary dilatation is secondary to compression from a gallbladder/cystic duct stone rather than secondary to a CBD calculus.

Pancreaticobiliary system

The next anatomical location where gallstones can be found is outside the gallbladder but within the pancreaticobiliary system. When gallstones exit the gallbladder into the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis), they can often obstruct the normal drainage of bile which can lead to jaundice. This is typically associated with pain, unlike malignant biliary obstruction which is characteristically painless (Fig. 19).

Fig. 19
(a) Sagittal ultrasound, (b) fluoroscopic ERCP cholangiogram, (c) T2-weighted axial MRI and (d) coronal MIP MRI of the biliary tree. These images demonstrate multiple filling defects (arrows) within the common bile duct with associated biliary duct dilatation consistent with obstructing choledocholithiasis

The obstruction of biliary drainage and stasis of bile may result in infection in the form of ascending cholangitis and associated sepsis. The clinical picture associated with this is described in Reynolds' pentad consisting of fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, hypotension and altered mental status. These patients may require urgent decompression of the biliary system.

### Anthropogenic shift towards higher risk of flash drought over China [^1131LQ4o]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

For the case illustrated in Fig. 1, the duration for this flash drought event is 20 days (4 pentads). As compared with previous concurrent heat and drought conditions, (blue asterisks in Fig. 1), the new definition reflects both the flash (decline rate of soil moisture percentile larger than 5%) and drought (soil moisture percentile < 20%) conditions, while the previous definition may overestimate flash drought frequency with too short durations (usually only 5 days, e.g. June 20–24 in Fig. 1) that does not lead to any impact. Moreover, the severity of flash drought can also be explicitly estimated with the new definition, using the soil moisture percentile deficit during the flash drought event (red shaded area in Fig. 1).

With the new definition, the frequency, duration, and severity of flash drought events are calculated similar to those of conventional drought events, but at a higher temporal resolution. During a study period, the frequency is defined as the average number of flash drought events during the growing seasons per year, the mean duration is the average number of days during which an event lasts, and the mean severity is the mean accumulated soil moisture percentile deficits from the threshold of 40%. There is a higher chance for flash droughts over southern China (humid region) than over northern China (semiarid region), according to both the new and old definitions (Fig. 2a, b). There are more flash drought events based on the old definition (Fig. 2b), but their corresponding mean durations are very short, mostly around 7 days (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the mean durations of flash drought events based on the new definition are about 20–40 days (Fig. 2c), which is more reasonable in terms of drought impact.

### An energy-efficient pathway to turbulent drag reduction [^117U6ZS2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Simulations and experiments at low Reynolds numbers have suggested that skin-friction drag generated by turbulent fluid flow over a surface can be decreased by oscillatory motion in the surface, with the amount of drag reduction predicted to decline with increasing Reynolds number. Here, we report direct measurements of substantial drag reduction achieved by using spanwise surface oscillations at high friction Reynolds numbers ([Formula: see text]) up to 12,800. The drag reduction occurs via two distinct physical pathways. The first pathway, as studied previously, involves actuating the surface at frequencies comparable to those of the small-scale eddies that dominate turbulence near the surface. We show that this strategy leads to drag reduction levels up to 25% at [Formula: see text] = 6,000, but with a power cost that exceeds any drag-reduction savings. The second pathway is new, and it involves actuation at frequencies comparable to those of the large-scale eddies farther from the surface. This alternate pathway produces drag reduction of 13% at [Formula: see text] = 12,800. It requires significantly less power and the drag reduction grows with Reynolds number, thereby opening up potential new avenues for reducing fuel consumption by transport vehicles and increasing power generation by wind turbines.

### Global distribution, trends, and drivers of flash drought occurrence [^115MoxCK]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Data

Four global reanalysis data sets were used to generate the spatial and temporal composites of flash drought characteristics. These four data sets include MERRA, MERRA-2, ERA-Interim, and ERA5. The reanalysis data sets were selected based on their global coverage of critical land-surface variables used for flash drought analysis, their temporal focus on the satellite era, and their inclusion of coupled land and atmospheric models.

Daily ET and PET were obtained from each of the four global reanalysis data sets between 1980 and 2015. Daily PET was derived from each of the reanalysis data sets using the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith equation. Daily values of the evaporative stress ratio (ESR) were calculated by taking the ratio between daily ET and PET. Mean pentad values of ESR were computed and standardized at each grid point to calculate the standardized ESR (SESR). SESR is given as:where SESR ijp (referred to as SESR) is the z score of ESR at a specific grid point (i, j) for a specific pentad p, is the mean ESR at a specific grid point (i, j) for a specific pentad p for all years used from the gridded data set, and σ ESR is the standard deviation of ESR at a specific grid point SESR (i, j) for a specific pentad p for all years used from the gridded data set. The temporal change in SESR was also calculated and standardized:where(referred to as ΔSESR) is the z score of the change in SESR from one pentad to another pentad at a specific grid point (i, j) for a specific pentad p, is the mean change in SESR values at a specific grid point (i, j) for a specific pentad p for all years used from the gridded data set, andis the standard deviation of SESR changes at a specific grid point (i, j) for a specific pentad p for all years used from the gridded data set. SESR and ΔSESR were both detrended prior to standardizing to account for changes that may have occurred in the drought threshold (SESR) or in individual pentad changes (ΔSESR) over time due to climate change.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presenting as bilateral flank pain and hematuria: a case report [^115wXDKv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease whose incidence is now increasing. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with bilateral flank pain and hematuria, subsequently diagnosed with TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has classically been characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of the disease has been a mystery until recently. We review the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and management of this disorder. Our discussion focuses on the importance of understanding this disease while considering the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia because the common pitfall of rapidly administering platelets to a patient with TTP may lead to a disastrous outcome.

OVERDOSAGE

A 17 month old infant inadvertently received 1600 mg of intravenous pentamidine isethionate which was followed by renal and hepatic function impairment, hypotension and cardiopulmonary arrest. Treatment included cardiopulmonary resuscitation, epinephrine, atropine and intubation. In addition, a four hour course of charcoal hemoperfusion was accompanied by reduction of pentamidine serum concentration and stabilization of the patient's condition. The patient recovered from these adverse events, but later died due to an unknown cause.1

### The global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome: ready for prime time? [^111bCXS8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Is This the End of the Berlin Definition for ARDS?

Rather than a new definition, the global definition is an extension of Berlin. The intubated category retains the Pa O 2 /F O 2 severity cutoffs described before but allows the use of Sp O 2 /F O 2 when no arterial blood gas measurement is available. It adds two new categories, nonintubated ARDS and ARDS in resource-limited settings, that would otherwise not be classified as ARDS. Because the global definition is not formally endorsed by any of the scientific societies, it should not replace Berlin. Yet, it would also be detrimental to work with multiple ARDS definitions. Therefore, to ensure comparability, we strongly encourage that authors keep reporting effect estimates for patients fulfilling Berlin criteria, even when a broader population is included. A formal redefinition is very much needed and will benefit from the proposed global definition and the research that will follow.

To conclude, the proposed global definition of ARDS extends the criteria formulated in the Berlin definition and will broaden the population on a global scale. There are important uncertainties surrounding the epidemiological consequences of these changes, which require close inspection and further research. Formal reformulation of the ARDS definition through scientific societies will need to follow.

### When is measuring sensitivity and specificity sufficient to evaluate a diagnostic test, and when do we need randomized trials? [^112PxYig]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical value of using a new diagnostic test depends on whether it improves patient outcomes beyond the outcomes achieved using an old diagnostic test. When can studies of diagnostic test accuracy provide sufficient information to infer clinical value, and when do clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials? The authors argue that accuracy studies suffice if a new diagnostic test is safer or more specific than, but of similar sensitivity to, an old test. However, if a new test is more sensitive than an old test, it leads to the detection of extra cases of disease. Results from treatment trials that enrolled only patients detected by the old test may not apply to these extra cases. Clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials assessing treatment efficacy in cases detected by the new diagnostic test, unless they can be satisfied that the new test detects the same spectrum and subtype of disease as the old test or that treatment response is similar across the spectrum of disease.

### "New twist" in diabetes care for HbA (1c) reporting: "it takes two to tango"! [^114xmMUd]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

One of the new initiatives we would like to report is called Profiles in Progress, and the first narrative appears in this issue. This initiative was the result of an incredible idea from Lyn Reynolds, who has expertly managed the editorial office of Diabetes Care for many years. The purpose of this narrative and new initiative is to specifically recognize a researcher or provider in the field of diabetes whose contributions and discoveries were so noteworthy and remarkable that the findings truly changed the landscape of diabetes management forever. Our plans are to have such narratives in Diabetes Care three to four times per year. It is appropriate and fitting that our first Profiles in Progress, a contribution from Dr. Erika Gebel, Associate Editor of Diabetes Forecast, recognizes Dr. Samuel Rahbar. Dr. Rahbar discovered that HbA 1c is elevated in individuals with diabetes and, as a result of this research, this test has become an invaluable aspect of management. Clearly, Dr. Rahbar should feel gratified that his dedication to this cause and his life's work can be directly linked to a reduction in morbidity and mortality from diabetes.

### Small molecule targeting r (UGGAA) disrupts RNA foci and alleviates disease phenotype in drosophila model [^114n5RPS]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Sequence selectivity in the binding of NCD to mutated UGGAA/UGGAA pentad

To know if NCD binding to the r(UGGAA) 9 involved the binding to the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad in the secondary hairpin structure, T m s of the RNA duplexes containing the URRAA/URRAA pentad, where R is guanine (G) or adenine (A), were measured in the absence and presence of NCD (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6). A marked increase in the T m by 21.5 °C was observed for the duplex containing the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad (5ʹ-GGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AGG-5ʹ) in the presence of NCD (red bar), whereas no increase in the T m was observed with quinoline carbamate dimer (QCD) (blue bar). QCD did not show the band shift for r(UGGAA) 9 in EMSA (Supplementary Fig. 4). Replacing one guanine in 5ʹ-GGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AGG-5ʹ with adenine to 5ʹ-GGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AGA-5ʹ resulted in a modest T m increase (5.2 °C) in the presence of NCD. Further substitution of the guanine in 5ʹ-GGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AGA-5ʹ with adenine to 5ʹ-AGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AGA-5ʹ and 5ʹ-GGA-3ʹ/3ʹ-AAA-5ʹ diminished the effect of NCD on the increase in T m. Substantial changes on CD spectra of the duplex containing the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad were also observed in the presence of NCD but not QCD (Fig. 2b). These results suggested that NCD binding to the r(UGGAA) 9 likely involved the binding to the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad. With the 29-mer hairpin-RNA containing the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad (SCA31 hpRNA; Supplementary Fig. 7), the stoichiometry of NCD binding to the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad was determined to be 2:1 by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF MS) analysis (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). The ions corresponding to the 1:1 complex was not detected under the conditions, suggesting that binding of two NCD molecules to the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad would be necessary to stabilize the NCD-SCA31 hpRNA complex. Accurate thermodynamic parameters for the binding of NCD to the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to give Δ H –10.6 kcal mol –1, Δ S –1.3 cal mol –1 K –1, and Δ G –10.2 kcal mol –1 (at 25 °C), leading to an apparent dissociation constant K d(app) of 32 nM (Fig. 2d).

### Dimensionless learning based on information [^11485HUA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Dimensionless learning for mean velocity

Firstly, we discover a local scaling for the mean velocity profile in compressible turbulent channels using high-fidelity simulation data from existing literature. The dataset, which spans different Reynolds and Mach numbers, includes the mean velocity q o = u and the flow state, where y is the wall-normal distance, ρ and μ are the local density and viscosity, ρ w and μ w are the density and viscosity at the wall, and τ w is the wall shear stress. By limiting the number of inputs to one, IT- π identifies the optimal dimensionless variable with the highest predictive capabilities. The dimensionless inputs and outputs discovered by IT- π are summarized in Fig. 4 (Column 2, Row 2). Panels (c) and (d) demonstrate that the scaling identified by IT- π improves the collapse of the compressible velocity profiles across the range of Mach and Reynolds numbers considered compared to the classic viscous scaling. A closer inspection of the dimensionless input and output variables reveals that this improvement is accomplished by accounting for local variations in density and viscosity.

### Ultrasound-activated ciliary bands for microrobotic systems inspired by starfish [^1148uc5U]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The first-order fluid response is represented by the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, (Eq. S4 and S5) and can be expressed in terms of the nondimensional frequency Reynolds number. We begin by defining the following nondimensional quantities:where, anddenote the characteristic scales for the first-order velocity, density, time, and viscosity, respectively. Using these nondimensional quantities, the first-order momentum equation can be expressed aswhere, as expected, the relative strength of the inertial and viscous terms at the first-order is characterized by the frequency Reynolds number given as, withbeing the characteristic length scale for the first-order system. Noting that the first-order (actuation) velocity scale can be expressed asand denoting kinematic viscosity as, the frequency Reynolds number can be expressed as

Next, we consider the relative strength of the forcing term in the second-order momentum equation (Eq. (3)) with respect to the viscous terms.

Specifically, the third term on the left-hand side of Eq. (3) scales as, while the viscous term in Eq. (3) scales as. Therefore, the relative strength of the forcing term with respect to the viscous terms is given by the ratiowhereanddenote the characteristic scales for the streaming velocity, length, and time, respectively. Thus, the forcing term in the second-order system depends on the frequency Reynolds number as well as the separation of time and length (or velocity) scales between the first-order and the streaming flow. Consequently, a sufficiently large Reynolds number and adequately separated time and length scales can introduce significant inertia in the second-order equations and therefore violate the contingency of the scallop theorem, to achieve propulsion even with a reciprocal actuation. Furthermore, since Re f scales linearly with the frequency and amplitude of a vibrating object, the frequency Reynolds number of the ciliary bands can be engineered to have intermediate values, which implies that inertia can be introduced to produce propulsion at microscale even for reciprocal motion. The frequency Reynolds number of our oscillating cilium can be estimated as, where f = 100 kHz is the excitation frequency and(see also Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Movie 1).

Structural analysis of NCD-UGGAA/UGGAA pentad complex by NMR

Interactions of NCD with the SCA31 hpRNA (Fig. 3a) were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Figure 3b showed the changes in NMR signals of exchangeable protons upon the addition of NCD, indicating the structural change of SCA31 hpRNA. Signals that appeared around 10–12 ppm were due to the formation of four naphthyridine-guanine hydrogen-bonded pairs, which were confirmed by the NOE, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is noted that signals of guanosine residues of the UGGAA/UGGAA pentad could not be observed without NCD, likely due to the exchange broadening, suggesting that the UGGAA/UGGAA region is structurally flexible.

### Systemic infections mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116nGcqL]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

The absence of specific diagnostic criteria, the urgency to begin plasma exchange treatment, and the risk for complications from plasma exchange make the initial evaluation of patients with suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) difficult. Systemic infections may mimic the presenting clinical features of TTP. In the Oklahoma TTP-HUS (hemolytic-uremic syndrome) Registry, 1989–2010, 415 consecutive patients have been clinically diagnosed with their first episode of TTP; in 31 (7%) the presenting clinical features were subsequently attributed to a systemic infection. All 31 patients had diagnostic criteria for TTP; 16 (52%) had the complete "pentad" of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities, renal failure, and fever. Four (16%) of 25 patients who had ADAMTS13 measurements had < 10% activity; three patients had a demonstrable ADAMTS13 inhibitor. Compared with 62 patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (< 10%) who had no recognized alternative disorders, patients with systemic infections had more frequent fever, coma, renal failure, and the complete "pentad" of clinical features. Seventeen different infectious etiologies were documented. A systematic literature review identified 67 additional patients with a diagnosis of TTP or HUS and also a systemic infection. Among all 98 patients, infections with 41 different bacteria, viruses, and fungi were documented, suggesting that many different systemic infections may mimic the presenting clinical features of TTP. Initial plasma exchange treatment is appropriate in critically ill patients with diagnostic features of TTP, even if a systemic infection is suspected. Continuing evaluation to document a systemic infection is essential to determine the appropriateness of continued plasma exchange.

### Clinical characteristics, predictors, and rates of hospitalized acute cholangitis patients in the United States [^113FUext]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholangitis (AC) is a bacterial infection of the biliary tree, usually following an obstruction or stasis. It presents with the classic triad of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice, known as Charcot's triad. In severe cases, if it also presents with hypotension and altered mental status in addition to the classic Charcot's triad, it is known as Reynold's pentad. In the United States, the peak incidence is between 50 and 60 years, and there is an equal prevalence among males and females. Diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical symptoms, signs, biochemical markers of cholestasis and imaging. In patients presenting with AC, image findings depending on modality and etiology can vary, but include stones in the bile duct, increased signal intensity, enhancement of the bile duct and biliary stenosis. The severity of AC determines the urgency of biliary drainage: for mild cases, adequate resuscitation and antibiotic therapy may be sufficient, while severe cases involving organ dysfunction require urgent or emergent biliary drainage procedures, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Our study aimed to assess the trends, healthcare utilization, costs and outcomes associated with patients admitted with AC in the United States in the years 2016 and 2017.

### Management of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy with baclofen [^113mv8Ay]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep-wake disorder characterized by the pentad symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, sleep fragmentation, sleep-related hallucinations, and cataplexy. There is no curative therapy for narcolepsy. Treatment is therefore symptom directed. Symptom management is generally directed at improving excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, and cataplexy. First-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness is typically daily use of wake-promoting agents, such as modafinil or armodafinil, or stimulant therapy, such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Alternatively, sodium oxybate can be used nightly for improved cataplexy, sleep consolidation, and following day wakefulness. These therapies can be limited in some patients because of inadequate efficacy, poor tolerability, or side effects.

Methods

We describe five narcolepsy patients with severe excessive daytime sleepiness who had an inadequate response or experienced side effects with the initial therapies but had a positive response to treatment with baclofen.

Results

These patients reported subjective improvement in sleep maintenance without fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. Average Epworth Sleepiness Scale assessment before treatment was 15.8 with post-treatment assessment being 10.4 (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Baclofen may be an effective treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep fragmentation in narcolepsy and warrants further study.

### Obstruction of the biliary and urinary system [^112xWrHo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Biliary and urinary obstructions can be managed endoscopically or cystoscopically, surgically or by percutansous intervention or drainage. If the obtructed system is infected, emergent decompression is needed. Early recognition and treatment is paramount in both conditions. Acute cholangitis can present many different ways, from mild symptoms to fulminant sepsis. It is usually a result of ascending bacterial colonization and biliary obstruction resulting in bacterial overgrowth. Therefore, those patients with recent biliary instrumentation or previous biliary modification are at higher risk. Charcot's triad of fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and jaundice is only seen in 50%-70% of patients. Fever is seen in over 90% of cases, pain is seen in 70% of cases, and jaundice is seen in 60% of cases. Altered mental status and hypotension are associated with severe cases. All 5 symptoms of fever, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, altered mental status, and hypotension are referred to as Reynold's Pentad. Acute pyonephrosis can also present many different ways, from minimal symptoms to fulminant sepsis. Fever, chills, and flank pain are the classic symptoms, although some patients may be relatively asymptomatic. Pyonephrosis may present with a classic triad of fever, flank pain, and hydronephrosis, or simply hydronephrosis and sepsis. Pyonephrosis usually occurs as a result of urinary obstruction with either an ascending infection of the urinary tract or hematogenous spread of a bacterial pathogen as the culprit. Up to 75% of cases are related to urinary stone disease. Patients are at increased risk for pyonephrosis when they haven anatomic urinary tract obstruction, certain chronic diseases (diabetes meliitus and AIDS), or are immunosuppressed due to immunodeficiency or medications, (chronic steroid therapy).

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^1121TyWT]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 100th anniversary of the first description of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a disease by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz approaches. For many decades, TTP remained mostly a mysterious fatal condition, where diagnosis was often post‐mortem. Initially a pentad of symptoms was identified, a pattern that later revealed to be fallible. Sporadic observations led to empiric interventions that allowed for the first impactful breakthrough in TTP treatment, almost 70 years after its first description: the introduction of plasma exchange and infusions as treatments. The main body of knowledge within the field was gathered in the latest three decades: patient registries were set and proved crucial for advancements; the general mechanisms of disease have been described; the diagnosis was refined; new treatments and biomarkers with improvements on prognosis and management were introduced. Further changes and improvements are expected in the upcoming decades. In this review, we provide a brief historic overview of TTP, as an illustrative example of the success of translational medicine enabling to rapidly shift from a management largely based on empiricism to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, for the benefit of patients. Current management options and present and future perspectives in this still evolving field are summarized.

### Efficient mixing at low reynolds numbers using polymer additives [^112EkCRL]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Mixing in fluids is a rapidly developing area in fluid mechanics, being an important industrial and environmental problem. The mixing of liquids at low Reynolds numbers is usually quite weak in simple flows, and it requires special devices to be efficient. Recently, the problem of mixing was solved analytically for a simple case of random flow, known as the Batchelor regime. Here we demonstrate experimentally that very viscous liquids containing a small amount of high-molecular-weight polymers can be mixed quite efficiently at very low Reynolds numbers, for a simple flow in a curved channel. A polymer concentration of only 0.001% suffices. The presence of the polymers leads to an elastic instability and to irregular flow, with velocity spectra corresponding to the Batchelor regime. Our detailed observations of the mixing in this regime enable us to confirm several important theoretical predictions: the probability distributions of the concentration exhibit exponential tails, moments of the distribution decay exponentially along the flow, and the spatial correlation function of concentration decays logarithmically.

### Optimal blade pitch control for enhanced vertical-axis wind turbine performance [^112G1iBG]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The turbine model was driven by a NEMA 34 stepper motor with a 0.05° resolution for the angular position. The rotational speed was at Ω = 5.6 rad s −1, yielding a constant chord-based Reynolds number based on the blade velocity of R e c = (ρ Ω R c)/ μ = 50000. An alternative definition of the Reynolds number is used in wind-farm level investigations and is obtained from the free-stream velocity and turbine diameter: R e D = (ρ U ∞ D)/ μ. Here, the turbine model is operating between R e D = 168000 for λ = 1.5 and R e D = 78750 for λ = 3.2. The blade was connected to a separate direct-drive stepper motor with a 1: 12 gear reduction yielding a high torque mechanism with a 0.0015° angular resolution. All motors were individually controlled and synchronized using a three-thread motion controller (GALIL-4080).

### Hydrodynamic cavitation in stokes flow of anisotropic fluids [^111CGLmh]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We apply the density maps presented in Fig. 3a–c for estimating the volume, V c, of the cavitation domain. The total volume was obtained by adding up all the cubic volumes for which the local density ρ l ≤ 0.15. Figure 5 plots the variation of V c with the Reynolds number Re, where Re cr denotes the critical Reynolds number for the cavitation inception. Alongside anisotropic system described so far, we have also performed MD simulations for the same LC model in the isotropic phase (T = 1.1). The two systems differ in their viscosity η: the nematic LC (η ≃37) is more viscous than the isotropic LC (η ≃21). Thus, from the definition of Re, it follows that the nematic LC cavitates at lower critical Reynolds number Re cr than the isotropic LC. That fluids with lower viscosity require a larger Re cr to cavitate is consistent with our experiments. Neither the deionized water nor 5CB in isotropic phase elicited cavitation at Reynolds numbers in which the nematic 5CB cavitated. It is important to note here that, in our simulations, the Re cr for the nematic LC is of the same order of magnitude as the local Re in the microfluidic experiments (≃0.1).

### Diagnostic testing and decision-making: beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder [^117PW1St]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

CHOOSING AND REPORTING THE CUT-POINT FOR A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE BIOMARKER

In addition to assessing the overall discriminative ability of a biomarker, it is often of interest to identify the best cut-point for that continuous or ordinal biomarker to be used in practice to classify individual patients as either having or not having the disease or outcome of interest.

First, it is not always prudent or feasible to make a recommendation of a cut-point because there might not exists a cut-point that gives adequate sensitivity and specificity. In their study design phase, researchers should specify the minimal criteria for reporting a cut-point at all — for example, requiring a certain minimum value for each of sensitivity and specificity, such as 70% or 75%, or an AUC of ≥ 0.75. It is not helpful or prudent to introduce a new cut-point into practice if it does not have sufficient accuracy.

A common method for estimating an optimal cut-point is to choose a threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity (not their sum). One simply calculates sensitivity and specificity for each observed value of the biomarker and identifies the cut-point (or cut-points) that generate the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. This is appropriate when sensitivity and specificity are thought to be equally important for the study at hand, implying that a false-positive or false-negative mistake would be equally costly.

Alternatively, researchers might require a minimum specificity (or sensitivity), which would influence the choice of optimal cut-point. For example, it may be that the cut-point that maximizes sensitivity and specificity yields a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 78%. But if ≥ 90% specificity were required, the optimal cut-point for this study might have a sensitivity of only 60%. The desired balance between sensitivity and specificity should be determined and justified a priori.

### Single-cell data reveal heterogeneity of investment in ribosomes across a bacterial population [^111iN3Nq]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fabrication of microfluidic devices

The master-molds were obtained from Epsilon Micro Devices (College of Engineering, Zahn Center, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego CA). In order to produce PDMS mother machines, with microchannels of dimensions 25 × 1.2 × 1.3 μ m, we adapted the protocol from the mother machine handbook published by the Jun laboratory at UC San Diego. In particular, we mixed a curing agent and polymer base at a 1:10 ratio (Sylgard Elastomer Kit 184). The mix was poured into the mold and trapped air bubbles were removed in a vacuum chamber. The resulting devices were cured for a minimum of 2 hours at 65 °C. Devices were then removed from the master-mold and a 0.75 mm punch was used to create the inlet and the outlet. Before use, the devices were treated with pentane and acetone and were left to dry overnight. A plasma cleaner (PDC-32G Harrick Plasma) operated at high intensity for 40 seconds was used for surface activation of the devices and previously cleaned microscope slides. Each device was placed on a microscope slide and then put at 65 °C for 10 minutes. 50 mg/mL of BSA was injected into the sealed devices for surface passivation and the devices were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour.

Device loading and medium shifts

Precultures were performed in the same way as for the batch growth experiments described above. The optical density of strains growing in minimal medium with acetate was monitored and the cells were harvested during balanced growth (after at least 6 generations). The cells were then washed with fresh medium containing 50 mg/mL of BSA, concentrated around 100-fold and loaded into the device. The individual cells growing in the microchannels were left overnight in acetate to reach balanced growth before starting image acquisition.

An Elveflow pressure controller (OB1 MK3) equipped with a microfluidic flow sensor (0 to 50 μ L/min) was used to assure a constant flow delivery of 20 μ L/min to the device. The bottles of medium to be changed at the time of medium switches were prepared and put at 37 °C many hours before the switch. After the switch, 2 to 3 minutes were required for the new medium to reach the device. The corresponding dead-volume and dead-time were taken into account in all our analyses. Figure S3 illustrates the scenario for a typical microfluidics experiment.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presenting as pancreatitis [^111p6Zuf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare clinical entity. It is a multi-systemic disorder characterized by a clinical pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, diffuse and nonfocal neurologic symptoms, decreased renal function, and fever. Abdominal pain is an uncommon presenting symptom for TTP. Pancreatitis may occur from TTP or, in a few cases, may trigger TTP. The clinical diagnosis of TTP is generally difficult because there are many varied clinical presentations and the full expression of the pentad may be prolonged. However, once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, immediate plasmapherseis with plasma exchange must be performed to reduce the severe morbidity from neurologic disability.

### Microangiopathies in pregnancy [^111Psoy4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a potentially reversible, life-threatening medical emergency. We present a case of a 21-year-old female with evidence of haemolytic anaemia based on the presence of positive markers of haemolysis. Negative Coomb's test, thrombocytopenia and placental infarcts raised suspicion for a thrombotic microangiopathy. She was diagnosed with TTP and managed with emergency plasma exchange. Her recovery was immediate. A presumptive diagnosis of TTP should be based on the presence of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with thrombocytopenia and plasma exchange should be initiated while complete work up is pending. Using the regular pentad solely for diagnosis of TTP will lead to underdiagnosis of many cases and should be avoided. Several microangiopathies can be seen during pregnancy including TTP/atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, HELLP syndrome, pre-eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Distinction between each type will be the focus of our discussion as treatment decisions differ accordingly.

### Schizotypal traits and depressive symptoms in nonclinical adolescents [^1151tn1K]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The main goal of this study was to examine the relationship between schizotypal personality traits and depressive symptoms in a sample of nonclinical adolescents. The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (J Personal Disord 1995;9:346–355) and the Reynolds Depression Adolescent Scale (Reynolds WM. Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale. Professional Manual. Odessa: Psychological Assessment Resources, Inc; 1987) were administered. The sample was made up of 1384 adolescents (48.6% boys), with a mean (SD) age of 15.7 (1.0) years. The results of the study indicate a high degree of overlap between schizotypal experiences and depressive symptoms at a nonclinical level. Canonical correlation between the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief scales and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale scales was 0.63, which represents 39.69% of the associated variance between the 2 sets of variables. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 4-dimensional model made up of the Positive, Interpersonal, Disorganized, and Depressive dimensions was that which best fit the data. Moreover, the dimensional structure underlying the schizotypal traits and depressive symptoms was found to be invariant across sex and age. These findings converge with data found in previous studies of both patients with schizophrenia and nonclinical adults and suggest that affective dysregulation is also present at a subclinical level. Future research should continue to make progress in the early detection of participants at risk of developing schizophrenia-spectrum disorders based on the early identification of these types of subclinical traits.

### Characteristics of pentosan polysulfate sodium-associated maculopathy and similarities with other maculopathies commonly managed in a retina practice [^1165fHPz]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work describes characteristics of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS)-associated maculopathy and its similarities with common maculopathies in a retina practice cohort.

Methods

Thirty-two patients were identified through electronic medical record query who were exposed to PPS. One patient was excluded for lack of retinal imaging. Thirty-one patients (62 eyes) were included. A retrospective review was used to obtain patient characteristics, examination findings, and retinal imaging of the study patients. Classification into "likely", "unlikely", or "possible" to have PPS-associated maculopathy groups was based on the fundus photography and retinal imaging. Main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity, age, sex, diagnosis of reason for referral, allocation into designated maculopathy group, and presence of choroidal neovascularization.

Results

Of 31 patients (62 eyes), the median age was 70 years (range, 24–104 years) and the majority were women (87%). Mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.3 ± 0.4 logMAR at presentation. The most common reason for referral was age-related macular degeneration (29%). Maculopathy grades were "likely" (29%, 9 total patients), "possible" (26%, 8 total patients), or "unlikely" (45%, 14 total patients). Choroidal neovascularization was noted in 9.7% of all eyes and 11% of eyes in the "likely" group. The "possible" and "likely" groups had older ages of presentation (P < .05) compared with the "unlikely" group.

Conclusions

A high percentage (55%) of patients with a history of chronic PPS exposure showed features of "likely" or "possible" maculopathy. Similarities with common maculopathies such as age-related macular degeneration and the importance of screening and recognizing at-risk patients are highlighted.

### Photocatalytic COreduction with aminoanthraquinone organic dyes [^1119a52Z]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Proposed mechanism of light-driven CO 2 reduction.

a Light-driven redox steps of the PS; b CO 2 reduction mechanism under > 400 nm light irradiation; c CO 2 reduction mechanism under > 550 nm light irradiation.

The light-driven redox process of the AQ-based dyes has been a subject of great interest in photochemistry –, however, due to the various intermediates in reductions and protonations, the reaction mechanism is still under debate. Because AQ generates a similar intermediate at ~400 nm as PSs 1–6 during photolysis (Supplementary Figs. 30–36), the light-driven process of AQ was investigated to gain useful mechanistic information. UV–vis spectra reveal that photolysis of AQ in the presence of BIH in DMF quickly generates a species at 560 nm in 1 min (Fig. 5a). Since it is clear neither the 1 electron reduced AQ (545 nm) nor the 2 electron reduction product AQ 2− (622 nm) gives a good match, this species is assigned to an e − /H + product AQH•. In fact, a semiquinone at 570 nm has been detected in an osmium triad. An AQ − species can be observed unambiguously from a reaction with NaBH 4 (Supplementary Fig. 37). It is not surprising that the AQ − undergoes a fast protonation by BIH + to produce the AQH•. Upon continued irradiation, an intermediate at ~520 nm is observed (Fig. 5a), which is consistent with the generation of an AQH −. A further protonation of the AQH − species to generate a 10-hydroxyanthrone (AQH 2) is expected to take place based on 1 H NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig. 38). The UV–vis spectra also shows another absorption peak at ~407 nm (Fig. 5a), which is similar to a proposed AQH 2 intermediate at 407 nm from an AQ-containing pentad complex reported by Wenger et al.

Symptom burden in POTS patients

Symptoms of POTS most frequently reported by survey respondents are detailed in Table 4. The most common symptoms include lightheadedness (n = 3992; 99%), tachycardia (n = 3901; 97%), presyncope (n = 3789; 94%), headache (n = 3797; 94%) and difficulty concentrating (n = 3794; 94%). Of these symptoms, the triad of lightheadedness, tachycardia and presyncope was concomitantly present in 3677 (91%) of respondents. A pentad of all five symptoms was reported by 3331 (83%) of respondents.

Symptom changes over time in POTS patients

Compared to when their symptoms started, 1702 (42%) patients reported that their symptoms had generally improved a little (n = 1167; 29%) or a lot (n = 535; 13%). Ten per cent (n = 400) of participants reported no change in symptoms. Additionally, 1756 (44%) patients reported that their symptoms had worsened a lot (n = 1197; 30%) or a little (n = 559; 14%). Almost two‐thirds of respondents (n = 2552; 63%) believed they have always had a tendency to have POTS‐like symptoms for most of their lives.

Nearly, one‐third (n = 490; 29%) of participants whose symptoms improved a little or a lot reported that medications were the predominant reason for this improvement. A majority of participants reporting some improvement (n = 876; 52%) reported that nonpharmacological factors had also been helpful (in addition to medications). A larger proportion (P < 0.001) of participants seen at an Autonomic Disorders Consortium site reported symptom improvement (n = 187/347; 54%) in comparison with those who were seen elsewhere (n = 1974/3476; 43%).

Participants reported having to go to the emergency department significantly fewer times after their diagnosis of POTS (paired difference in visits: 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9, 2.7; P < 0.001), although they still averaged 8 ± 20 visits postdiagnosis.

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^114hEGBB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Editorial

As universally known, acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of cholelithiasis. It is a very common problem and general surgeons have to face it daily. The absolute heterogeneity of patients, co-morbidities and environment in which this disease presents, make the diagnosis, and the subsequent therapeutic procedures, very difficult to standardize. The full complement of the signs and symptoms historically described as the "Charcot's triad" or the "Reynolds' pentad" are infrequent and, as such, do not really assist the clinician with planning management strategies. Few different consensus conference and severity score grading systems have been published from expert panels in recent years with consequent comments and criticisms. Recently an International Consensus meeting held in Tokyo established evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis, severity assessment and treatment of acute cholecystitis (Tokyo guidelines). The Tokyo guidelines is a fine methodologically and scientifically correct study which defines the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the acute biliary infections. Although many different diagnostic and treatment methodologies have been developed in recent years, none of them have been assessed scientifically to become a standard method in the management of acute biliary infections and, more specifically, acute cholecystitis. The Tokyo extraordinary expert panel, by a meticulous review of English-language literature, demonstrated that a structured diagnostic and severity scoring system for acute biliary infections is not available, and consequently tried to overcome this scientific gap.

### Scientific multi-agent reinforcement learning for wall-models of turbulent flows [^112YXqNp]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Testing: turbulent channel flow

We examine the model predictions on turbulent channel flow for Reynolds numbers in the range from 5200 to 10 6 (Fig. 3). In the case of VWM, we expect that as long asis within the range observed during the training process, the model will perform as expected. Cases at R e τ = 2 × 10 4 and 5 × 10 4 produce high errors as theis not within the trained range. Once the values ofare adjusted to be within the range by refining the grid, the errors decrease significantly. This entails refining the grid for higher Reynolds numbers to allow the first grid point off the wall to be within the trained range of. In the case of LLWM, we observe that the prediction error in the friction velocity is less than 4% while the mean velocity profiles are well-aligned with the log law regardless of the value of. The error increases with Reynolds number, most likely due to the high variation of the streamwise wall-normal gradient with increasing Reynolds number as well as the departure offrom the trained range of values. Still, the results are comparable to the results obtained from the widely used equilibrium wall model (EQWM) up to R e τ ≈ 10 5, which uses an empirical coefficient tuned for this particular flow configuration. This range of Reynolds numbers is sufficient for various external aerodynamic and geophysical flows. The predicted mean velocity profiles for both models are shown in Fig. 4.

### Expert opinion: patient selection for premixed insulin formulations in diabetes care [^111Cg8Ma]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Glucometric Indices

The evolution of objective glucometric indices has provided a better understanding of glycemic control. Both fasting and postprandial levels of glycemia are components in determining the HbA1c levels. The most common indices for glycemic control include fasting and postprandial glucose levels and HbA1c. These together make the glycemic triad. These parameters together with minimum glycemic variability and minimum hypoglycemia make the glycemic tetrad and pentad, respectively.

Various glucometric indices such as postprandial glucose excursions (PPGE) and the prandial fasting index (PFI) have been suggested to bring objectivity to the choice of therapy (Table 3). These indices help to determine the relative contribution of fasting and postprandial glucose levels to hyperglycemia. While these indices are not validated, they serve as a useful therapeutic framework to allow use of insulin in a rational manner. High PPGE and PFI suggest a higher postprandial glycemic burden. Another validated index calculated as the ratio of the fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c index serves as an indicator of the contribution of fasting hyperglycemia to the glycemic burden. When compared with the ratio of fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c, PPGE and PFI are cheaper alternatives and are more affordable. These indices can serve as useful clinical decision-making tools in diabetes care. The indices should be validated in clinical studies for informed and widespread application in diabetes management.

Results

Clinical features

Clinical findings are summarised in table 1. All patients presented with global developmental delay. Motor development was severely affected in all but one patient (91.6%), and four of these patients (36.4%) were non-ambulatory at ages 5.0, 2.5, 11.0 and 15.0 years, respectively. Spastic paraplegia or cerebellar signs were not reported in this cohort. Eight patients were non-verbal, while four had very poor speech limited to a few single words. One patient was reported to have cortical blindness. Eleven patients (91.6%) had epilepsy, with age of onset varying from the neonatal period up to the age of 5 years. In seven patients, seizures were generalised, four of which presented with infantile spasms. Four patients were refractory to treatment. Five patients (5/10, 50%) had postnatal microcephaly (−2.5 SD and –4.5 SD) and five patients were normocephalic. Six patients (6/10, 60%) presented with mild dysmorphic facial features, while four patients were not dysmorphic. Dysmorphic facial features included a high forehead and deep-set eyes (patient 2) and a round face with a flat nasal bridge, cupid upper lip and full lower lip in patient 3. Dysmorphic features were not further specified for patients 1 and 4.
