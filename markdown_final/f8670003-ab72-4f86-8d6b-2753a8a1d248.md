## Question

Treatment for tick bite one week ago

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a tick bite that occurred one week ago, including whether prophylaxis is indicated, what to do now, and how to monitor for disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing relative to the 72-hour window for post-exposure prophylaxis. Then, I should verify the high-risk criteria for Lyme disease prophylaxis and whether they were met. Next, I will review what to do now, including whether to test or treat asymptomatic patients. After that, I need to outline a watchful waiting plan and the red flags that warrant urgent evaluation. Finally, I should consider special situations like pregnancy, children, and non-Lyme tick-borne infections, and close with prevention counseling and a clear summary recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the timing, because that drives everything here. Post-exposure prophylaxis with a single dose of doxycycline is recommended only if it can be given within 72 hours of tick removal, so at one week post-bite, that window has closed and prophylaxis is no longer indicated, regardless of risk status [^115Kk5NG] [^116X7ngT] [^112TcpTo].

> Wait, let me verify the high-risk criteria anyway, even though the window has passed, so I don't miss anything. High-risk for Lyme disease prophylaxis requires three simultaneous conditions: the tick is an Ixodes species vector, the bite occurred in a highly endemic area, and the tick was attached for at least 36 hours; if any of these are uncertain or not met, prophylaxis would not have been offered even within 72 hours, reinforcing a watchful waiting approach here [^115Kk5NG] [^113hxftQ] [^116wF6wB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. I should confirm that routine serologic testing of asymptomatic patients after a tick bite is not recommended, because early testing is often falsely negative and a positive result in the absence of symptoms does not mandate treatment; similarly, testing the removed tick for Borrelia burgdorferi is discouraged because it does not reliably predict human infection risk [^114H2axT] [^115fiPMK] [^116xxaGp] [^115CE6a9].

> Next, I should review what to do now. The appropriate management at one week post-bite is watchful waiting with patient education, focusing on early signs of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, and arranging follow-up if symptoms develop; if the patient is asymptomatic, no antibiotics are indicated at this time [^116nHB9J] [^113tvgUa] [^117M4XSH].

> I will now examine the monitoring plan and symptom triggers for action. The patient should monitor for erythema migrans, fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, malaise, or neurologic symptoms such as cranial nerve palsy; if any of these occur within about 30 days of the bite, then evaluation and treatment should be initiated, typically with doxycycline for early localized Lyme disease if there are no contraindications [^116nHB9J] [^117M4XSH] [^112d4pj8].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or the patient is a young child; I need to ensure I address safe options. In pregnancy or in children under 8 years, amoxicillin is preferred for treatment if Lyme disease develops; doxycycline is acceptable for children 8 years and older and is the first-line agent for most nonpregnant adults with early Lyme disease, with cefuroxime as an alternative when needed [^115csPij] [^112d4pj8].

> Let me consider other tick-borne infections that could emerge now, because I should not anchor on Lyme alone. Anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis present 5–14 days after a bite with fever and systemic symptoms and are treated with doxycycline; Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be severe and mandates empiric doxycycline when suspected, without waiting for confirmatory tests; babesiosis should be considered if hemolysis or thrombocytopenia appear; none of these warrant prophylaxis after a bite, but early recognition and treatment are critical if symptoms arise [^1171CUri] [^11532McC] [^113hPSzc] [^1116zHZK].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing any diagnostic steps that could change management now. For an asymptomatic patient one week after a bite, no serology or PCR is indicated; if symptoms develop, diagnosis of early Lyme disease is clinical when erythema migrans is present, and if atypical skin lesions occur, acute-phase serology followed by convalescent-phase testing can be considered, recognizing that early serology may be negative [^113GPmR2] [^114eAF72].

> Next, I should review prevention counseling for future exposures, because reducing risk going forward is important. Advise using DEET or picaridin on skin, permethrin-treated clothing, protective clothing and tick checks, bathing within 2 hours after outdoor exposure, and prompt mechanical removal of any new ticks with fine-tipped tweezers; remind the patient that nonmechanical methods are ineffective and may increase risk, and that ticks should be removed as soon as possible, ideally within 36 hours of attachment [^112vkRcj] [^115eTM2H] [^113fUP27] [^112gZvfr] [^115xUopi].

> Let me reconsider the core question to ensure internal consistency. At one week post-bite, prophylaxis is not indicated, testing is not recommended in the absence of symptoms, and the correct course is watchful waiting with clear return precautions; if symptoms occur, treat according to guideline-directed therapy for the specific tick-borne illness, with doxycycline as first-line for most bacterial infections in appropriate patients and amoxicillin or cefuroxime as alternatives when indicated [^115Kk5NG] [^112d4pj8] [^1118mHvH].

> Final recommendation: No prophylaxis at one week; no testing if asymptomatic; provide written and verbal education on signs of early Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections; arrange follow-up or urgent reassessment if erythema migrans, fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, or neurologic symptoms develop within the next 3–4 weeks; if symptoms occur, initiate guideline-concordant therapy promptly, typically doxycycline for adults and children 8 years and older, with amoxicillin or cefuroxime for pregnant patients or children under 8 years when treating early Lyme disease [^115Kk5NG] [^112d4pj8] [^115csPij].

---

For a tick bite one week ago, **prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated** because the window for effective prophylaxis has passed (> 72 hours) [^115Kk5NG] [^113hxftQ]. Management is **watchful waiting** with close monitoring for erythema migrans or systemic symptoms for 30 days [^116nHB9J]. If erythema migrans or compatible symptoms develop, treat with **doxycycline for 10 days** (amoxicillin or cefuroxime for 14 days if doxycycline is contraindicated) [^1118mHvH] [^112d4pj8]. Serologic testing is not recommended for asymptomatic patients [^1122EWB8] [^114H2axT]. Educate on signs of Lyme disease and advise seeking care if symptoms occur [^116nHB9J].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

Assess the **following factors** to guide management:

- **Tick species**: Ixodes scapularis (deer tick) or Ixodes pacificus (western black-legged tick) are high-risk vectors for Lyme disease [^117THWQF].

- **Geographic location**: Highly endemic areas include the northeastern, upper midwestern, and northern California regions [^116ZGWQX].

- **Duration of attachment**: ≥ 36 hours significantly increases the risk of Lyme disease transmission [^117TDVBP].

- **Patient symptoms**: Presence of erythema migrans (EM) rash, fever, arthralgias, or neurologic symptoms [^117M4XSH].

---

## Indications for prophylactic antibiotics

Prophylactic antibiotics are **only indicated** if all of the following criteria are met:

- **Tick species**: Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus [^117THWQF].

- **Geographic location**: Highly endemic area for Lyme disease [^115Kk5NG].

- **Duration of attachment**: ≥ 36 hours [^115Kk5NG].

- **Timing**: Prophylaxis must be administered within 72 hours of tick removal [^112TcpTo].

If any of these criteria are not met, **prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended** [^115Kk5NG].

---

## Recommended prophylactic regimen

When indicated, the **recommended regimen** is a single dose of doxycycline:

- **Adults**: 200 mg orally once [^116X7ngT].

- **Children**: 4.4 mg/kg orally once, maximum 200 mg [^115YeC2g].

This regimen has been shown to **reduce the risk of Lyme disease by approximately 87%** in clinical trials [^114XKnAR].

---

## Management of tick bites occurring more than 72 hours ago

For tick bites that occurred more than 72 hours ago, **prophylactic antibiotics are not effective** and are not recommended [^115Kk5NG]. Instead, **management focuses on watchful waiting and patient education** [^116nHB9J].

---

## Watchful waiting and patient education

Patients should be **educated to monitor for the following symptoms for up to 30 days** following the tick bite:

- **Erythema migrans (EM) rash**: Expanding, annular rash with central clearing [^113HfHxg].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, headache, and neurologic symptoms such as cranial nerve palsy or meningitis [^116ZGWQX].

If any of these symptoms develop, the patient should **seek medical evaluation promptly** [^116nHB9J].

---

## Diagnostic testing

Routine serologic testing for Lyme disease is **not recommended** for asymptomatic patients following a tick bite [^1122EWB8]. Testing is only indicated if the patient develops compatible clinical symptoms, such as an EM rash or systemic symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease [^111oWmeg].

---

## Treatment if symptoms develop

If the patient develops **erythema migrans or other compatible symptoms**, treat with the following antibiotic regimens:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | Adults: 100 mg orally twice daily; Children: 2.2 mg/kg orally twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose) | 10 days [^1118mHvH] |
| Amoxicillin | Adults: 500 mg orally three times daily; Children: 50 mg/kg/day divided into three doses | 14 days [^1118mHvH] |
| Cefuroxime axetil | Adults: 500 mg orally twice daily; Children: 30 mg/kg/day divided into two doses | 14 days [^1118mHvH] |

---

Doxycycline is preferred due to its **efficacy against Lyme disease** and other tick-borne pathogens [^111szGEq].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Doxycycline is contraindicated. Amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil are preferred alternatives [^115csPij].

- **Allergy**: Patients allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins may require alternative regimens, such as macrolides, though these are less effective [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: Only indicated within 72 hours of tick removal if high-risk criteria are met [^115Kk5NG].

- **Watchful waiting**: Recommended for tick bites occurring more than 72 hours ago, with patient education on symptom monitoring [^115Kk5NG].

- **Diagnostic testing**: Not recommended for asymptomatic patients [^1122EWB8].

- **Treatment**: Initiate antibiotics if erythema migrans or compatible symptoms develop, with doxycycline as the preferred agent [^111szGEq].

---

For a tick bite one week ago, **prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated**. Management consists of watchful waiting, patient education, and prompt treatment if symptoms of Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses develop [^115Kk5NG].

A previously healthy 24-year-old man presented with acute-onset vertigo after a recent tick bite sustained during a hiking trip. The initial illness included fever, malaise, headache, and neck stiffness, all of which resolved without treatment within 1 week. Days later, he developed persistent vertigo accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and imbalance, but without hearing loss or other focal neurologic deficits. Neurologic examination localized the lesion, and imaging confirmed the suspected site of involvement. Additional diagnostic testing identified an unusual abnormality correlating with the clinical findings. The patient was treated appropriately based on the findings, leading to complete resolution of symptoms and full recovery.

Lyme disease high-risk tick bite assessment — identification and surveillance limitations: Accurate identification of a tick species may be challenging, and the determination of the timing of the bite by history is often unreliable; in a highly endemic region, examination of the scutal index of Ixodes spp. ticks attached to patients over 17 years found > 40% did not meet the high-risk criteria, underscoring the need to develop methods to deliver reliable and timely information to clinicians. Infection prevalence and strain diversity of Borrelia burgdorferi among Ixodes scapularis can be locally and regionally variable, contributing to variability in Lyme disease risk following a tick bite, with the expected benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis to be greatest in areas with high disease risk and to diminish with decreasing risk, and longitudinal disease and tick surveillance are needed to monitor how risk is changing over time.

Ixodes tick bite management in the United States — do/do not guidance and prophylaxis criteria state to "Remove tick with clean fine-tipped tweezers (or other comparable device) [I, B] (see Figure 5)" and to "Identify tick [II, A]. Send to a laboratory, refer to an online resource, or see Figure 2". Clinicians should "Determine if tick meets high-risk criteria [III]" including "a) identified as Ixodes vector species", "b) bite occurred in a highly endemic area (see Figure 4 and consult state health data)", and "c) attached for ≥ 36 hours (see Figure 6)". The table advises, "Consider initiating prophylaxis if a, b, and c are met, AND it is within 72 hours of tick removal [II]. See dosing below†", where "Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg for children)". Avoid harms with "Do not use other nonmechanical methods for tick removal", "Do not test tick for pathogens (eg, send for PCR)", and "Do not initiate prophylaxis in any other scenario".

### Acral palpable purpura with rapidly progressing multiorgan involvement [^113WsnAD]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A. Initiate treatment with doxycycline
B. Confirm diagnosis with serologic rickettsial antibody titers
C. Obtain additional skin sample for direct immunofluorescence
D. Contact the local or state health department
E. Order contact precautions to avoid person-to-person transmission

Answers:

A. Initiate treatment with doxycycline – Correct. After an incubation period of 2–14 days, symptoms of headache, fever, myalgias, and arthralgias occur. Cutaneous involvement typically develops 3–5 days later. Because antibodies are not detectable until 7 to 10 days after disease onset, patients with suspected RMSF should receive empiric doxycycline, since treatment delayed after day 5 is associated with an increased mortality rate.
B. Confirm diagnosis with serologic rickettsial antibody titers – Incorrect. Diagnosis can be confirmed by a four-fold rise in serum IgG antibodies drawn 2–4 weeks apart, but empiric therapy should be started immediately in patients with suspected RSMF. Rickettsia rickettsii IgG returned elevated at 1:128 5 days after hospitalization and 1:256 2 weeks later. The patient had no previous baseline serologic rickettsial antibody. Therefore, the elevated titers were not diagnostic, but strongly supportive of RMSF in conjunction with the patient's history and clinical findings.
C. Obtain additional skin sample for direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Direct immunofluorescence staining via skin biopsy may be supportive diagnostically, but appropriate treatment should be initiated first. Of note, sensitivity of direct immunofluorescence declines after doxycycline therapy is initiated.
D. Contact the local or state health department – Incorrect. All cases of RMSF should be reported to state or local health department according to local laws, but reporting should take place after appropriate therapy is initiated.
E. Order contact precautions to avoid person-to-person transmission – Incorrect. RMSF is transmitted via tick bite. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.

Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. Evidence summarized from four placebo-controlled trials in endemic areas found that among 1082 randomized subjects the placebo-group risk was 3.0% and that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced risk versus placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75)); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000). No serious adverse effects were reported, though drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The guideline notes insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics and calls for additional research to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin or other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for prophylaxis.

### Tick-borne diseases of the United States: ten things clinicians should know [^115r7RfV]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

This article highlights critical aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of tick-borne infections in children. Principles that apply broadly across the continental United States are emphasized, rather than details of each disease. Tick-borne infections are often confused with other, more common childhood illnesses, in part because of their nonspecific initial clinical findings and because patients are usually unaware of their preceding tick exposures. This is a problem, because delays in starting appropriate antibiotic therapy increase the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these infections, especially Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). For patients in whom RMSF is a reasonable diagnostic consideration, therapy should be started presumptively, without awaiting the results of confirmatory diagnostic tests. For both adults and children, doxycycline is the drug of choice for RMSF and other American rickettsial infections. Concerns over the potential toxicity of doxycycline in young children are unfounded. Similarly groundless is the belief in "chronic Lyme disease" as an explanation for persistent nonspecific complaints after completing antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Prevention of tick-borne infections rests on avoidance of tick-bites and prompt removal of attached ticks. When used appropriately, insect repellents containing DEET are safe and effective for preventing tick exposures.

Lyme disease — cause, transmission, geography, and manifestations are summarized as follows: Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by spirochetes in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted to humans by the bite of certain species of Ixodes ticks. It is the most common vector-borne infectious disease of humans in the temperate northern hemisphere, affecting hundreds of thousands of people annually in North America and Eurasia, and in North America is found predominantly in 3 regions (the northeastern states from Virginia to eastern Canada; the upper Midwest; and northern California). Clinical disease can manifest as early as days and as late as many months following a tick bite, with presentations that include a skin lesion at the tick bite site and disseminated disease with skin lesions distant from the bite, neuropathy, meningitis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and/or arthritis; interpretation of diagnostic tests can be challenging due to serologic dynamics, and treatment options, including drug, route, and duration, may differ for different disease manifestations.

### EAN consensus review on prevention, diagnosis and management of tick-borne encephalitis [^116cAjeF]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infection of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and transmitted by ticks, with a variety of clinical manifestations. The incidence of TBE in Europe is increasing due to an extended season of the infection and the enlargement of endemic areas. Our objectives are to provide recommendations on the prevention, diagnosis and management of TBE, based on evidence or consensus decisions.

Methods

For systematic evaluation, the literature was searched from 1970 to 2015 (including early online publications of 2016), and recommendations were based on evidence or consensus decisions of the Task Force when evidence-based data were not available.

Recommendations

Vaccination against TBE is recommended for all age groups above 1 year in highly endemic areas (≥ 5 cases/100 000/year), but also for individuals at risk in areas with a lower incidence. Travellers to endemic areas should be vaccinated if their visits will include extensive outdoor activities. Post-exposure prophylaxis after a tick bite is not recommended. A case of TBE is defined by the presence of clinical signs of meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (> 5 × 10 6 cells/l) and the presence of specific TBEV serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies, CSF IgM antibodies or TBEV IgG seroconversion. TBEV-specific polymerase chain reaction in blood is diagnostic in the first viremic phase but it is not sensitive in the second phase of TBE with clinical manifestations of CNS inflammation. Lumbar puncture should be performed in all patients with suspected CNS infection unless there are contraindications. Imaging of the brain and spinal cord has a low sensitivity and a low specificity, but it is useful for differential diagnosis. No effective antiviral or immunomodulating therapy is available for TBE; therefore the treatment is symptomatic. Patients with a potentially life threatening meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis should be admitted to an intensive care unit. In the case of brain oedema, analgosedation should be deepened; osmotherapy and corticosteroids are not routinely recommended. If intracranial pressure is increased, therapeutic hypothermia or decompressive craniectomy might be considered. Seizures should be treated as any other symptomatic epileptic seizures.

Conclusions

Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral CNS infection that may result in long-term neurological sequelae. Since its incidence in Europe is increasing due to broadening of endemic areas and prolongation of the tick activity season, the health burden of TBE is enlarging. There is no effective antiviral treatment for TBE, but the disease may be effectively prevented by vaccination.

Diagnostic tick testing after an Ixodes bite — test the tick's species but do not test the tick for Borrelia burgdorferi. We recommend submitting the removed tick for species identification (good practice statement), and we recommend against testing a removed Ixodes tick for B. burgdorferi (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence); the presence or absence of B. burgdorferi in an Ixodes tick removed from a person does not reliably predict the likelihood of clinical infection. Detecting B. burgdorferi sensu lato in Ixodes spp. ticks poorly predicts subsequent disease (0–12.4%) or asymptomatic seroconversion (0–4.7%), and most Ixodes spp. ticks discovered by patients have been attached for < 48 hours. Even in highly endemic areas where > 20% of nymphal ticks and > 50% of adult ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi, mathematical models estimate a low probability of Lyme disease after an Ixodes spp. tick bite (2.5–4.6%), particularly if the tick has not been attached for > 72 hours.

Timing of tick removal and risk of Lyme transmission — Prophylactic strategies for Lyme disease have been modeled on the risk of infection after a tick bite relative to the length of time the tick is attached to its host. Generally, the risk of Lyme disease transmission is correlated with the duration of tick attachment. Although the risk of transmission of B burgdorferi after a tick bite in Lyme endemic regions is estimated to be 1 to 3%, the risk increases to 20% when infected I scapularis ticks are attached longer than 72 h. Early animal studies of I scapularis ticks infected with B burgdorferi suggested that at least 48 h of attachment were necessary for transmission of disease. However, a recent review highlighted that Lyme transmission is possible within 24 h of attachment and that a definitive study describing a minimum tick attachment time for the transmission of Lyme in humans has not been published. Until these data are available, the CDC recommends tick removal within 36 h of attachment to reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Recommendation. Once discovered, ticks should be removed as soon as possible. To meaningfully reduce the risk of Lyme disease, ticks should be removed within 36 h of attachment. Recommendation grade: 1B.

Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a bacterial infection caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and transmitted by the bite of the black-legged (deer tick) in North America. Its incidence is increasing. HGA can be transmitted after 24 to 48 hours of tick attachment. The incubation period is 5 to 14 days after a tick bite. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Complications include shock, organ dysfunction, and death. Mortality is less than 1% with appropriate treatment. Doxycycline is first line treatment for all ages. Start it empirically if symptoms and risk factors suggest HGA. PCR is the confirmatory test of choice.

### A single dose of doxycycline after an ixodes ricinus tick bite to prevent Lyme borreliosis: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^115Y6bR6]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis in North America, but extrapolation to Europe is hampered by differences in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and tick species. We assessed the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite in Europe.

Methods

We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 h after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment. Potential participants ≥ 8 years of age who reported a recent tick bite online were invited for the study. After informed consent, they were randomly assigned to either the prophylaxis or the no-treatment group. Participants in the prophylaxis group were asked to visit their general practitioner to administer the antibiotics. All participants were followed up by online questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the development of physician-confirmed Lyme borreliosis in a modified-intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3953) and is closed.

Results

Between April 11, 2013, and June 10, 2015, 3538 potential participants were randomized, of whom 1689 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat analysis. 10 cases of Lyme borreliosis were reported out of 1041 participants (0.96%) in the prophylaxis group, and 19 cases out of 648 no-treatment participants (2.9%), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31–84%), and a number-needed-to-treat of 51 (95% CI 29–180). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

This primary care-based trial provides evidence that a single dose of doxycycline can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes ricinus tick bite.

### Tick bites and skin rashes [^114uC3Zx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fever and a rash following a tick bite can signify a true medical emergency. Ticks are important vectors of disease worldwide, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever. This paper will review the major ticks of medical importance and the diseases they transmit, including important emerging pathogens.

Recent Findings

Rocky Mountain spotted fever continues to be the most lethal tick-borne illness in the United States and is emerging as an important disease in South America. Other important emerging diseases include human anaplasmosis, southern tick associated rash illness, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, and a variety of rickettsial fevers including those caused by Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia amblyommii.

Summary

Most tick-borne illnesses respond readily to doxycycline therapy. In the case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, therapy should be started when the disease is suspected and should never be delayed for confirmatory tests. Accurate identification of tick vectors can help establish a diagnosis and can help guide preventive measures to reduce the burden of disease.

### Identifying the vector of Lyme disease [^115csPij]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the deer tick. Deer ticks have a four-stage life cycle (egg, larva, nymph, and adult), and nymphal ticks transmit B. burgdorferi to humans more frequently than adult ticks. Transmission of this spirochete typically requires a minimum of 24 to 48 hours of tick attachment. Early stages of Lyme disease are characterized by a hallmark rash, erythema migrans. The overall risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low in a person who has a deer tick bite. If erythema migrans develops at the site of the bite, treatment may include doxycycline in persons who are at least eight years of age. Administration of amoxicillin is appropriate for pregnant women or children younger than eight years. For those who are allergic to these medications, cefuroxime axetil may be used.

"The risk of infection from tick-borne illness increases with the time of tick attachment". "Although the risk of contracting a tick-borne illness appears to be more substantial if the tick is attached for > 24 to 48 hours, the tick should be removed as soon as possible to minimize the risk of infection". "The risk of damaging tick mouthparts appears to be lower when health care professionals remove ticks with tweezers compared with laypeople removing ticks by hand". "Other methods of removal, including application of gasoline, nail polish, methylated spirits, petroleum jelly, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or a hot kitchen match, appear to be less effective". "Mechanical removal is accepted by most experts". "Although squeezing the abdomen of the tick on removal has not been definitively linked to transmission of disease, some evidence links squeezing the abdomen of the tick on removal to anaphylaxis resulting from tick bites". "As with any injury, hand washing and wound cleansing should follow tick removal".

### Early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) and its mimics (Southern tick-associated rash illness and tick-associated rash illness) [^112uVCNS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Erythema migrans, an expanding erythematous skin lesion that develops days to weeks following an Ixodes species tick bite, is the most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease. Presentations in the United States differ somewhat from that in Europe, presumably because of the different etiologic agents. Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the skin lesion, rather than on laboratory testing. After treatment with an appropriate oral antibiotic for 10 to 14 days, the prognosis is excellent. Two conditions that cause a similar skin lesion following a tick bite, but are of unknown cause, are Southern tick-associated rash illness in the United States and tick-associated rash illness in Japan.

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^111YpsHZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

First responders and health care providers who followed standard precautions (e.g. personal protective equipment [PPE]) while caring for patients with tularemia need not take PEP. Antimicrobial PEP or fever monitoring might be considered for first responders and health care providers who had breaches in PPE and substantial exposure while caring for patients with tularemia (e.g. direct contact with a patient's ulcer without wearing gloves or performing intubation without wearing a surgical mask).

Response teams conducting environmental evaluations or other activities in an area of an intentional release of F. tularensis should use PPE recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce risk for infection from environmental contamination. If appropriate EPA-recommended PPE is not available and workers cannot avoid being in the area, antibiotic PrEP or PEP or fever monitoring after exposure may be considered.

Members of the general public are at risk for naturally acquired tularemia after tick or deer fly bites, lawn mowing, animal skinning, or other exposures. However, the overall risk after natural exposures is minimal because of the relatively low incidence of naturally acquired tularemia (0.064 per 100,000 population). PEP is not typically recommended after a potential natural exposure, although PEP can be considered for hunters, pet owners, or other persons who had direct contact with an animal known to be infected.

Additional details on selection of specific antimicrobials for PEP, including the GRADE EtD framework underlying recommendations, are available. Although evidence for fluoroquinolone use for PEP is particularly scant, fluoroquinolones are expected to be effective based on extrapolation from treatment data. In addition, evidence to inform optimal duration of PEP is limited.

### Management of tick bites and early Lyme disease: a survey of Connecticut physicians [^116TRmuF]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines have been published for the treatment of Lyme disease (LD). These guidelines have been challenged as inadequate. Two common LD management problems are antibiotic prophylaxis of deer tick bites (deer ticks may carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes LD) and antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, the pathognomonic rash of LD. A 1-page questionnaire was sent to a 13% (573/4300) sample of Connecticut physicians to define how they treat deer tick bites and erythema migrans. Questionnaires were returned by 320 (56%) of 573 physicians. Questionnaires were analyzed for the 267 physicians who saw patients with LD. Seventy (26%) of the 267 surveyed physicians prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with tick bites. B burgdorferi serology was ordered by 31% of physicians for patients with tick bites. Most surveyed physicians treated erythema migrans with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a mean of 21 days. Serology was ordered by 49% of physicians for patients with erythema migrans. Most physicians did not use prophylaxis for patients with deer tick bites. In addition, most of the physicians surveyed followed established guidelines for treating patients with erythema migrans. However, many of the physicians surveyed do serologic testing for patients with tick bites and/or erythema migrans. Serologic testing for these patients is usually not necessary.

### Diagnosis and management of Lyme disease [^114ngnnq]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. Transmission occurs primarily through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Identification of an erythema migrans rash following a tick bite is the only clinical manifestation sufficient to make the diagnosis of Lyme disease in the absence of laboratory confirmation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a two-tier serologic testing protocol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay initially, followed by the more specific Western blot to confirm the diagnosis when the assay samples are positive or equivocal. The treatment of Lyme disease is determined mainly by the clinical manifestations of the disease. Doxycycline is often the preferred agent for oral treatment because of its activity against other tick-borne illnesses. Preventive measures include avoiding areas with high tick burdens, wearing protective clothing, using tick repellants (e.g., diethyltoluamide [DEET]), performing frequent body checks and bathing following outdoor activities, and instituting environmental landscape modifications (e.g., grass mowing, deer exclusion fencing) to reduce the tick burden. Although there is controversy regarding treatment of post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease, there is no biologic or clinical trial evidence indicating that prolonged antibiotic therapy is of benefit.

### Tick removal [^113Evj3w]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Many methods of tick removal that have been reported in the literature have proved to be unsatisfactory in controlled studies. Some methods may even cause harm by inducing the tick to salivate and regurgitate into the host. Ticks are best removed as soon as possible, because the risk of disease transmission increases significantly after 24 hours of attachment. The use of a blunt, medium-tipped, angled forceps offers the best results. Following tick removal, the bite area should be inspected carefully for any retained mouthparts, which should be excised. The area is then cleaned with antiseptic solution, and the patient is instructed to monitor for signs of local or systemic illness. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis following tick removal generally is not indicated but may be considered in pregnant patients or in areas endemic to tick-borne disease.

Ticks as vectors and geographic distribution — pathogen–vector–host interactions and life stages — note that transmission of TBIs to humans requires an interaction between pathogen, vector, and host; each tick species can serve as a vector for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and may seek different hosts for blood meals in each of their 3 life stages; disease transmission can occur via feeding or co-feeding on the same host, and the geographic distribution of TBIs closely reflects the distribution of the tick vectors that transmit disease.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of tick-borne illness (TBI). Recommendations are graded based on quality of supporting evidence according to criteria put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians. The guidelines include a brief review of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, prevention, and management of TBI in the United States, with a primary focus on interventions that are appropriate for resource-limited settings. Strong recommendations are provided for the use of DEET, picaridin, and permethrin; tick checks; washing and drying clothing at high temperatures; mechanical tick removal within 36 h of attachment; single-dose doxycycline for high-risk Lyme disease exposures versus "watchful waiting"; evacuation from backcountry settings for symptomatic tick exposures; and TBI education programs. Weak recommendations are provided for the use of light-colored clothing; insect repellents other than DEET, picaridin, and permethrin; and showering after exposure to tick habitat. Weak recommendations are also provided against passive methods of tick removal, including the use of systemic and local treatments. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of long-sleeved clothing and the avoidance of tick habitat such as long grasses and leaf litter. Although there was sound evidence supporting Lyme disease vaccination, a grade was not offered as the vaccine is not currently available for use in the United States.

Removal of attached ticks — summary of the evidence: Duration of tick attachment is among the most important predictors of subsequent Lyme disease, and experimental studies in animal hosts have established a time delay between the onset of tick feeding and transmission of B. burgdorferi that occurs after 36–48 hours of attachment; thus, performing tick checks after exposure and promptly removing any attached Ixodes spp. ticks is a potentially effective means to prevent Lyme disease, and proper removal requires grasping and pulling the mouthparts at the closest point of attachment to the skin. In animal laboratory experiments, the probability of Borrelia burgdorferi transmission increases the longer the tick has been attached and feeding, and nonmechanical means of tick removal, such as applying chemicals, petroleum products, or heat may cause the tick to regurgitate and potentially increase the risk of pathogen transmission. A mathematical model further estimated that infection did not occur before 36–40 hours of attachment, and that 50% of infected nymphs transmitted B. burgdorferi by 68 hours of attachment; transmission of B. mayonii to laboratory animals using single infected nymphs occurred after 48 hours of attachment, while early studies had documented rare transmission of B. burgdorferi < 24 hours and within 24–37 hours of tick attachment.

### Prophylaxis with single-dose doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease after an ixodes scapularis tick bite [^114XKnAR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite will prevent Lyme disease.

Methods

In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At base line, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi. Entomologists confirmed the species of the ticks and classified them according to sex, stage, and degree of engorgement.

Results

Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than of those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P < 0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions. Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P < 0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks (8 of 142 bites [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 bites [0 percent], P = 0.02) and particularly after bites from nymphal ticks that were at least partially engorged with blood (8 of 81 bites [9.9 percent], as compared with 0 of 59 bites from unfed, or flat, nymphal ticks [0 percent]; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

A single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours after an I. scapularis tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme disease.

STARI — epidemiology and etiologic evidence indicates that STARI has been reported predominantly in the southeastern and south-central United States, where the lone star tick is the most abundant human-biting tick, and that lone star ticks are not able to transmit B. burgdorferi. To date, no infectious agent has been identified in STARI patients, except in 1 instance where B. lonestari was detected by PCR in a skin lesion and in the lone star tick that had bitten the patient. Recent data suggest that STARI and Lyme disease–associated erythema migrans produce different host metabolic biosignatures, there are no known extracutaneous sequelae associated with STARI, and it remains unknown whether antibiotic treatment affords clinical benefit or which antibiotics would be useful.

### Tick-borne disease [^113HfHxg]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne diseases in the United States include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, and relapsing fever. It is important for family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. A petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Various other rashes or skin lesions accompanied by fever and influenza-like illness also may signal the presence of a tick-borne disease. Early, accurate diagnosis allows treatment that may help prevent significant morbidity and possible mortality. Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases.

Lyme disease is now the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States. The highest incidence is in children aged 5 to 9 years with a male predominance. The most common manifestation, erythema migrans, is sometimes not recognized, leading to risk of complications. Testing for Lyme disease should only be done if there is a consistent clinical syndrome with exposure in a Lyme-endemic area. Most forms of Lyme disease are successfully treated with short courses of oral therapy. Prevention and management of tick bites is important.

Babesiosis presents with a broad spectrum of manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening disease. An estimated 50% of infected children and 25% of adults are asymptomatic. When present, clinical manifestations occur 1–4 weeks after a tick bite or 1–9 weeks after a contaminated blood transfusion and include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Hepatosplenomegaly, as well as jaundice and dark urine due to erythrocyte lysis, may also be noted. Typical laboratory test abnormalities include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of liver enzymes. Manifestations of severe diseases include disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure, acute respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, and death. Risk factors for severe diseases include immune compromise and asplenia. Like anaplasmosis, babesiosis may co-exist with LD and potentially result in increased disease severity. Treatment decisions should consider multiple factors, such as patient age, immune status, splenic function, and pregnancy status. In immunocompetent adults, the preferred drug regimen is azithromycin and atovaquone, with an alternate regimen of clindamycin and quinine (39G). Immunocompromised and asplenic patients may require higher and prolonged doses.

### Topical azithromycin for the prevention of Lyme borreliosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 efficacy trial [^114n2pyF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Lyme borreliosis develops in 1–5% of individuals bitten by ticks, but with a diagnostic gap affecting up to 30% of patients, a broadly applicable pharmacological prevention strategy is needed. Topical azithromycin effectively eradicated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato from the skin in preclinical studies. We assessed its efficacy in human beings.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial done in 28 study sites in Germany and Austria, adults were equally assigned to receive topical 10% azithromycin or placebo twice daily for 3 consecutive days, within 72 h of a tick bite being confirmed. Randomisation numbers, which were stratified by study site, were accessed in study centres via an interactive voice-response system, by pharmacists not involved in the study. The primary outcome was the number of treatment failures, defined as erythema migrans, seroconversion, or both, in participants who were seronegative at baseline, had no further tick bites during the study, and had serology results available at 8 weeks (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2011–000117–39.

Findings

Between July 7, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 1371 participants were randomly assigned to treatment, of whom 995 were included in the ITT population. The trial was stopped early because an improvement in the primary endpoint in the group receiving azithromycin was not reached. At 8 weeks, 11 (2%) of 505 in the azithromycin group and 11 (2%) of 490 in the placebo group had treatment failure (odds ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.42–2.26, p = 0.47). Topical azithromycin was well tolerated. Similar numbers of patients had adverse events in the two groups (175 [26%] of 505 vs 177 [26%] of 490, p = 0.87), and most adverse events were mild.

Interpretation

Topical azithromycin was well tolerated and had a good safety profile. Inclusion of asymptomatic seroconversion into the primary efficacy analysis led to no prevention effect with topical azithromycin. Adequately powered studies assessing only erythema migrans should be considered. A subgroup analysis in this study suggested that topical azithromycin reduces erythema migrans after bites of infected ticks.

Lyme disease — risk stratification and rationale for prophylaxis emphasize epidemiology and attachment duration: in endemic regions "nymphal I. scapularis infection prevalence exceeds 20%", whereas I. pacificus infection prevalence "often is < 20%", though some areas have " > 20%" prevalence. Transmission risk rises with attachment time, with "the majority of transmission" occurring after "36–48 hours", a "positive association between duration of tick attachment (over vs under 72 hours)" and outcomes, and risk that "may exceed 20%" when attached for " ≥ 72 hours". A meta-analysis showed that giving prophylactic antibiotics "within 72 hours" reduced subsequent Lyme disease "from 2.2% to 0.2%". Lower-risk exposures include " < 36 hours" attachment or low-incidence regions, where absolute risk and benefit of prophylaxis decrease. Counseling remains important: "clinicians should counsel patients" and "prophylaxis with doxycycline does not guarantee infection avoidance", and "we advise pregnant women to have an informed discussion" about antibiotics versus observation.

Neurologic evaluation and Lyme disease — Screening neurologic patients with a low a priori likelihood of Lyme disease — that is, without a history of tick bite, erythema migrans, or other more typical manifestations, would result in far more false positive than true positive results. For suspected Lyme meningitis, likelihood increases with facial nerve palsy, symptoms of longer duration (> 7 days), and mononuclear cell predominant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Lyme disease can very rarely cause focal inflammation in the brain or spinal cord, and testing may be informative in this setting; however, MRI findings of nonspecific T2 white matter hyperintensities are not generally useful to diagnose Lyme neuroborreliosis, and misattribution of these to Lyme disease could lead to overuse of antibiotics with underemphasis on treatable vascular risk factors.

### Infections with tickborne pathogens after tick bite, Austria, 2015–2018 [^116nuNk9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants were enrolled prospectively during 2015–2018 at 2 centers in Austria (Vienna and Thiersee). The invitation to participate was announced in the local media. The analysis focused on infections with tickborne pathogens including B. burgdorferi s.l. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp. Babesia spp. Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, and relapsing fever borreliae. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (1064/2015) and of the Medical University of Innsbruck (AN2016–0043–359/4.16). Participants provided written informed consent.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 18 years and the availability of the particular tick for testing. Persons bitten > 7 days before assessment were excluded.

Questionnaire

A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information concerning tick bite location, history of erythema migrans, antimicrobial drug treatment within 4 weeks before the tick bite, estimated duration of tick attachment, number of ticks removed, and possible geographic region of tick attack. The feeding duration of the tick was reported in days by the difference of the estimated date of the tick bite and the date of tick removal.

Outcome Definition

Serologic testing and PCR for blood were conducted during the first week after the removal of the tick, with a follow-up scheduled 6 weeks thereafter. We defined infection as > 1 of the following: occurrence of erythema migrans diagnosed by a medical professional (M.M. or D.H.), increase in Borrelia -specific antibodies in follow-up samples, and presence of the microorganism determined by PCR in the initial or follow-up blood samples.
