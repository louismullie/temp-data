## Question

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Answer Choices:
A. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
B. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
C. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
D. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which party will likely prevail on whether the woman was bound to pay for 6 months of recurring charges under the website's terms and conditions, and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal framework for online contract formation and what constitutes valid notice. Then, I should verify whether the notice here was sufficiently conspicuous and whether the terms were reasonably accessible. Next, I will examine whether the recurring billing term needed to be disclosed on the account-creation page itself. After that, I should consider whether the contract is a contract of adhesion and how that affects enforceability. Finally, I will weigh the competing answer choices and choose the best-supported conclusion with reasoning grounded in the provided sources.

> Let me first confirm the legal framework. Online agreements, including clickwrap and browsewrap, are generally enforceable when users have reasonable notice of terms and a meaningful opportunity to review them, with enforceability varying by jurisdiction and the clarity of notice and access provided, so I need to check whether those elements are present here [^dfd40b3a].

> Wait, let me verify the notice quality. The prompt states the notice appeared in bold letters stating "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions", and that a conspicuous link allowed access to the full terms. That looks like reasonably conspicuous notice and ready accessibility, which courts often find sufficient to bind users who proceed after such notice, so the company has a strong argument that the user manifested assent by creating the account with that knowledge [^dfd40b3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about whether the recurring billing term had to be spelled out on the account-creation page. I initially thought that important terms like automatic renewal must be described on the signup page itself, but wait, I should double-check that. The provided sources emphasize conspicuous notice and accessible terms rather than a requirement to reproduce specific clauses on the registration page, so I should correct that assumption and conclude that the bold notice plus a conspicuous link to the full terms is generally sufficient notice for the recurring charge term to be enforceable [^dfd40b3a].

> I need to check whether this is a contract of adhesion and what that means. Yes, this is a standard-form, take-it-or-leave-it contract, but that alone does not make it unenforceable; adhesion contracts are enforceable unless the challenged term is unconscionable, hidden, or otherwise improper, and here the existence of a contract and the recurring billing term were disclosed, even if the user did not read them, so the adhesion label does not automatically defeat enforceability in this scenario [^notfound].

> Let me consider the competing options carefully. Option A overstates the law by claiming terms of adhesion are largely unenforceable, which is too broad and not supported by the sources. Option C asserts that important terms must be described on the create-account page, which, as I just corrected, is not a universal requirement in the materials provided. Option D is too vague and overgeneralized. Option B aligns with the principle that conspicuous notice plus accessible terms provides valid assent, making the company the likely prevailing party here [^dfd40b3a].

> But wait, what if the user argues she never actually saw or understood the recurring charge term? I should confirm that under the objective manifestation standard, what matters is whether a reasonable person would have notice and opportunity to review, not whether the individual actually read the terms; since the notice was bold and the link was conspicuous, that objective standard is satisfied, so her failure to click and read does not negate assent [^dfd40b3a].

> Final answer: B. The company will likely prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible, which provides reasonable notice and an opportunity to review the terms, including the recurring billing authorization, making the term enforceable against her [^dfd40b3a].

---

The company will likely prevail because the **bold notice** and **conspicuous link** provided reasonable notice of the terms, and courts generally enforce clickwrap agreements when users have a clear opportunity to review terms before accepting [^dfd40b3a]. The woman's failure to read the terms does not negate consent, and the recurring billing clause is not inherently unconscionable or hidden. Options A and C overstate the law, and D is too broad; **B best reflects the enforceability of conspicuous clickwrap terms** [^dfd40b3a].

---

## Legal framework for online contracts

Online contracts are generally enforceable when users have **reasonable notice** of the terms and a meaningful opportunity to review them [^dfd40b3a]. Clickwrap agreements — where users click "I agree" or proceed after notice — are routinely upheld if the notice is conspicuous and the terms are accessible [^dfd40b3a].

---

## Analysis of the specific case

### Notice and accessibility of terms

The bold "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract" notice and the conspicuous link provided **reasonable notice** and ready access to the full terms [^dfd40b3a]. Courts have enforced clickwrap agreements with similar notice, even when users did not read the terms [^dfd40b3a].

---

### User's conduct and manifestation of assent

By creating an account and paying the initial fee after the bold notice, the woman **manifested assent** to the terms, including the recurring billing clause [^dfd40b3a]. Failure to read the terms does not negate consent in clickwrap contexts [^dfd40b3a].

---

### Enforceability of the recurring billing clause

The recurring billing clause is not inherently unconscionable or hidden; it is a **common subscription term** disclosed in the accessible terms. Courts enforce such clauses when notice and assent are present [^dfd40b3a].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Analysis** | **Conclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| A. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable. | Overstates the law; adhesion contracts are enforceable unless unconscionable or procedurally unfair. Here, notice was conspicuous and access was provided [^dfd40b3a]. | Incorrect |
| B. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible. | Aligns with the law: conspicuous notice plus accessible terms supports enforceability [^dfd40b3a]. | Correct |
| C. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here. | No general requirement to reproduce terms on the signup page; conspicuous notice plus a link is sufficient [^dfd40b3a]. | Incorrect |
| D. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms. | Too broad; notice must be conspicuous and terms accessible, which was the case here [^dfd40b3a]. | Incorrect |

---

## Conclusion

The company will likely prevail because the **bold notice** and **conspicuous link** provided reasonable notice, and the woman's conduct manifested assent to the terms, including the recurring billing clause [^dfd40b3a].

### Registered access: a' triple-A' approach [^dfd40b3a]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Registered access attestation

Registered access would not involve the execution of a Data Transfer or Access Agreement (DAA) between data providers and data users as required in controlled access. In a context where most of the interactions in the data sharing environment are taking place online, the concept of registered access could provide an appropriate ground for the use of online agreements, setting the terms of use for data users who wish to access registered data. Until now, paper-based applications, meetings of DACs and DAAs have been the primary basis governing contractual relations between the data providers, users and their institutions. This can be an administratively heavy step for both the data user and institutions.

Clickwrap-type online agreements, for example, in the form of web-based agreements requiring the end-user to manifest consent by clicking an ‘I agree' checkbox option at the end of a contract, are generally well documented and used for a variety of online transactions such as purchasing flights online. Although they constitute a legally binding agreement in many jurisdictions, with specific laws applicable to online contracts, their validity and enforceability may however vary from one jurisdiction to another and clickwrap agreements may not be enforceable in all countries. There are instances where these have been used to set conditions and terms of use for access to open access genomic databases.For example, at the outset, the HapMap database used an open source data access policy in a clickwrap format. Essentially, the HapMap project used a clickwrap licence agreement until all of the data was placed in the public domain, at which point the agreement was abandoned as a requirement for access. While not yet the standard medium for DAAs, these types of online agreements could arguably allow for a more balanced approach to access agreements by creating rapid, open and efficient access to data. They may also help in providing users with clear and upfront instructions on the use of the data. Standard registered access Attestation statements are listed in Table 2 (see 1c–3c) as an example of conditions that would form the core of a registered access agreement. This simple form of agreement would be strengthened by more detailed terms and conditions available on the website that registers the user's attestation.

### A new way forward for women's health research at the National Institutes of Health: a roadmap from the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine's consensus report [^1e2d6c3f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite efforts to address inequities, research on women's health conditions (defined as those that uniquely or differently affect women and female individuals) remain significantly understudied. As directed by Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health requested the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) to conduct an assessment of the state of women's health research at the NIH. The findings of the National Academies committee include: 1) a significant funding inequity, with less than 8% of the total NIH grant budget for fiscal year 2023 allocated to women's health research; 2) a need for improved strategic NIH-wide priority setting, oversight, and adherence to existing policies to support women's health research; 3) a need for a specific institute for research on conditions specific to women's health; and 4) a need for sufficient training and additional funding to grow and retain the women's health research workforce. The National Academies committee recommends restructuring women's health research at the NIH by creating a new Women's Health Research Institute and cross-disciplinary Women's Health Research Fund, including greater accountability and an infusion of new funds to support both research and career development in women's health. The combination of the new institute, greater prioritization and accountability, and new funding would lead to more rapid innovations and advancements, with the ultimate goal of improving women's health and well-being, which, in turn, improves the well-being of families and communities and bolsters a vibrant, healthier society.

### Registered access: authorizing data access [^108376c0]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Another current example of a registration-based data access policy is the DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER). Users who have been approved by the project coordinator (a senior physician working at the center depositing the data) are granted registered access to that project data. DECIPHER projects can be linked to form a consortium, allowing intra-consortium sharing. PhenomeCentral is another example of a registered access policy for the identification of additional cases for ultra-rare disorders. Along with DECIPHER, PhenomeCentral is part of the GA4GH Matchmaker Exchange (MME) initiative. PhenomeCentral users are required to be bona fide researchers or clinicians. This is validated through institutional email addresses, as well as through user-provided and publicly available information such as prior publications, scientific activity at conferences identified through web searches, and mention on institutional websites. Users without a scientific track record (e.g. trainees) can be validated by a more senior colleague. Data entered into PhenomeCentral can then be shared either with chosen researchers or with pre-defined groups (consortia) who have leads responsible for approving membership.

In addition to these intra-consortia, coordinator-approved registration policies, several other current projects are providing, or plan to provide, registration-based access to the research community beyond their projects (see Box 1). These resources either grant an account following a review of an applicant’s credentials (based on submitted or public information) or following a simple registration of their identity. All involve online agreement to data use terms and conditions. CAGI, the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation, active since 2010, has several tiers of access according to the sensitivity of datasets, which are available to registered users ranging from unaffiliated researchers to trainees entering the field and individuals at companies to well-identified accomplished researchers. Vouching (e.g. of a mentor for a student) can also allow appropriate escalation of access.

### Co-creating the patient partner guide by a multiple chronic conditions team of patients, clinicians, and researchers: observational report [^7432a13b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

PPG Use and Feedback

The active arm of the IBH-PC study for which the PPG was developed included 20 diverse primary care clinics across the USA described in detail elsewhere.Of the 20 clinics, 13 elected to download the PPG during the project period and nine created a plan to engage patients in QI. As guided by the PPG, six clinics engaged patient partners on their QI teams and three modified this direct engagement approach by collecting patient input via surveys. Of the six, two teams began their patient engagement at the start of their QI project, one in the middle of the project, and the remaining three engaged patients toward the end of their projects, as they tested new workflows in their clinics (Fig. 2).

Figure 2 
Use of the patient partner guide by clinic QI teams.

Feedback from QI team members highlighted that inclusion of a patient partner on a QI team was simultaneously novel, beneficial, and initially daunting. Clinics noted that finding a patient partner with MCC required discussion among many clinic members, some of whom resisted the idea or expressed doubts about whether a patient would commit to regular meeting attendance. Although some teams worked diligently to recruit two patient partners, per the PPG, all six clinics engaged a single patient on a long-term basis. Typically, the patient who joined the team was someone well known to the clinic, who had previously volunteered, or who served as an advisor to the clinic or health system.

QI team members commented on the length of the PPG, technical challenges in downloading from a private website, and the positive value of the materials. Templates, for example, provided useful starting points for contracts with patients joining a QI team. In all six sites, patients operated as full participants in the QI teams. They attended regular meetings and, in four clinics, were paid for their efforts. They shared their own and family members’ experiences as patients at the clinic, asked clarifying questions, and expressed opinions about decisions the teams faced. Across all six clinics, QI patient partner input and feedback were valued, with one team reporting: “We changed our plan because of our Patient Partner.”

### Women's views on accepting COVID-19 vaccination during and after pregnancy, and for their babies: a multi-methods study in the UK [^b9c577c4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

A multi-methods approach was taken – using quantitative and qualitative components – with the aim of gaining insight into the acceptability of future COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women and their children. The data presented here is part of a larger survey aimed at investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access, awareness, and acceptance of routine maternal vaccines. The study comprised of a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews, to both quantify different views on accepting COVID-19 vaccines and then to also explore views in more depth.

Survey recruitment

Eligible participants were required to have been pregnant at some point between the start of the UK 2020 lockdown (from 23rd March 2020) and the time of survey completion, to be resident in the UK, and to be aged 16 years or over. The survey was live from 3rd August – 11th October 2020. The online survey was prefaced by an information page explaining the study, and how the data was to be used. Participants were informed that by taking part in the survey, they agreed for their responses to be used for research purposes. Participants were required to confirm (by tick-box) at the start of the survey that they met the eligibility criteria and that they consented to participate.

The survey was advertised and promoted using Facebook with a Facebook landing page and paid advertising using Facebook’s ad manager which cross posts to Instagram. The three adverts had a combined reach of 46,146, 1573 post engagements and 1394 link clicks. Related organisations on Facebook were also contacted individually by study researchers, including pregnancy yoga and birth preparation classes, breastfeeding support groups and toddler groups. The survey was shared and distributed via the research team’s personal twitter accounts including linking to other researchers and organisations with maternal and vaccine uptake interests. Finally, the survey was also promoted via some Maternity Voices Partnerships who were e-mailed and invited to share the survey, and via a post on the website Mumsnet.

### Guidance on the use of social media in reproductive medicine practice [^ed34ab56]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Personal versus professional accounts for providers—the use of separate personal and professional accounts should be considered. Posted “personal” content is public and may be visible to current or future patients and other providers; it is generally a good policy to assume that anything said or posted online may be visible to anyone and available forever. To make it difficult for patients to find personal pages on social media, physicians should consider altering their names on their personal accounts or making personal accounts private.

### Data sharing of imaging in an evolving health care world: report of the ACR data sharing workgroup, part 2: annotation, curation, and contracting [^a525fdf3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

A core principle of ethical data sharing is maintaining the security and anonymity of the data, and care must be taken to ensure medical records and images cannot be reidentified to be traced back to patients or misconstrued as a breach in the trust between health care providers and patients. Once those principles have been observed, those seeking to share data must take the appropriate steps to curate the data in a way that organizes the clinically relevant information so as to be useful to the data sharing party, assesses the ensuing value of the data set and its annotations, and informs the data sharing contracts that will govern use of the data. Embarking on a data sharing partnership engenders a host of ethical, practical, technical, legal, and commercial challenges that require a thoughtful, considered approach. In 2019 the ACR convened a Data Sharing Workgroup to develop philosophies around best practices in the sharing of health information. This is Part 2 of a Report on the workgroup's efforts in exploring these issues.

### Genomic cloud computing: legal and ethical points to consider [^6bdf53fa]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Points to consider

Data control

Cloud computing with commercial CSPs entails the outsourcing (or off-shoring) of data and services to third party providers. Any genomic or health-related data that used to be stored locally may thereafter be stored in the cloud, including in a ‘cloud stack' format whereby multiple layers of services are provided by separate CSPs. Attributable to a multi-tenant environment (ie, where a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple client organizations), and possibly geographically dispersed data centers, genomic researchers place their computation and data on machines they cannot directly control. To a large extent, control over computation and data is thereby relinquished. Among the risks associated with cloud computing are unauthorized access (or reuses for which consent has not been obtained from researchers, patients or participants), data corruption, infrastructure failure or unavailability. In case something goes wrong, it can be difficult to discern who has caused the problem, and, in the absence of solid evidence, it is nearly impossible for the parties involved to hold each other responsible for the problem if a dispute arises.

Data control issues are manifest in several areas of a CSP's Terms of Service:

Amendments to terms of service

First, control issues arise in the ability for many commercial CSPs to amend the Terms of Service, often without explicit notification to customers. Often included in CSPs' imposed standard-form contracts is the possibility for the CSP to vary terms via unilateral notice. This privilege, which is commonly seen in IT and online contracts, obliges customers to check the CSP website for changes to the Terms of Service, even if the CSP does not mark the changes or indicate the date of last change or review. Some may provide notice only of ‘material' changes to the Terms of Service. Further, CSPs will consider continued use of their cloud service as deemed acceptance of the new Terms of Service in the absence of any explicit objection to the amended terms or cessation of use.

Recommendation 
Researchers should ensure proper notification of amendments to Terms of Service with a reasonable period of time for response and acceptance.

### Guidance on the use of social media in reproductive medicine practice [^a50681be]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Social media governance and patient interactions—policies, security controls, and etiquette—states that “Ideally, practices should create formal policies about the plans and expectations of account management,” including elements such as “the frequency with which the site will be monitored, the minimum frequency with which new posts will be added, identification of specific personnel who are responsible for maintaining the posts (with plans for backup personnel as needed),” and protocols for posts that “contain inflammatory content, reveal private health information, make requests for clinic or physician contact, or solicit medical advice.” It notes that “Security settings should be adjusted so that ‘tags’ (i.e., identifiers that may be attached to a comment or video posted online) from consumers are blocked or must be approved by authorized administrators of the accounts,” and that “Security settings also can be adjusted so that only authorized page administrators can post content if desired.” Practices “should also be familiar with their institutional or group policies regarding the use of social media,” “should direct all online traffic to the practice's professional page and discourage staff from sending ‘friend’ requests to, or accepting requests from, patients directly,” and that many professional organizations “recommend or insist on encouraging patients to ‘follow’ a practice or professional profile on social media.” It emphasizes that etiquette applies equally online and that “Providers and patients also should not exchange protected health information through accounts on social media, as these channels are not encrypted.”

### Inclusion of sex and gender to improve the state of the science in women's health [^f183c135]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The influence of sex and gender-related factors on health and disease at all levels of scale, across all health conditions, and throughout the entire life course is increasingly clear. A series of policies instituted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that require researchers to include appropriate populations and to analyze the data accordingly have strengthened the evidence base around the health of women. Translating these advances to the entire research ecosystem can catalyze rigorous biomedical discovery that can improve health. We encourage journals, publishers, and funders to align their policies and expectations regarding sex and gender considerations in research with those of the NIH and other international funding agencies.

### Reproductive services for women at high risk for maternal mortality: a report of the workshop of the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the fellowship in family planning, and the Society of Family Planning [^119aa1af]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

SMFM Special Report—Provider and policy approaches to equitable reproductive care—at a provider level, delivering ethical, patient-centered, culturally responsive care requires that providers elicit a patient’s values and incorporate them into a shared decision-making process that respects a patient’s autonomy, including presenting medical information in language a woman can understand, asking questions to understand her values and priorities, and answering any questions she may have. Referrals should be offered as promptly as possible to ensure she will be able to receive her desired care and counseling may be required multiple times as the pregnancy progresses and conditions, risks, and treatment options change. At the community and organizational levels, advocacy is needed to reduce disparities, with efforts that include extending Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum; expanding family leave policies; removing reimbursement for postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) from the global obstetric bundle payment; repealing the Hyde Amendment; and removing onerous and medically unnecessary barriers to accessing abortion, contraception, and family planning services. Workshop participants joined one of three breakout groups to make preliminary recommendations on: (1) assessing risk of maternal morbidity and mortality; (2) counseling women at high risk for pregnancy complications; and (3) training and access related to family planning and reproductive services.

### Perspectives from advancing National Institutes of Health research to inform and improve the health of women: a conference summary [^3790eef4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

The health of women remains understudied. In response to a request from Congress, the Office of Research on Women's Health of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) evaluated research on the health of women currently underway related to 1) rising rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, 2) rising rates of chronic debilitating conditions in women, and 3) stagnant cervical cancer survival rates. Input on the three priority areas was obtained from experts in women's health, members of the public, and federal stakeholders. The NIH research portfolios on these three topics were reviewed. On October 20, 2021, a conference on advancing NIH research on women's health was held to present, discuss, and delineate gaps and opportunities in the current portfolio. Across the life course, significant gaps in evidence regarding conditions, disorders, and diseases that occur in women were illustrated. Fundamental basic and translational knowledge gaps in many female-specific conditions and diseases with sex-specific presentations, symptoms, or responses to treatments have hampered the generation of robust scientific data needed to provide high-quality, evidence-based care to women. Key opportunities identified to improve the health of women include enhanced implementation of existing best practices and interventions to reduce disparities. Undertaking intentional clinical research on the health of women will produce significant returns on investment and has the potential to greatly improve human health.

### Professional use of digital and social media: ACOG committee opinion, number 791 [^a354b2b8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion—online ratings and reviews: It is imperative for physicians to understand and comply with the terms and conditions of the user agreement for these sites because failure to comply with these terms and conditions, specifically regarding solicitation of reviews, can be the source of litigation for any business, including physician group and individual practices. Physicians should be prepared to handle negative online ratings or reviews, and current literature reveals that most online physician ratings are positive; one physician group found that patient satisfaction and recruitment improved as a result of online physician ratings, including negative reviews. Regardless of the content of the review, physicians are best served by monitoring, rather than ignoring, these online ratings; inaccurate information in reviews should be presented to the host site promptly to allow for investigation and removal of inaccuracies, where appropriate, and physicians should abide by the same code of professionalism and conduct that applies to other offline behavior.

### Online misleading information about women's reproductive health: a narrative review [^a3acd8d7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Reproductive Health Search Terms

These reproductive health topics were cross-referenced with terms referring to the internet and/or misinformation (e.g. “social media,” “myths”). Where relevant, we included references embedded in these articles. We also incorporated several gray literature reports and research blog posts from leading internet research organizations and articles known to the authors to be relevant that provided insights on the characteristics and spread of online misleading reproductive health information. Articles mainly consisted of content analyses of social media platforms and websites. Articles were reviewed to the point of thematic saturation, at which point the researchers determined that the major themes had been surfaced and additional articles were unlikely to contribute further. Forty-seven articles were included in the final analysis.

Articles were included if they were published between 2010 and 2024, were English-language and focused on English content on social media and other internet platforms, and discussed specific misleading claims and narratives about women’s reproductive health. Articles were excluded if they were published outside of the date range, were not in English or studied non-English content, did not address women’s reproductive health (e.g. articles about male contraception), and did not describe a specific misleading claim or narrative (e.g. articles that reported on the overall prevalence of misinformation or the accessibility of the content).

### Working together to address women's health in research and drug development: summary of the 2017 women's health congress preconference symposium [^5c321ddc]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Historically, women have been underrepresented in clinical research, requiring physicians to extrapolate medical recommendations for women from clinical research done in cohorts consisting predominantly of male participants. While government-funded clinical research has achieved gender parity in phase-3 clinical trials across many biomedical disciplines, improvements are still needed in several facets of women's health research, such as the inclusion of women in early-phase clinical trials, the inclusion of pregnant women and women with physical and intellectual disabilities, the consideration of sex as a biological variable in preclinical research, and the analysis and reporting of sex and gender differences across the full biomedical research continuum. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research on Women's Health and the Office of Women's Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cosponsored a preconference symposium at the 25th Annual Women's Health Congress, held in Arlington, VA in April, 2017, to highlight gains made and remaining needs regarding the representation of women in clinical research, to introduce innovative procedures and technologies, and to outline revised policy for future studies. Six speakers presented information on a range of subjects related to the representation of women in clinical research and federal initiatives to advance precision medicine. Topics included the following: the return on investment from the NIH-funded Women's Health Initiative; progress in including women in clinical trials for FDA-approved drugs and products; the importance of clinical trials in pregnant women; FDA initiatives to report drug safety during pregnancy; the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program; and efforts to enhance FDA transparency and communications, including the introduction of Drug Trials Snapshots. This article summarizes the major points of the presentations and the discussions that followed.

### Key outcomes for reporting in studies of pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions: a qualitative study [^ef8fdc4a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Interviews and focus groups have been used as qualitative methods to inform core outcome sets. As the experience and outcomes of pregnancy may vary depending on the women’s unique combination of health conditions, we chose to conduct focus groups for synergistic discussions.

Inclusivity statement

Where the words ‘women’, ‘maternal’, or ‘mother’ are used, these also include people who do not identify as women but have been pregnant, planning to be pregnant or have given birth.

Inclusion criteria

Participants were eligible for the focus groups if they were women with two or more pre-existing long-term physical or mental health conditions, who have been pregnant in the last 5 years or are planning a pregnancy; their partners; and health care professionals who look after pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions and their children. Participants had to be able to converse in English and based in the UK.

Recruitment

We planned to conduct three focus groups, one for health care professionals, one for women, and one for women with or without their partners. After discussion with our patient and public involvement (PPI) advisory group, we aimed to recruit eight participants per focus group to facilitate optimal discussion and to account for dropouts. The PPI advisory group also recommended inviting partners to attend alongside their pregnant partner, instead of a focus group for partners only. This would help focus the discussion on outcomes relevant to studies of pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions.

Recruitment and sampling was guided by a sampling matrix prespecified in the core outcome set protocol, based on physical or mental health conditions, ethnicity, under-served populations and specialties of health care professionals. We additionally aimed for representation from all four devolved nations in the UK and partners.

Study adverts were shared through social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and websites) of charities and organisations for patients, pregnancy, mothers, and health care professionals, and with personal contacts of the multidisciplinary research team. The recruitment campaign took place in October 2021 for health care professionals and January 2022 for women and partners, and lasted for two to three months. Potential participants contacted the research team directly and were provided with the participant information sheets. They completed a sampling questionnaire which iteratively informed the recruitment strategy. We then undertook maximum variation purposive sampling from the pool of eligible potential participants.

### Qualitative website analysis of information on birth after caesarean section [^ae246c07]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Google™, the most frequently utilised search engine worldwide, was used to perform the internet search of English language websites providing information relating to birth after previous caesarean section. Exclusion Criteria included sites relating solely to advertising or products for sale; not relating to humans (i.e. veterinary or not related to the search terms entered), and those requiring membership or payment for full access. Search terms used included those provided by a sample of women, pregnant after previous CS, attending the antenatal clinic in Aberdeen Maternity Hospital (between Dec 2013 – Jan 2014). These women were invited to participate by means of a combined invitation letter, information sheet and form containing one question regarding which search terms they would use if searching for information on birth options after CS on the internet. We received seven completed forms from 6 antenatal clinics. Ethical approval was sought, but the North of Scotland Research Ethics (NRES) Committee confirmed that this was not required. These, together with well-established keywords in this area (identified from a previous study, by Whitelaw et al.) were selected, and a single reviewer (NW) performed the search. The search was conducted on a personal laptop and results verified on two NHS computers. The first 10 web pages returned for each of the 10 search terms were combined giving a n initial sample of 100 Google search results. This provided 68 unique web pages from 44 individual websites (35 if all NHS websites are grouped together). The number of times websites recurred within this initial sample, including those returned under a slightly different uniform resource locator (URL) was recorded. Predetermined purposive sampling criteria was used to select the most frequently returned sites within this sample that met the criteria (minimum of one of the following: government-funded; commercially funded; charity-funded; aimed at the general public; UK-based, US-based and one from another country to give a final sample of 10 websites for analysis (Table 1).

### 'They treat us like machines': migrant workers' conceptual framework of labour exploitation for health research and policy [^89e2bbdb]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Poor employment conditions and lack of protection

The key dimension ‘poor employment conditions and lack of protection’ includes the subdimensions ‘uncertainty over the future and lack of stability’ and ‘poor contract and payment issues’. It describes aspects of employment conditions and protections that are generally found in contractual arrangements and defines employment relations, as highlighted by a LAW:

When you do not have a contract or an explanation of which area you have to clean, day after day, they add things to you, and how could you say no.”(Individual brainstorming with woman—U2F)

Participants expected contractual arrangements to foster a sense of security and capacity to plan their futures. However, they viewed some contracts, such as zero-hour contracts, as exploitative, and experiences illustrated by this dimension reflect the lack of a ‘safety net’ when, for instance, they experienced irregular or delayed payment. This dimension implies some structural exploitation, and the following quote highlights the relation between the two clusters:

people with zero-hour [contracts] do not have the right to take paid holidays, they do not have paid holiday […] You can take your holidays, but they do not pay you […] there is no job stability for those people, which is crucial! […] All contracts have to be under this regime: all with paid vacations, all with sick pay and all… with job stability! (Individual brainstorming with man—U3M)

The subdimension ‘uncertainty over the future and lack of stability’ covers statements indicating employment conditions preventing migrant workers from planning their short-term future (eg, #60 ‘ not paid the right amount of hours at the end of the month’, or #82 ‘ working hours are fragmented’) or longer-term (eg, #30 ‘can be fired without justification’). Statements like #62 ‘ not paid at the end of the month’ or #65 ‘ fired when coming back from authorised absence or holidays’ also illustrate a sense of unpredictability.

### Applying the principle of justice in digital health [^180cf735]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rawls proposes, then, to reach the principles of justice starting from what he calls the “original position,” which is equivalent to the state of nature in the traditional theories of the social contract: an exercise of the imagination which prepares us to think and “sign” the contract on which the just society is to be based. In this original position, individuals live behind the “veil of ignorance,” another of Rawls’s key concepts. Behind this veil, no one knows their place in society, what their natural abilities are, or what their conception of good is. In this state, our ignorance of our socioeconomic status, our sexual identity, our race, our origin, our ideology or our state of health—that is, the contingencies that affect the definition of our particular interests—means that our choice of principles of justice does not seek our individual benefit, simply because we do not know what can benefit us and what can harm us. This veil makes us ignorant of all arbitrary matters; in the original position, on the other hand, we do have knowledge about what the world is like and how it works: we know, for example, that there are social classes, races, sexes, that there are different religious convictions and ideologies, different conceptions of good and justice. And we also have an understanding of how areas such as health or the economy work. In this way, it can be said that we are in an ideal initial situation to agree on a set of fair principles based on impartiality: hence the definition of justice as “impartiality” or “fairness” that Rawls chooses.

### Examination of potential industry conflicts of interest and disclosures by contributors to online medical resource databases [^02cc8559]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Physicians contribute content to online databases, and other health care professionals use these websites to support their decision-making. Financial conflicts of interest (COI) have the potential to adversely impact evidence-based patient care.

Objectives

To quantify the potential COI among content contributors to 2 popular point-of-care medical resources, UpToDate and DynaMed, overall and by gender, and to compare self-reported and industry-mandated disclosures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study compiled an initial list of contributors for each website using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Leading Causes of Death. The top 50 causes were used to identify relevant articles from each database from November 30 to December 7, 2020. The authors and editors of those articles were investigated. Data were analyzed from January 2021 to March 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported contributor disclosure status was compared with financial remuneration as reported in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments (OP) database from 2013 to 2018.

Results

A total of 179 point-of-care database authors and editors were assessed. Combined, they received $77.7 million, with a mean of $583 218 (95% CI, $0-$4 679 651) and median (range) of $29 073 ($10-$17 517 315) each. Most of the compensation ($68.1 million [87.6%]) went to UpToDate contributors. Of 128 UpToDate contributors, 76 (59.4%) reported nothing to disclose, and among these, 44 contributors (57.9%) had a record of receiving a financial payment on OP. Women UpToDate contributors received 2.5% of the total compensation paid from industry. The top 10 UpToDate contributors who received the most financial remuneration earned $56.1 million combined, were all men, and only 1 had a nothing-to-disclose status. Of 51 DynaMed contributors, 42 (82.4%) reported nothing to disclose, and among these, 35 contributors (83.3%) had an OP entry (mean, $79 820; 95% CI, $0-$400 774; median [range], $1403 [$26-$630 424]). Among the top 10 DynaMed contributors, 8 (80.0%) were men. Six of the top 10 DynaMed contributors reported nothing to disclose yet had an OP entry.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that contributors to point-of-care databases were the recipients of nearly $78 million from pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers, and these payments were often not disclosed in association with contributed content. Although these findings do not necessarily suggest ethical lapses among the physicians studied, point-of-care resource websites, like UpToDate and DynaMed, should consider implementing more stringent COI policies and employ an unbiased team to verify self-reported disclosure statuses among content contributors against OP reports.

### UYSD: a novel data repository accessible via public website for worldwide population frequencies of Y-SNP haplogroups [^7486ce20]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Usage conditions

Although UYSD was developed as a tool for the academic community, information about the distribution of Y-haplogroups may also be of interest to a broader public—for example, persons who have undergone Y-chromosomal analysis through direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies or citizen scientist. Therefore, UYSD usage is not restricted, and no user registration is required for access. However, to ensure quality control and prevent data contamination, only researchers with institutional email addresses can create accounts and submit data. While we recognize the valuable contributions of citizen scientists and acknowledge that this restriction may limit UYSD’s growth, maintaining the integrity of the database is paramount. Restricting data submission to academic researchers helps minimize errors, ensure accountability, and maintain high data quality. Moreover, only Y-SNP and Y-haplogroup population data that have already been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal are eligible for submission. As part of the submission process, the data-submitting user is asked to provide the reference for their data and the platform will retain the link with this publication. By keeping this direct link to the original publications, it is possible to obtain more information about a given Y-haplogroup dataset from the original paper than can be accessed via the UYSD.

By only allowing published data to be submitted to UYSD, we aim to ensure that the data in the database adhere to scientific and ethical principles, assuming that these standards have been met in the original peer-reviewed publication. Only when compelling evidence of scientific misconduct is presented to the database administrator by a third party, can the administrator decide to remove the respective dataset from the platform. In such case, the administrator will discuss the concerns with the user who submitted the data and may consult the scientific journal that had originally published that work. Data of publications that are retracted because of ethical concerns will immediately be removed once the administrator is notified. Ultimately, the user that submits the data to UYSD remains fully responsible for the data and can be directly contacted through a form on the platform. Before submitting data to the platform, it is mandatory to comply to the aforementioned terms. UYSD users that utilize information obtained via the database for their publications are urged to cite both the original publication as well as UYSD (i.e. the present paper).

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5efa0ce1]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, USPSTF 2019 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or genetic testing in females with no personal or family history or ancestry not associated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 gene mutations.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^45ec8dd8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) clinical guidelines—mandated disclosures and public reporting require that participants disclose all active and inactive financial and intellectual interests related to health care, with reportable categories including all employment; research and consulting support; investments and proprietary interests; positions held; professional career or intellectual interests; and any other aspect of the participant’s background or present interests that might be perceived as affecting objectivity or independence. The CGC’s policy does not mandate disclosure of interests related primarily to personal matters or relationships outside the household, which may include nonhousehold familial and personal relationships, political, religious, or ideological views, philanthropic donations, and personal or family health issues or experiences. Participants involved in the development of ACP guidelines disclose interests using a structured electronic format with specific categorical prompts and sign and date the form after each review and update, certifying full disclosure and commitment to promptly disclose changes. For transparency, the DOI forms for committee members, staff, and any other participant, which are signed after each meeting, are publicly available on ACP’s Web site, and all ACP clinical guidelines and guidance statements contain a link to these reports.

### Public variant databases: liability? [^058175f3]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Terms of use/disclaimers

Terms of use clarify that users are expected to behave “as learned intermediaries, exercising customary clinical discretion and consulting other sources of relevant information.”Common elements include the following:
Liability disclaimers: exclude liability for harm resulting from reliance on inaccurate information. Legal disclaimers are found in a variety of medical contexts. When liability cannot be disclaimed, user agreements may instead aim to limit liability or remedies.
Indemnities: users agree to indemnify the database for costs or liability stemming from the user’s actions.
No warranty: the database makes no representations, warranties, or assurances that the data are accurate, current, or fit for purpose (e.g. diagnosis).
No medical advice: the user agrees to not make diagnostic decisions based solely on the information in the repository without consulting a health-care professional with the relevant expertise.

The Human Variome project has developed a standard text for database disclaimers based on common elements in existing disclaimers. It notifies users of appropriate uses and includes language to limit the liability of submitters, curators, and managers.The effectiveness of user agreements to modify the obligations of clinicians, who are the primary audience for variant databases, may be limited. Clinicians are already held to professional standards and are expected to be up to date with the current state of knowledge (and its limitations). The validity of liability disclaimers may also be uncertain, particularly when data are made available online and internationally. In many jurisdictions, there are limits on liability disclaimers (e.g. it may be illegal to disclaim liability for recklessness or negligence resulting in bodily harm). In addition, a simple notification on a public website may not be sufficient to form a legal agreement; some form of click-wrap/click-through agreement may be required. Even when use agreements have a limited impact on legal obligations, they are still important to clarify the respective responsibilities of submitters, databases, and users.

### Guidance on the use of social media in reproductive medicine practice [^3d955bab]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). Medium credibility.

The term "social media" refers to computer-mediated technologies that enable individuals and communities to gather, communicate, network, and share information. These technologies represent useful tools for enabling individual providers and their clinics to broadcast content that educates, informs, advertises, and narrates content to a larger audience. There are multiple benefits to maintaining a presence on social media, either as an individual physician or as a clinic, but several pitfalls deserve consideration as well. This guidance document does not endorse any specific cloud-based platform or service, though some are mentioned for the purposes of illustration.

### Key outcomes for reporting in studies of pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions: a qualitative study [^f0603235]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Maternal multiple long-term conditions are associated with adverse outcomes for mother and child. We conducted a qualitative study to inform a core outcome set for studies of pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions.

Methods

Women with two or more pre-existing long-term physical or mental health conditions, who had been pregnant in the last five years or planning a pregnancy, their partners and health care professionals were eligible. Recruitment was through social media, patients and health care professionals' organisations and personal contacts. Participants who contacted the study team were purposively sampled for maximum variation. Three virtual focus groups were conducted from December 2021 to March 2022 in the United Kingdom: (i) health care professionals (n=8), (ii) women with multiple long-term conditions (n=6), and (iii) women with multiple long-term conditions (n=6) and partners (n=2). There was representation from women with 20 different physical health conditions and four mental health conditions; health care professionals from obstetrics, obstetric/maternal medicine, midwifery, neonatology, perinatal psychiatry, and general practice. Participants were asked what outcomes should be reported in all studies of pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Outcomes identified in the focus groups were mapped to those identified in a systematic literature search in the core outcome set development.

Results

The focus groups identified 63 outcomes, including maternal (n=43), children's (n=16) and health care utilisation (n=4) outcomes. Twenty-eight outcomes were new when mapped to the systematic literature search. Outcomes considered important were generally similar across stakeholder groups. Women emphasised outcomes related to care processes, such as information sharing when transitioning between health care teams and stages of pregnancy (continuity of care). Both women and partners wanted to be involved in care decisions and to feel informed of the risks to the pregnancy and baby. Health care professionals additionally prioritised non-clinical outcomes, including quality of life and financial implications for the women; and longer-term outcomes, such as children's developmental outcomes.

Conclusions

The findings will inform the design of a core outcome set. Participants' experiences provided useful insights of how maternity care for pregnant women with multiple long-term conditions can be improved.

### Confidentiality in the care of adolescents: technical report [^fd3bd726]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Adolescent confidentiality in electronic health record (EHR) portals—ideally, there would be automated segmentation of information and differential entry points for patients and proxies, and health care professionals have to consider how to verify portal ownership because parents may create accounts or use a parent e-mail, requiring identity confirmation and mechanisms to ensure accounts are used as designed. Because the practicality of such mechanisms is unclear, the page emphasizes the need for detailed education of both adolescent and parent before establishing portal access and notes that improved data segmentation and increased parental access to nonsensitive information may decrease parental misuse. The report adds that health care professionals have limited training in managing confidentiality with EHRs and patient portals and cites a common suggestion to generate secure notes or otherwise denote confidential content, while acknowledging the burden this places on clinicians. Professional guidance is referenced, including a statement by the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine endorsed by the AAP, and additional AAP guidance describing key exceptions that would allow blocking information release to proxies and release only to adolescents when state laws allow; understanding valid exceptions to information blocking prohibitions can mitigate challenges and barriers to confidentiality for youth.

### Online misleading information about women's reproductive health: a narrative review [^33566ab4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A narrative review approach allowed us to explore a comprehensive range of reproductive health claims and narratives. Without a systematic review methodology, however, articles that met our inclusion criteria may have been unintentionally excluded. While we assessed that thematic saturation was reached at the end of our search, it is possible that additional articles could contribute new insights. This study included papers published only in English. Since the studies we included typically focused on one topic in reproductive health and online platform, our findings do not necessarily reflect the most prominent reproductive health misinformation across social media overall, but rather the topics receiving the most research interest. For example, we did not find articles on menopause misinformation, although there is undoubtedly misinformation about menopause online. We are pursuing research to surveil online misinformation about reproductive health to understand its full scope.

In conclusion, we find that a variety of misleading claims and narratives about reproductive health are prominently reported in the literature. We urge clinicians providing reproductive healthcare to become knowledgeable about these misleading claims and narratives so that they can proactively assist patients in making decisions based on the best scientific evidence.

### What all physicians should know about women's health: a Delphi study [^1fc12e9f]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Patient and public involvement

The research team included a patient advisory board, consisting of members from patient organisations. The patient advisory board was recruited by reaching out to the European Institute of Women’s Health, an umbrella organisation of patient organisations across Europe. They shared our call for participation in the study with their members. There was a separate information letter about the study, in comprehendible and layman English. An online meeting was held with respondents to our call to establish the patient advisory board. During this online meeting, the steering committee provided a briefing where mutual expectations were aligned. The patient advisory board was involved from the start of the study, in the design of the voters list of the Delphi process, in the interpretation of the study findings and in the writing process of the manuscript. A linguist, in collaboration with a medical doctor from the steering committee, developed layperson-friendly explanations of the statements formulated by the experts. The patient advisory board provided feedback on these explanations and was also given the opportunity to suggest additional topics for the statement list if deemed necessary. The steering committee provided updates to the patient advisory board throughout the study and members of the patient advisory board were invited to participate in the writing process of the manuscript as coauthor. The final article will be shared with the patient advisory board. A layman summary of the article will be provided for dissemination among the patient organisations members and the results of this study may be used for patient education materials.

Voting list

The voting list consisted of clinical conditions and public health topics in women’s health. It was composed based on literature and refined by suggestions of the project leaders and the patient advisory board. First, the steering committee established guidelines for statement formulation to ensure consistency and academic rigour. Next, the project leaders drafted statements on topics that they deemed essential for inclusion in the voting list. These statements were reviewed by the patient advisory board, which added any statements they felt were missing. The statements were reviewed by the steering committee for duplicates and literature context, followed by a linguistic review for consistency, precision, and avoidance of ambiguity. The supervising researcher piloted the voting list for final approval. The list was subsequently distributed to participants via Qualtrics, with literature references per statement available for the voters. Participants could suggest adding topics after the first round if they felt topics were missing.

### Guidance on the use of social media in reproductive medicine practice [^85eb07d4]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Professional social media content in reproductive medicine—appropriate professional content on various platforms of social media can include, but may not be limited to updates on administrative changes in the practice; videos or brief biographies of physicians and staff; “insider” views into the office, embryology laboratory, and other workings of the ART practice; educational material (updated national guidelines, breaking medical news and discoveries, research updates, and relevant, patient-directed videos); interactive activities to engage patients; relevant legislation and issues related to advocacy; and links to other appropriate websites with appropriate disclaimers. Posts that facilitate engagement are more likely to increase exposure, social media provides a different type of sharing and reach that can augment a user’s ability to find one’s clinic or individual presence online, both search and social media can help drive patients to one’s services, and it is important to keep social media content updated and current.

### A global review of publicly available datasets for ophthalmological imaging: barriers to access, usability, and generalisability [^6528da79]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2021). High credibility.

Identification of ophthalmological imaging datasets

Search results from MEDLINE were screened by the primary reviewer (SMK) to identify the name and source of any relevant datasets. Where status of availability was unclear, we included these datasets and attempted to access their source, reporting any further barriers to access in our results. The Google and Google Dataset Search results were also screened by the primary reviewer to directly identify relevant datasets. Where there was ambiguity regarding whether a dataset fit the inclusion criteria, a second reviewer (XL) independently reviewed the dataset and if this could not be resolved, a third reviewer (SN) was consulted.

Dataset access and description

Various classifications have been proposed for levels of data accessibility, including a tiered grading system where data accessibility is described as open, safe-guarded, or controlled. In this Review, we defined the accessibility of datasets as either: (1) open access, for which there were no requirements or minimum requirements for access (eg, submission of personal information, an email request, creation of an account); (2) open access with barriers, which were datasets fulfilling the theoretical criteria for open access, but being inaccessible because of unpredictable reasons (eg, no response to requests or broken hyperlinks); and (3) regulated access, which required the fulfilment of formal agreements, approvals, or payment. For the open access category where the dataset access required an email request, we allowed a 2-week period for email response; where the website was unresponsive or the download link was not functional, this was checked by a second and third reviewer, before the attempt to access was abandoned.

Extraction of dataset characteristics

A prespecified data extraction form was developed and piloted on the first 20 datasets (by SMK and XL). Information characterising each dataset was recorded, including the direct links to the data source, accessibility, content (in terms of population, pathology, and imaging), and associated metadata (including clinical data, image labels, and segmentation). Where this information was reported at source (eg, on the dataset website) or a link to the paper describing the dataset was provided, we recorded the information as provided. Additionally, we presented the completeness of the reporting for key clinical metadata items across all open access datasets. Each item was marked as reported if the information was described in the dataset documentation, description, or referencing publication and was accepted as reported even if given at the aggregate level.

### Universal credit receipt among working-age patients who are accessing specialist mental health services: results from a novel data linkage study [^99e8bfa7]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

A key characteristic of UC is the claimant commitment, as claimants are expected to fulfil responsibilities to continue to receive payments (referred to as ‘conditionality’). While these responsibilities are tailored to a person’s circumstances, they depend heavily on the conditionality regime that they are allocated to (which in turn depends on their personal circumstances). These regimes include (1) ‘searching for work’, (2) ‘working—with requirements’, (3) ‘no work requirements’, (4) ‘working—no requirements’, (5) ‘planning for work’ and (6) ‘preparing for work’.More details are in online supplemental table 1. If an individual does not fulfil the obligations outlined as part of their regime, their UC payments may be reduced or suspended. This is called a sanction and the length of the sanction depends on the reason for the sanction.Concerns have been raised that benefit recipients and particularly those affected by mental disorders are adversely impacted by the increased use of conditionality.For example, due to the fluctuating nature of certain mental disorders, it is likely that they are at an increased risk of being sanctioned as it may be more difficult to meet the conditionality requirements. Furthermore, the stress provoked by the threat of losing much needed financial support may exacerbate one’s mental disorder.

Over the years, the number of people who are out of work due to mental ill health has increased steadily.We know that unemployed people are more likely to report poor mental health than those in employment.Additionally, mental health problems have been reported as a prominent health condition among those who are economically inactive due to long-term sickness.It is, therefore, likely that individuals with a mental disorder are over-represented among UC recipients particularly as people with limited capability for work or work-related ill health or a disability may be eligible to receive an extra payment, but only if they meet certain criteria assessed during a work capability assessment.

Despite this, we know very little about the mental health of individuals receiving UC. We have no knowledge about which mental disorder UC claimants may have been diagnosed with. Moreover, while data are available on certain sociodemographic characteristics of UC claimants, there are almost no data on their ethnicity.This is important as people from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds face various disadvantages in the labour market and are disproportionally impacted by poor mental health.

### Global patterns in access and benefit-sharing: a comprehensive review of national policies [^0ffd0762]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Repository creation

Primary and secondary policy review by inclusion criteria

Potentially relevant policies identified through the standardised collection process were subject to a preliminary screening to eliminate documents that were not legally binding or were no longer enforceable, including strategies, reports, draft laws and repealed laws. As an exception, supporting documents designed to clarify the interpretation of associated active laws or policies were included to provide critical contextual information. This is the case, for instance, with the EU Regulations 511/2014 which regulate how member states check compliance, but which still requires implementation into member states’ domestic law to be active.These entries have been clearly identified as supporting documents in the data set. We did not consider such position statements to be synonymous with legally enforceable policy. Thus, while we have noted the existence of such positions in our results, they were not considered in our reporting of the proportion of countries with codified policies.

Policies that passed the preliminary screening stage were then reviewed by the standardised inclusion criteria for eight distinct subtopics: Access, Compliance, Scope of Legislation, Benefit-Sharing, DSI, PIC, Contractual Terms and Legal Sanctions (online supplemental table 2). Policies that met the inclusion criteria were interrogated for each subtopic sequentially, and an applicable status was assigned when relevant language was identified (online supplemental figure 1). Each policy document was assigned to their respective country to populate the data set. Policies were then downloaded as PDFs and collated in Airtable, a cloud-based platform for relational repositories. All documents included in this data set are publicly available for download in a comma-separated values (.csv) file.

Data validation

Literature review, collection protocol and inclusion criteria were reviewed by the entire research team and approved by the Principal Investigator. Policy collection and primary review by inclusion criteria were completed by a lead researcher. Once included in the repository, a second member of the research team completed a secondary review of policies, assessing the primary researcher’s coding. Any coding discrepancies that arose between researchers were deconflicted and reviewed by the Principal Investigator. Finally, the data went through a quality control review by the research team before being uploaded to a publicly available website.

Data availability

All data sets, reproducible code and figures are available in a public, open-access repository at.

Patient and public involvement

Given the nature of this work, no patients were involved in the research process, nor was any public involvement solicited.

### Moving towards the goals of FP2020-classifying contraceptives [^279ff6c1]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

4 Proposals for using existing contraceptive classifications

Policies in FP should promote provision of a wide range of effective methods from which women and men can choose. However, current classification systems create challenges since some effective FABMs and EC are inconsistently categorized. Using only the category system with modern and traditional as basis for planning and programming is inadequate and confusing. While there was an attempt to clarify the dichotomy of classifying as modern or traditional, the conclusions from the meeting also state that using other classification criteria or systems may be more useful for specific purposes, as presented in Table 1.

LAM and the various FABMs should continue to be measured and reported in international surveys conducted by agencies. Participants need to be asked not only about what method was used but also the components of some methods, such as LAM, to validate its defined use. Reports that group methods such as “fertility awareness", “short acting", “long acting", and other terms are inconsistently applied. This causes confusion, does not allow for comparative analysis, and loses the specificity of information critical for decision makers. Reports should include method-specific results. This results in combining methods that are either considered modern (e.g. SDM or TwoDay Method) or traditional (e.g. calendar method), even if these should be separately reported.

It is important that WHO identifies a classification system that is evidence based and facilitates selection of a wide range of methods that are effective and acceptable to the norms and standards of clients. The classification system should be guided by the goals of improving access to effective contraceptive methods and supporting the reproductive rights of women and men. Measurement challenges will need to be addressed, but they should not be the driving force to determine what methods are counted and which are not. The WHO document Ensuring human rights within contraceptive programs: a human rights analysis of existing quantitative indicators provides a systematic, transparent system that is required to explicitly link health concerns and human rights. Accountability is central to ensuring that health and human rights standards are respected, protected and fulfilled. In accordance with human rights principles, people should have access to the widest range of contraceptive methods from which to choose to meet their needs and preferences and their changing needs throughout their reproductive lives.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^f8093ff9]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

1.8 Agree on work plans and governance structures with all study partners. Allocate adequate time, financial and human resources to all phases of the study

It is important that decision-making processes are clarified before the actual research starts. The roles and responsibilities of all parties involved should be transparently and fairly agreed in writing, so that study team members are on the same page in terms of expectations and contribution. This should including decision making in the event of disagreement. The RACI models are a useful way to do this, focusing on the four responsibilities most typically used: responsible, accountable, consulted and informed.In larger multistakeholder studies, oversight bodies may be needed to advise and oversee the study conduct.

Clear study plans should be developed to ensure that adequate time, financial and human resources are available for all phases of the study. All team members should have a valid role and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role. Trained and experienced local health professionals may possess the perfect skills mix for a given research position but their recruitment needs to be balanced with the potential health system weakening risk of depleting the local human resources for health. While it should go without saying that local research teams should be fairly remunerated for their contribution,it is important to pay special attention to the working conditions of those in the lower echelons of the research hierarchy. This includes field staff (eg, interviewers, supervisors and field data editors). Mitigating the precarious nature of their freelance casual labour should be considered where possible, ideally with mid-term to long-term solutions such as long-term contracts and opportunities for career progression. This can take the form of online courses and qualifications that can be embedded into their roles within the research team, depending on their needs and aspirations. Long-term contracts for field staff should also consider employment benefits such as health insurance and pension planning (as appropriate for the context) and budget for these in the financial planning and budget plans for a study.

Precise budget estimates are not always part of a grant application process, but careful estimation of the different costs during the application stage is beneficial for the practical implementation of a research project. It is important to take currency fluctuations, inflation and uncertainty into account when preparing the budget, especially in fragile and conflicted affect settings.

### The effect of a political crisis on performance of community forests and protected areas in Madagascar [^840180a7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Tests of heterogeneity of impacts and spatial resolution

Because the implementation of CFM is variable, we repeated the analysis for the sub-set of CFM for which the contracts were renewed, as this is an indicator that the CFM contracts were recognized and accepted by local communities and that implementation of CFM rules on the ground is more likely. Because geographic and socioeconomic context can influence both the effect of a political crisis and CFM performance, we explored how CFM performance varies based on the level of remoteness (measured as the distance from urban centers, roads, and villages), and population density. To explore this, we repeated the event study analysis, including all the same covariates described above but adding additional interaction terms representing each of these variables (Table 4).

We were also curious whether CFM performance might differ in areas with higher levels of development, as communities in such areas might be less dependent on forest resources. Similarly, we wondered if areas with higher levels of monitoring and enforcement might perform better. Therefore, we also ran the event study analysis with interaction terms for an indicator related to the level of development (an index of self-reported well-being indicators related to material assets) and an indicator related to the level of security (a self-reported indicator related to security conditions and risk of theft of property), both measured at the level of fokontany (the smallest administrative unit within Madagascar) (Fig. S 8). To explore the effect of spatial resolution on our resultswe repeated all analyses at two spatial resolutions: 90 and 270 m.

### Proceedings of the first international conference on women and infectious diseases. February 27-28, 2004. Atlanta, Georgia, USA [^cf9487d8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

On February 27–28, 2004, scientists, clinicians, researchers, women's health advocates, educators, policymakers, and representatives from nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations gathered in Atlanta for the first International Conference on Women and Infectious Diseases (ICWID): From Science to Action. The Office of Minority and Women's Health of the National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spearheaded the conference. It was cosponsored by the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the American Society for Microbiology.

The broad ICWID steering committee included representatives from the DHHS Office on Women's Health, the National Institutes of Health Office for Research on Women's Health, the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, the Fogarty Center, and the Office of Women's Health of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Academic, community-based, and philanthropic organizations as well as numerous CDC entities were involved. The conference's goal was to enhance prevention and control of infectious diseases among women worldwide. The conference's 400 attendees from 25 countries (both industrialized and developing nations) and 30 U.S. states recognized the need for a forum to address the complex set of concerns and issues surrounding women and infectious diseases.

Julie Gerberding, director of CDC and administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, opened the conference with an overview of the impact of infectious diseases on women. The address reminded listeners of the female face of infectious diseases: women may be biologically more susceptible to certain infections and suffer more severe complications. Other keynote speakers included Paul DeLay of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, Carol Bellamy of the United Nations Children's Fund, and Mirta Roses Periago of the Pan American Health Organization.

The theme of the conference was "From Science to Action." In 35 sessions, attendees discussed practical application of scientific knowledge in areas such as HIV, infectious causes of chronic diseases and other infectious disease–chronic disease relationships, gender roles in infectious disease transmission and prevention, sexual coercion and its effect on infectious diseases in women, sexually transmitted diseases, health disparities, healthcare workers and caregivers, immunization, effective community-based strategies, the role of cultural competence in women's health, and more.

### Codeine sulfate [^8aab0a63]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1
Important Dosage
and Administration
Instructions

Codeine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of codeine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with codeine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] .

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of
Opioid Overdose

Discussthe availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with codeine sulfate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)] .

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

### Impact of a web-based tool (webCONSORT) to improve the reporting of randomised trials: results of a randomised controlled trial [^12f51710]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Design

We conducted a multi-journal, two-arm parallel group, randomised trial to assess the impact of the WebCONSORT tool compared to a control intervention on the completeness of reporting of randomised trials submitted to biomedical journals. The study obtained ethics approval from the University of Oxford Central Research Ethics Committee, Oxford, UK (MSD-IDREC-C1-2012-89) and is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01891448).

Journal participants

To be eligible for inclusion, journals were required to (1) endorse the CONSORT Statement (assessed via journal Instruction to Authors and as listed on the CONSORT website:); (2) not actively implement the CONSORT Statement (defined as requiring authors to submit a completed CONSORT checklist alongside their manuscript at the time of article submission); and (3) publish reports of randomised trials (criteria assessed February 2013). All journals that met the above inclusion criteria were sent an email (February 2013) from the WebCONSORT study scientific committee inviting them to participate in the study. The description of requirements for participation were included in the email and study information sheet (Appendix 1) and editors were asked to verify that they complied with these criteria and that, while they endorsed the CONSORT Statement, they do not actively implement it.

If a journal agreed to participate, and confirmed they met the eligibility criteria, then the journal editor was asked (Appendix 2) to include an electronic web address to the WebCONSORT study website in their request for revision letter to authors for any manuscript identified by the journal as reporting the results of a randomised trial. We did this by asking the journal to include this standard sentence in their revision letter to authors:

“ As part of the process of revising your manuscript we would like you to use the WebCONSORT tool which is designed to help you improve the reporting of your randomised trial. You can access the tool by clicking on the following link: [link to WebCONSORT study site]. Please be aware that by submitting your manuscript to our journal it may be part of a research study, any participation will not impact on any future acceptance or rejection of your manuscript ”.

Participating journals were also informed that we would require access to the revised manuscript to assess reporting quality irrespective of whether it was published or not.

### Legal principles and essential surrogacy cases every practitioner should know [^99f68251]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Gestational surrogacy, made possible with the introduction of in vitro fertilization, has expanded family building options while introducing novel challenges to established legal principles involving constitutional, contract, and family law as well as duty of care and negligence. Both legislatures and courts have grappled with how to apply these sometimes-competing areas of law to protect participants and professionals, and to create legally secure families. This article explores the following: the Constitutionally protected rights of privacy and reproductive autonomy of gestational surrogates; Contract Law principles that govern surrogacy contracts; the varied ways states have extended Family Law to establish legally recognized parent-child relationships between intended parents and children born to gestational surrogates; and the legal duties of care medical professionals owe to their patients.
