## Question

When to do thoracocentesis in a patient with heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to perform thoracentesis in a patient with heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the effusion is likely cardiac in origin. Then, I should verify whether the presentation warrants diagnostic versus therapeutic thoracentesis. Next, I will review the strength of evidence, especially the TAP-IT randomized trial, and reconcile it with guideline recommendations. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and procedural best practices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise decision framework and highlight special scenarios where thoracentesis is clearly indicated or should be avoided.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. In acute decompensated heart failure, pleural effusions are common, often bilateral, and usually transudative; however, I should not assume cardiac etiology without correlating symptoms, signs, and imaging, because exudative effusions and mixed etiologies do occur and can change management [^95283f7c] [^68a42a58] [^bd52c65b]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even in heart failure, a substantial minority of effusions are exudative or have noncardiac contributors, so I need to integrate history, exam, chest radiography, and ultrasound before deciding on thoracentesis [^f12b69b0] [^bd52c65b].

> Next, I should distinguish diagnostic from therapeutic indications. Diagnostic thoracentesis is warranted when the etiology is uncertain, particularly for new, unilateral, or larger-than-minimal effusions in the absence of clinically evident heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney disease that is responding to therapy; this helps exclude infection, malignancy, or pulmonary embolism and guides targeted treatment [^e5255fe6] [^68a42a58]. Therapeutic thoracentesis is appropriate to relieve dyspnea from a sizeable effusion when symptoms persist despite optimal medical therapy; I need to ensure we are not substituting a procedure for inadequate decongestion and guideline-directed medical therapy [^e5255fe6] [^7c59971d].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence for routine therapeutic thoracentesis in heart failure. The TAP-IT randomized trial in patients with acute HFrEF and pleural effusion found that upfront ultrasound-guided pigtail thoracentesis added to standard care did not improve days alive out of the hospital at 90 days, mortality, or length of stay, despite a median drainage of about 1 liter and a low major complication rate of 1% [^07e01014] [^55017a20] [^dc0feb2a]. Wait, let me verify the implications; this argues against routine, upfront therapeutic thoracentesis in this population and reinforces medical decongestion as first-line therapy [^071bae1e] [^7c59971d].

> But wait, what if the effusion is very large or the patient is severely symptomatic despite diuretics. Observational and physiologic data suggest that larger effusions may derive more symptomatic benefit from drainage, and small studies in chronic heart failure outpatients show sustained symptom relief after thoracentesis; however, these are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I should individualize decisions rather than apply a blanket rule [^7c59971d] [^0d2c7cf5]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline positions align with a selective approach; contemporary guidance continues to support therapeutic thoracentesis for symptom relief while discouraging routine diagnostic taps when the clinical picture clearly points to heart failure and no alternative diagnosis is suspected [^e5255fe6] [^68a42a58].

> I need to ensure safety and procedural best practices are addressed. Ultrasound guidance reduces pneumothorax and other complications and is recommended for both diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis; in TAP-IT, the major complication rate was 1% with ultrasound guidance, which is reassuring but not a license to bypass careful selection and technique [^23fa44e5] [^37609452] [^d93c3ef4]. Let me reconsider coagulopathy; recent evidence suggests thoracentesis can be performed safely in many patients with uncorrected coagulopathy, though I should still weigh bleeding risk, operator experience, and effusion characteristics case-by-case rather than reflexively correcting labs or holding anticoagulation [^59666e94] [^cb673efe].

> Next, I should review special scenarios where thoracentesis is clearly indicated. If infection is suspected, particularly in parapneumonic effusion or empyema, I should not delay diagnostic and therapeutic drainage; similarly, if malignancy is a concern, diagnostic thoracentesis with appropriate cytology and biomarkers is warranted to guide oncologic management [^e5255fe6] [^68a42a58]. In undifferentiated effusions where Light's criteria may misclassify transudates as exudates, pleural fluid NT-proBNP can help confirm a cardiac origin and avoid unnecessary invasive testing; however, I should avoid ordering pleural NT-proBNP routinely when serum NT-proBNP is already diagnostic and the pretest probability is high [^559e223e] [^886e2ae1] [^0702370e].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm heart failure as the likely cause using clinical context, imaging, and natriuretic peptides; if the etiology is uncertain or an alternative diagnosis is plausible, proceed to diagnostic thoracentesis. Second, optimize medical decongestion and guideline-directed therapy; if dyspnea persists and a sizeable effusion is present, consider therapeutic thoracentesis for symptom relief. Third, avoid routine upfront thoracentesis in acute HFrEF when the effusion is modest and symptoms are improving with medical therapy, given the neutral results of TAP-IT. Fourth, use ultrasound guidance, assess bleeding risk thoughtfully, and monitor for complications such as pneumothorax or re-expansion edema, especially with large-volume drainage [^e5255fe6] [^07e01014] [^23fa44e5] [^d93c3ef4].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence and guidelines. Routine therapeutic thoracentesis does not improve hard outcomes in acute HFrEF, so it should not be automatic; reserve thoracentesis for diagnostic uncertainty or for significant symptomatic effusions refractory to optimized medical therapy, and always pair it with best-practice procedural technique and vigilant follow-up for response and complications [^07e01014] [^e5255fe6] [^23fa44e5].

---

Therapeutic thoracentesis is indicated in heart failure patients with **large, symptomatic pleural effusions** that cause dyspnea, hypoxemia, or respiratory distress, especially when symptoms persist despite optimal diuretic therapy [^e5255fe6]. It is not routinely indicated for small, asymptomatic effusions or when the effusion is likely transudative from heart failure alone [^68a42a58]. Diagnostic thoracentesis is warranted when the effusion is **unilateral, large, or atypical**, or when infection or malignancy is suspected [^e5255fe6]. Ultrasound guidance is essential to minimize complications, and patients should be monitored for pneumothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and hemodynamic changes [^23fa44e5] [^d93c3ef4].

## Indications for thoracentesis in heart failure

Thoracentesis in heart failure patients is generally categorized as **diagnostic or therapeutic**:

---

### Diagnostic indications

Diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated when the etiology of the effusion is uncertain or when atypical features are present:

- **Unilateral effusions**: Especially if large or new, to exclude alternative diagnoses such as malignancy, infection, or pulmonary embolism [^e5255fe6].

- **Atypical features**: Exudative fluid, bloody effusion, or pleural fluid with unusual characteristics [^e5255fe6].

- **Suspected infection**: Fever, leukocytosis, or clinical suspicion of parapneumonic effusion or empyema [^e5255fe6].

- **Suspected malignancy**: History of cancer, weight loss, or constitutional symptoms [^e5255fe6].

---

### Therapeutic indications

Therapeutic thoracentesis is indicated for **symptom relief** in patients with large, symptomatic effusions:

- **Significant dyspnea or respiratory distress**: Particularly when symptoms persist despite optimal medical therapy, including diuretics and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [^e5255fe6].

- **Large effusions**: Occupying more than one-third of the hemithorax or causing mediastinal shift [^6c733d3f].

- **Refractory effusions**: Recurrent or persistent effusions despite aggressive medical management [^0d2c7cf5].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While thoracentesis is generally safe, certain conditions require caution or procedural modification:

- **Coagulopathy**: INR > 1.5 or platelet count < 50,000/µL. However, recent evidence suggests thoracentesis can be performed safely in patients with uncorrected coagulopathy, with careful technique and ultrasound guidance [^59666e94] [^cb673efe].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Increased risk of pneumothorax, but ultrasound guidance significantly reduces complications [^e46874a2] [^69b40446].

- **Small, loculated effusions**: Higher risk of complications; ultrasound guidance is essential [^e5127e2a].

---

## Procedural considerations and safety

To minimize complications, the following **best practices** are recommended:

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Strongly recommended to reduce pneumothorax and other complications [^23fa44e5] [^37609452].

- **Operator experience**: Experienced operators have lower complication rates [^e46874a2].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for signs of pneumothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and hemodynamic instability during and after the procedure [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Thoracentesis provides immediate symptomatic relief in patients with large, symptomatic effusions. However, it does not address the underlying pathophysiology of heart failure, and effusions frequently recur if the underlying condition is not adequately managed [^7c59971d]. Potential complications include:

- **Pneumothorax**: Occurs in approximately 6% of cases, with chest tube placement required in 2% [^e1e40a6e].

- **Re-expansion pulmonary edema**: Rare but serious complication, particularly after large-volume drainage [^912e3cf0].

- **Bleeding**: Hemothorax or chest wall hematoma, especially in patients with coagulopathy [^912e3cf0].

- **Infection**: Rare but possible, particularly with inadequate sterile technique [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize a **selective approach** to thoracentesis in heart failure patients:

- **Diagnostic thoracentesis**: Recommended for new, unilateral, or atypical effusions, or when infection or malignancy is suspected [^e5255fe6].

- **Therapeutic thoracentesis**: Reserved for symptomatic patients with large effusions refractory to medical therapy [^e5255fe6].

- **Routine thoracentesis**: Not recommended for small, asymptomatic effusions or when the effusion is clearly transudative and attributable to heart failure alone [^68a42a58].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for thoracentesis** |
|-|-|
| Small, asymptomatic, bilateral effusion | No |
| Large, symptomatic effusion refractory to diuretics | Yes (therapeutic) |
| Unilateral or atypical effusion | Yes (diagnostic) |
| Suspected infection or malignancy | Yes (diagnostic) |
| Coagulopathy | Proceed with caution, use ultrasound guidance |

---

Thoracentesis is indicated in heart failure patients with **large, symptomatic pleural effusions** that persist despite optimal medical therapy, or when the effusion is atypical or suspicious for alternative diagnoses. It provides immediate symptom relief but does not address the underlying disease, so recurrence is common without proper heart failure management. Ultrasound guidance and adherence to best practices are essential to minimize complications.

Clinical Perspective

Pleural effusion is present in more than half of patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated heart failure. – For ≈20% of patients, the effusion occupies more than one-third of the hemithorax. Invasive drainage by therapeutic thoracentesis may be used to relieve shortness of breath for patients with sizeable effusions. Thoracentesis provides immediate symptom relief but poses a risk of complications. – No evidence exists from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. Therefore, treatment guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding the indications for or timing of thoracentesis. Thoracentesis is performed at increasing rates, and there is a need for evidence of the effects of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure.TAP-IT (Thoracentesis to Alleviate Cardiac Pleural Effusion–Interventional Trial) investigated the effectiveness of upfront thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy compared with medical treatment alone on patient-relevant outcomes in patients admitted to the hospital with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

Background

TAP-IT (Thoracentesis to Alleviate Cardiac Pleural Effusion-Interventional Trial) investigated the effect of therapeutic thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy in patients with acute heart failure and sizeable pleural effusion.

Methods

This multicenter, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, conducted between August 31, 2021, and March 22, 2024, included patients with acute heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, and non-negligible pleural effusion. Patients with very large effusions (more than two-thirds of the hemithorax) were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to upfront ultrasound-guided pleural pigtail catheter thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy or standard medical therapy alone. The primary outcome was days alive out of the hospital over the following 90 days; key secondary outcomes included length of admission and 90-day all-cause mortality. All outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

A total of 135 patients (median age, 81 years [25th; 75th percentile, 75; 83]; 33% female; median left ventricular ejection fraction, 25% [25th; 75th percentile, 20%; 35%]) were randomized to either thoracentesis (n = 68) or standard medical therapy (n = 67). The thoracentesis group had a median of 84 days (77; 86) alive out of the hospital over the following 90 days compared with 82 days (73; 86) in the control group (P = 0.42). The mortality rate was 13% in both groups, with no difference in survival probability (P = 0.90). There were no differences in the duration of the index admission (control group median, 5 days [3; 8]; thoracentesis group median, 5 days [3; 7], P = 0.69). Major complications occurred in 1% of thoracenteses performed during the study period.

Conclusions

For patients with acute heart failure and pleural effusion, a strategy of upfront routine thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy did not increase days alive out of the hospital for 90 days, all-cause mortality, or duration of index admission. The current findings lay the groundwork for future research to confirm the results.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^4ef97136]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms of acute heart failure were eligible for inclusion if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45% and a non-negligible pleural effusion related to heart failure. No specific quantitative measure of the effusion was required, but the effusion had to be sizable enough for the physician to find drainage by thoracentesis clinically relevant and feasible. A strict definition of size or quantity was not applied because incorporating a quantitative assessment of pleural effusion did not mirror clinical practice at the participating hospitals. Patients were deemed suitable for thoracentesis by the treating physician on the basis of the appearance of the pleural effusion on images available in the clinical setting. Thus, the resulting population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis based on current clinical practice. Patients with new-onset heart failure and patients with acute decompensated chronic heart failure were eligible. A high likelihood of heart failure as the pathogenesis of the effusion was intended. Hence, patients with an LVEF > 45% were not considered for the trial; we considered that pleural effusion in patients with normal ejection fraction was more likely to possibly represent noncardiac pathogeneses. Patients were excluded if one of the following criteria was met: indication for diagnostic thoracentesis, contraindication to thoracentesis, severely impaired hemodynamics or respiratory failure, massive effusion occupying more than two-thirds of the hemithorax, pulmonary or pleural infections, an intrathoracic procedure within 3 months (including thoracentesis), severe aortic stenosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 15 mL·min·1.73 m 2, or dialysis. In addition, patients with a planned or expected admission > 10 days for conditions other than heart failure were excluded. A detailed description of the eligibility criteria is available inand has been reported previously.

Randomization and Blinding

All participants who provided written informed consent were randomly allocated 1:1 to either the thoracentesis group or the control group. The randomization sequence was generated by Internet-based randomization software stratified according to the status of anticoagulant therapy and enrolling site with permuted blocks and block sizes ranging from 2 to 4 patients. Neither the participants, the treating physicians, nor the investigators were blinded to treatment allocation.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^04951c78]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

TAP-IT is the first RCT to investigate the effectiveness of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. In patients admitted to the hospital with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and pleural effusion, a strategy of referral to routine thoracentesis did not increase the number of days the participants were alive and out of the hospital in the following 90 days. Thoracentesis was safe, with a rate of major complications of 1%, consistent with previous reports. Greater than expected variation in the primary outcome may limit the statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes. However, the current findings lay the groundwork for future research to confirm the results and further clarify the potential role of thoracentesis for patients with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^e5255fe6]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to diagnostic thoracentesis, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to perform diagnostic thoracentesis for new-onset, unilateral, and larger than minimal pleural effusions in the absence of clinically evident HF, cirrhosis, or kidney failure appropriately responsive to therapy. Perform therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms.

Limitations

The study has limitations. Unblinded interventional trials carry a risk of bias, and the primary outcome measure should be chosen carefully. The primary outcome in TAP-IT, DAOH for 90 days, is clinically relevant and reasonably unbiased. Still, we cannot rule out that the unblinded nature of the trial could have affected the physician's incentive to discharge or to readmit. Furthermore, there is a risk of bias in patient-reported outcomes with overestimation of the effect of the intervention. Patient-reported quality of life is subject to survivor bias and attrition bias resulting from survey nonresponse, which primarily occurs in participants with compromised health status. In a frail study population with a high cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disease burden, this is a potential risk. We observed a greater variation in the primary outcome than anticipated, which reduced our statistical power to detect smaller or moderate differences between the groups, likely decreasing the statistical power from the expected 90%.

We do not have data on the completeness of decongestion or drainage; no protocolized decongestion assessment was used, and control imaging to assess the effect of decongestive treatment or thoracentesis is not performed routinely unless complications to thoracentesis are suspected. The median volume drained in TAP-IT was comparable to previous observational data, in which thoracentesis was associated with long-lasting symptom relief in stable outpatients with diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure and moderate to severe pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed within a median of 22 hours, which was as expected, because half of the participants received anticoagulant therapy requiring a pause for up to 2 days before the procedure; in exploratory subgroup analysis, we found no numeric trend toward reduction in the length of the index admission in participants not on anticoagulant therapy. In a pragmatic trial, the results reflect not only the procedure but also the logistics around it at the participating sites. However, the volume drained by thoracentesis and the time to procedure reasonably represent what is experienced in the clinical setting. In addition, the results from this sample population may not be extrapolated to a younger population with heart failure as single morbidity, and the limited sample size does not allow conclusions based on subgroup analysis, including sex differences.

Intervention

In the intention-to-treat population, the median time from randomization to thoracentesis (n = 59) was 22 hours (3; 31; minimum 0 to maximum 97 hours). The subgroup of 29 participants who received anticoagulant therapy waited a median of 30 hours (22; 48) before the procedure. By thoracentesis, a median of 1062 mL pleural effusion (700; 1744; minimum 150 to maximum 6200 mL) was drained, and 68% of the intervention group (46 out of 68) had > 500 mL drained. In the thoracentesis group, 2 participants were not referred and planned for thoracentesis and were classified as crossovers according to the study protocol and statistical analysis plan. In adherence with the protocol, 7 participants (10%) in the thoracentesis group did not undergo the procedure because the performing physician did not find an effusion large enough for safe catheter placement. This group waited a median of 48 hours (32; 59); only 3 were on anticoagulant therapy. Five participants (8%) in the control group underwent thoracentesis (one had 2 procedures attributable to complications) during the index admission because they developed an indication for a diagnostic puncture, experienced clinical deterioration, or had an insufficient treatment response after 5 days. All were in adherence to the protocol. This ultimately resulted in an as-treated population of 64 participants (47%) having thoracentesis performed and 71 (53%) treated with standard pharmacological therapy only during the index admission (Figure 1). Detailed descriptions of the indications or reasons for refraining from thoracentesis are listed in.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^68a42a58]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

Key Secondary Outcomes

The median duration of the index admission was 5 days in both groups (control group, 5 days [3; 8]; thoracentesis group, 5 days [3; 7]; Mann-Whitney parameter, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.39–0.58]; P = 0.69; Table 2). The 90-day all-cause mortality rate was 13% (9 patients in each group), with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% (2 patients in each group) and no difference in survival probability between the 2 groups (P = 0.90; Table 2 and Figure 3 A). In the thoracentesis group, 28 patients (41%) experienced all-cause hospitalization during the following 90 days compared with 28 (42%) in the control group (P = 0.99), and the cumulative risk of first all-cause hospitalization or all-cause death was similar in the groups (P > 0.99; Figure 3 B). The median number of days alive and not hospitalized because of heart failure was also similar between the groups (thoracentesis group, 85 [84; 87]; control group, 84 [80; 86]; Mann-Whitney parameter, 0.57 [95% CI 0.47–0.66]; P = 0.16).

Results across the primary and main secondary outcomes were similar in the as-treated population and the prespecified subgroup of participants with and without anticoagulant therapy. Similar results were found in post hoc subgroup analysis in participants with acutely decompensated chronic heart failure or new-onset heart failure and in participants classified as having large pleural effusion (n = 76 [56%]) or a small or medium pleural effusion (n = 54 [40%]) based on a semiquantitative evaluation.

Discussion

In this RCT of therapeutic thoracentesis in patients admitted to the hospital with acute heart failure with reduced LVEF and pleural effusion, a strategy of upfront thoracentesis did not increase DAOH in the following 90 days, or reduce the length of the index admission, the survival probability, or quality of life. Participants experienced minor complications or discomfort during or after the procedure in 25% of the total thoracenteses performed in the study period. Thoracentesis was safe, with a rate of serious complications of 1%, consistent with previous reports. –

No other randomized or controlled trials have assessed the effect of thoracentesis in patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced LVEF and pleural effusion.

Our overall outcomes for the combined cohort align with results from observational and randomized trials of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Previous smaller observational studies in patients with chronic heart failure undergoing thoracentesis (32 and 86 patients) have reported high 30-day mortality rates, ranging from 9% to 22%. The observed 13% 90-day all-cause mortality rate in TAP-IT was similar to the 12% to 15% reported in a recent RCT evaluating the addition of acetazolamide to loop diuretic therapy in acute heart failure. The observed KCCQ overall summary score 14 days after discharge was comparable with previous reports in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 1 week after hospitalization for worsening heart failure. One observational study has reported improved quality of life associated with a reduction in pleural effusion measured by ultrasound in a small series of outpatients with heart failure receiving medical therapy. Our observed mean KCCQ overall summary score on day 14 is ≈20 points higher than that reported during admission for acute heart failure; however, the trajectory of health status measured by KCCQ shows a quick rebound after heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Safety Outcomes and Complications Attributable to Thoracentesis

Ten participants (7%) experienced a severe complication during the index admission (fall, pharmacologically treated delirium, nosocomial infection, or dehydration/electrolyte imbalance), with comparable rates between groups (details are available in).

During the trial period, 80 thoracenteses were performed in the study population. Control imaging was not protocolized but based on normal clinical practice and the individual physician's evaluation of the participant. An overview of the total complication rates and stratified by treatment group is presented in Table 3. Pneumothorax occurred in 4 out of 80 procedures (5%). Three were treated conservatively. One pneumothorax required intervention with a surgical drain and was classified as a serious adverse event. No major bleeding (hemothorax), organ laceration, intrapleural infection, or reexpansion pulmonary edema was observed, resulting in an overall rate of major complications of 1 out of 80 procedures (1%). However, in 20 out of the 80 thoracenteses (25%), participants experienced minor complications or discomfort during or after the procedure, resulting in an overall complication rate of 26% (21 out of 80).

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^f09aec66]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention, Comparator, and Follow-Up

The control group received standard medical therapy, with the treating physician determining the dose of diuretics and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). The thoracentesis group was referred to upfront thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy. Thoracentesis was performed according to local practices, including any required interruption of anticoagulant therapy. The standard procedure was ultrasound-guided insertion of an intercostal small-bore pigtail catheter, usually 5–8 French, and passive drainage over a few hours. In patients with bilateral non-negligible pleural effusion, bilateral thoracentesis could be performed at the discretion of the treating physician. To ensure the safety of the participants in the control group, thoracentesis was allowed in patients who developed an indication for diagnostic thoracentesis or whose condition deteriorated to a state during which an exclusion criterion was fulfilled. Participants in the control group with diuretic-resistant pleural effusion with no response to pharmacological therapy by day 5 could be referred to thoracentesis. Clinical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging, including echocardiography during the index admission, were performed according to the standard of care of each department, and participants were discharged when deemed appropriate by the treating physician. There were no trial-related follow-up visits. During the 90-day follow-up period, participants were contacted on day 14 after discharge to arrange questionnaire follow-up by telephone, mail, or email, depending on participant preference. On day 14 after discharge, participants were given the 23-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and selected questions from the Questions About Acute Hospitalisation survey used in the annual Danish National Survey of Patient Experiences. The KCCQ was repeated on day 90. All other baseline and outcome data were collected from the participants' electronic health records and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the Capital Region of Denmark.

Results

Population

Between August 31, 2021, and December 22, 2023, we assessed 255 patients for eligibility, and 136 were randomly assigned to the thoracentesis (n = 69 [51%]) or control group (n = 67 [49%]; Figure 1). The investigators retracted 1 participant allocated to the intervention group from the study shortly after randomization because the informed consent was deemed invalid. This resulted in a total study population of 135 participants: 68 (50%) in the thoracentesis group and 67 (50%) in the control group. The last participant completed the 90-day follow-up on March 22, 2024. The groups were comparable across baseline characteristics (Table 1). Participants had a median of 81 years of age (75; 84) and 33% were women. Participants had symptoms and signs of decompensated heart failure, a median LVEF of 25% (20; 35) and a median NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide) level of 5899 pg/mL (3649; 10 997). Overall, 53% (n = 72) presented with new-onset heart failure, and 49% (n = 66) received anticoagulation therapy. Participants were randomized at a median of 21 hours (14; 35) after admission. Most participants had multiple images by different modalities performed as part of their diagnostic workup before randomization. Computed tomographic scan results were available in 30 (22%), ultrasound results in 62 (46%), and chest X-rays were performed in 113 (84%). Pleural effusion was bilateral in 73% (n = 99).

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^7c59971d]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several possible explanations for the neutral outcome of TAP-IT. The population was elderly, with substantial comorbidities and frailty, which may partly explain the lack of effect of thoracentesis on DAOH. In fact, the 90-day all-cause hospitalization rate was 41%, with heart failure–related hospitalizations accounting for only 14% of the total rehospitalizations. Other trials on decongestive strategies and treatment have shown an effect on short-term outcome measures, such as congestion scores and responses to diuretics, but no effect on rehospitalization, mortality, or length of hospital stay. The potential benefits of thoracentesis could have been reduced if the effusions were too small. Observational studies on the impact of thoracentesis by effusion size in patients with heart failure are small and have shown conflicting results. One study (n = 10) indicated that symptom relief was more common in patients with effusions > 1000 mL, whereas others have found symptom relief and improvement in oxygenation regardless of the volume drained. In TAP-IT, a pragmatic trial, the population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis on the basis of current clinical practice. The result of TAP-IT reveals that the current population considered for thoracentesis does not seem to benefit from routine referral to thoracentesis and that the efficacy of the procedure in pleural effusion related to heart failure warrants investigation in more selective populations, perhaps on the basis of persisting symptoms, larger effusion volumes, or low tolerance of diuretics or GDMT.

Pleural effusion related to heart failure is associated with increased filling pressures, with a dose–response relationship between increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure and the size of pleural effusion. Hence, reducing filling pressures should be the primary treatment target. A likely explanation for the lack of benefit from thoracentesis is that the intervention does not target the increased filling pressures responsible for the pleural effusion. Indeed, in TAP-IT, both groups received similar decongestive therapy and GDMT and demonstrated similar clinical outcomes. This underscores the importance of attention to goal-directed decongestion and fast implementation of GDMT to improve prognosis in patients hospitalized with heart failure.

### Treatment options for patients with recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to heart failure [^0d2c7cf5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are a common finding in the nearly six million Americans diagnosed with heart failure. This review focuses on the historical, present and potential future trends in the management of such benign pleural effusions.

Recent Findings

The management of symptomatic pleural effusions, in general, and in heart failure, specifically, has evolved in the last two decades. With more options, the treatment is often individualized for patients. Newer forms of therapy are also less invasive, resulting in less procedural morbidity, recuperation and cost.

Summary

The majority of patients with a pleural effusion resulting from heart failure will resolve their symptoms with medical therapy. Patients who experience symptoms from reaccumulation of their effusion have a selection of treatment options that can be individualized based on the patient's prognosis, functional status, need for future intervention and desires.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^1dd1d781]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria. If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^2aa95d99]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of days alive out of the hospital (DAOH) in the 90 days after randomization. Hospitalization was defined as lasting across a change in calendar date. Key secondary outcomes were index admission length, all-cause mortality, and time to first all-cause hospitalization or all-cause death. The number of days alive and not hospitalized because of heart failure during 90 days was added as a secondary outcome after the trial commenced. Heart failure–related hospitalization was defined according to the recommendations from the Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials Initiative. Patient-reported secondary outcomes were quality of life measured by the KCCQ overall summary score on days 14 and 90 and each participant's overall satisfaction with the treatment and care during the index admission. Key safety outcomes were the number of severe and common complications of thoracentesis, including thromboembolic events within 30 days, because anticoagulant therapy for some participants was paused before thoracentesis.

### The evaluation of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure [^da3196ac]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the causes of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure, and the association of the characteristics of these statistics with the use of diuretics.

Subjects and Methods

Eighty-one patients with a definite diagnosis of heart failure who underwent thoracentesis were evaluated. Fluids were classified as transudates or exudates using Light's criteria.

Results

Forty-one effusions (in 34 patients) were transudates, and 54 (in 47 patients) were exudates. A specific cause was found for 32 of the exudates (27 patients); except for heart failure, no obvious cause was found for the remaining 22 fluids (20 patients). Exudates with a specific cause for an exudate were more likely to have at least two of Light's criteria (18 of 27 [67%]) than did exudates without a known cause (2 of 21 [10%]). Intravenous diuretic therapy in the 24 hours before thoracentesis was significantly more common among patients with exudates without a specific cause.

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure may have exudative pleural effusions without an obvious cause except heart failure.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^886e2ae1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is difficult to suggest a threshold level for pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP since the studies used varying threshold levels. The average pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP level in the studies was 6140 pg/mL. Six of the studies used a threshold level between 1457 to 1714 pg/mL (sensitivity and specificity for a threshold level of 1457 pg/mL by ROC analysis in the study by Bayram et al was 84% and 98%, respectively). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of these six studies is 95% (95% CI: 91–98) and 95% (95% CI: 89–98), respectively, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 370 (95% CI: 101–1351). As a result, a threshold level of approximately ≥ 1500 pg/mL provides very good diagnostic accuracy for pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP.

The utility of NT-pro-BNP for the diagnosis of pleural effusions of cardiac origin can be applied to several clinical situations. First, if the pre-test probability of a pleural effusion due to heart failure is high and alternative diagnoses are less likely, then a thoracentesis can be avoided and an elevated serum NT-pro-BNP level will be diagnostic for a cardiac origin of the pleural effusion. Second, if the pre-test probability of a pleural effusion due to heart failure is low or alternative diagnoses are considered in addition to heart failure, then a thoracentesis should be performed and if the pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP level is high then this would be diagnostic of heart failure as one potential cause for the pleural effusion. Furthermore, in undiagnosed pleural effusions, for example when Light's criteria misclassify transudative CHF effusions as exudates and the pre-test probability is equivocal for CHF, a high pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP would also be diagnostic.

### Pleural effusions in the intensive care unit [^a989d76f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of pleural effusions in the intensive care unit varies depending on the screening methods, from approximately 8% for physical examination to more than 60% for routine ultrasonography. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of pleural effusions in intensive care unit patients: large amounts of intravenous fluid are often administered, pneumonia is common, and heart failure, atelectasis, extravascular catheter migration, hypoalbuminemia, or liver disease are present in many intensive care unit patients. In surgical intensive care units, cardiac or abdominal surgery is often followed by pleural effusions, and in trauma patients, hemothorax is a dreaded event. Because no clinical parameter excludes pleural infection, and because of the impact of thoracentesis on diagnosis and treatment, this procedure should be performed unless contraindicated. Thoracentesis is safe in mechanically ventilated patients. The author discusses the following points regarding pleural effusions in the intensive care unit: screening intensive care unit patients for pleural effusion, safety of thoracentesis in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, distinguishing exudates from transudates, and diagnosing and managing infected pleural effusions in critically ill patients. Lastly, the author suggests a research agenda for pleural effusions in intensive care unit patients.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^5a883655]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion (PLEFF), mostly caused by volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection, is a common condition in critical care patients. Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) helps clinicians not only to visualize pleural effusion, but also to distinguish between the different types. Furthermore, TUS is essential during thoracentesis and chest tube drainage as it increases safety and decreases life-threatening complications. It is crucial not only during needle or tube drainage insertion, but also to monitor the volume of the drained PLEFF. Moreover, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with a higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without the need for X-ray exposure. We review data regarding the diagnosis and management of pleural effusion, paying particular attention to the impact of ultrasound. Technical data concerning thoracentesis and chest tube drainage are also provided.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d4cf3d84]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The quality of the studies was generally good overall. The main limitations of the studies were the possibility of spectrum bias, review bias, and population bias. Spectrum bias refers to distortions in a diagnostic test's performance caused by a distortion in the study population. Testing is not done across a population with the expected distribution of disease severity, but rather limited subsets. In our meta-analysis, five studies acquired their study population by selecting CHF patients and patients with pleural effusions of non-cardiac origin (control group). The presence of spectrum bias can lead to an overestimation of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Review bias refers to a situation where persons interpreting the index test have knowledge of the reference standard or vice versa, when persons interpreting the reference standard have knowledge of the index test. In our meta-analysis, it was very unclear whether this did or did not occur because the majority of the studies did not report whether blinding during testing was done. Again, this may have lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic performance of the test. Finally, population bias refers to the generalizability of the diagnostic test to a wider population. The studies included in our meta-analysis had poor reporting of any co-morbid conditions within the CHF-associated pleural effusion group thus potentially limiting generalizability. Furthermore, a thoracentesis in patients with a high pre-test probability for a cardiac origin of the pleural effusion with low probability for other causes would not usually be indicated in most clinical scenarios thus further limiting the generalizability of these results.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^4090e797]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Diagnoses made on pleural biopsy

The 44.3% of patients with malignant pleuritis is in the range of other studies (60.0%, 54.0%, 44.2%, 36.6%). Of course this also depends on previous diagnostic work up before thoracoscopy (eg, imaging, number of thoracentesis, closed pleural biopsy), but also on your patient population, and if the data were collected in TB-endemic countries. We have a higher percentage of nonspecific pleuritis compared with these other studies, and lower percentage of other benign conditions. We however have no empyema, haemothorax nor heart failure, which is prevalent in some other studies. Neither do we have (clinical) probable diagnoses, but only certain diagnoses, and we categorised all these uncertain diagnoses as nonspecific pleuritis.

### Does this patient have an exudative pleural effusion? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^e1e40a6e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1–250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8–46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5–38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein > 0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06–5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### Every second counts: signs of a failing heart on thoracic CT in the ED [^0ae890b4]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Impending cardiac failure is often difficult to recognize and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Upon arrival in the emergency department, patients are promptly screened for potentially life-threatening conditions through a history and physical examination. In many cases, the diagnosis is not clear until confirmatory laboratory or imaging tests are performed. Unfortunately, patients can rapidly decompensate as this diagnostic information is being obtained. Emergent CT plays a key role in identifying conditions that may result in cardiovascular collapse, including severe congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, and impending cardiac failure. Characteristic imaging findings can prompt the physician to take immediate action and prepare for resuscitation.

### Thoracic ultrasound for pleural effusion in the intensive care unit: a narrative review from diagnosis to treatment [^b6e3f1f2]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several medical conditions are responsible for pleural effusion (PLEFF), with volume overload, congestive heart failure, and pleuropulmonary infection representing the most common causes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fluid accumulation can take place due to an imbalance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the lung capillaries, increased pleural membrane capillary permeability, and lymphatic obstruction. Furthermore, the factors known to promote lung edema formation in the clinical setting (fluid loading, myocardial depression, hypoalbuminemia) usually coexist, and may exceed the normally high absorptive capacity of the lungs and parietal pleural lymphatics, resulting in exacerbation of PLEFF.

PLEFF occurs frequently in ICU patients with an incidence that varies according to the diagnostic technique used (from 8% following physical examination to more than 60% after routine imaging). It is also associated with a high crude mortality rate. Indeed, PLEFF can worsen gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory dynamics. Drainage can improve oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and compliance by enhancing the ventilation:perfusion ratio and by re-expanding areas of collapsed parenchymal lung. Although percutaneous pleural drain insertion is frequently carried out in the ICU, inaccurate insertion of the tube can have tragic consequences. Complications with the insertion of chest drains have been reported in up to 20–30% of cases; some of these complications can be potentially fatal (i.e. perforation of the lung, heart, liver, esophagus, spleen, and inferior vena cava).

Prompt diagnosis of the presence and nature of PLEFF is vital in order to evaluate the best therapeutic choice (diuretics, invasive procedures). The use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS), a safe and non-invasive bedside procedure with good accuracy, can help clinicians to visualize the effusion and also to distinguish between different types (exudative, transudative empyema, hemothorax). Moreover, TUS is important during thoracentesis and the insertion of chest drains as it helps increase safety and decrease life-threatening complications (e.g. organ laceration and infection). It is fundamental not only during needle or drainage insertion, but also when monitoring the volume of PLEFF drained, and deciding when to remove the drainage tube. Furthermore, TUS can help diagnose co-existing lung diseases, often with higher specificity and sensitivity than chest radiography and without X-ray exposure. Consequently, TUS has become an essential skill for many specialists, especially intensivists.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^293e2ae3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

ACC/AHA heart failure data elements — chest radiography defines the data element as "Documented findings from the radiological examination of the chest", with permissible values including "Pulmonary vascular redistribution, pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema", "Cardiomegaly, chamber enlargement", "Pleural effusion(s)", and "No abnormalities related to HF". Pulmonary edema is defined as "Accumulation of fluid in the lung tissues causing disturbance of the gas exchange that may lead to respiratory failure. It is caused by direct injury to the lung parenchyma or congestive HF". Cardiomegaly/chamber enlargement is "Abnormal enlargement of the heart", and pleural effusion(s) are described as "Increased amounts of fluid within the pleural cavity. Symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. It is usually caused by lung infections, congestive HF; pleural and lung tumors, connective tissue disorders, and trauma".

Chest radiographs in acute chest pain — chest radiographs are rapid, noninvasive tests that can be used to screen for several disorders that may present with chest pain, and the yield of chest radiography depends on the pretest probability and will thus be higher when history or physical examination point to a greater likelihood of a given diagnosis. However, chest radiographs often do not lead to a diagnosis that requires intervention, and their use should be guided by clinical suspicion. The AHA/ACC guidelines for NSTE-ACS and heart failure all recommend chest radiographs on presentation, although this should not delay urgent revascularization if it is indicated. In patients with acute chest pain and heart failure, chest radiographs are useful to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion, as well as identifying potential pulmonary causes that may have contributed to symptoms, and may demonstrate a widened mediastinum in patients with aortic dissection, although they are not sensitive enough in this setting to rule out the diagnosis. Chest radiographs may be most useful to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary, or other conditions that may cause symptoms, including pneumonia, pneumothorax, or rib fractures; pleural effusions, pulmonary artery enlargement, and infiltrates may suggest PE, which would need to be confirmed by further testing.

### Etiologies of bilateral pleural effusions [^7f3935ba]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

To evaluate the safety, etiology and outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral thoracentesis.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral thoracenteses in an academic medical center from July 2009 through November 2010. Pleural fluid characteristics and etiologies of the effusions were assessed. Mean differences in levels of fluid characteristics between right and left lungs were tested. Associations between fluid characteristics and occurrence of bilateral malignant effusions were evaluated. The rate of pneumothorax and other complications subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis was determined.

Results

Exudates were more common than transudates, and most effusions had multiple etiologies, with 83% having two or more etiologies. Bilateral malignant effusions occurred in 19 patients, were the most common single etiology of exudative effusions, and were associated with higher levels of protein and LDH in the pleural fluid. Among 200 thoracenteses performed with a bilateral procedure, seven resulted in pneumothoraces, three of which required chest tube drainage and four were ex vacuo.

Conclusions

More often than not, there are multiple etiologies that contribute to pleural fluid formation, and of the combinations of etiologies observed congestive heart failure was the most frequent contributor. Exudative effusions are more common than transudates when bilateral effusions are present. Malignancy is a common etiology of exudative effusions. This study suggests that the overall complication rate following bilateral thoracentesis is low and the rate of pneumothorax subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis is comparable to unilateral thoracentesis.

### Uniportal VATS pleural biopsy in the diagnosis of exudative pleural effusion: awake or intubated? [^5a03229b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions may develop in many different conditions and the most common causes in developed countries are congestive heart failure, pneumonia and malignancy, respectively. It is estimated that 1.5 million patients suffer from pleural effusion per year. To determine the etiology of pleural fluid, firstly, biochemical, cytological and microbiological analysis of the fluid is required by thoracentesis; however, this procedure allows diagnosis in only about 75–60% of cases. The second step diagnostic procedure in negative pleural effusions of unknown causes is conventional 'blind' pleural biopsy, i.e. non-image guided pleural biopsy. This procedure is inexpensive, easy to apply and still used in many institutions. The use of 'blind' pleural biopsy increases the diagnostic efficiency of malignant pleural fluid cytology by 7–27%. However, 20–40% of patients with exudative pleural effusion cannot be diagnosed by recurrent thoracentesis and 'blind' pleural biopsy. Image guided (computed tomography or ultrasound) pleural biopsy has been shown to have a diagnostic efficiency of 76–85% in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions.

### Outcomes of thoracentesis for acute heart failure in hospitals [^4364722d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Data on in-hospital outcomes for hospitalizations undergoing thoracentesis (THR) for any cause has been conflicting. For hospitalizations with acute heart failure (HF), however, to date, no study has evaluated the outcomes of THR. Accordingly, our current study addresses this knowledge gap. We analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005–14). The study population included all adults (> 18 years) with the principal discharge diagnosis of HF and the presence of procedure code for THR. Hospitalizations with pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and co-morbidities such as malignancy, lymphoma, liver disease, end-stage renal disease, metastatic disease, and tuberculosis were excluded. Propensity matching was performed to identify a similar cohort of admissions that did not undergo THR. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality and length of hospitalization. During the study period, 2,251,927 hospitalizations for HF were found from the database; of which, 70,823 (3.14%) had THR. After propensity matching, a matched cohort of 70,785 hospitalizations for HF was identified. In-hospital mortality was higher for those who underwent THR (2.5% vs 1.6%; p < 0.001). In-hospital complications and procedures including cardiac arrest, sepsis, pneumothorax and hemothorax were more frequent in the THR group. Those who underwent THR had a longer mean length of stay (6.9 vs 4.5 days; p < 0.01) and higher cost of hospitalization ($13,448 vs $ 8940; p < 0.01). The trend analysis demonstrated a steady increase in the performance of THR in hospitalized HF between 2005 and 2014. In conclusion, THR performed during HF hospitalizations were associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality, complications and increased healthcare utilization in the form of longer length of stay and higher costs.

### Exudative effusions in congestive heart failure [^f12b69b0]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pleural effusions due to congestive heart failure (CHF) typically are transudates, but an occasional patient with CHF is found to have an exudate in the absence of an apparent cause other than CHF. We sought to determine the incidence and clinical significance of such exudative effusions.

Design

Patients with CHF and effusions seen during the 7-year period from January 1994 through December 2000 were identified from their hospital discharge diagnoses and radiographs, while those who had undergone thoracentesis were identified from a review of the laboratory logs. The presenting symptoms and clinical course were determined from a review of the medical records. The effect of RBC contamination on pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels was determined by measuring the LDH activity of mock pleural fluid containing known amounts of RBC.

Results

Seven hundred seventy patients had CHF with an effusion, but only 175 patients underwent a thoracentesis. In this select group, 86 patients had transudates and 89 had exudates. A noncardiac cause for the exudate was readily identified in 59 patients by hospital discharge, and 7 more patients had an etiology found during follow-up. Eleven of the remaining 23 patients had undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery ≥ 1 year prior to presentation, and 50% of the effusions in patients who had undergone CABG surgery were exudates. Thus, CHF-related exudates were identified in only 12 patients, and in 4 of these patients the exudates could be explained by RBC contamination of the pleural fluid. The clinical presentation of patients with CHF-associated exudates was similar to that of CHF patients with transudates.

Conclusion

In most patients who have CHF and an exudative effusion, there is a noncardiac cause for the pleural effusion. The high frequency of exudates in patients with a history of CABG indicates a persistent impairment in lymphatic clearance from the pleural cavity. Exudative effusions due solely to CHF are rare.

### Bed side thoracentesis among non-ventilated patients with… [^3fee32a6]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Only one study found sustained effect of thoracentesis on oxygenation among 10 patients on mechanical ventilation. Lung function was found to improve after TC among patients with paradoxical movement of hemidiaphragm, and relief of dyspnea after large pleural effusion TC was demonstrated as well. No study to date, as the investigators know, on the benefit of TC, was done on non-ventilated, ward patients with moderate to large pleural effusion. Also, no studies to date showed any improved clinical outcome of this procedure. Although ultrasound guided TC is a safer mode than blinded TC, complications as pneumothorax, pain, shortness of breath, cough, bleeding, hematoma, and re-expansion pulmonary edema may result from TC. Although no consensus exist regarding the benefit of TC still this procedure is common among ventilated and non-ventilated patients.

The investigators seek to find whether there is clinical benefit for TC, among non-ventilated, ward patients with moderate to large pleural effusion. For this purpose the investigators aim to conduct a prospective randomized trial. In this study the investigators aim to compare outcomes as: hospital length of stay, vital signs and wellbeing, utilization of imaging modalities and readmission rates among patients who had therapeutic TC compared to those who had not. Also the investigators would like to try and predict the amount of pleural effusion from the ultrasound imaging as well as to find the added value of point of care US screening of pleural effusion on top of routine Xr among patients with respiratory instability.

### Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with pleural effusions: preliminary observations [^cf0803fa]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To address the value of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations as a diagnostic tool for determining the cardiac etiology of pleural effusions, and to determine possible differences of plasma BNP concentrations before and after pleurocentesis in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Consecutive series of 64 patients with indications for diagnostic pleurocentesis. The final diagnosis of the underlying disease was assessed by clinical criteria. Seven patients were excluded due to pleural effusions of equivocal origin or due to obvious hemothorax secondary to trauma.

Intervention

Pleurocentesis attempting to drain effusions dry. Plasma BNP concentrations were measured directly before pleurocentesis and 24 h after the intervention. During these 24 h, the dosages of patients' medications were held constant.

Measurements and Results

In distinguishing between patients with pleural effusions caused by CHF (n = 31) and patients with pleural effusions attributable to other causes (n = 26), the area under the curve was 0.974 (SE, 0.021; 95% confidence interval, 0.892 to 0.997) for plasma BNP. A BNP cutoff concentration of 2,201 ng/L had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 100% in the diagnosis of CHF. The median plasma BNP concentrations in patients with pleural effusions caused by CHF (n = 31) did not change within 24 h after pleurocentesis compared with the concentrations obtained before the procedure (before pleurocentesis, 3,227 ng/L; 24 h after pleurocentesis, 2,759 ng/L; p = 0.189), despite a median removal of 1,100 mL pleural fluid.

Conclusions

Plasma BNP concentrations of patients with pleural effusions of unknown origin may be an aid in the diagnosis of CHF as the underlying cause. If plasma BNP is used as a surrogate marker of global cardiac function, there is no indication of hemodynamic improvement caused by pleurocentesis alone in patients with CHF and pleural effusions.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® workup of pleural effusion or pleural disease [^d6f78c29]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusions are categorized as transudative or exudative, with transudative effusions usually reflecting the sequala of a systemic etiology and exudative effusions usually resulting from a process localized to the pleura. Common causes of transudative pleural effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure, whereas exudative effusions are typically due to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. This document summarizes appropriateness guidelines for imaging in four common clinical scenarios in patients with known or suspected pleural effusion or pleural disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^6ed4210f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pleural effusion is a common presentation, originating from a wide range of disorders, including congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia and cancer. The cause of a pleural effusion frequently remains unclear after thoracentesis. Light's criteria are used to help differentiate exudates from transudates by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the pleural fluid and the serum, and algorithms for the investigation of exudative pleural effusion have been developed. Nonetheless, the cause of exudative effusion remains uncertain in a substantial percentage of patients with lymphocytic pleural effusion after extensive examinations including thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Approximately 30% of cases of exudative pleural effusion are reported to be diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, that is no specific diagnosis, even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopy, and 12–15% of nonspecific pleuritis are ultimately diagnosed with pleural malignancy after a mean interval between thoracoscopy and the final diagnosis of 4.4–9.8 months. Therefore, 12–16 months of follow-up is suggested following thoracoscopy for patients with nonspecific pleuritis to exclude malignancy; however, unexplained pleural effusions often present a management dilemma for clinicians because of ongoing uncertainty about the possibility of a false-negative result from sampling error. In addition, the clinical course of such pleural effusions varies, for example resolving, persistent and progressive. Hence, new approaches are needed to detect their causes. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibroinflammatory disorder of uncertain cause that affects various organs including the pleura. Several lines of evidence indicate that IgG4-RD accounts for a proportion of patients with pleural effusions of idiopathic cause.

### Complications of thoracentesis: incidence, risk factors, and strategies for prevention [^912e3cf0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although thoracentesis is generally considered safe, procedural complications are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In this article, we review the risk factors and prevention of the most common complications of thoracentesis including pneumothorax, bleeding (chest wall hematoma and hemothorax), and re-expansion pulmonary edema.

Recent Findings

Recent data support the importance of operator expertise and the use of ultrasound in reducing the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Although coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications have traditionally been viewed as contraindications to thoracentesis, new evidence suggests that patients may be able to safely undergo thoracentesis without treating their bleeding risk. Re-expansion pulmonary edema, a rare complication of thoracentesis, is felt to result in part from the generation of excessively negative pleural pressure. When and how to monitor changes in pleural pressure during thoracentesis remains a focus of ongoing study.

Summary

Major complications of thoracentesis are uncommon. Clinician awareness of risk factors for procedural complications and familiarity with strategies that improve outcomes are essential components for safely performing thoracentesis.

### Safe and effective bedside thoracentesis: a review of the evidence for practicing clinicians [^15a6805d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians often care for patients with pleural effusion, a condition that requires thoracentesis for evaluation and treatment. We aim to identify the most recent advances related to safe and effective performance of thoracentesis.

Methods

We performed a narrative review with a systematic search of the literature. Two authors independently reviewed search results and selected studies based on relevance to thoracentesis; disagreements were resolved by consensus. Articles were categorized as those related to the pre-, intra- and postprocedural aspects of thoracentesis.

Results

Sixty relevant studies were identified and included. Pre-procedural topics included methods for physician training and maintenance of skills, such as simulation with direct observation. Additionally, pre-procedural topics included the finding that moderate coagulopathies (international normalized ratio less than 3 or a platelet count greater than 25,000/μL) and mechanical ventilation did not increase risk of postprocedural complications. Intraprocedurally, ultrasound use was associated with lower risk of pneumothorax, while pleural manometry can identify a nonexpanding lung and may help reduce risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema. Postprocedurally, studies indicate that routine chest X-ray is unwarranted, because bedside ultrasound can identify pneumothorax.

Conclusions

While the performance of thoracentesis is not without risk, clinicians can incorporate recent advances into practice to mitigate patient harm and improve effectiveness. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2017;12:266–276.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^337d6088]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion and Conclusion

Pleural effusions are relatively common in medical practice. It is estimated that the annual incidence of pleural effusions in the United States (US) is 1.5 million cases. The most common cause of pleural effusions is CHF with an estimated incidence of 500,000 cases in the US per year. Identifying the underlying etiology of pleural effusions requires a combination of strategies including clinical history, pleural fluid analysis, and potentially more invasive procedures such as pleural tissue biopsy. Clinical history is very important in the diagnosis of pleural effusions from a cardiac origin. However, alone, it does not appear to be very accurate. Romero-Candeira et al studied 64 patients with transudative pleural effusions of which 44 were due to CHF and showed that in 40% of cases initial clinical history failed to correctly classify the effusion. Pleural fluid analysis using Light's criteria is better than clinical history for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin however these criteria misclassify transudates as exudative effusions approximately 25% of the time, mainly related to the use of diuretics. Misclassification of transudates to exudates can lead to inappropriate management or potentially more invasive diagnostic investigations resulting in increased morbidity and health care costs. As a result, tests with higher diagnostic accuracy may prove beneficial in terms of reducing morbidity and improving cost-efficiency for diagnosing pleural effusions of cardiac origin.

In the last decade several studies have been reported assessing the diagnostic utility of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP in pleural effusions of cardiac origin. To summarize these studies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included ten studies, of which seven were from Europe, with a total of 1120 patients and/or pleural effusions. We showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity were identical (94% [95% CI: 90–97] and 94% [95% CI: 89–97]) with a diagnostic odds ratio of 246 (95% CI: 81–745). When the study by Seyhan et al, which was retracted from the literature, was excluded from the analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio remained the same within 95% confidence intervals.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^5133d241]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Collected labratory values included prothrombin time, serum albumin, total protein, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Serological testing was not uniformly performed but was reported if applicable. Bacterial cultures included peripheral blood and pericardial fluid samples.

Effusion size was determined by reviewing prepuncture echocardiogram reports, using the most extensive diastolic measurement. Small size was defined as < 10 mm, medium was > 10 and < 20 mm, and large was > 20 mm. Analyzed fluid characteristics included macroscopic aspect, biochemistry, cytology, and microbiology. Volume of drained fluid during or after the procedure could not be accurately determined because of nonuniform reporting. Survival rates were obtained by reviewing the standardized electronic medical records for the date of death or by identifying the last follow‐up visit.

The etiology of pericardial effusion was classified using the following criteria. The effusion was labeled as malignant when pericardial fluid cytology included atypical or overtly malignant cells. We categorized these cases by primary presentation: newly diagnosed malignancy, first metastasis of a known malignancy, or known metastasized malignancy. We also separately identified patients with negative pericardial fluid cytology but known malignancy. The infectious group included patients with a positive history of viral infection and signs of inflammation (eg, precordial pain) after exclusion of other etiologies. Specific viruses were not identified because of the standard institutional policy not to pursue viral etiologies by either serology or polymerase chain reaction in pericarditis or pericardial effusion unless strictly indicated. Bacterial effusion, however, was defined only by positive pericardial fluid culture. Iatrogenic pericardial effusion included patients who underwent an invasive medical or surgical procedure before pericardial effusion (eg, coronary intervention, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implementation, thoracic surgery). Postpericardial injury syndrome included patients who had acute coronary syndrome or who underwent thoracic surgery during the preceding months in whom we found no other etiology. Uremic pericarditis was diagnosed when blood urea nitrogen was > 60 mg/dL or dialysis dependency existed in the absence of other identifiable causes. Radiation therapy–related pericardial effusion was diagnosed in patients with a history of thoracic radiotherapy in whom other causes were excluded. Thyroid‐related pericardial effusion was diagnosed in patients with elevated thyroid‐stimulating hormone and decreased tetra‐ or tri‐iodothyronine. Patients were categorized with effusion due to congestive heart failure in cases with clinical symptoms and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (< 50%) in the absence of other identifiable etiologies. The final group included patients with idiopathic pericardial effusion, for whom no clear explanation or evidence was found for any etiology using standard, routine clinical care.

### Influence of diuretics on the concentration of proteins and other components of pleural transudates in patients with heart failure [^f77b3f8c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diuretic therapy increases the total protein and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in pleural fluid in patients with transudates due to heart failure, but the effect of diuresis on other substances in pleural fluid constituents is not known.

Subjects and Methods

Twenty-one patients with transudative pleural effusions due to congestive heart failure were prospectively studied. Repeated diagnostic thoracentesis (mean ± SD = 3 ± 1; range, 2 to 6) was performed until the effusions were radiographically unapparent (5 ± 2 days). Thirty-one patients with congestive heart failure who underwent only a single thoracentesis after diuretic therapy served as controls. We measured the concentrations of various components of pleural effusions in the serum and in the pleural fluid, and determined the serum-pleural fluid gradient (serum concentration minus pleural fluid concentration) and ratio (serum concentration divided by pleural fluid concentration).

Results

The pleural concentrations of most components increased significantly (P < 0.001) from the initial specimen to the final specimen: total protein, from 23 ± 7 g/L to 33 ± 9 g/L; albumin, from 13 ± 4 g/L to 18 ± 6 g/L; lactate dehydrogenase, from 177 ± 62 U/L to 288 ± 90 U/L; cholesterol, from 31 ± 16 mg/dL to 52 ± 22 mg/dL; and cholinesterase, from 1,304 ± 616 U/L to 1,884 ± 674 U/L. Expressed as percentage change, the increases in the serum-pleural fluid gradients for albumin (12% ± 22%) and total protein (11% ± 12%) were significantly less than the increases in their concentrations in pleural fluid (albumin, 47% ± 49%; total protein, 48% ± 40%) or in their pleural fluid/serum ratios (albumin, 27% ± 29%; total protein, 38% ± 34%).

Conclusions

The concentrations of the biochemical components commonly measured in pleural fluid increase progressively during diuretic therapy. Calculation of the serum-pleural fluid gradients for protein and albumin may be the most useful way to distinguish transudates from exudates in patients with congestive heart failure who have undergone diuresis.

### Safety of thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy in patients with uncorrected coagulopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^59666e94]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy are common procedures with bleeding risks, but existing guidelines may be overly conservative. We reviewed the evidence on the safety of thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy in patients with uncorrected coagulopathy.

Research Question

Is it safe to perform thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy in patients with uncorrected coagulopathy?

Study Design and Methods

This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception through December 31, 2019. Included studies involved patients with uncorrected coagulopathy because of disease (eg, thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis, kidney failure) or drugs (eg, antiplatelets, anticoagulants). Relevant outcomes were major bleeding and mortality.

Results

Eighteen studies (5,134 procedures) were included. Using random-effects meta-analysis, the pooled major bleeding and mortality rate was 0 (95% CI, 0%-1%). No publication bias was found. Excluding six studies that were in abstract form, meta-analysis of the remaining 12 full articles showed that the pooled major bleeding and mortality rate also was 0 (95% CI, 0%-2%). Subgroup analysis performed for patients with uncorrected coagulopathy resulting from disease or drugs showed similar results.

Interpretation

Among patients with uncorrected coagulopathy who underwent thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy, major bleeding and mortality complications were uncommon. Our results suggest that in appropriately selected patients, thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy can be performed safely.

### Thoracentesis and the risks for bleeding: a new era [^cb673efe]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracentesis is a commonly performed procedure throughout the world. Convention dictates that patients should have laboratory values such as international normalized ratio (INR) and platelets corrected or medications that affect bleeding withheld prior to performing this procedure. By transfusing blood products or withholding medications, patients are exposed to risks that are different than but equally if not more significant than the risk of hemothorax from thoracentesis. This review highlights recent studies that suggest the parameters of performing thoracentesis should be less stringent than traditionally thought.

Recent Findings

Although the safety of thoracentesis has improved with the use of ultrasound and other advancements, the number of patients on new medications that exert an influence on bleeding and those who have physiologic coagulation abnormalities continues to grow. Despite a 1991 study demonstrating the safety of thoracentesis in patients with an abnormal INR or low platelet count, transfusion of blood products to normalize laboratory values is commonplace. A number of studies within the past year address the safety of thoracentesis amidst INR and platelet abnormalities and in patients taking antiplatelet or other medications that affect a patient's bleeding potential.

Summary

Although large randomized studies do not exist, recent literature suggests that it is time to reevaluate the need to correct INR and platelet counts or to transfuse blood products or withhold medications prior to thoracentesis in patients felt to have a risk of possible bleeding.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^bd52c65b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

Recent Findings

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, have been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease process.

Summary

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

American Thoracic Society — Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

Sixteen patients with heart failure were enrolled in this analysis. According to Light's criteria, 12 cases were exudative pleural effusions, and 4 cases were transudative pleural effusions. The 4 patients with transudative pleural effusion did not undergo thoracocentesis before medical thoracoscopic examination because the volume of pleural effusion was small. For the 12 cases with exudative pleural effusion, the pleural biopsy pathologies were neither tuberculosis nor malignancy. Combined with these patients' previous history of heart disease (hypertension in 12 patients, coronary heart disease in 5 patients, atrial fibrillation in 4 patients, rheumatic heart disease in 2 patients and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 1 patient) and the decrease in pleural effusion after standardized management of primary heart disease, we determined that these pleural effusions were the result of heart failure. The reason that these pleural effusions were exudates may be due to the use of diuretics.

As shown in Table 2, the group of 19 patients with false-negative diagnoses consisted of eight men and 11 women with a mean age of 62.5 ± 11.2 years. In this subgroup, 42.1% of patients had a smoking history, and only two patients had neither pleural nodules nor pleural plaques. The subsequent diagnostic procedures of these patients largely involved tissue biopsy; only one patient was diagnosed by the reduction of pleural effusion after chemotherapy for breast cancer. The average time from NSP biopsy to cancer diagnosis was 3.3 ± 3.0 months (range: 1–10 months).

Table 3 presents details of patient demographics, symptoms, abnormalities during microscopy, and biochemistry of the pleural effusion in patients with NSP. The results indicate that there was a higher likelihood of diagnosing pleural malignancies among patients with the recurrence of pleural effusion (p = 0.035), pleural nodules (p = 0.034), or pleural plaques (p = 0.038). No association was seen when considering other characteristics.

### Pleural fluid C-C class chemokines 22 and pleural effusion due to heart failure: a prospective and double-blind diagnostic accuracy test [^5192cce2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Pleural effusion is a common clinical sign that can be caused by more than 60 diseases. Heart failure (HF), malignancy, tuberculosis and pneumonia are the four major causes of pleural effusion. Prompt and accurate identification of the cause of pleural effusion is a prerequisite for treatment and is crucial for improving prognosis. Identifying patients with HF among those with pleural effusion is particularly challenging because there are no specific signs or symptoms of HF. In clinical practice, HF is diagnosed using clinical reference standards, including pleural fluid and serum biochemistry, echocardiography and response to diuretics. Among laboratory tools, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in pleural fluid or serum is highly accurate for HF diagnosis and is endorsed by guidelines. However, many factors can affect the diagnostic accuracy of NT-proBNP, including age, renal function and body mass index. Therefore, the development of novel diagnostic markers for HF is of great importance.

C-C class chemokine 22 (CCL22), also termed macrophage-derived chemokine, is released by active macrophages that function in T cell chemotaxis.CCL22 is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. For example, patients with ischaemic cardiovascular disease have higher serum CCL22 levels than healthy individuals. Additionally, pleural fluid CCL22 is associated with the pathogenesis of tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE)and malignant pleural effusion (MPE). These findings suggest that pleural fluid CCL22 may have diagnostic and prognostic potential in patients with pleural effusion. This study aimed to explore the utility of pleural fluid CCL22 as a diagnostic indicator in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion.

Efficacy and pleurodesis

To determine the efficacy with regard to sufficient symptom relief, we investigated the need of subsequent invasive procedures. Follow-up data were available for 59 procedures demonstrating no need for additional interventions in 93.2% (55/59). Thoracenteses or the insertion of a second chest tube after IPC removal were performed four times (4/59, 6.8%), of which three (5.1%) and one (1.7%) were interventions due to a preceding IPC-related complication or pleurodesis failure, respectively. Although pleurodesis is not the primary goal of IPC, it is associated with improved quality of life and therefore indicative of palliation. Pleurodesis was achieved in 39.0% (23/59; no pleurodesis: 56.5%, 35/59; not reported: 6.8%, 4/59). All patients with postinfectious effusions developed pleurodesis, whereas rates in cardiogenic effusions and cirrhosis were considerably lower (24.1% and 21.1%, respectively, p = 0.026). If further disease-specific interventions were performed, IPCs were able to be removed in 26.7% in heart failure (p NS) and 40.7% in HH (p = 0.009), representing either pleurodesis or cessation of pleural fluid accumulation. Median time to pleurodesis was 1.6 months (range 16 days to 3.5 months, IQR 0.9–3.2). To exclude the negative bias of patients not surviving long enough to develop pleurodesis, we further examined the subgroup of patients surviving ≥ 1 month. Here, pleurodesis rate increased to 45.9% (17/37 IPC). Following pleurodesis, all catheters were removed soon (median 0 days, range 0 days to 1.2 months).

### Pleural fluid amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide in patients with pleural effusions [^6e0359ed]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Definite diagnosis of transudative or exudative pleural fluids often presents a diagnostic dilemma. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether amino-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in pleural fluid has a diagnostic value for discriminating heart-failure-related pleural effusions from non-heart-failure effusions.

Methods

Sixty-six subjects (40 male, mean age 61 ± 18 y) with pleural effusions were included. Samples of pleural fluid and serum were obtained simultaneously from each subject. Biochemical analysis, bacterial and fungal culture, acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and cytology were performed on the pleural fluid.

Results

Subjects with heart-failure-related pleural effusion had significantly higher pleural NT-proBNP levels than other subjects (P < .001). Pleural and serum NT-proBNP measures were closely correlated (r = 0.90, P < .001). An NT-proBNP cutoff value of ≥ 2,300 pg/mL in pleural fluid had a sensitivity of 70.8%, a specificity of 97.6%, and positive and negative predictive values of 94.4% and 85.4%, respectively, for discriminating transudates caused by heart failure from exudates. Eight heart-failure subjects were misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria, 5 of whom received diuretics before thoracentesis. All misclassified subjects had pleural NT-proBNP levels higher than 1,165 pg/mL, which predicted heart-failure-associated transudates with 95.8% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity.

Conclusions

Pleural fluid NT-proBNP measurement in the routine diagnostic panel may be useful in differentiation of heart-failure-related pleural effusions and exudative pleural fluids with reasonable accuracy, especially in heart-failure patients treated with diuretics.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6c1295a5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions arising from heart failure are usually discriminated from other causes based on clinical criteria in association with biochemical analysis, particularly the discrimination of transudates versus exudates, most commonly using Light's criteria. The sensitivity of Light's criteria for identifying exudative pleural effusions is very high (98%), however the criteria's ability to exclude transudative effusions is low. As a result, heart failure associated pleural effusions can be misclassified as exudates using Light's criteria, particularly after diuretics have been used. One study showed that 28% (5 of 18) patients with pleural effusions from congestive heart failure (CHF) were misclassified as exudative effusions using Light's criteria. A diagnostic dilemma often arises when CHF-associated pleural effusions are misclassified as exudates which can then lead to the use of more expensive and sometimes invasive tests to diagnose the etiology of the effusion. A non-invasive and inexpensive strategy to discriminate pleural effusions of a cardiac origin would be beneficial in such circumstances.

Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the amino-terminal fragment N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) have an established role in the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients with CHF. BNP, also known as B-type natriuretic peptide, is a 32 amino acid polypeptide secreted by the ventricles of the heart in response to excessive stretching of cardiomyocytes. BNP is co-secreted along with a 76 amino acid polypeptide, NT-pro-BNP, which is biologically inactive. The half-life of BNP is approximately 20 minutes whereas of NT-pro-BNP is 1–2 hours. BNP binds to atrial natriuretic factor receptors leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and central venous pressure, and an increase in natriuresis.

Several studies have been published in the literature on the diagnostic accuracy of NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions from heart failure. The purpose of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid NT-pro-BNP for pleural effusions of cardiac origin.

### Usefulness of medical thoracoscopy in the management of pleural effusion caused by chronic renal failure [^9eac0752]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although pleural effusion (PE) can be caused by several pathologies like congestive heart failure, infections, malignancies, and pulmonary embolism, it is also a common finding in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diagnostic thoracentesis is of limited value in the differential diagnosis, and the role of more invasive investigations like medical thoracoscopy (MT) is still unclear.

Aim

To evaluate the usefulness of MT in unexplained PE in CKD.

Materials and Methods

In the electronic database of our Institution, we retrospectively searched for patients with CKD who underwent MT for unexplained PE between January 2008 and August 2016.

Results

Ten patients were included in the present study. The average age was 72.4 years, the male:female ratio 9:1 and the average blood creatinine value 5.96 mg/dL. The average follow-up was 18 months. A thoracentesis showed an exudate was found in 9 patients and in 1 case pleural fluid characteristics were not recorded for technical reasons; in none of them the cytologic or microbiological analyses were considered diagnostic. The clinical suspicion was a neoplastic (5) or an infectious disease (5). In 4 patients with recurrent PE, MT was performed to obtain talc pleurodesis. No immediate procedure-related complications were recorded; 1 patient developed empyema after 2 months. In 6 cases final diagnosis was chronic uremic pleuritis, hydrothorax in 2, and chronic lymphocytic pleurisy in 2.

Conclusions

MT represents a safe and effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in patients with CKD, that itself is a common cause of exudative effusion, and those patients may not require MT.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^2496abf7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis can be caused by a wide variety of malignant or nonmalignant causes. Known etiologies include infections, neoplasia, iatrogenicity, congestive heart failure, and metabolic causes (hypothyroidism, uremia), as well as pericardial injury (eg, following myocardial infarct, thoracotomy, or trauma), radiation, connective tissue diseases, and trauma. 1, 2 Nevertheless, a substantial number of effusions are idiopathic. 3 Data on the frequency of different etiologies and, more specifically, on primary or metastasized malignancies remain scarce and vary widely among the few studied populations. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In the past 2 decades, only 5 sizeable prospective series on the etiology of pericardial effusions have been reported. Two of those series included distinct populations in which tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common, and thus the participants are not necessarily representative of other cohorts. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

Excluding malignancy or confirming pericardial involvement in patients previously diagnosed with cancer not only has important consequences for the management of patients presenting with a pericardial effusion but also affects their outcome. 1 The diagnosis or exclusion of pericardial involvement in malignancy is, to a large extent, established by pericardial cytology obtained via pericardiocentesis. The aim of this study was to examine the etiology of pericardial effusions requiring a percutaneous intervention, either because of hemodynamic compromise or for a diagnostic workup, to determine how often fluid cytology is requested in unsuspected as well as known cancer patients and to analyze the impact of these findings on patient outcome.

### Diagnostic accuracy of thoracic CT to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion prior to thoracentesis [^60e0de27]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion is the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, a closed space between the parietal and visceral pleura, due to numerous pathologic conditions with increased production (and/or a reduction in reabsorption) of pleural fluid (PF), including heart failure, lung infection, malignant tumors, collagen vascular disease, trauma, and so forth. The first step in the evaluation of PF is to distinguish exudative from transudative effusion. For the past several decades, exudative effusion has been differentiated from transudative effusion using Light's criteria, which requires detection of protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the PF through thoracentesis. The goal of the initial thoracentesis is to determine the presence of exudate and alleviate dyspnea (if present). If the etiology of the pleural effusion favors leakage and there is supportive clinical history, such as heart failure, nephrotic syndrome or liver cirrhosis, thoracentesis may be postponed until it is clear whether the pleural effusion can be treated concurrently with direct treatment of the underlying disease. Therefore, accurate prediction of pleural effusion diagnosis before thoracentesis will have great influence on treatment method.

Morphologic features evaluated by computed tomography (CT), such as pleural thickening, pleural nodules, loculation and effusion density, and extrapleural fat tissue thickness, may aid in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusions. Accumulating evidence have shown that anemia can be detected on unenhanced CT of the thorax, based on density change of blood reflected by quantitative analysis of CT values. Moreover, an obvious linear correlation of hemoglobin concentration and CT attenuation has also been clearly demonstrated. Accordingly, it is reasonable to speculate that density differences between exudative and transudative effusions can be detected by CT value measurement. Indeed, several studies have evaluated the efficacy of CT value to differentiate transudative from exudative pleural effusion. Nevertheless, results from these studies are inconsistent or contradictory. Thus, in current study, we aim to investigate the diagnostic value of CT in distinguishing exudative and transudative effusions. Furthermore, we also assessed the strength of correlation between CT value and patients' protein and LDH level in PF.

### Nonmalignant pleural effusions: a prospective study of 356 consecutive unselected patients [^b08aae87]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion secondary to a nonmalignant cause can represent significant morbidity and mortality. Nonmalignant pleural effusion (NMPE) is common, with congestive heart failure representing the leading cause. Despite this, there are limited data on mortality risk and associated prognostic factors.

Methods

We recruited 782 consecutive patients presenting to a pleural service between March 2008 and March 2015 with an undiagnosed pleural effusion. Further analysis was conducted in 356 patients with NMPE. Pleural biochemical analysis, cytologic analysis, thoracic ultrasonography, and chest radiography were performed. Echocardiography, CT imaging, radiologically guided biopsy, and medical thoracoscopy were undertaken as clinically indicated. Patients were followed for a minimum duration of 12 months, with the final diagnosis decided through independent review by two respiratory consultants.

Results

Of the 782 patients, 356 were diagnosed with NMPE (46%). These patients had a mean age of 68 years (SD, 17 years) with 69% of them being men. Patients with cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure had 1-year mortality rates of 50%, 46%, and 25%, respectively. Bilateral effusions (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; 95% CI, 2.22–5.68) and transudative effusions (HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.81–4.28) were associated with a worse prognosis in patients with NMPE, with a 57% and 43% 1-year mortality rate, respectively.

Conclusions

This is the largest prospectively collected series in patients with NMPE, demonstrating that cases secondary to organ dysfunction have extremely high 1-year mortality. In addition, the presence of bilateral and transudative effusions is an indicator of increased mortality. Clinicians should be aware of these poor prognostic features and guide management accordingly.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^5de689dc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion often develops in patients with thoracic or systemic diseases. Such effusion has traditionally been classified as transudate or exudate based on the etiology and underlying pathology, and differentiating the two types of pleural effusion is critical for guiding treatment. Transudates are usually taken as a sign of underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis, which then becomes the focus of treatment. Because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, exudates are usually taken as a sign of, inflammatory disorders or malignancy, leading to more extensive diagnostic procedures.

The criteria most widely used to differentiate exudates and transudates in patients with pleural effusions are Light's criteria, established by Light et al. in 1972. These criteria rely on levels of total protein and of lactate dehydrogenase. The criteria maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity: they typically identify 98% of pleural exudates, but they misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. As a result, patients misclassified with exudate undergo unnecessary and risky invasive diagnostic procedures, such as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy. This highlights the need to develop better methods to differentiate exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Since Light's criteria were published in 1972, pleural cholesterol levels have been explored for their usefulness in diagnosing pleural exudates. Cellular degeneration and vascular leakage due to increased permeability are thought to elevate pleural cholesterol levels. Several studies suggest that pleural cholesterol is increased in pleural exudates, making it a potential biomarker for differentiating exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether pleural cholesterol levels can provide adequate differentiating power, and other studies have explored the diagnostic potential of the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) and come to similarly conflicting conclusions. To help gain more reliable insights, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol level or the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates.

### Improving the safety of thoracentesis [^e46874a2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracentesis is a common bedside procedure associated with iatrogenic complications including pneumothorax. Experienced clinicians using optimal procedural techniques within a supportive system can achieve improvements in safety. However, clinicians have been relatively slow to adopt these changes. This review examines the available literature regarding procedural safety of thoracentesis with emphasis on best practice models to reduce iatrogenic complications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have identified procedure-specific variables that are independently associated with iatrogenic pneumothorax including inexperienced operators, lack of ultrasound imaging, and large-volume aspiration of fluid. Development of a best practice model including procedural training within a focused procedural group that utilizes ultrasound imaging further improves thoracentesis procedural safety.

Summary

Several procedural modifications have led to improvements in thoracentesis procedural safety in reducing iatrogenic complications. Herein, we review the known risks associated with thoracentesis and identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. On the basis of recent studies, we make recommendations and encourage incorporation of 'best practice' techniques for thoracentesis procedures.

### The impact of clinically significant pleural effusion on survival of US veterans with cancer, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia: the veterans administration lung effusion study [^4d7e7556]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous clinical data suggest that the presence of a pleural effusion is associated with poor survival. However, these studies were limited by either a small sample size or lack of an adequate control group.

Research Questions

What is the impact of pleural effusion on survival in patients hospitalized with an admitting diagnosis of the 3 most common causes of pleural effusion: cancer, congestive heart failure, or pneumonia?

Study Design and Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of US veterans hospitalized between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2020. International classification of disease codes were used to identify patients with an admitting diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, or cancer. Patients were dichotomized as having a clinically significant pleural effusion (PE) when a pleural effusion drainage was performed or not (NO-PE). All-cause mortality was compared between the PE and NO-PE cohorts.

Results

We analyzed 34,707 patients in the PE group and 792,217 patients in the NO-PE group. Patients with PE had a significantly higher all-cause mortality compared with patients with NO-PE. The median survival time was significantly lower in PE group as compared with NO-PE group across all 3 diagnoses, CHF (PE, 1.51 years; 95% CI, 1.40–1.61 vs NO-PE, 3.23 years; 95% CI, 3.21–3.26), cancer (PE, 1.33 years; 95% CI, 1.27–1.39 vs NO-PE, 2.05 years; 95% CI, 2.02–2.08), and pneumonia (PE, 4.27 years; 95% CI, 3.94–4.61 vs NO-PE, 5.11 years; 95% CI, 5.06–5.15). The hazard ratio of all-cause mortality remained unchanged after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities.

Interpretation

The presence of a clinically significant pleural effusion was independently associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with admitting diagnosis of CHF, cancer, and pneumonia. Clinicians and researchers should consider the association of CHF, cancer, and pneumonia with Pes when estimating the prognosis of individual patients and when assessing the survival of longitudinal cohorts.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^e34e87bb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound guidance for pleural interventions in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is conditionally supported; in patients with known or suspected MPE, we suggest that ultrasound imaging be used to guide pleural interventions (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects). Supporting data include a large retrospective cohort that reviewed 62,261 thoracenteses reporting an overall pneumothorax risk of 2.7% and a 19% reduction with ultrasound (odds ratio = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74–0.90), and that 3.4% of pneumothoraces required chest tube placement. In malignant effusions specifically, ultrasound guidance reduced pneumothorax after thoracentesis (1.0% vs. 8.9%, relative risk [RR] = 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03–0.37), with no chest tubes in the ultrasound group compared with three (2.2%) without image guidance (95% CI not estimable). The panel agrees that ultrasound guidance, which has no significant harms associated with its usage, has an important benefit of reducing pneumothorax rates, and pneumothorax was associated with a significantly longer length of hospital stay and total patient hospitalization cost.

### Pleural effusions occurring with right heart failure [^26a1eaa6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions commonly occur in patients with left heart failure. However, there is increasing evidence that patients with pulmonary hypertension and isolated right heart failure frequently have pleural effusions.

Recent Findings

Three recent studies have evaluated the incidence of pleural effusions without an alternate explanation in patients with idiopathic/familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (14%), pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases (33%), and portopulmonary hypertension (30%). The majority of patients in all three studies with pleural effusions without an alternate explanation were found to have isolated right heart failure. In these studies, mean right atrial pressures and death during follow-up were significantly higher in patients with pleural effusions and isolated right heart failure compared to patients with no pleural effusions.

Summary

Pleural effusions without an alternate explanation occur commonly in at least three subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The majority of patients with pleural effusions also have isolated right heart failure that is thought to be responsible for the development of the effusions. Patients presenting with pulmonary hypertension should be evaluated for pleural effusions, and if present, should receive a work-up for right heart failure.

### Chylothorax: complication attributed to dasatinib use [^e376a7e0]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 63-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic myelogenous leukaemia treated with dasatinib, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction presented with difficulty in breathing. Chest X-ray showed large right-sided pleural effusion, which was confirmed on a CT angiogram of the chest. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 61% with moderate to severely dilated right ventricle and right ventricular systolic pressure of 60mm Hg. Diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed, and 2.2 L of pleural fluid was removed. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with chylothorax. Significant symptomatic improvement was noted after thoracentesis. In the absence of an alternate explanation, chylothorax was attributed to dasatinib, which was switched to nilotinib. This resulted in resolution of her pleural effusions.

### Pleural fluid C-C class chemokines 22 and pleural effusion due to heart failure: a prospective and double-blind diagnostic accuracy test [^9a8d5958]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Participants

We report this work following the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies guidelines. The participants in this study were recruited from SIMPLE, a prospective, preregistered, double-blind diagnostic test accuracy study.SIMPLE aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid and serum biomarkers in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, diagnostic criteria and framework of the SIMPLE study have been described in our previous studies. In short, we recruited patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions who visited the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between September 2018 and July 2021 (Hohhot cohort) and those who visited the Affiliated Changshu Hospital of Nantong University between June 2020 and July 2021 (Changshu cohort). The exclusion criteria for the Hohhot and Changshu cohorts were as follows: (1) unclear cause of pleural effusion at the time of discharge, (2) pregnancy, (3) age < 18 years, (4) pleural effusion that developed during hospitalisation and (5) trauma-induced pleural effusion.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and members of the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of this study.

Diagnostic criteria

HF-induced pleural effusion was diagnosed using clinical reference standards, including transudative effusions, echocardiographic features (eg, cardiomegaly and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction), chest X-ray features (bilateral pleural effusions), biochemical tests (eg, serum natriuretic peptide levels) and response to diuretics. MPE was defined as positive pleural biopsy or effusion cytology. In some patients with negative cytology who were unwilling or unable to undergo pleural biopsy, MPE was defined by the presence of late-stage primary cancer, consistent clinical features and exclusion of benign conditions. The diagnosis of TPE was based on typical pleural biopsy findings or isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from pleural samples. In patients with a high clinical probability of TPE but negative microbiological and/or histological findings, the diagnosis of TPE was established based on the response to anti-tuberculosis treatment and exclusion of other causes of pleural effusions. Parapneumonic pleural effusions (PPE) were defined as those occurring in conjunction with pneumonia, bronchiectasis or lung abscess and typically required the administration of antibiotics and/or chest tube drainage. Two senior clinicians, Z-DH and LY, made the final diagnoses, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Associated pleural and pericardial effusions: an extensive differential explored [^127efce2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^5e6d0d27]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of pleural effusions is around 320 per 100 000 per year in industrialised countries, representing approximately 1.5 million new patients in the USA. Initial work up (anamnesis, physical exam, ECG, chest X-ray, blood sample and thoracocentesis) can yield a diagnosis in up to 74% of patients. So approximately one in four effusions remains of unclear origin. Further diagnostic procedures usually comprises repeat thoracocentesis (which can yield an extra 27% of diagnoses) and pleural biopsy. Pleural biopsy is most frequently performed by thoracoscopy. The main advantage of thoracoscopic biopsy is that a specimen of the most abnormal pleural surface can be examined. Second, when inspection shows suspicion of malignancy, poudrage can be performed. Diagnostic yield of thoracoscopy has been reported to be up to 93%.

This study represents our experience during an almost 10-year period with diagnostic thoracoscopy in patients with pleural exudates without a diagnosis after initial little invasive evaluation.

### Guidelines for the appropriate use of bedside general and cardiac ultrasonography in the evaluation of critically ill patients-part I: general ultrasonography [^69b40446]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Noncardiac thoracic imaging — pleural effusion recommendations state: "We recommend that ultrasound should be used to complement physical examination and conventional chest radiography to diagnose and localize a pleural effusion. Grade 1A". and "We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to assist in drainage (including needle guidance), particularly of small or loculated effusions compared with landmark technique. Grade 1B". with "no recommendation regarding the preference to use of either static or dynamic technique to do so". Reported diagnostic performance is that "The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound to diagnose a pleural effusion are about 84%, 100%, and 94%, respectively", and "Other data indicate a favorable accuracy (nearly 100%) compared with chest CT". Regarding safety and complications, events with drainage of large effusions "were decreased from 33 or 50% to 0% when they were drained using ultrasound guidance", and in a large observational series there was "a 1.3% complication rate in a series of over 200 patients versus 6.5% in a historical control"; additionally, "Appropriately trained intensivists can perform ultrasound-guided drainage with an acceptable complication profile".

### Pleural fluid C-C class chemokines 22 and pleural effusion due to heart failure: a prospective and double-blind diagnostic accuracy test [^69ca4161]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid CCL22 for HF in two cohorts. We found that CCL22 had moderate diagnostic accuracy for HF. In addition, DCA revealed a potential net benefit of CCL22 in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion. These results suggest that pleural fluid CCL22 may be an auxiliary diagnostic tool for HF-related pleural effusion. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the diagnostic role of pleural fluid CCL22 in patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion.

Although Light's criteria are commonly used to differentiate transudates from exudates, and HF is a primary cause of transudate, previous studies have shown that 20%–30% of HF-related transudates may be misclassified as exudates. Moreover, approximately 15% of transudates are caused by non-cardiac conditions such as liver cirrhosis or renal disease. These limitations indicate that Light's criteria alone may be insufficient for the accurate identification of HF-related pleural effusion. Therefore, pleural biomarkers such as CCL22 may serve as useful adjuncts in improving diagnostic precision, particularly in ambiguous cases.

Management of patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — the algorithm branches to "Asymptomatic", where "Pleural intervention not needed (unless for diagnostic purposes)", and to "Symptomatic", where "Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis (i.e., large-volume tap*)" is performed "With goals of assessing lung expansion and relief of dyspnea" and "may not be necessary if the patient's dyspnea is known to be attributable to the MPE". Subsequent decision-making includes "Lung re-expansion"; if "Predicted very short survival", then "Palliate dyspnea with: repeat thoracentesis if needed, oxygen, morphine", whereas if not, "Consider placement of IPC (IPC should also be considered in patients with failed pleurodesis or symptomatic loculated effusion)". When lung re-expansion is achieved, proceed to "Discussion of relative risks / benefits of IPC vs. pleurodesis vs. combination approaches" and consider "Talc poudrage or talc slurry ± IPC". For "Evidence of IPC-related infection", the pathway directs "Initiation of oral antibiotics based on local sensitivities. Attempt to keep catheter in place"; the footnote notes "there is a low likelihood (2–4%) of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)–related infection" and that escalation of care "should be made on a case-by-case basis and is recommended if there are any signs/symptoms of worsening infection". A prognostic caution states "Physicians are not great predictors of prognosis" and the "Predicted very short survival" recommendation "should be used as a rough guideline and individualized on a case-by-case basis".

### A rare cause of constrictive pericarditis [^fb268c6d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented with 3months of exertional dyspnoea and 1week of oedema. Examination revealed elevated neck veins, pulsus paradoxus, muffled heart sounds, decreased breath sounds and pedal oedema. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated cardiac tamponade, and chest X-ray showed pleural effusion. Pericardiocentesis, thoracocentesis, laboratory investigations and CT did not elucidate an underlying aetiology. Three weeks later, he presented with recurrent cardiac tamponade and pleural effusion. Pericardial window histology was benign. Pleural and pericardial fluids were again unrevealing. Three months later, he presented with worsening congestive heart failure. TTE, cardiac catheterisation and cardiac MRI were consistent with constrictive pericarditis. Preoperative workup did not identify an underlying cause. The patient underwent subtotal pericardiectomy. Intraoperative frozen section indicated malignancy. Pathology confirmed metastatic poorly differentiated signet ring adenocarcinoma of intestinal origin. He died 4days postoperatively from multiorgan failure.

### A simple laboratory measurement for discrimination of transudative and exudative pleural effusion: pleural viscosity [^443fe6fa]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The initial step in establishing the cause of an effusion is to determine whether the fluid is a transudate or exudate. Plasma viscosity is influenced by the concentration of plasma proteins and lipoproteins with the major contribution resulting from fibrinogen. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of pleural fluid viscosity in discrimination of transudate and exudates.

Materials and Methods

We studied prospectively 63 consecutive patients with pleural effusion in whom diagnostic or therapeutic thoracentesis had been performed. The criteria of Light were applied to differentiate transudates from exudates: 33 patients (23 male, 13 female, mean age = 68 ± 4 years) had exudates and 30 patients (17 male, 13 female, mean age = 68 ± 5) had transudates (due to congestive heart failure). Measurements of pleural fluid and plasma viscosity were performed using a viscometer.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between patients with transudate and exudates in respect to plasma viscosity. However, pleural viscosities of the patients with exudates were significantly higher than those of patients with transudate (1.37 ± 0.16 mPa vs 0.93 ± 0.03 mPa s p < 0.001, respectively). Pleural viscosity has a high sensitivity, specificity (94%, 93%, respectively), positive and negative predictive value (97%, 97%, respectively) for the discrimination of transudative or exudatetive pleural fluid.

Conclusion

We have demonstrated for the first time that pleural viscosity of the exudative effusion is higher than that of transudative effusion with high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. Regarding the simplicity of this measurement, it may play a valuable role in the accurate and fast discrimination of pleural fluid.

### High diagnostic accuracy of NT-proBNP for cardiac origin of pleural effusions [^0702370e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A prospective study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, measured simultaneously in serum and pleural fluid, in identifying pleural effusions due to heart failure. Pleural fluid and serum samples from all patients presenting for thoracentesis between April 2004 and May 2005 were simultaneously collected. The discriminative properties of NT-proBNP levels in identifying pleural effusions due to heart failure were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared to the diagnostic value of finding a transudate by Light's criteria. Ninety-three patients were evaluated, 27% with cardiac effusion and 73% with exudative effusions of various cause. Levels of NT-proBNP in pleural fluid and serum correlated closely. Serum and pleural fluid NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with cardiac effusion. With a cut-off value of 4,000 ng.L(-1), NT-proBNP levels in pleural fluid and serum displayed comparably high diagnostic accuracies of 92 and 91%, respectively. All patients misclassified by Light's criteria were correctly identified by measuring NT-proBNP levels. N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels in either pleural fluid or serum showed a high diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional criteria. Thus measuring N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a valuable additional diagnostic tool for the detection or exclusion of cardiac origin of pleural effusions.
