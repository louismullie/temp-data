## Question

The alphabet consists of 24 letters, and to describe each permutation of these letters, $24 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of area is needed. How many times the surface area of the Earth is required to describe all permutations? (The radius of the Earth is $r = 6370 \mathrm{~km}$.)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many times the surface area of the Earth is required to describe all permutations of 24 letters, given that each permutation needs 24 cm² of area and the Earth's radius is 6370 km. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of permutations of 24 distinct letters. Then, I should calculate the total area required for all permutations in square centimeters. Next, I will compute the surface area of the Earth in square centimeters. Finally, I will divide the total permutation area by the Earth's surface area to get the ratio and express it in scientific notation with appropriate units and significant figures.

> Let me first confirm the permutation count. For 24 distinct letters, the number of permutations is 24 factorial, which is 24! = 24 × 23 × 22 ×… × 2 × 1. I should double-check that I'm not mixing this up with combinations; yes, permutations are ordered arrangements, so 24! is correct here [^notfound].

> Now, I need to calculate the total area required. If each permutation requires 24 cm², then the total area is 24! multiplied by 24 cm². Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: 24! is approximately 6.204 × 10²³, so total area ≈ 6.204 × 10²³ × 24 ≈ 1.489 × 10²⁵ cm². I should keep more precision and round only at the end, so I'll retain 1.4889 × 10²⁵ cm² for now [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the Earth's surface area calculation. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and the radius is given as 6370 km. Hold on, I should convert kilometers to centimeters to keep units consistent: 6370 km = 6370 × 10⁵ cm = 6.37 × 10⁸ cm. So, Earth's surface area = 4π × (6.37 × 10⁸ cm)² ≈ 4π × 40.5769 × 10¹⁶ cm² ≈ 5.100 × 10¹⁸ cm². Let me double-check the order of magnitude; yes, that's about 5.1 × 10¹⁸ cm² [^notfound].

> I will now examine the ratio. Dividing the total permutation area by the Earth's surface area gives: (1.4889 × 10²⁵ cm²) / (5.100 × 10¹⁸ cm²) ≈ 2.919 × 10⁶. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might be closer to 3 × 10⁷, but that would be off by a factor of 10; the correct ratio is about 2.9 million, not 30 million. So, the answer is approximately 2.9 × 10⁶ Earth surface areas [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the significant figures and rounding. The Earth's radius is given to three significant figures, and π is exact for this purpose, so reporting the final ratio to two or three significant figures is reasonable. Rounding 2.919 × 10⁶ to 2.9 × 10⁶ preserves the appropriate precision given the input data [^notfound].

> Final answer: About 2.9 × 10⁶ times the surface area of the Earth would be required to describe all permutations of 24 letters at 24 cm² per permutation [^notfound].

The total area needed to describe all permutations of 24 letters is **24! × 24 cm²** ≈ 1.49 × 10²⁵ cm². The Earth's surface area is **4πr²** ≈ 5.10 × 10¹⁸ cm². Dividing the total area by the Earth's surface area gives **≈ 2.92 × 10⁶**, meaning about **2.9 million Earths** would be needed.

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of permutations

The number of permutations of 24 distinct letters is **24!** (24 factorial):

[
24! = 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1
]

Using a calculator or computational tool, we find:

[
24! \\approx 6.204 \\times 10^{23}
]

---

## Step 2: Calculate the total area required

Each permutation requires **24 cm²**, so the total area is:

[
\\text{Total area} = 24! \\times 24, \\text{cm}^2 \\approx 6.204 \\times 10^{23} \\times 24, \\text{cm}^2 \\approx 1.489 \\times 10^{25}, \\text{cm}^2
]

---

## Step 3: Calculate the surface area of the Earth

The surface area of a sphere is **4πr²**, where r is the radius. Given r = 6370 km = 6.37 × 10⁸ cm:

[
\\text{Earth's surface area} = 4\\pi (6.37 \\times 10^8, \\text{cm})^2 \\approx 4\\pi \\times 4.058 \\times 10^{17}, \\text{cm}^2 \\approx 5.10 \\times 10^{18}, \\text{cm}^2
]

---

## Step 4: Calculate the ratio

Divide the total area by the Earth's surface area:

[
\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1.489 \\times 10^{25}, \\text{cm}^2}{5.10 \\times 10^{18}, \\text{cm}^2} \\approx 2.92 \\times 10^6
]

---

## Conclusion

Approximately **2.9 million Earths** would be needed to describe all permutations of 24 letters at 24 cm² per permutation.

Data collection and generation

We first describe how the examples were collected or generated, and then the 15 prompt templates that were used for each of them.
Addition. We randomly generate 5,000 instances, in which each addend is sampled uniformly from 1 to 100 digits. We then remove those instances for which f hrm > 50 to prevent instances with similar or identical numbers of digits in both addends from dominating the upper difficulty bins. This is because, for example, if the difficulty is the harmonic mean, the bins with f hrm > 90 would be dominated by instances in which both addends have very high numbers of digits (that is, at least 82 digits). A similar phenomenon also occurs with other difficulty levels, but with the previous criterion considered, the problem is well mitigated. This results in a final sample of 3,142 instances.
Anagram. We use the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus, containing the frequency of more than 300,000 most commonly used single words on the Web in English. From this corpus, we randomly choose up to 100 English words with 3–20 letters, resulting in a total of 1,570 words. There are fewer than 1,800 instances because there are fewer than 100 English words with 17–20 letters. Then, we shuffle the order of letters randomly to map these words into 1,570 anagrams. We make sure the resultant permutation is not the same as the original word.
Locality. We use the World Cities Database, which provides an up-to-date database of the cities and towns globally. From this database, we first exclude cities with non-unique names across the globe. Next, we remove cities with more than one word or non-standard letters in the 26-character Latin alphabet (for example, Buenos Aires or Chŏngjin) to enhance the quality and ease of the response-scoring method. After the previous selection procedure, we seek to form a final sample that covers instances with different difficulty levels (or bins) as equally as possible. Thus, we perform binning on the difficulty function (f pop) to produce 100 bins in which we extract up to 50 instances from each bin randomly, resulting in a total of 2,341 instances. Again, there are fewer than 5,000 instances because some bins contain fewer than 50 instances.
Science. This benchmark is built by integrating multiple-choice questions from educational settings: OpenBookQAand GPQA. OpenBookQA is a collection of multiple-choice questions in basic science, based on 1,329 established facts. We randomly sampled 1,000 questions from OpenBookQA. To complement the benchmark with more advanced science questions, we included GPQA — a dataset containing 546 graduate-level questions written by domain experts that challenge LLMs to demonstrate a deep understanding of biology, physics and chemistry. We exclude two lengthy questions that exceed the context window limit for some of the models that we analyse.
Transforms. This benchmark includes a comprehensive set of information-centric transformation tasks based on real-world scenarios. We integrate many data-formatting questions from a data-wrangling datasetand from a 'natural instructions' dataset, manually regenerating or adapting some of them. We also also introduce new tasks about world knowledge, information retrieval, advertising, administration, coding, scheduling and retailing, reflecting a wide range of real user interactions with language models. The benchmark integrates 73 different tasks, with 10 instances each, totalling 730 items.

Task 3: Shape flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by a triangle presented at different orientations. Triangles were of equal height and line thickness to target letters.

Task 4: Number flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by an Arabic numeral, chosen from a range between 2 and 9.

Task 5: Same-polarity flankers

Target letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by black letters; presentation was as Task 2 except that items were presented on a grey background to match Task 6 (see below).

Task 6: Reverse-polarity flankers

Target black letters (n = 24) were flanked on each side by white letters, all presented on a grey background.

The edge-to-edge distance between the target letter and flankers was 0.1° of visual angle in the condensed condition and 1.0° in the spaced condition at a viewing distance of 50 cm; the height of stimuli (10.5 mm) corresponded to a visual angle of 1.20°. Participants were given one prompt for each trial where they named the flanker ('Is that the letter in the middle?'); this prompt was intended to limit errors resulting from visual disorientation. The same combination of flankers was used for each target letter under both spatial conditions within each flanker condition. Alphabetic items occurred with equal frequency within each task. The stimuli were presented in blocks of six items, with blocks being administered in an ABBA design. All flanked stimuli were presented in the centre of the screen within a fixation box (6.4° in width, 2.9° in height). All 26 patients with PCA completed Tasks 1, 2 and 4; 24 completed Task 3; and 22 completed Tasks 5 and 6. Naming latencies were manually determined from the onset of each letter using Audacity.

### Word contexts enhance the neural representation of individual letters in early visual cortex [^a586b094]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In the main experiment, we used a blocked design, in which we presented blocks of four long trials (one of each of the four conditions), followed by a null-trial. Each trial was 14-s long, during which ten stimuli were presented. Of those stimuli, nine or occasionally (in 25% of trials) eight were (non-)word items and one or two were (learned) targets. A single presentation consisted of 900 ms of (non)word item plus noise background, and 500 ms of blank screen plus fixation dot (Fig. 1c). Targets were either presented in their regular (learned) form or with one of the non-middle letters permuted, and participants had to discriminate whether the target was regular or permuted. Target correctness and occurrence within the trial were counterbalanced and randomised, with the constraint that targets were never presented directly after each other. The order of word items was shuffled pseudo-randomly, with the constraint that the same letter never repeated twice at the same position (except for the middle letter).

### From letters to composed concepts: a magnetoencephalography study of reading [^d5334130]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

More anteriorly, we observed a change in sensitivity to a discrimination between letter and symbol strings. Two clusters in the test window reached the threshold for statistical significance. The first of these was found toward the most anterior point of the ventral ROI and spanned 130–165 ms (p < .0001), thus overlapping in time with the more posterior sensitivity to visual noise. The second cluster was located slightly more posterior on the ventral surface (see Figure 2) and later in time, spanning 260–300 ms (p < .0001).

Expanding on the analyses performed by Gwilliams et al. and repeated here, we also performed a series of follow‐up tests that separated the four‐ and one‐unit letter and symbol‐string stimuli. The results are shown in Figure S1. First, in the more anterior and earlier String Type cluster, both individual letter and four‐letter words showed a transient increase relative to their symbol‐string counterparts, appearing as a larger positive peak in the responses. This relative increase appeared to be larger in the Words versus Symbols contrast than the Letter versus Symbol contrast. The result of a post‐hoc paired t ‐test conducted on the differences between the contrasts (i.e. Letter — Symbol vs. Word — Symbols) between 100 and 200 ms after stimulus onset was statistically significant at an uncorrected p < .05 level (t [27] = 2.82, p < .009).

A similar pattern was found in the post‐hoc examination of the later, but slightly more posterior, String Type cluster. Here, words elicited a more prolonged divergence from their symbol counterparts, relative to that seen between individual letters and symbols. In the Word versus Symbols contrast, this divergence extended beyond the original 300 ms boundary on the original test window. A post‐hoc paired t ‐test on the differences between the contrasts, this time between 260 ms (the cluster onset) and 400 ms, again revealed a statistically significant difference (t [27] = 6.43, p < .0001), with the four‐unit contrast eliciting larger differences than the one‐unit contrast.

The spatial extents of the clusters that matched the Gwilliams et al. results were adopted as group‐level functional (f)ROIs in the analyses reported below to examine where along this series of responses we might observe a sensitivity to the different word combination conditions. This set of functional ROIs consisted of the Noise Level I and II clusters, and both String Type clusters.

### Abundance of live ² ⁴ ⁴ Pu in deep-sea reservoirs on earth points to rarity of actinide nucleosynthesis [^ab0b5754]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

For archives accumulating millions of years, the expected 244 Pu abundance range (see discussion) is well within reach of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), an ultra-sensitive methodof ion identification and detection. Based on the ingestion efficiency of Pu into deep-sea manganese crusts (21%) and on the AMS 244 Pu-detection efficiency (1 × 10 −4, see Methods), we calculate a measurement sensitivity expressed as a 244 Pu flux onto Earth of the order of 0.1 to 1 atom per cm 2 per My 244 Pu from ISM deposition. Thus, for the crust with a 25 My accumulation period and with 200 cm 2 surface area ~500–4,000 244 Pu-detection events are expected, and about a factor 100 less for the sediment sample (1.64 My time period and 4.9 cm 2 surface area).

AMS experimental data of 244 Pu abundances in Earth archives

We have developed the capability to detect trace amounts of 244 Pu in terrestrial archives by AMSand our technique provides background-free 244 Pu detection with an overall efficiency (atoms detected/atoms in the sample) of ~1 × 10 −4 (see Methods and Supplementary Tables 1–4). The AMS measurements determine the atom ratio 244 Pu/ A Pu where A Pu (A = 236 or 242) is a spike of known amount (added during the chemical processing of the sample) from which the number of 244 Pu nuclei in the sample is obtained (see Methods). In addition to 244 Pu counting, we also measured the shorter lived 239 Pu (t 1/2 = 24.1 ky) content as an indicator of anthropogenic Pu signature.

### Learning meaningful representations of protein sequences [^6646110e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

How we choose to represent our data has a fundamental impact on our ability to subsequently extract information from them. Machine learning promises to automatically determine efficient representations from large unstructured datasets, such as those arising in biology. However, empirical evidence suggests that seemingly minor changes to these machine learning models yield drastically different data representations that result in different biological interpretations of data. This begs the question of what even constitutes the most meaningful representation. Here, we approach this question for representations of protein sequences, which have received considerable attention in the recent literature. We explore two key contexts in which representations naturally arise: transfer learning and interpretable learning. In the first context, we demonstrate that several contemporary practices yield suboptimal performance, and in the latter we demonstrate that taking representation geometry into account significantly improves interpretability and lets the models reveal biological information that is otherwise obscured.

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^bb9b7f12]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

After n refinement steps, we thus obtain a functiondefined at discrete points:which we extend to the entire interval [0, 1) by linear interpolation; see Fig. 5 d for an illustration. In practice we found that computations (specifically the risk computed by integrating) converge after about eight refinement steps.

This procedure has the important property that once a point is sampled, it does not change on further refinements:which follows from equation (67). Recall now that, as stated above, a process is self-consistent if "for small enough Δ Φ, the probability distribution at a point Φ [does] not depend on the level of refinement". Since equation (70) clearly satisfies that requirement, we see that the process obtained after infinitely many refinement steps is indeed self-consistent. We thus define the hierarchical beta (HB) process as

To complete the definition of, we need to specify how we choose the initial end pointsand. In our implementation, they are drawn from normal distributionswith Φ ∈ {0, 1}, where again c is determined via our proposed calibration procedure; this is simple and convenient, but otherwise arbitrary. We also need to explain how we choose the beta parameters α and β, which is the topic of the next subsection.

Choosing beta distribution parameters

All HB processes are monotone, continuous and self-consistent, but within this class there is still a lot of flexibility: since α and β are chosen independently for each subinterval, we can mouldinto a wide variety of statistical shapes. We use this flexibility to satisfy the two remaining desiderata: a) that realisationstrackover Φ ∈ [0, 1]; and b) that the variability ofbe proportional to. It is the goal of this subsection to give a precise mathematical meaning to those requirements.

Let x 1 ~ Beta(α, β) and x 2 = 1 − x 1. (The density function of a beta distribution is given in (24).) The mean and variance of x 1 areFor a given Φ, it may seem natural to select α and β by matchingtoandto. However both equations are tightly coupled, and we found that numerical solutions were unstable and unsatisfactory; in particular, it is not possible to make the variance large whenapproaches either 0 or 1 (otherwise the distribution of x 1 would exceed [0, 1]).

### Word contexts enhance the neural representation of individual letters in early visual cortex [^8a53b56c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Here, W is a (n by m) matrix of feedforward weights that map inputs onto latent causes (e.g. letters), ⊗ denotes pointwise multiplication, square brackets represents a max operator and ∈ 1 is set at 1 × 10 −6. Each row of W maps the pattern of inputs to a specific prediction unit representing a specific latent cause (such as the letter) and can hence be thought of as the 'preferred stimulus' or basis vector for that prediction unit. The entire W matrix is then best thought of as comprising the layer's model of its environment. Finally, from the distribution of activities of the prediction units (y), the reconstruction of expected input features (r) is calculated as a simple linear generative model:where V is a (m by n) matrix of feedback weights that map predicted latent causes (e.g. letters) back to their elementary features (e.g. strokes) to create an internal reconstruction of the predicted input, given the current state estimate. As in many multilayer networks, the model adheres to a form of weight symmetry: V is almost identical to W T, but its values are values normalised so that each column sums to one. To perform inference, prediction units can be initialised at zero (or with random values) and the Eqs. (2–4) are updated iteratively. To perform top–down hierarchical inference, reconstructions from a higher-order stage (e.g. recognising words) can be sent back to the lower-order stage (e.g. recognising letters) as additional input. To accommodate these recurrent inputs, additional weights have to be defined that are added to W and V as extra columns and rows, respectively. The strength of these weights is scaled to control the reliance on top–down predictions.

### Spectroscopic identification of water emission from a main-belt comet [^d3ddd529]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Spectra for H 2 O and CO 2 were generated for a fixed production rate using the above model. We used a least-squares method to fit the continuum (modelled as a first- or second-order polynomial) and gas emission. Uncertainties were derived using the bootstrap technique and the spectral uncertainties. This was sufficient for fitting the water band, but the CO 2 band upper limit required consideration of correlated noise in the spectrum. Correlated noise is typical of integral field spectrometers, and we estimated the data covariance with the Gaussian Processes techniqueusing the George Python package. Uncertainties based on the five-parameter fit (production rate, two polynomial coefficients and two data correlation parameters) were derived with the Emcee Python package. All four spectra were consistent with a non-detection for CO 2 and we report results fitting a combined spectrum. The average column density of H 2 O and CO 2 molecules within a 0.3″ radius aperture is calculated to be 2.11 × 10 16 m −2 and less than 1 × 10 14 m −2, respectively, and the production rates are = (9.88 ± 0.10) × 10 24 molecules s −1 and < 7 × 10 22 molecules s −1 (excluding the 10% calibration uncertainty). The CO 2 limit is based on the one-sided 99.7% confidence limit (approximately equivalent to a 3 σ upper limit).

Sublimation model

An ice sublimation model, may be used to better understand the mass-loss process. We use the production rate of H 2 O to calculate the effective active area on the surface of comet Read. Two versions of the model were used: the slow rotator model, in which every part of the surface of the comet is in instantaneous equilibrium with incident solar radiation; and the rapid rotator model, in which the nucleus rotation rate is so high that parallels of latitude become isotherms. The two models provide lower and upper limits to the inferred active area, provided that the obliquity of the rapid rotator model is 0°. For our analysis, we assume the Bond albedo for the surface to be 0.05 and the infrared emissivity to be 1. We use a sphere with a radius of 0.24 km (ref.) to calculate the active surface fraction. The results of our calculations are presented in Extended Data Table 1.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^f050c80c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Defining the general beta and gamma distribution

One limitation of the method so far is that the beta and gamma distributions are constrained to a given fixed range of values. The gamma distribution is constrained to the positive real numbers, with a zero lower bound. Meanwhile, the beta distribution is constrained to the real numbers within the interval [0, 1]. These constraints limit the variety of variables that can be modelled by the gamma and beta distributions. For this reason, here we define general variants of both distributions such that variables with any lower or upper bound can be modelled and δ can be retrieved. Rather than modifying the pdfs and cdfs directly to allow for any lower or upper bound, we defined methods for indexing the functions and for calculating the variance and mean for the distributions from observations of a variable (V) with any lower (L) or upper (U) bound.

### Validation of monte carlo estimates of three-class ideal observer operating points for normal data [^26b6e5d9]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Traditional two-class receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is inadequate for the complete evaluation of observer performance in tasks with more than two classes.

Materials and Methods

Here, a Monte Carlo estimation method for operating point coordinates on a three-class ROC surface is developed and compared with analytically calculated coordinates in two special cases: (1) univariate and (2) restricted bivariate trinormal underlying data.

Results

In both cases, the statistical estimates were found to be good in the sense that the analytical values lay within the 95% confidence interval of the estimated values about 95% of the time.

Conclusions

The statistical estimation method should be key in the development of a pragmatic performance metric for evaluation of observers in classification tasks with three or more classes.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^1078e4fd]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Reconstructing meaning from bits of information [^4ff875aa]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The overall level of classification accuracy using the semantic coordinates of the unpresented target objects was high, ranging from 76.1% to 93.3% correct classifications across subjects (mean = 87.2%, SD = 4.9; Fig. 2, see also Supplementary Table 1). The null-distribution for chance level performance was determined through a permutation test in which the relationship of each feature vector and its target was randomized in the training set. This process was iterated 1000 times, each time using a randomly selected participant's brain activation data. Based on the resulting distribution, decoding accuracies > 61.5% were deemed significantly better than chance (p < 0.05); this threshold was exceeded by a comfortable margin for all subjects.

Fig. 2
Decoding performance using different models. For each model, the raw data points are indicated as a jittered scatter plot on the left side of the summary boxplot and in the same color. Here, each dot represents the decoding accuracy across all pairwise-classifications (n = 64,620) for one participant using a given model. Central tendencies for each model are illustrated as a boxplot (the band indicates the median, the box indicates the first and third quartiles and the whiskers indicate ± 1.5 × interquartile range). The black triangle within each box indicates the mean decoding accuracy across participants. The level of significant decoding performance (p < 0.05, based on a permutation test) is marked as a dashed line. The significance of the pairwise two-sided t -tests (Bonferroni-corrected for the number of pairwise comparisons performed) between the mean accuracy scores of the different models is indicated on top (✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱✱ p < 0.001, ns = nonsignificant)

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### Notation-dependent and-independent representations of numbers in the parietal lobes [^fe5e94d3]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

It is a commonly held view that numbers are represented in an abstract way in both parietal lobes. This view is based on failures to find differences between various notational representations. Here we show that by using relatively smaller voxels together with an adaptation paradigm and analyzing subjects on an individual basis it is possible to detect specialized numerical representations. The current results reveal a left/right asymmetry in parietal lobe function. In contrast to an abstract representation in the left parietal lobe, the numerical representation in the right parietal lobe is notation dependent and thus includes nonabstract representations. Our results challenge the commonly held belief that numbers are represented solely in an abstract way in the human brain.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you,' and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Disentangling dispersion from mean reveals true heterogeneity-diversity relationships [^73c951cd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

In these methods, our objective was to demonstrate that δ is a mean-independent measure of statistical dispersion for bounded continuous variables, that other commonly used measures of heterogeneity (of which statistical dispersion is a subset) are dependent on and, thus, inherently biased by the mean, and that this bias has, in past work, resulted in spurious observed heterogeneity relationships with other variables.

Mean-heterogeneity relationships for the standard beta and gamma distribution

Here we introduce the gamma and beta distributions for modelling lower- and double-bounded variables, respectively. For both distributions, the most frequently used heterogeneity measures have analytical derivations based solely on the parameters of the distribution, which we can use to observe mean-heterogeneity relationships without being subject to feature relationships or chance. Additionally, both distributions can be evaluated in terms of a scale/dispersion parameter that influences the spread of observations in the distribution. A parameter is interpreted as a scale/dispersion parameter when, for a constant mean, increases in the parameter always correspond to increases in the variance. We can, therefore, fix the dispersion parameter, modify the mean, and observe the mean-heterogeneity relationships. We, then, derive a method of retrieving the dispersion parameter of the gamma and beta distribution, which we denote δ L and δ 2, respectively (with the subscript referring to the type of bounds, see Equations (2) and (3)).

### Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature [^c2839cb4]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases 1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing 3–10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings 11–13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.

### Spectroscopic identification of water emission from a main-belt comet [^7d7ba805]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Insight into the mass-loss process may be gained through an estimate of the sublimating surface area. With a cometary nucleus water–ice sublimation model, we compute an active area of 0.03–0.11 km 2 (Methods). The active area corresponds to the cumulative area of hypothetical pure water-ice patches distributed about the surface and in contact with low-albedo material. The calculated range results from the unknown thermal properties and rotation state of the nucleus, quantified by the slow rotator and rapid rotator nucleus models. The slow rotator model predicts peak water production at the subsolar point on the nuclear surface with no night-time production. The rapid rotator model would have water production equally distributed along latitudinal bands throughout the day and night hemispheres. On the basis of the observed sunward asymmetry of the water coma, we consider the slow rotator model, and therefore the lower active area, to be more appropriate. Typical comets have active fractions (the ratio of active area and surface area) less than or similar to 10%. With an effective radius of the nucleus, R = 0.24 ± 0.05 km (ref.), the comet's nuclear active fraction is approximately 4–15%. Therefore, comet Read's water production rate is commensurate with its small size and the typical surface characteristics of comets.

### A neural parametric code for storing information of more than one sensory modality in working memory [^4eccf81b]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Working memory, a well-studied cognitive function, refers to the capacity to remember things for a short time. Which neurons in the brain implement this function and how exactly they do it are unresolved questions. Here we show that, in a cortical area that participates in the analysis of perceptual experiences, the same neurons encode both tactile and acoustic information in working memory, and do so using the same representation for both modalities. This means that memory circuits in this area are dedicated to encoding information in a relatively abstract format that had not been revealed until now.

### Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid vesta by the dawn mission [^4f15d754]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

With regard to spacecraft velocity, the SPICE ephemerides containing Dawn's state vector were released by the optical navigation team in 2012before the peer-reviewed publication of Vesta's gravitational solution in 2014. Hence, Dawn's reconstructed trajectory does not include variations in orbital velocity due to the heterogeneous gravity field that exhibits accelerations between −1000 mGal and +2000 mGal (−1 cm s −2 and +2 cm s −2) relative to the homogeneous model. Since each frequency spectrum produced in our BSR analysis is averaged over 5-s observations, unpredicted gravitational accelerations contribute –5 to +10 cm s −1 uncertainty in Dawn's velocity vector.

The rotational velocity of the echo site on Vesta's surface depends on the distance of the site from Vesta's center and the rotation period, the latter of which is known to high precision. Given the large extent of surface area illuminated by the HGA beam on Vesta, we use the radius at the center of the echo site to calculate a representative rotational velocity. During occultation entry of orbit 355, uncertainty of ± 0.5 km in the radius yields an uncertainty of ± 16 cm s −1 in the echo site's rotational velocity.

Using the above-derived uncertainties in the positions and velocities of each body, we calculate the propagation of error into each line-of-sight velocity between Dawn, the surface echo site on Vesta, and the antenna on Earth that contribute to the calculation of theoretical δf. Uncertainty in the velocity of body A projected along the line of site with body B is calculated from the propagation of error in (1) the velocity vector of A, (2) the position of A, and (3) the position of B. Hence, the theoretical differential Doppler shift is calculated to range between ~2 and 20 Hz, and is consistent the observed δf of –12 Hz (Fig. 1b) for the surface echo measured during orbit 355, occultation entry.

### Interdependence between body surface area and ultraviolet B dose in vitamin D production: a randomized controlled trial [^2f7fd39b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ultraviolet (UV) B radiation increases serum vitamin D level expressed as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D(3) [25(OH)D], but the relationship to body surface area and UVB dose needs investigation.

Objective

To investigate the importance of body surface area and UVB dose on vitamin D production after UVB exposure.

Methods

We randomized 92 participants to have 6%, 12% or 24% of their skin exposed to 0·75 (7·5 mJ cm(-2) at 298 nm using the CIE erythema action spectrum), 1·5 (15 mJ cm(-2)) or 3·0 (30 mJ cm(-2)) standard erythema doses (SED) of UVB. Each participant underwent four UVB exposures at intervals of 2–3 days. Skin pigmentation and 25(OH)D levels were measured before and 48 h after the final exposure.

Results

The increase in 25(OH)D after irradiation [Δ25(OH)D] was positively correlated with body surface area (P = 0·006; R(2) = 0·08) and UVB dose (P < 0·0001; R(2) = 0·28), and negatively correlated with baseline 25(OH)D (P < 0·0001; R(2) = 0·18), for the entire data sample. However, when analysing each body surface area separately, we found a significant UVB response correlation for 6% (P < 0·0001; R(2) = 0·48) and 12% (P = 0·0004; R(2) = 0·35), but not for 24%. We also found a significant skin area response correlation for 0·75 SED (P < 0·0001; R(2) = 0·56), but not for 1·5 and 3·0 SED when analysing each UVB dose separately. The relationships did not change significantly after adjustment of Δ25(OH)D for baseline 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The increase in 25(OH)D depends mainly on the UVB dose; however, for small UVB doses the area of irradiated body surface is important.

### Neural dynamics of phoneme sequences reveal position-invariant code for content and order [^bc534d98]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

An important theoretical point is that we are decoding features of each phoneme rather than decoding phoneme categories per se. However, when decoding phoneme categories instead of features, we observe very similar results (see supplementary Fig. 14).

Figure 1B summarises the result of the neural analysis. Confirming previous studies, phonetic features were decodable on average between 50–300 ms from the MEG signal and accounted for 46.2% of variance explained by the full suite of 31 features. Performance averaged across features was statistically greater than chance, as confirmed with a temporal permutation cluster test, based upon a one-sample t-test (df = 20) applied at each time-sample (p < 0.001; critical t averaged over time = 3.61). Information theoretic measures such as surprisal, entropy, and log sequence frequency accounted for 14.5% of explainable variance, which was also statistically better than chance on average (−10–540 ms; p < 0.001; t = 2.98). Positional properties such as location in the word explained 31% of variance, and showed the greatest individual effect sizes (−120–600 ms; p < 0.001; t = 5.61). Here, phoneme order is coded the same for all phonemes regardless of feature. Finding a significant effect of phoneme order therefore suggests that order is represented independently from phonemic content, and is the same for all phonemes regardless of the features they contain. The remaining variance was accounted for by boundary onset/offset features (0–410 ms; p < 0.001; t = 3.1).

### A simple permutation-based test of intermodal correspondence [^4a8f1824]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Many key findings in neuroimaging studies involve similarities between brain maps, but statistical methods used to measure these findings have varied. Current state-of-the-art methods involve comparing observed group-level brain maps (after averaging intensities at each image location across multiple subjects) against spatial null models of these group-level maps. However, these methods typically make strong and potentially unrealistic statistical assumptions, such as covariance stationarity. To address these issues, in this article we propose using subject-level data and a classical permutation testing framework to test and assess similarities between brain maps. Our method is comparable to traditional permutation tests in that it involves randomly permuting subjects to generate a null distribution of intermodal correspondence statistics, which we compare to an observed statistic to estimate a p-value. We apply and compare our method in simulated and real neuroimaging data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We show that our method performs well for detecting relationships between modalities known to be strongly related (cortical thickness and sulcal depth), and it is conservative when an association would not be expected (cortical thickness and activation on the n-back working memory task). Notably, our method is the most flexible and reliable for localizing intermodal relationships within subregions of the brain and allows for generalizable statistical inference.

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.

### Adaptation to feedback representation of illusory orientation produced from flash grab effect [^bc16d341]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The difference in time series were tested for statistical significance at population level using cluster-based permutation test, which corrected for multiple comparisons. Values at individual time points were first subjected to mass univariate t-test with cluster-defining threshold set to p < 0.05 (or | r | > 0.5 for correlation analysis). The resulted contiguous suprathreshold intervals, in which statistics were of the same sign, were defined as clusters. For cross-decoding matrix, 2D clusters were defined on regular lattice. These clusters had to further pass a critical value in "cluster mass" before reported as significant. Cluster mass is the sum of t values in the cluster. The critical values were obtained with the following procedure: (1) randomly permute left or right labels for each subject, apply mass univariate t -test, calculate cluster mass for each cluster, and record the max and min cluster mass values; (2) repeat the above for 10,000 times or all possible permutations, and construct the empirical distribution for max and min values; (3) take the 97.5 and 2.5 percentiles of the max and min distributions, respectively, as the critical values for a two-tailed test. The confidence interval of population mean time courses as well as instantaneous inter-subject correlation was estimated using the bootstrap technique by resampling the subjects with replacement for 1000 times.

### Concerns regarding… [^70dc23c9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Controversy about hyperparameter optimization of various machine learning models

In this study, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not described, even though different combinations of hyperparameters are crucial for model building and validation.

In the field of machine learning, using default hyperparameters may not be suitable for specific datasets. Lack of hyperparameter optimization can prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, leading to less stable performance, high heterogeneity, and insufficient robustness, which negatively affects model building and generalization. Different combinations of hyperparameters significantly impact the predictive efficacy of the model. Failure to adequately perform hyperparameter optimization may result in models that do not achieve optimal predictive efficacy. This causes selection bias in the model and ultimately leads to incorrect decisions.

Machine learning is prone to model overfitting and poor generalization if the built-in hyperparameters are not properly set. Therefore, hyperparameter optimization in the field of machine learning is a scientific, rigorous, and reliable practice.

### Promoting optimal development: screening for behavioral and emotional problems [^b2b5af0c]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Barriers to screening — practice constraints and provider confidence — are highlighted, including that "Pediatricians report a lack of confidence in their training and ability to successfully manage children's behavioral and emotional problems with only 13% of pediatricians reporting confidence." Additional challenges include "lack of time, long waits for children to be seen by mental health providers, and lack of available mental health providers to refer children," and "Liability issues have been identified as a barrier to screening and managing children with behavioral and emotional problems." Pediatricians have also "raised concerns about the increasing number of mandates outlined in practice guidelines with ever-shrinking time for health maintenance visits as a result of reimbursement pressures."

### Temozolomide [^e4160480]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

 Maintenance Phase Treatment Schedule

Four weeks after completing the temozolomide and radiotherapy phase, administer temozolomide for an additional 6 cycles of maintenance treatment. Dosage in Cycle 1 (maintenance) is 150 mg/m2once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment. At the start of Cycle 2, escalate the dose to 200 mg/m2, if the nonhematologic adverse reactions for Cycle 1 are Grade less than or equal to 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than or equal to 1.5 × 109/L, and the platelet count is greater than or equal to 100 × 109/L. If the dose was not escalated at Cycle 2, do not escalate the dose in subsequent cycles. Maintain the dose at 200 mg/m2per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs.

During treatment, obtain a complete blood count on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 × 109/L (1,500/µL) and the platelet count exceeds 100 × 109/L (100,000/µL). Do not start the next cycle of temozolomide until the ANC and platelet count exceed these levels. Base dose reductions during the next cycle on the lowest blood counts and worst nonhematologic adverse reactions during the previous cycle. Apply dose reductions or discontinuations during the maintenance phase [see Table 2 in the Full Prescribing Information, Recommended Dosage and Dosage Modifications for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (2.1)].

### MGluR5 receptor availability is associated with lower levels of negative symptoms and better cognition in male patients with chronic schizophrenia [^1fc480ba]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.3 Letter‐number span

In the Letter–Number Span (LNS; Gold, Carpenter, Randolph, Goldberg, & Weinberger, 1997), the tester verbally presents increasingly longer sequences of intermixed numbers and letters at a rate of one per second. After each sequence, the participant is asked to repeat the numbers in ascending order first, and then the letters in alphabetical order. The letter–number sequences range from two up to a maximum length of seven stimuli. Four trials are presented for each length of the sequence. The test is discontinued when the subject fails four consecutive trials of the same length. One point is scored for each correctly repeated sequence (maximum total score is 24 points). This test measures the performance of the working memory.

2.3.4 Corsi block‐tapping task

The Corsi block‐tapping task (Corsi, 1973) is a simple and powerful test used for the assessment of deficits in immediate nonverbal memory and for clarifying theoretical conceptions of visuospatial memory (Berch, Krikorian, & Huha, 1998). The original Corsi apparatus consisted of a set of nine identical blocks (3 × 3 × 3 cm) irregularly positioned on a wooden board (23 × 28 cm). The experimenter points to a series of blocks at a rate of one block per second. Subsequently, the participant is required to point to the same blocks in their order of presentation. The length of the block sequences increases until recall is no longer correct (Vandierendonck, Kemps, Fastame, & Szmalec, 2004). The final test scores represent a sum of correct recalls performed forward and backward.

2.3.5 Rey visual design learning test

The Rey visual design learning test (RVDLT; Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006) is an instrument that assesses immediate memory span, new learning, and recognition memory for nonverbal material (Wilhelm, 2004). Fifteen cards with geometric figures are presented over five learning trials, with immediate recall tested after each presentation. The total score is the number of correctly memorized items reproduced by means of drawings in the trials and a delayed recall test. In the recognition test, subjects are asked to pick the target items from a set of 30 items, which contains 15 targets and 15 nontargets.

### Promoting optimal development: screening for behavioral and emotional problems [^a33cea56]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Family psychosocial risk screening — association, tools, feasibility, and dilemmas: children's behavioral and emotional problems are frequently associated with family psychosocial risk, and family psychosocial screening can provide important information about potential protection or lack thereof for a child who may or may not yet show signs of behavioral or emotional problems. Early detection and treatment of family psychosocial risk may potentially avert the emergence of problems in the child. Only a limited number of well-validated screens suitable for use in primary care for broad screening of family psychosocial risk and family support and functioning are available, although a few show promise. There are screening measures for specific psychosocial stressors, such as maternal depression, and these have been shown to be feasible in pediatric settings, while family screening for psychosocial risk within pediatric settings, however, raises a number of dilemmas, including concerns about liability and payment and who is responsible for an adult's well-being after a problem is detected.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^da0a3408]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Sustainable oxygen evolution electrocatalysis in aqueous 1 M HSOwith earth abundant nanostructured CoO [^7633c6a3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To prove the general importance of this protective strategy, typical oxides based on Ni, Co, and Fe, which were active in alkaline solution but unstable in acid for oxygen evolution, were synthesized and then their electrochemical performances were measured in 1 M H 2 SO 4 (Supplementary Fig. 21). It was showed that all of these oxides were active for oxygen evolution and kept their performance at 10 mA cm –2 during 2 h catalysis with the small change of ≤ 13 mV (Supplementary Fig. 22).

We also compared the activity/stability of Co 3 O 4 @C vs. Co 3 O 4 (Supplementary Fig. 10). The corresponding x-Co 3 O 4 /GPO electrodes showed good stability during preliminary CV cycles and chronopotentiometry measurement, but at higher overpotentials. A 5 mF cm –2 EDLC was determined, just 1/5 that of Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO (Supplementary Fig. 13). Specific surface area from N 2 sorption isotherm curves for Co 3 O 4 @C was also about five times greater than that of Co 3 O 4 (Supplementary Fig. 23). These results suggest that the role of the carbon coating is to improve the nanostructuration of the active Co 3 O 4 material.

In addition, the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO, Co 3 O 4 /GPO, and IrO 2 /GPO electrodes were studied by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) at different applied potentials. Supplementary Fig. 24 shows the obtained Nyquist plots, which systematically feature two arcs (or distorted arc for IrO 2), consistent with two simultaneous/consecutive charge-transfer channels. Fitting the experimental data to a suitable equivalent circuit model (Supplementary Fig. 25) revealed that the best ohmic contact (reflected by the series resistance, R S) is obtained for the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO (Supplementary Fig. 25a). On the other hand, the charge transfer resistance (R ct), scales inversely with the electrocatalytic activity of the different electrodes, being the lowest one for the Co 3 O 4 @C/GPO electrode (Supplementary Fig. 25b). This is consistent with the estimated surface capacitance, which scales with electrode performance, as a result of higher surface area and hence, higher density of catalytic sites (Supplementary Fig. 25c).

### Comparing aberration detection methods with simulated data [^2cb325da]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We compared aberration detection methods requiring historical data to those that require little background by using simulated data. Methods that require less historical data are as sensitive and specific as those that require 3–5 years of data. These simulations can determine which method produces appropriate sensitivity and specificity.

### Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-25 years of progress [^600234fb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute lymphoblastic leukemia:

- **Definition**: ALL is a hematological malignancy that originates from B- or T-lymphoid progenitor cells and is characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells within the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ALL is complex and involves a variety of genetic abnormalities that disrupt normal cell maturation and promote the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ALL is estimated at 1.8 per 100,000 person-years in the US and 2.75 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.
- **Disease course**: ALL typically presents with symptoms such as fever, pallor, bleeding, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Patients may also have lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In some cases, musculoskeletal manifestations may be the only initial presenting symptom.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is based on age at diagnosis, WBC count at presentation, and the presence of certain genetic changes. The outcome for older adults (≥ 40 years) and patients with relapsed or refractory ALL remains poor.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### Prior ground: selection of prior distributions when analyzing clinical trial data using Bayesian methods [^0094e5c2]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Increasingly, investigators are choosing to use Bayesian methods for the analysis of clinical trial data. Unlike classical statistical methods that treat model parameter values (such as treatment effects) as fixed, Bayesian methods view parameters as following a probability distribution. As we have written previously, 1 by analyzing clinical trial data using Bayesian methods one can obtain quantities that may be of interest to clinicians, providers, and patients, such as the probability that a treatment effect is more or less than 0, that is, the probability that a treatment is effective.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^e30d71d8]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend to use a multi-step approach in adult patients with MASLD:

- obtain an established non-patented blood-based score, such as the fibrosis-4 index, as the first step

- obtain established imaging techniques, such as liver elastography, as the second step to further clarify the fibrosis stage if fibrosis is still suspected or in high-risk groups.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^af90569d]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Creative problem-solving is central in daily life, yet its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Restructuring (i.e. reorganization of problem-related representations) is considered one problem-solving mechanism and may lead to an abstract problem-related representation facilitating the solving of analogous problems. Here, we used network science methodology to estimate participants' semantic memory networks (SemNets) before and after attempting to solve a riddle. Restructuring was quantified as the difference in SemNets metrics between pre- and post-solving phases. Our results provide initial evidence that problem-related SemNets restructuring may be associated with the successful solving of the riddle and, subsequently, an analogous one. Solution-relevant concepts and semantically remote concepts became more strongly related in solvers. Only changes in semantically remote concepts were instrumental in actively solving the riddle while changes in solution-relevant concepts may reflect a pre-exposure to the solution.
