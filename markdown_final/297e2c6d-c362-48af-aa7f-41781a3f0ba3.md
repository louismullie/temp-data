## Question

What is the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated ABRS in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "uncomplicated ABRS" means and when antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify the most current guideline recommendations on duration. Next, I will check whether a shorter 5-day course is as effective as longer regimens. After that, I need to consider when a 7-day course might be appropriate. I will also examine safety trade-offs, including adverse effects and resistance. Finally, I should review what to do if the patient is not improving and ensure the antibiotic choice aligns with guidance before summarizing the practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Uncomplicated ABRS in adults is typically defined as symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis persisting without improvement for at least 10 days, or worsening after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or severe onset with high fever and purulent discharge/facial pain for at least 3 consecutive days. Importantly, there is no extension beyond the sinonasal cavity and no immunocompromise, which would change management decisions [^114jTpcF] [^111CQxJn] [^116pDK81].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving antibiotics. I should confirm when antibiotics are actually indicated, because most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are viral and self-limited. High-quality guidelines emphasize reserving antibiotics for those meeting bacterial criteria or for patients who fail watchful waiting, given the small average benefit and higher adverse event rates with antibiotics; delayed prescribing strategies reduce unnecessary antibiotic use without worsening outcomes, so I need to ensure I'm not over-treating before deciding on duration [^112WnXrG] [^1113PHUr] [^117LcnhV].

> Next, I should review the most current guideline consensus on duration. The 2025 AAO-HNSF adult sinusitis guideline update explicitly recommends 5–7 days of empiric antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated ABRS, down from the older 5–10 day range, reflecting evidence that 5 days performs as well as longer courses and is preferred for most adults to reduce adverse effects [^116tfRog] [^1121iV3s] [^116F9atb].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence behind "shorter is better". A systematic review cited by the 2025 guideline found no difference in clinical success between 3–7 days and 6–10 days and similar success when 5 days were compared with 10 days; additionally, 5-day therapy reduced adverse events versus 10 days, which strengthens the preference for shorter courses in routine cases [^11618bS1]. Observational and implementation data also show many clinicians still prescribe 10+ days, even though guidelines have moved to 5–7, underscoring an opportunity to align practice with evidence and stewardship [^114ch8sU].

> I will now examine whether a 5-day course is sufficient for most adults. Trials and meta-analyses show 5-day regimens, including a randomized comparison of 5 versus 7 days of gemifloxacin, achieve comparable clinical response, and contemporary guidance interprets this as supporting a 5-day default for uncomplicated disease, reserving 7 days for more severe or persistent presentations. Patient-specific factors and trajectory of illness can guide where within 5–7 days to land [^116a3KM2] [^116tfRog] [^1121iV3s].

> But wait, what if the illness is more severe or slow to respond. Let me consider the higher end of the range. For adults with more severe symptoms, slower clinical response, or comorbid risk factors, extending to 7 days may be reasonable, though routine use of 10 days is no longer recommended; IDSA's 5–7 day guidance is consistent with this, and AAO-HNS notes that a longer course may be appropriate if symptoms persist beyond 5 days or severity warrants, emphasizing shared decision-making about duration [^116tfRog] [^116tfRog].

> I need to ensure I'm balancing benefits and harms correctly. Antibiotics confer only a modest average benefit in uncomplicated ABRS, whereas adverse events are substantially more common than with placebo. Shortening to 5 days reduces exposure and adverse effects without sacrificing efficacy, aligning with stewardship and patient-centered safety [^117LcnhV] [^11618bS1].

> Next, I should review what to do if the patient is not improving, because duration alone won't salvage an inadequate regimen or missed diagnosis. If there is clinical worsening after 48–72 hours or lack of improvement by 3–5 days on appropriate therapy, guidelines advise reassessing the diagnosis, excluding mimics or complications, and changing therapy; that reassessment window helps prevent unnecessarily prolonging a failing course and ensures timely escalation if needed [^114cefYD] [^11271JBL] [^115uv8ic].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line agent choice to make sure the duration advice is coherent with the regimen. For most adults, amoxicillin is first-line for 5–7 days; amoxicillin–clavulanate is reasonable when resistance risk is higher or if there is treatment failure, with doxycycline as an alternative in penicillin allergy; macrolides and TMP/SMX are discouraged empirically due to resistance, so the duration recommendation assumes an agent with appropriate coverage [^115meHhE] [^113fDDiV] [^115uv8ic] [^114uzHSQ] [^115oMEci].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls. Initially, I thought 7–10 days might still be broadly acceptable based on older guidance, but I should correct that; the most recent high-credibility guidance has narrowed the recommended adult duration to 5–7 days, favoring 5 days for most, and that is the most evidence-concordant and stewardship-aligned position today [^116tfRog] [^1121iV3s].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is: for uncomplicated ABRS in adults who meet bacterial criteria or have failed appropriate watchful waiting, prescribe an antibiotic for 5–7 days, with 5 days as the default for most, and extend to 7 days for more severe illness, slower response, or patient-specific factors, using amoxicillin as first-line when appropriate and reassessing at 3–5 days if not improving to confirm the diagnosis and adjust therapy [^116tfRog] [^1121iV3s] [^112oTYQQ] [^114cefYD].

The recommended duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in adults is **5–7 days** [^114ySuUW]. Shorter courses (5 days) are as effective as longer courses (7–10 days) and are preferred to reduce adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^115Lxx2S] [^11618bS1]. If symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days of therapy, reassess and consider changing the antibiotic or extending the course based on clinical judgment [^116tfRog] [^1164iXc9].

---

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses

Recent studies and guidelines support **shorter antibiotic courses** for uncomplicated ABRS in adults:

- **AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines**: Recommend 5–7 days of antibiotics for uncomplicated ABRS, emphasizing shorter courses to minimize adverse effects and resistance [^11618bS1].

- **IDSA 2012 guidelines**: Recommend 5–7 days of antibiotics for adult ABRS, aligning with the AAO-HNSF recommendations [^114ySuUW].

- **Meta-analyses and systematic reviews**: Multiple studies have demonstrated that 5-day antibiotic courses are as effective as longer courses (7–10 days) in treating uncomplicated ABRS, with fewer adverse effects and lower resistance rates [^115Lxx2S] [^116a3KM2].

---

## Clinical outcomes of shorter vs. longer antibiotic courses

Clinical outcomes of **shorter antibiotic courses** (5 days) compared with longer courses (7–10 days) show no significant differences in clinical cure, symptom resolution, or recurrence rates, while **shorter courses** are associated with fewer adverse effects — including gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions, and antibiotic resistance — and reduced costs and improved adherence.

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic duration

Several factors may influence the **duration of antibiotic therapy** in uncomplicated ABRS:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, immunocompromised status, and severity of symptoms may necessitate longer courses (up to 7–10 days) in select cases [^116tfRog].

- **Clinical response**: If symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days of therapy, reassess and consider changing the antibiotic or extending the course based on clinical judgment [^11271JBL] [^114cefYD].

- **Antibiotic choice**: First-line antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) are recommended for uncomplicated ABRS, with alternatives such as doxycycline or respiratory fluoroquinolones reserved for specific cases (e.g. penicillin allergy or treatment failure) [^115jUJP3] [^114uzHSQ].

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Recommended duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| AAO-HNSF 2025 | 5–7 days | - Shorter courses preferred <br/> - Reassess if no improvement in 3–5 days [^11618bS1] |
| IDSA 2012 | 5–7 days | - Shorter courses preferred <br/> - Reassess if no improvement in 3–5 days [^114ySuUW] |
| AAFP 2025 | 5–7 days | - Shorter courses preferred <br/> - Reassess if no improvement in 3–5 days [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The recommended duration of antibiotics for uncomplicated ABRS in adults is **5–7 days**, with shorter courses preferred to minimize adverse effects and antibiotic resistance. If symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days of therapy, reassess and consider changing the antibiotic or extending the course based on clinical judgment [^11618bS1].

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115uv8ic]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic Therapy for ABRS Following Initial Treatment Failures — In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), if a patient on antibiotics worsens or fails to improve within 3 to 5 days, drug-resistant infection should be considered and therapy switched with reevaluation; when changing therapy, clinicians should consider initial coverage limits, as amoxicillin-treated patients commonly have beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (60%), M. catarrhalis (58.3%), or penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (72%). Resistance can be significant, with minimum inhibitory concentration at least 2-fold higher observed in 49% of patients. For multidrug-resistant pathogens, options would include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g per day amoxicillin equivalent) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternative agents are available, but given the FDA black box warning regarding fluoroquinolones, the decision to use this class should be carefully thought out; oral cephalosporins and macrolides are predicted to offer inadequate coverage for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Safety and follow-up are emphasized: patients who fail antibiotics with a worsening pattern should be examined for complications and, if concerning findings are present, an urgent referral to an otolaryngologist or emergency department is warranted and CT sinuses, or MRI is indicated; a follow-up plan should be made between clinicians and patients.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part I. evaluation [^111DS9Ni]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory practice. Although often caused by viruses, it sometimes is caused by bacteria, a condition that is called acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The signs and symptoms of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and prolonged viral upper respiratory infection are similar, which makes accurate clinical diagnosis difficult. Because two thirds of patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis improve without antibiotic treatment and most patients with viral upper respiratory infection improve within seven d antibiotic therapy should be reserved for use in patients who have had symptoms for more than seven days and meet clinical criteria. Four signs and symptoms are the most helpful in predicting acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain (especially unilateral), unilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, and worsening symptoms after initial improvement. Sinus radiography and ultrasonography are not recommended in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, although computed tomography has a role in the care of patients with recurrent or chronic symptoms.

Introduction

The judicious use of antibiotics preserves millions of lives and safeguards numerous individuals from infectious complications annually. However, their continued viability is threatened by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which was responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Excessive and inappropriate antimicrobial use significantly contributes to this crisis. Research indicates a strong correlation between the consumption of antibiotics and the selection of resistant bacteria, both at societal and individual levels.

Primary care is responsible for about 80% of antibiotic prescriptions, and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for more than half of all antibiotic prescriptions globally. Given the limited development of new antibiotics, prudent antimicrobial utilisation, particularly in primary care, is crucial to mitigating the spread of AMR. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for uncomplicated RTIs is very common worldwide. In the UK around 50% of all general practice consultations for RTIs result in the prescription of an antibiotic, with a high variability across practices ranging from 20% to 80%. In a study comparing the rate of antibiotic prescribing for acute RTIs in Australian general practice from 2010 to 2015, it was found that antibiotics were prescribed at rates 4–9 times higher than those recommended by Australia's most widely used therapeutic guidelines. Even in the Netherlands, which has the lowest antibiotic use in Europe with slightly under ten defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, it is estimated that nearly half of RTI prescriptions are not in accordance with local guidelines. In the UK, more than half of the patients with acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis and sore throat seen in primary care are treated with antibiotics. In addition, in many regions around the world, antibiotics are accessible without prescriptions, as shown in a recent study of 38 studies across 24 countries, revealing 62% of non-prescription antibiotic dispensing, mostly for suspected RTIs. Despite being more prevalent in low-income countries, even in some high- and middle-income countries, non-prescription antibiotic provision is a concern. Most acute uncomplicated RTIs are caused by viruses and, in otherwise healthy adults, these infections are typically self-limiting and antibiotics provide no relevant benefits.

Background

Concerns exist regarding antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) owing to adverse reactions, cost and antibacterial resistance. One proposed strategy to reduce antibiotic prescribing is to provide prescriptions, but to advise delay in antibiotic use with the expectation that symptoms will resolve first. This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2007, and updated in 2010, 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects on duration and/or severity of clinical outcomes (pain, malaise, fever, cough and rhinorrhoea), antibiotic use, antibiotic resistance and patient satisfaction of advising a delayed prescription of antibiotics in respiratory tract infections.

Search Methods

From May 2017 until 20 August 2022, this was a living systematic review with monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 20 August 2022. Due to the abundance of evidence supporting the review's key findings, it ceased being a living systematic review on 21 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving participants of all ages with an RTI, where delayed antibiotics were compared to immediate or no antibiotics. We defined a delayed antibiotic as advice to delay the filling of an antibiotic prescription by at least 48 hours. We considered all RTIs regardless of whether antibiotics were recommended or not.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

For this 2022 update, we added one new trial enrolling 448 children (436 analysed) with uncomplicated acute RTIs. Overall, this review includes 12 studies with a total of 3968 participants, of which data from 3750 are available for analysis. These 12 studies involved acute RTIs including acute otitis media (three studies), streptococcal pharyngitis (three studies), cough (two studies), sore throat (one study), common cold (one study) and a variety of RTIs (two studies). Six studies involved only children, two only adults and four included both adults and children. Six studies were conducted in primary care, four in paediatric clinics and two in emergency departments. Studies were well reported and appeared to provide moderate-certainty evidence. Randomisation was not adequately described in two trials. Four trials blinded the outcome assessor, and three included blinding of participants and doctors. We conducted meta-analyses for pain, malaise, fever, adverse effects, antibiotic use and patient satisfaction. Cough (four studies): we found no differences amongst delayed, immediate and no prescribed antibiotics for clinical outcomes in any of the four studies. Sore throat (six studies): for the outcome of fever with sore throat, four of the six studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and two found no difference. For the outcome of pain related to sore throat, two studies favoured immediate antibiotics, and four found no difference. Two studies compared delayed antibiotics with no antibiotic for sore throat, and found no difference in clinical outcomes. Acute otitis media (four studies): two studies compared immediate with delayed antibiotics - one found no difference for fever, and the other favoured immediate antibiotics for pain and malaise severity on Day 3. Two studies compared delayed with no antibiotics: one found no difference for pain and fever severity on Day 3, and the other found no difference for the number of children with fever on Day 3. Common cold (two studies): neither study found differences for clinical outcomes between delayed and immediate antibiotic groups. One study found delayed antibiotics were probably favoured over no antibiotics for pain, fever and cough duration (moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Effects

there were either no differences for adverse effects or results may have favoured delayed over immediate antibiotics with no significant differences in complication rates (low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic use: delayed antibiotics probably resulted in a reduction in antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; 8 studies, 2257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, a delayed antibiotic was probably more likely to result in reported antibiotic use than no antibiotics (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.69 to 3.75; 5 studies, 1529 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: patient satisfaction probably favoured delayed over no antibiotics (OR 1.45, 1.08 to 1.96; 5 studies, 1523 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in patient satisfaction between delayed and immediate antibiotics (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.29; 7 studies, 1927 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated antibiotic resistance. Reconsultation rates and use of alternative medicines were similar for delayed, immediate and no antibiotic strategies. In one of the four studies reporting use of alternative medicines, less paracetamol was used in the immediate group compared to the delayed group.

Authors' Conclusions

For many clinical outcomes, there were no differences between prescribing strategies. Symptoms for acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved by immediate antibiotics compared with delayed antibiotics. There were no differences in complication rates. Delaying prescribing did not result in significantly different levels of patient satisfaction compared with immediate provision of antibiotics (86% versus 91%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, delay was favoured over no antibiotics (87% versus 82%). Delayed antibiotics achieved lower rates of antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics (30% versus 93%). The strategy of no antibiotics further reduced antibiotic use compared to delaying prescription for antibiotics (13% versus 27%). Delayed antibiotics for people with acute respiratory infection reduced antibiotic use compared to immediate antibiotics, but was not shown to be different to no antibiotics in terms of symptom control and disease complications. Where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe antibiotics immediately for people with RTIs, no antibiotics with advice to return if symptoms do not resolve is likely to result in the least antibiotic use while maintaining similar patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes to delayed antibiotics. Where clinicians are not confident in not prescribing antibiotics, delayed antibiotics may be an acceptable compromise in place of immediate prescribing to significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for RTIs, while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction levels. Further research into antibiotic prescribing strategies for RTIs may best be focused on identifying patient groups at high risk of disease complications, enhancing doctors' communication with patients to maintain satisfaction, ways of increasing doctors' confidence to not prescribe antibiotics for RTIs, and policy measures to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for RTIs.

### Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: minimizing bacterial resistance [^112iN1Xj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens has become a common clinical problem that has serious public health implications. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) has contributed to the development of resistant microorganisms. Health care providers can help control the spread of resistance by limiting the use of antimicrobial agents to infections that meet clinical guidelines for a bacterial cause.

Objective

This article examines the means of accurately diagnosing and appropriately treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in an effort to control increasing levels of resistance.

Methods

This article discusses current treatment guidelines that provide the evidenced-based rationale for choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial agents for suspected ABRS in adults and children. An evidence-based approach can help minimize the public health threat posed by the continuing increase in microbial resistance.

Results

Although definitive clinical criteria that differentiate between ABRS and viral URTI are lacking, careful evaluation of the duration and severity of symptoms provides a rational basis for diagnosing ABRS in primary care settings.

Conclusions

Once a diagnosis of ABRS has been made, empiric antibiotic therapy may be justified. When it is, the first-line agent should be the narrowest spectrum antibiotic that would be expected to eradicate the most common causative organisms. The antibiotic selection process should take into account prevailing patterns of resistance and the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens, as well as published evidence-based guidelines.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in adults: part II. treatment [^11494ZaE]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Although most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viruses, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is a fairly common complication. Even though most patients with acute rhinosinusitis recover promptly without it, antibiotic therapy should be considered in patients with prolonged or more severe symptoms. To avoid the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, narrow-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin should be used for 10 to 14 days. In patients with mild disease who have beta-lactam allergy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline are options. Second-line antibiotics should be considered if the patient has moderate disease, recent antibiotic use (past six weeks), or no response to treatment within 72 hours. Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium and fluoroquinolones have the best coverage for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In patients with beta-lactam hypersensitivity who have moderate disease, a fluoroquinolone should be prescribed. The evidence supporting the use of ancillary treatments is limited. Decongestants often are recommended, and there is some evidence to support their use, although topical decongestants should not be used for more than three days to avoid rebound congestion. Topical ipratropium and the sedating antihistamines have anticholinergic effects that maybe beneficial, but there are no clinical studies supporting this possibility. Nasal irrigation with hypertonic and normal saline has been beneficial in chronic sinusitis and has no serious adverse effects. Nasal corticosteroids also may be beneficial in treating chronic sinusitis. Mist, zinc salt lozenges, echinacea extract, and vitamin C have no proven benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^114ch8sU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Evidence about the contribution of excessive treatment duration to antibiotic overuse in primary care is limited. A recent study from the US showed that more than two thirds of antibiotic courses for acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, whereas the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends treatment of uncomplicated cases for five to seven days. A small study from the Manitoba region in Canada, that focused on urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, skin or soft tissue infections, and pneumonia estimated that 15% of prescriptions with the appropriate antibiotic were for treatments longer than guideline based recommendations.

An up-to-date picture on prescribed antibiotic durations for common infections in English primary care is lacking. Such an overview is especially relevant given the increasing evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that shorter antibiotic courses clear infection comparable to longer courses, while minimising selection, proliferation, and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the likelihood of side effects from antibiotic use.

We therefore assessed the extent to which durations of antibiotic courses prescribed for common infections in English primary care are in line with relevant guidelines. If substantial proportions of antibiotic prescriptions are longer than recommended, this would indicate that there is potential to safely reduce total antibiotic use simply by better application of guidelines in clinical practice.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics to this patient with persistent upper respiratory symptoms? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115izRZV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published advice for high-value care on the appropriate use of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections. They conducted a narrative literature review of evidence for antibiotic use in this setting that included recent clinical guidelines from professional societies supplemented by randomized, controlled trials; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews. They concluded that clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, high fever and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or worsening symptoms after a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days and had initially improved ("double-sickening"). In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent clinicians debate whether to initiate antibiotic treatment in a 62-year-old man with a history of recurrent sinusitis who presents with persistent upper respiratory symptoms. They review the data on which the ACP/CDC recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of prescribing antibiotic therapy in this setting.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116uiYM7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — definition and timing of antibiotic treatment failure are specified as follows: For patients who have started on antibiotic therapy, treatment failure is defined as worsening of symptoms or failure to improve after 3 to 5 days, with worsening defined as the progression of presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS or the onset of new signs or symptoms, and failure to improve defined as a lack of reduction in presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS that would not apply if symptoms are persistent yet gradually improving. The statement lists "Policy level: Option". Fluctuations in signs and symptoms within the first 48 to 72 hours of initial therapy were not uncommon and not necessarily indicative of failure. Prior guidelines noted an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes" when failure was defined at 7 days, but subsequent studies demonstrate an early response to effective antibiotic therapy, usually within 3 days, and the GUG felt that keeping a 7‑day cut‑point before changing antibiotics would result in more than an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes".

### Acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^111RohWg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Subtypes of rhinosinusitis include acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis is further specified as bacterial or viral. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold. Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, decongestants, and saline nasal irrigation is appropriate in patients who present with nonsevere symptoms (e.g., mild pain, temperature less than 101°F [38.3°C]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are recommended in patients with symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that do not improve after seven days, or that worsen at any time. Limited evidence supports the use of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with acute rhinosinusitis. Radiographic imaging is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography of the sinuses should not be used for routine evaluation, although it may be used to define anatomic abnormalities and evaluate patients with suspected complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Rare complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include orbital, intracranial, and bony involvement. If symptoms persist or progress after maximal medical therapy, and if computed tomography shows evidence of sinus disease, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^117KCuAX]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3–4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116pDK81]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult rhinosinusitis scope and definitions — the target patient for this guideline is aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, where rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is defined as rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension of inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity at the time of diagnosis. Rhinosinusitis may be classified by duration as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if less than 4 weeks' duration, or as CRS if lasting more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations; ARS may be classified further by presumed etiology into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), and distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. When patients have 4 or more annual episodes of ABRS, without persistent symptoms in between, the condition is termed recurrent ARS (RARS). Nearly all experts agree that CRS begins after 12 weeks duration, and we agree with other guideline groups that define ARS as up to 4 weeks' duration; very limited data are available on rhinosinusitis lasting 4 to 12 weeks, sometimes called subacute rhinosinusitis, and we do not distinguish rhinosinusitis in this time frame as an explicit entity in the guideline with decisions individualized.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^115Lxx2S]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^111pTD8o]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI.

Methods

A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: "acute bronchitis", "respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "rhinosinusitis", and "the common cold".

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common cold.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^1156AdH2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113u8a1A]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical management — preoperative medical therapy prerequisite: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with CRS, with evidence strength described as a "Recommendation based on RCTs and meta-analyses" and a "Level of confidence in the evidence. High". Benefits include to "Avoid delays in surgery; reduce costs; avoid adverse effects of medications that are unlikely to benefit the patient", while risks include "Misinterpretation of this recommendation as a reason to withhold or limit any or all medical therapy for CRS". Supporting text emphasizes that although candidacy often follows prior appropriate medical therapy, the type and duration "should not be defined by a singular, one-size-fits-all medical treatment algorithm", and an SR of "387 distinct clinical trials" showed wide variation in preoperative regimens. A recent international consensus "noted that an aggregate grade of evidence for oral nonmacrolide antibiotic therapy for either greater than or less than 3 weeks in CRS without polyposis could not be ascertained" and "recommends against nonmacrolide antibiotics for less than 3 weeks to treat sinusitis with polyposis outside of an acute exacerbation", with "no recommendation… for greater than 3 weeks", which "suggests that necessitating oral antibiotic therapy across all CRS patients before considering surgical candidacy is not supported in the current literature". A notable subtype exception is "a fungal ball", for which "the treatment is exclusively surgical (see KAS 4)".

### Absence of evidence for enhanced benefit of antibiotic therapy on recurrent acute rhinosinusitis episodes: a systematic review of the evidence base [^112upWoT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence base on the effectiveness of short-course antibiotic therapy in adult patients with a recurrent episode of acute rhinosinusitis as part of a disease pattern on severity and duration of symptoms and recurrences.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Review Methods

A comprehensive search was performed up to March 21, 2013. Articles reporting studies on the effects of short-course antibiotic therapy compared with placebo in patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis were included. For included articles, the design of reported studies was assessed for directness of evidence and risk of bias.

Results

In total, 3473 unique publications were retrieved, of which 30 were considered eligible based on title and abstract screening. In addition, 8 eligible articles were retrieved using cross-reference checking. Based on full-text evaluation, none of the retrieved 38 articles satisfied our predefined selection criteria. They did not compare antibiotic treatment with placebo, excluded patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, or did not report findings for a subgroup of patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Conclusion and Recommendation

To date, there is no evidence available on differences in effect of antibiotic therapy in primary or sporadic and recurrent episodes of acute rhinosinusitis. As such, decisions for or against initial antibiotic therapy in patients with recurring episodes of acute rhinosinusitis should be based on the same criteria used in managing primary or sporadic episodes of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^111oKXXT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) — diagnostic criteria and antibiotic course include that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is diagnosed in patients with URIs persisting longer than 10 to 14 days, and appropriate criteria for the diagnosis are symptoms of rhinosinusitis for 10 to 14 days, symptoms of a cold that improve and then worsen over a 7- to 10-day period, or severe symptoms of acute sinus infection. A 10 to 14 day course is generally adequate for acute disease, although shorter courses may be adequate with some antibiotics, and if there is no improvement in 3 to 5 days, then an alternative antibiotic should be considered. There is both clinical and experimental evidence that allergic rhinitis (AR) might predispose patients with ARSs, and in young adults with ABRS, there is a reported incidence of AR ranging from 25% to 31%.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^112Unpyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE

Despite the high utilization of antibiotic treatment of CRS, there is a paucity of high quality prospective studies. For treatment of CRS with antibiotics for less than 3 weeks, the majority of studies focus on the treatment of AECRS. While there are several non-placebo controlled studies and two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) on the role of prolonged treatment with macrolide antibiotics for CRS, there are few studies evaluating nonmacrolide therapies. Herein we will review the available evidence.

For the purposes of this discussion, three to four weeks or less is considered a 'short-term' antibiotic course and greater than three to four weeks is a considered a 'long-term' course. In general practice, the duration of courses is usually shorter than 10 days. The aim of short-term antibiotic courses is to treat suspected acute bacterial infections causing exacerbations.

There have been only two small placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of short-term antibiotics in CRS, excluding studies focused only on acute exacerbations of CRS (AECRS). Sabino et al. studied patients with acute exacerbations of CRS with or without polyps and found that after a two-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11), both groups exhibited overall improvement on day 14 compared to day 0 (p < 0.01). Van Zele conducted a three-arm study comparing a 20-day course of doxycycline, oral methylprednisolone and placebo in 47 patients with CRSwNP (either recurrent after surgery or with grade 3 or 4 polyps) and found reduced postnasal drip symptom scores at week 2, but no significant differences for all other symptoms and time points. Van Zele demonstrated significantly greater polyp shrinkage in the antibiotic treatment arm vs. placebo at 12 weeks post-treatment. The antibiotic effects were of a much lower magnitude than those seen in the corticosteroid arm and were probably not of clinical significance.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114QSqQp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — antibiotic use and diagnostic evaluation during exacerbations: Despite the limited evidence of the efficacy of short- and long-term antibiotics for routine CRS treatment, the use of antibiotics in CRS patients may be appropriate if bacterial infection results in acute exacerbation, and evidence of purulence within the middle meatus or nasal cavity of a symptomatic CRS patient may reasonably indicate that bacterial infection is contributing to exacerbation. To assess for the presence of sinonasal purulence, anterior rhinoscopy, oropharyngeal examination, or nasal endoscopy can be performed before prescribing antibiotic therapy, and repeated physical examination seems preferable to reflexive antibiotic usage or indiscriminately repeated CT scans. Specific recommendations regarding antibiotic choice, dosage, and treatment duration are not sufficiently supported by published data, but antibiotic selection based on endoscopically guided cultures may provide clinically meaningful improvements in nasal findings and patient-reported symptoms. Known side effects of antibiotic use include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, liver enzyme disruptions, and Clostridium difficile colitis, and there are pertinent concerns about the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the inappropriate and injudicious use of antibiotics.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABRS have been produced in association with a number of societies in the United States; these guidelines aim to promote the rational selection of antibiotic therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for selection of antibiotic resistance. This article provides an overview of current U.S. guidelines for the treatment of ABRS, focusing on the impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment options.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114Rs9Za]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Antibiotic courses for common infections… [^112fdQqB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with COPD exacerbations, antibiotic courses should be limited to five days.
- In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the initial antibiotic course should be limited to five days with follow-up before completion of the course.
- For women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, taking nitrofurantoin for five days, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days, or a single dose of fosfomycin is effective.
- In patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, taking a fluoroquinolone for five to seven days is the most effective empiric treatment. From the AFP Editors. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antibiotic courses of five days are as effective as longer courses based on a meta-analysis of studies enrolling more than 10, 000 patients. This is the lower course recommendation of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, which recommends five to seven days.

Community-Acquired Pneumonia In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, initial antibiotic courses should be limited to five days with monitoring for signs of improvement. Antibiotic therapy should be extended for ongoing vital sign abnormalities, inability to eat, or concerns with mentation. This recommendation does not apply to patients who are immunocompromised. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies, an antibiotic course of six days or less is as effective as a longer course while still reducing mortality and serious adverse events. Recommended antibiotics for healthy adults include amoxicillin, doxycycline, and azithromycin, which target the common pathogens. In patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, five- to seven-day courses of fluoroquinolones are recommended. Shorter courses of fluoroquinolones are as effective as longer courses in women and men with pyelonephritis, so a five-day course works as well as a 10-day course.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be avoided for empiric therapy in pyelonephritis because of resistance in nearly 20% of infections. S. aureus is suspected in patients with penetrating trauma, injection drug use, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or previous evidence of MRSA infection or colonization, an antibiotic effective against MRSA should be added.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1156yd7R]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find a benefit to patients of treating clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis with high-dose rather than standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. This finding is disappointing because the IDSA-recommended standard dosehas a limited effect (vs placebo). This outcome is also surprising in light of the promising results of the previous trial.

Why would we get such very different results? First, the current trial suffered from an incomplete collection of data (although mostly for the secondary outcomes). Yet these missing data cannot explain such a pronounced lack of benefit. A best-case analysis of the missing primary outcomes made only a modest difference. We found no important changes in baseline characteristics in the participants who remained at the end of days 3 and 10, and it seemed futile to continue recruitment to achieve the planned number of participants. Second, the 2 groups were not completely similar at baseline. Standard-dose participants reported a longer average duration of illness; therefore, more of them might have had spontaneous improvement unrelated to antibiotic dose by the end of day 3. However, the actual impact of duration of illness appeared to be minimal. In addition, even if an effect of allergic rhinitis in diminishing the response to antibiotics had been found, it would have reduced primary outcomes in more participants in the standard-dose group. Third, one or both of the studies may have suffered from a randomly skewed, nonrepresentative sample of participants. Whatever the explanation, the addition of the current participants to those from our previous study reduced the benefit of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate to statistical nonsignificance.

Three secondary findings are of interest. First, the frequency of diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections was quite high, even though most cases were mild. Second, patients who reported they were prone to adverse effects were more likely to experience them. Whether or not this outcome represented a self-fulfilling prophecy, this information would seem important when discussing with patients the pros and cons of antibiotic treatment. Third, the large number of patients with presumed penicillin allergy (Figure 1) underlines the need for more widespread testing for penicillin allergy. As shown in multiple studies, most of these patients do not have, or no longer have, an allergy to penicillin and can benefit from having the option of treatment with a penicillin.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^111NHwdB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — antibiotics versus watchful waiting: Although the literature suggests that antibiotics shorten the time to cure in ABRS, there is concern about the adverse effects of antibiotics, including resistance. A previous expert panel recommended a watchful waiting approach with antibiotics in nonsevere ABRS, and the panel recommended re-evaluation as necessary and antibiotics if there was worsening or no improvement with symptomatic therapy. A Cochrane database review assessed the effect of antibiotics in uncomplicated ABRS in a primary care setting and concluded that antibiotics are not recommended as first-line treatment in adults with clinically diagnosed ABRS, with their review of 10 trials finding that irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of patients were cured after 1 week and 71% after 2 weeks; this review did not make recommendations for pediatric patients, patients with suppressed immune system, and patients with severe disease.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) initial empiric therapy — For uncomplicated disease in previously healthy adults with mild to moderate symptoms, we recommend amoxicillin (500 mg PO tid or 875 mg PO bid) rather than amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg PO tid or 875/125 mg PO bid), since comparative studies have not demonstrated superior efficacy but more frequent adverse events with amoxicillin-clavulanate; although no significant differences have been found in clinical outcomes across antibiotic agents, it is impossible to conclude that these regimens are truly equivalent in efficacy.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^11183ECx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — Antibiotic selection and dosing in children: When considering antibiotic choices, uncomplicated ABRS in a child who has not received multiple previous courses of antibiotics can still be treated with amoxicillin (45 or 80 mg/kg/day). Another reasonable and safe choice is amoxicillin — clavulanate, and as the likelihood that the prevalence of H influenzae has increased in children with ABRS, amoxicillin clavulanate is the preferred treatment. If hypersensitivity to these antimicrobials is suspected, alternative choices include quinolones or clindamycin or linezolid with a second or third generation cephalosporins; penicillin skin testing may be considered in patients with β-lactam allergy if β-lactams are the most appropriate antibiotic. Clindamycin is useful if anaerobic organisms are suspected but provides no coverage against gram-negative organisms.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

### Systematic review of antimicrobial therapy in patients with acute rhinosinusitis [^1155Czg6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the natural history of acute rhinosinusitis and the impact of antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Trial Registry through February 2007 combined with manual review of retrieved article bibliographies.

Review Methods

Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, controlled trials comparing placebo vs oral antimicrobial for initial therapy of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis in patients aged 12 years or older.

Results

Thirteen trials met inclusion criteria and had data suitable for pooling. Clinical cure occurred in 8% of patients who received placebo after 3 to 5 days, rising to 35% by 7 to 12 days and 45% by 14 to 15 days. Antimicrobials increased cure rates at 7 to 12 days, with an absolute rate difference of 15% (95% CI, 4%-25%). Clinical improvement occurred in 30% of patients who received placebo after 3 to 5 days, rising to 73% by 7 to 12 days and 14 to 15 days. Antimicrobials increased improvement rates at 7 to 12 days by 14% (95% CI, 1%-28%) and at 14 to 15 days by 7% (95% CI, 2%-13%). Diarrhea and adverse events were about 80% more common in patients who received antimicrobials (P < 0.03).

Conclusions

Over 70% of patients with acute rhinosinusitis are improved after 7 days, with or without antimicrobial therapy. About 7 patients must be treated to achieve one additional positive outcome at 7 to 12 days above and beyond spontaneous resolution. Generalizability of results is limited because nearly all trials involved a primary care setting and some trials excluded patients with severe illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116tfRog]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

American Academy of Pediatrics — antibiotic duration: The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis has not received systematic study, and recommendations based on clinical observations have varied widely from 10 to 28 days of treatment. An alternative suggestion is that antibiotic therapy be continued for 7 days after the patient becomes free of signs and symptoms, which results in a minimum course of 10 days.

### No evidence for distinguishing bacterial from viral acute rhinosinusitis using symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea: a systematic review of the evidence base [^111RXbaE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library.

Review Methods

We performed a comprehensive systematic search on March 28, 2013. We included studies on the diagnostic value of duration of symptoms and purulent rhinorrhea in patients suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We assessed study design of included articles for directness of evidence and risk of bias. We extracted prevalence and positive and negative predictive values.

Results

Of 4173 unique publications, we included 1 study with high directness of evidence and moderate risk of bias. The prior probability of bacterial rhinosinusitis was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.35); we could not extract posterior probabilities. Odds ratios (95% CI) from univariate analysis were 1.03 (0.78–1.36) for duration of symptoms and 2.69 (1.39–5.18) for colored discharge on the floor of the nasal cavity.

Conclusion and Recommendation

We included 1 study with moderate risk of bias, reporting data in such a manner that we could not assess the value of symptom duration and purulent rhinorrhea in adults suspected of having acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Recommendations to distinguish between a viral and a bacterial source based on purulent rhinorrhea are not supported by evidence, and the decision to prescribe antibiotic treatment should not depend on its presence. Based on judgment driven by theory and subsidiary evidence of a greater likelihood of bacterial rhinosinusitis after 10 days, antibiotic therapy may seem a reasonable empirical option.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115GmxHj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) versus viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) — distinguishing features and time course indicate fever is not a reliable discriminator and was not included as a cardinal sign; fever has a sensitivity and specificity of only about 50% for ABRS. Only 0.5% to 2.0% of ARS episodes are complicated by bacterial infection. For VRS, typical symptoms peak at Day 2 to 3 and wane thereafter but may persist 14 days or longer, symptoms may persist for longer than 10 days though they gradually decrease, and in the first 3 to 4 days of illness, VRS cannot be differentiated from an early-onset ABRS.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — imaging and initial management follow these decision points: if a complication is suspected, Obtain Radiological Imaging; otherwise, Do Not Obtain Radiological Imaging. For ABRS care, Recommend Symptomatic Relief for ABRS and Offer Watchful Waiting* (Requires assurance of follow-up). When antibiotics are used, Prescribe Amoxicillin, With or Without Clavulanate for 5–7 Days; if penicillin allergy, prescribe doxycycline or a third generation cephalosporin w/ or w/o clindamycin. Reassess for improvement; lack of response is Treatment Failure defined as Failure to improve by 3–5 days after diagnosis or worsening at any time, prompting actions such as Change the Prescribed Antibiotic and Manage Complication. For viral disease, clinicians May Recommend Symptom Relief for VRS.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112sLPyg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^111jEgvb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — antibiotic selection and duration: The antibiotics currently approved by the FDA for ABRS are azithromycin, clarithromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefprozil, cefuroxime axetil, loracarbef, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and moxifloxacin. It should be noted that, owing to concerns over bacterial resistance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer recommends the use of macrolides for empiric treatment of ABRS, and that organization recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line therapy and doxycycline, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin in adult patients allergic to penicillin. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends 5 to 7 days of treatment with antibiotics for uncomplicated ABRS in adults and 10 to 14 days in children. Intravenous antibiotics may be considered in children who cannot tolerate oral medications for ABRS or in those with orbital, subperiosteal, or epidural abscesses. Summary Statement 21: To avoid resistance and potential adverse effects from antibiotics, the workgroup recommends evaluation of β-lactam allergy by penicillin skin testing and/or graded oral challenge if β-lactam is the most appropriate antibiotic (Rec, B).

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Short treatment durations for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: five days of gemifloxacin versus 7 days of gemifloxacin [^116a3KM2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the clinical and radiologic efficacy of 5 days compared with 7 days of gemifloxacin therapy in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS).

Study Design

In this prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study, adult patients presenting with ABRS were randomized to receive gemifloxacin 320 mg once daily for either 5 days (n = 218) or 7 days (n = 203).

Results

For the primary efficacy end point, clinical response to therapy at follow-up, 5 days of therapy with gemifloxacin was as effective as 7 days of therapy (per-protocol population; treatment difference 0.44%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.54 to 7.41). Five and 7 days of treatment with gemifloxacin were well tolerated.

Conclusion and Significance

The clinical efficacy of gemifloxacin 320 mg daily for 5 days is at least as good as the efficacy of gemifloxacin 320 mg daily for 7 days in the treatment of ABRS.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^112tjjJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

Adult rhinosinusitis epidemiology and care burden — sinusitis affects approximately 12% of adults in the United States resulting in over 30 million annual diagnoses, and the direct cost of managing acute and chronic sinusitis exceeds $11 billion per year with additional expense from lost productivity, reduced job effectiveness, and impaired quality of life ranging from $12 to 20 billion. More than 1 in 5 antibiotics prescribed in adults are for sinusitis, making it the fifth-most common diagnosis responsible for antibiotic therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^1119WNTr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^117BuRsZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — initial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states: "Clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up", and "The duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made". Evidence qualifiers include "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A", "Level of Confidence in Evidence: Medium", and "Policy level: Recommendation". The update specifies "reduced watchful waiting to 3 to 5 days duration from time of diagnosis", while prior guidance "endorsed watchful waiting without an antibiotic… even when signs and symptoms had persisted for 10 days or longer". Patient preference has a "Large role for shared decision-making for watchful waiting vs. antibiotic therapy". Exceptions include "Complicated sinusitis, immune deficiency, or coexisting bacterial illness", and the clinician should consider age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, co-morbid conditions, and factors suggesting "severe" disease when assessing suitability; the guideline notes "the strengthening of the recommendation of watchful waiting to the default initial therapy", with allowance to differ "when the clinician believes that 'severe' disease requires antibiotic therapy".

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections in adults: background [^112JZzgX]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.
