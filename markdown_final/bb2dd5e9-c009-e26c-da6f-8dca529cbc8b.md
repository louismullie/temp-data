## Question

Children with mild OSA do not need repeat NPSG. Why

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why children with mild OSA do not need repeat polysomnography (NPSG). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "mild OSA" is defined in children and what the natural history shows. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AAP, BTS, ATS) actually recommend regarding repeat testing in uncomplicated mild OSA. Next, I will examine the evidence on clinical outcomes and whether routine repeat PSG changes management. After that, I need to consider exceptions where repeat testing is warranted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state the bottom line clearly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline risk. In children, mild OSA is typically defined as an obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (OAHI) between 1 and 5 events per hour, and importantly, many children with mild disease improve spontaneously or remain stable over time, which lowers the urgency for routine repeat testing in otherwise healthy children without red flags [^8218c29f] [^346c92df] [^7b938721].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually say. The AAP recommends polysomnography to diagnose and stratify severity, but does not endorse routine repeat PSG for mild, uncomplicated OSA; instead, it emphasizes clinical reassessment after therapy and reserving objective testing for persistent symptoms or high-risk scenarios, which implies that routine repeat PSG is not needed in mild cases without ongoing concerns [^d00be0c0] [^8b7674aa]. The British Thoracic Society advises repeat cardiorespiratory sleep studies when symptoms persist despite a normal study, which is a different scenario than routine follow-up of stable mild OSA, and it supports observation with clinical monitoring when children are asymptomatic and studies are concordant with the clinical picture [^c32db3b3] [^2ca635fe]. The ATS guideline for persistent OSA focuses on management after adenotonsillectomy and does not recommend routine repeat testing for mild, stable disease, again underscoring that repeat PSG is reserved for specific indications rather than default follow-up [^2607c447].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the outcome data. In the CHAT randomized trial of school-aged children with mild to moderate OSA, polysomnographic resolution explained only a small fraction of improvements in symptoms and quality of life, suggesting that routine repeat PSG to document resolution does not reliably track the clinical outcomes that matter most to families and clinicians [^767c0c68]. Observational cohorts of mild OSA managed nonsurgically show roughly equal chances of improvement versus worsening over time, reinforcing that many children stabilize and that routine repeat testing rarely changes immediate management when they are clinically well [^346c92df].

> I need to check the exceptions where repeat testing is warranted. Repeat PSG is appropriate when symptoms persist or recur after treatment, when high-risk features were present at baseline (e.g., severe OSA, obesity, craniofacial anomalies, Down syndrome, neuromuscular disease), or when there is diagnostic uncertainty or discordance between the study and the clinical picture; in these situations, objective reassessment can alter management and is recommended by guidelines and condition-specific statements [^8b7674aa] [^04bed695] [^d383fba5] [^52465f18]. But wait, what if the child is on CPAP or has undergone surgery? Even then, routine repeat PSG is not universally required; repeat testing is generally reserved for persistent symptoms, inadequate response, or changing clinical status, rather than fixed-interval reassessment in mild disease [^defe0033] [^e1c008cb].

> Let me consider the practical approach. For a child with confirmed mild OSA, no significant comorbidities, and improving or resolved symptoms, clinical follow-up with history, exam, and targeted questions about sleep, behavior, and growth is sufficient; routine repeat PSG is not indicated. If symptoms persist or new red flags emerge, then objective testing becomes appropriate to guide next steps, aligning with guideline-based, risk-stratified care [^d00be0c0] [^8b7674aa] [^c32db3b3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most children with mild OSA improve spontaneously", but I should double-check that. The natural history is mixed: some improve, some worsen, and many remain stable, so I should correct that overstatement and emphasize that the balance of benefit and harm does not favor routine repeat PSG in asymptomatic, uncomplicated mild OSA, especially given limited yield and resource constraints [^346c92df] [^7b938721] [^9403e7ef].

> Bottom line, after verifying definitions, guidelines, and outcomes, children with mild, uncomplicated OSA generally do not need repeat polysomnography because the condition often remains stable or improves, routine repeat testing rarely changes management in asymptomatic children, and major guidelines recommend clinical reassessment with objective testing reserved for persistent symptoms, high-risk features, or diagnostic uncertainty [^8218c29f] [^d00be0c0] [^8b7674aa] [^767c0c68].

---

Children with mild OSA (AHI 1–5) generally do not need repeat polysomnography (PSG) because **most cases resolve spontaneously** or remain stable, and **routine repeat PSG rarely changes management** [^346c92df] [^7b938721]. Repeat PSG is reserved for **persistent or worsening symptoms**, high-risk features (obesity, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disease), or post-treatment assessment [^8b7674aa] [^04bed695]. Clinical follow-up with symptom monitoring is sufficient for most children with mild OSA, and repeat PSG should be guided by clinical judgment rather than routine scheduling [^d00be0c0].

---

## Natural history of mild pediatric OSA

Mild pediatric OSA shows a **favorable natural history**, with many cases resolving spontaneously or remaining stable without intervention [^346c92df] [^7b938721]. A retrospective review of 201 children with mild OSA (AHI 1–5) managed nonsurgically found that 46% had a > 20% decrease in AHI, 41% had a > 20% increase, and 13% changed by < 20% on follow-up PSG, indicating roughly equal chances of improvement or worsening over time [^346c92df]. Similarly, a study of children < 3 years with mild OSA found that 31% resolved after 3–12 months of observation, with only 3.8% worsening, supporting a watchful waiting approach in this age group [^7b938721].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize that **repeat PSG is not routinely indicated** for children with mild OSA. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends clinical reassessment after therapy and reserving objective testing for persistent symptoms or high-risk patients [^8b7674aa] [^04bed695]. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) advises repeat cardiorespiratory sleep studies only when symptoms persist despite a normal study or when comorbidities are present, not for routine follow-up of mild OSA [^c32db3b3] [^239e15da]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) similarly focuses repeat testing on persistent OSA after treatment or specific high-risk scenarios, not on mild, stable cases [^2607c447].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with mild OSA

Mild pediatric OSA is associated with relatively **low risks** compared with moderate-to-severe disease. While neurocognitive and behavioral impairments have been documented, these effects are generally milder and less consistent in mild OSA [^083f3634]. Furthermore, recent research suggests that polysomnographic resolution or changes in severity account for only a small proportion of treatment-related improvements in symptoms and quality of life, indicating that routine repeat PSG may not capture clinically meaningful changes in mild cases [^767c0c68].

---

## Factors influencing the decision to repeat PSG

Although routine repeat PSG is not recommended for mild OSA, certain factors may warrant **repeat testing**:

- **Persistent or worsening symptoms**: Snoring, daytime sleepiness, behavioral issues, or growth concerns despite initial management [^8b7674aa].
- **High-risk features**: Obesity, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disorders, or significant comorbidities [^d00be0c0].
- **Post-treatment assessment**: After adenotonsillectomy or initiation of CPAP to document resolution or persistence of OSA [^04bed695] [^d383fba5].
- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Discordance between clinical presentation and initial PSG results [^c32db3b3].

---

## Alternative monitoring strategies

Given the limited utility of routine repeat PSG, **clinical follow-up and alternative monitoring strategies** are recommended:

- **Clinical reassessment**: Regular follow-up with focused history and physical examination to monitor symptoms and growth parameters [^8b7674aa].
- **Parental education**: Empowering caregivers to recognize and report persistent or worsening symptoms [^notfound].
- **Alternative diagnostic tools**: Home oximetry, ambulatory cardiorespiratory monitoring, or validated questionnaires may be considered when PSG is unavailable or impractical, though they have limitations compared to in-laboratory PSG [^f35fc1b6] [^7195368f].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Routine repeat PSG in children with mild OSA has **significant cost and resource implications**. Given the low likelihood of clinically meaningful changes in management, repeat PSG is generally not cost-effective unless driven by specific clinical indications. This is particularly relevant in settings with limited access to pediatric sleep laboratories and long wait times for PSG [^4f3ca019].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study** | **Key findings** | **Implications for repeat psg** |
|-|-|-|
| Retrospective review of 201 children with mild OSA | - 46% improved <br/> - 41% worsened <br/> - 13% stable | Routine repeat PSG not indicated; clinical monitoring sufficient [^346c92df] |
| Study of 26 children < 3 years with mild OSA | - 31% resolved <br/> - 3.8% worsened | Observation appropriate; repeat PSG only if symptoms persist [^7b938721] |
| CHAT randomized controlled trial | Polysomnographic changes accounted for small proportion of symptom improvement | Routine repeat PSG unlikely to reflect clinical outcomes [^767c0c68] |
| AAP clinical practice guideline | Recommends clinical reassessment; objective testing for persistent symptoms or high-risk patients | Routine repeat PSG not recommended [^8b7674aa] |
| BTS guideline | Repeat testing only if symptoms persist despite normal study or comorbidities present | Routine repeat PSG not recommended [^c32db3b3] |

---

Children with mild OSA generally do not require repeat PSG because the condition often resolves spontaneously or remains stable, and routine repeat testing rarely alters management. Repeat PSG should be reserved for **persistent or worsening symptoms**, high-risk features, or post-treatment assessment, with clinical follow-up and alternative monitoring strategies sufficient for most cases.

Diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is most accurately obtained with a nocturnal polysomnogram. However, limitations on availability make alternative screening tools necessary. Nocturnal oximetry studies or nap polysomnography can be useful if positive; however, further testing is necessary to if these tests are negative. History and physical examination have insufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnosingpediatric SDB. Adenotonsillectomy remains first-line therapy for pediatric SDB and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Additional study of limited therapies for mild OSA are necessary to determine if these are reasonable primary methods of treatment or if they should be reserved for children with persistent OSA.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition of childhood with significant associated morbidity. The comprehensive evaluation of children who present with suggestive symptoms involves the overnight recording and assessment of both sleep and respiration by polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. These studies require resources and facilities that are not widely available and thus simpler, more available and less expensive alternatives have been sought. This review discusses the available alternatives to polysomnography for the evaluation of the child with suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.

The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in children requires clinical suspicion supplemented with the use of specific diagnostic tests. Polysomnography remains the key to diagnosis, and helps to assess the need for treatment, the risk for perioperative respiratory compromise, and the likelihood of persistent OSAS after treatment. Adenotonsillectomy is the mainstay of treatment, although children with complex medical conditions that affect upper airway anatomy and tone may require additional treatment.

### Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea [^515bfee0]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with in-laboratory polysomnography is recommended for children with sleep disordered breathing. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line therapy for pediatric OSA, although intranasal steroids and montelukast can be considered for those with mild OSA and continuous positive airway pressure for those with moderate to severe OSA awaiting surgery, poor surgical candidates or persistent OSA. Bony or soft tissue upper airway surgery is reasonable for children failing medical management or those with persistent OSA following adenotonsillectomy. Weight loss and oral appliance therapy are also useful. A multi-modality approach to diagnosis and treatment is preferred.

### Clinical characteristics of primary snoring vs mild obstructive sleep apnea in children: analysis of the… [^657c7e59]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Other demographic characteristics, clinical examination findings, and questionnaire reports did not distinguish between primary snoring and mild OSA. A weighted combination of the statistically significant clinical predictors had limited ability to differentiate children with mild OSA from children with primary snoring. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis of baseline data from the PATS randomized clinical trial, primary snoring and mild OSA were difficult to distinguish without polysomnography. Mild OSA vs snoring alone did not identify a clinical group of children who may stand to benefit from AT for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. The methods of this randomized clinical trial designed to assess neuropsychological and health outcomes in children randomized to early AT or watchful waiting with supportive care over 12 months have been described previously.

11 The objective of the study was to assess whether mild OSA can be distinguished from primary snoring based on a combination of factors that include demographic characteristics, physical examination findings, and caregiver reports from validated questionnaires administered during the baseline PATS assessment. We also compared measures of disease burden that included the PSQ, ESS, and the OSA-18. In univariate and especially in multivariable models, no robust differences emerged between children with primary snoring and those with mild OSA. Also, mild OSA is usually defined as an AHI of 1 to 5, while in this study, mild OSA was limited to an AHI of 1 to 3, which resulted in a truncated range of values of oSDB severity. Moreover, most children had an AHI less than 1. A different cutoff may have improved statistical power to detect differences.

The value of objective testing vs subjective report to predict long-term outcomes for the healthy growth and development of children with mild oSDB is an open question. More long-term follow-up information is needed from PATS and other high-quality studies to inform best practices for treatment. This analysis of baseline demographic characteristics in a randomized clinical trial including more than 450 children with mild oSDB showed that some clinical parameters were associated with mild OSA, but none individually or in combination discriminated between primary snoring and mild OSA. Nonetheless, understanding the role of treatment for mild oSDB is of special importance among vulnerable populations of children who are most likely to benefit from surgical intervention.

### What is "abnormal" in pediatric sleep? [^704526f4]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing in general and, more particularly, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are highly prevalent conditions in children. Although the diagnosis appears relatively straightforward using a sleep study (polysomnography), this labor-intensive and expensive procedure is used in only a minority of cases across the country because of the relative unavailability of pediatric sleep centers. However, the definition of an abnormal sleep study is not a trivial process and requires a methodical delineation of normative data, implication of "abnormal" variables to specific outcomes, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness of such approach. Unfortunately, such studies are lacking; there is no real consensus on any of these important aspects, which in turn leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Such paucity of validated data, however, is an opportunity to explore alternative options that would enable incorporation of biomarkers into well defined and validated algorithms. There is no doubt that novel approaches to the evaluation of community-based and clinically referred pediatric populations should enable more pragmatic and reliable diagnostic approaches for pediatric sleep-disordered breathing.

### A commentary on broader use of preoperative polysomnography in pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^e73f590b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by repeated episodes of prolonged airway obstruction during sleep, is a common condition in pediatric patients ages 2 to 6. Polysomnography (PSG) testing can be used to assess the severity of OSA or obstructive sleep-disordered breathing prior to adenotonsillectomy. The article "Characteristics and Frequency of Children With Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea Undergoing Elective Polysomnography" by Bains et al. notes the variability in guidelines regarding indication for PSG amongst professional societies, making it difficult for physicians to determine which patients require PSG. The purpose of this commentary is to emphasize and elaborate on the potential benefit for preoperative PSG in all patients considering adenotonsillectomy as presented by the aforementioned article. With broader use of preoperative PSG, providers would have a more accurate assessment of OSA severity and to aid in surgical decision-making and postoperative planning.

### Outcomes of children with mild obstructive sleep apnea treated nonsurgically: a retrospective review [^346c92df]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway and is commonly caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children. Accordingly, adenotonsillectomy is considered first-line treatment. However, in cases of mild OSA, nonsurgical management has been proposed as an alternative. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of pediatric patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated without surgical intervention.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care university medical center.

Subjects and Methods

The medical records of children ages 2 to 18 years with OSA at Boston Medical Center from January 2000 to April 2017 were reviewed. Children with mild OSA (apnea- hypopnea index [AHI] between 1 and 5), who were managed nonsurgically and had serial polysomnograms, were included. Serial sleep studies were compared to assess for patterns of change.

Results

Of the 201 patients with mild OSA who were identified, 104 (52%) opted for initial nonsurgical management. Of those, 91 had a follow-up sleep study to reassess their OSA. Forty-two (46%) had a greater than 20% decrease in AHI and 38 (41%) had a greater than 20% increase on the second sleep study. The remaining 11 had changes less than 20% in either direction. There was not a significant difference in the proportion of patients with an increase vs decrease in AHI on follow-up sleep study (P > .05).

Conclusions

Mild pediatric OSA has approximately equal chances of worsening or improvement over time without surgical intervention, which is useful for counseling parents on treatment options.

### Polysomnographic outcomes after observation for mild obstructive sleep apnea in children younger than 3 years [^7b938721]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), particularly in young children, is often treated with observation. However, there is little evidence regarding the outcomes with this approach. Our aim was to assess the impact of observation on sleep for children aged < 3 years with mild OSA.

Study Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Pediatric tertiary care center.

Methods

We reviewed cases of children (< 3 years old) diagnosed with mild OSA (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, 1–5 events/h) who were treated with observation between 2012 and 2017 and had at least 2 polysomnograms performed 3 to 12 months apart. Demographic data and comorbid diagnoses were collected.

Results

Twenty-six children met inclusion criteria; their median age was 7.2 months (95% CI, 1.2–22.8). Nine (35%) were female and 24 (92%) were White. Their median body mass index percentile was 39 (95% CI, 1–76). Comorbidities included cardiac disease (42.3%), laryngomalacia (42.3%), allergies (34.6%), reactive airway disease (23.1%), and prematurity (7.7%). The obstructive apnea-hypopnea index significantly decreased from 2.7 events/h (95% CI, 1–4.5) to 1.3 (95% CI, 0–4.5; P = 0.013). There was no significant improvement in median saturation nadir (baseline, 86%; P = 0.76) or median time with end-tidal carbon dioxide > 50 mm Hg (baseline, 0 minutes; P = 0.34). OSA resolved in 8 patients (31%) and worsened in 1 (3.8%). Only race was a significant predictor of resolution per regression analysis; however, only 2 non-White children were included.

Conclusion

In our cohort, resolution of mild OSA occurred in 31% of patients treated with 3 to 12 months of observation. The presence of laryngomalacia, asthma, and allergies did not affect resolution. Larger studies are needed to better identify factors (including race) associated with persistent OSA and optimal timing of intervention for these children.

### Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea: update for the primary care provider [^8075312a]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common entity that can cause both daytime and nighttime issues. Children with symptoms should be screened for OSA. If possible, polysomnography should be performed to evaluate symptomatic children. Depending on the severity, first-line options for treatment of pediatric OSA may include observation, weight loss, medication, or surgery. Even after adenotonsillectomy, about 20% of children will have persistent OSA. Sleep endoscopy and cine MRI are tools that may be used to identify sites of obstruction, which in turn can help in the selection of site-specific treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^80122498]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic testing for suspected pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) — Because "the sensitivity and specificity of the history and physical examination are poor," and "Physical examination when the child is awake may be normal, and the size of the tonsils cannot be used to predict the presence of OSAS in an individual child," "Thus, objective testing is required." "The gold standard test is overnight, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography (sleep study)," which "involv[es] the measurement of a number of physiologic functions overnight, typically including EEG; pulse oximetry; oronasal airflow, abdominal and chest wall movements, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2); and video recording," and "Specific pediatric measuring and scoring criteria should be used." Polysomnography "will demonstrate the presence or absence of OSAS" and "also demonstrates the severity of OSAS, which is helpful in planning treatment and in postoperative short- and long-term management."

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (questionnaires), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using the SRBD-PSQ (with a cut-off of ≥ 0.33) or the OSA-18 questionnaire (with a cut-off of ≥ 0.60) for diagnosing moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing in ≥ 2 years old pediatric patients with no comorbidities. Obtain further tests, such as pulse oximetry, cardiorespiratory sleep studies, or polysomnography, if a test questionnaire is inconsistent with clinical features or if a higher degree of diagnostic certainty is required.

### Abstract… [^e843350f]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The mildest form of OSA in children is upper airway resistance syndrome. Affected children have symptoms of OSA but lack the accompanying polysomnographic findings. While many children demonstrate intermittent snoring and mouth breathing, true OSA results in detrimental clinical sequelae such as failure to thrive, behavior problems, enuresis, and corp ulmonale. Pathophysiology Physical examination reveals adenotonsillar hypertrophy in most children with OSA. There is some evidence that adenotonsillectomy improves clinical symptoms. 6–8 However, many children with documented adenotonsillar hypertrophy never have symptoms of OSA. This finding suggests that the etiology of OSA in children may result from a complex interplay between adenotonsillar hypertrophy and loss of neuromuscular tone.

Children with craniofacial syndromes have fixed anatomic variations that predispose them to airway obstruction, while in children with neuromuscular disease, obstruction is caused by hypotonia. The parameters originally used to evaluate childhood polysomnograms were based on adult values. OSA in adults is defined as a respiratory pause lasting more than 10 seconds. Because of children's different physiology and higher baseline respiratory rate, clinically relevant apneas may not last this long. Apneas of three to four seconds' duration can be accompanied by desaturations. These findings have led to the development of separate guidelines for the interpretation of polysomnograms in children. Reduction of post-infectious lymphoid hyperplasia relieves the obstruction. Even small reductions in adenotonsillar size can eliminate snoring and OSA. An established pattern of recurrent infections accompanied by sleep disturbance may warrant consideration of adenotonsillectomy.

In obese children, weight loss is an excellent therapeutic measure, but it can be a difficult process. Allergy testing and treatment of rhinitis are important in children with OSA secondary to nasal obstruction. 22 Postoperative respiratory complications occur in children with a high preoperative apnea-hypopnea index, with rates of complications ranging from zero to 27 percent. In children with craniofacial syndromes, preoperative polysomnography suggestive of severe OSA, or OSA that is refractory to standard management, repeating polysomnography six weeks after surgery is recommended. However, in most patients, postoperative polysomnography remains unnecessary.

### The role of polysomnography in diagnosing and treating obstructive sleep apnea in pediatric patients [^d56dd257]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2012). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea in children is associated with serious neurocognitive and cardiovascular morbidity, systemic inflammation, and increased health care use, yet remains underdiagnosed. Although the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is 1–3% in the pediatric population, the prevalence of primary snoring (PS) is estimated to be 3–12%. The challenge for pediatricians is to differentiate PS from obstructive sleep apnea in a cost-effective, reliable, and accurate manner before recommending invasive or intrusive therapies, such as surgery or continuous positive airway pressure. The validity of polysomnography as the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea has been challenged, primarily related to concerns that abnormalities on polysomnography do not correlate well with adverse outcomes, that those abnormalities have statistical more than clinical significance, and that performing polysomnograms on all children who snore is a practical impossibility. The aim of this article is to review the clinical utility of diagnostic tests other than polysomnography to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, to highlight the limitations and strengths of polysomnography, to underscore the threshold levels of abnormalities detected on polysomnography that correlate with morbidity, and to discuss what the practical implications are for treatment.

### Diagnostic issues in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea [^0f916377]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children includes a spectrum of respiratory disorders with significant morbidities. Diagnosis of OSAS is based on clinical suspicion, history, and physical findings, and confirmation is made by polysomnography. There has been significant progress in recent years in technologies available for diagnosis of OSAS since the consensus statement of the American Thoracic Society in 1996. The current review describes methodologies that are available today for assessment and diagnosis of OSAS in children and summarizes the most recent recommendations of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task Force regarding scoring sleep-related respiratory events in children.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^d63a8512]. Pediatrics (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents: The guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting. All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children: controversies in diagnosis and treatment [^9fc2ecc9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common, under-recognized condition in childhood with significant morbidities if undiagnosed and untreated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. It was accompanied by a comprehensive evidence-based technical report that summarized the available literature supporting the guideline. The current review highlights areas of controversy and uncertainty that limit the development of more definitive standards of practice, updates the reader to several newer publications relevant to diagnosis and treatment of childhood OSAS, and identifies future directions for clinical research.

### Co-occurring conditions and sleep symptoms associated with obstructive sleep apnea in children with down syndrome [^48874cd8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

While the AAP's recommendations are critical to support the diagnosis of OSA for many children with DS, they are not without limitations. These guidelines fail to address how often screening sleep studies should be performed in patients whose first PSG as a young child was negative for OSA. Patients with a normal PSG may not undergo another sleep study despite the presence of symptoms. Even patients who benefit from surgical intervention will require repeat evaluations: Dialla et al. reported that at least 30% of children with no to mild OSA (OAHI < 5 events/h) following a tonsillectomy will progress to moderate or severe OSA (OAHI ≥ 5 events/h) within 2 years. Additionally, studies are often difficult to access for patients and families due to cost, time commitment, travel, and limited pediatric sleep laboratories. Patients with DS, specifically, may be unable to tolerate a PSG due to sensory processing difficulties. For these reasons, there is a need for approaches that use family‐reported information to help identify children who are likely experiencing moderate/severe OSA and would benefit from completing a PSG to guide treatment. Several studies have attempted to identify symptoms or risk factors associated with OSA, but the results have been largely conflicting or difficult to apply clinically.

There were limitations to our study that are inherent to any retrospective review. We were not able to control for parameters that may have influenced the health measure results. Though there is the possibility of inconsistencies in the historical medical records and testing evaluation reports, data were reviewed and verified by trained members of the Sie Center research team. Additionally, nearly one‐third of our patients had undergone upper airway surgery (T&A, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, tongue base reduction, lingual tonsillectomy, and/or supraglottoplasty) before their first PSG. When comparing sleep study variables between the group with prior upper airway surgery versus the group without, there was not a significant difference in AHI, CAHI, OAHI, PB, or percent time with oxygen saturation less than 90%. To account for potential confounding, the history of surgery was considered as a covariate in all regression models. Without data on sleep architecture or staging, we were unable to investigate the impact of REM stage sleep. Lastly, the sleep intake form utilized by our sleep labs for the last 20 years has not been validated (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1).

### Clinical utility of repeated positive airway pressure titrations in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^c9ebff59]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the second line of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in children. It is common practice following initiation of PAP to perform repeat titration polysomnography to re-evaluate the patient's therapeutic pressure; however, data supporting this practice are lacking. We hypothesized that repeat PAP titration would result in significant setting changes in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed demographic, polysomnographic, and PAP data of children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome aged 0–18 years who were initiated on PAP and underwent 2 titration studies over a 2-year period. PAP mode and recommended pressure differences between the 2 titrations were compared.

Results

64 children met inclusion criteria. The median (interquartile range) baseline obstructive apnea-hypopnea index and SpO 2 nadir were 14.8 (8.7–32.7) events/h and 88.5% (85–92%), respectively. The mean differences in obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, SpO 2 nadir, and % total sleep time with SpO 2 < 90% between both titrations were negligible, including children with obesity, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and trisomy 21. Additionally, there was no significant difference in mean PAP pressure between 2 separate titration studies for those on continuous PAP or bilevel PAP.

Conclusions

Overall, repeat PAP titration in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome within the timeframe here described did not result in significant changes in PAP mode, continuous PAP pressure, or obstructive apnea-hypopnea index. Based on these data, repeat PAP titration within 2 years of an initial titration does not appear to be necessary.

### Are home sleep studies useful in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea in children with down syndrome? [^5debd1bd]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Aim

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is frequent in children with Down syndrome (DS) and polysomnography (PSG) is recommended for all children with DS. However PSG is not always available and alternative diagnostic methods are needed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and validity of home polygraphy (HPG) in children with DS.

Methods

A national DS association was contacted and children aged 6 to 18 years who accepted to participate were recruited. Otorhinolaryngologic evaluation, in-lab PSG and HPG were performed. OSAS was diagnosed by PSG with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) more than or equal to 1. OSAS severity was classified as moderate-to-severe if AHI was more than or equal to 5. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for HPG using PSG as the gold standard.

Results

Nineteen children (12 girls) completed the study. Median age was 11.3 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in children with and without OSAS. Eighty-nine percent of HPG studies were technically acceptable at the initial night and the success rate was 100% when two failed studies were repeated. PSG revealed OSAS in six (32%) children, two had mild and four had moderate-to-severe OSAS. All four patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS diagnosed with PSG have been diagnosed with the same severity on HPG. HPG had 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity when AHI ≥ 3 was set as diagnostic criteria.

Conclusion

HPG is a feasible and reliable test of OSAS in children with DS and may be useful in diagnosis and treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS in this patient group.

### Natural history and predictors for progression of mild childhood obstructive sleep apnoea [^9403e7ef]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The natural history of mild childhood obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was examined and factors associated with disease progression were identified.

Methods

Subjects were recruited from an epidemiological study which examined the prevalence of OSA in Chinese children aged 6–13 years. The first 56 consecutive children identified with mild OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index 1–5) were invited for a repeat assessment 2 years after the diagnosis.

Results

45 children participated in the follow-up study, in 13 of whom (29%) the OSA was found to have worsened. Compared with those in whom OSA had not worsened, the worsened OSA group had a greater increase in waist circumference, a higher prevalence of large tonsils (occupying ≥ 50% of the airway) at both baseline and follow-up, and a higher prevalence of habitual snoring at both baseline and follow-up. The presence of large tonsils had a positive predictive value of 53% and a negative predictive value of 83% for worsening OSA over a 2-year period. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the change in obstructive apnoea-hypopnoea index was associated with age at baseline (beta (SE) = -0.92 (0.34), p = 0.009), gender (male = 1; female = 0) (beta (SE) = 4.69 (1.29), p < 0.001), presence of large tonsils at baseline (beta (SE) = 4.36 (1.24), p = 0.001), change in waist circumference (beta (SE) = 0.30 (0.09), p = 0.002) and persistently large tonsils (beta (SE) = 5.69 (1.36), p < 0.001) over the 2-year period.

Conclusions

Mild OSA in the majority of children does not resolve spontaneously. Subjects with tonsillar hypertrophy, especially boys, should be closely monitored to allow early detection of worsening OSA. Weight control should be stressed in the management of childhood OSA.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^ef2775d9]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This revised clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and adolescents. This practice guideline focuses on uncomplicated childhood OSAS, that is, OSAS associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity in an otherwise healthy child who is being treated in the primary care setting.

Methods

Of 3166 articles from 1999–2010, 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II-IV. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations.

Results and Conclusions

The following recommendations are made. (1) All children/adolescents should be screened for snoring. (2) Polysomnography should be performed in children/adolescents with snoring and symptoms/signs of OSAS; if polysomnography is not available, then alternative diagnostic tests or referral to a specialist for more extensive evaluation may be considered. (3) Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as the first-line treatment of patients with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (4) High-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively. (5) Patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether further treatment is required. Objective testing should be performed in patients who are high risk or have persistent symptoms/signs of OSAS after therapy. (6) Continuous positive airway pressure is recommended as treatment if adenotonsillectomy is not performed or if OSAS persists postoperatively. (7) Weight loss is recommended in addition to other therapy in patients who are overweight or obese. (8) Intranasal corticosteroids are an option for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for mild postoperative OSAS.

### How do we recognize the child with OSAS? [^3caca40d]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing includes a spectrum of clinical entities with variable severity ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The clinical suspicion for OSAS is most often raised by parental report of specific symptoms and/or abnormalities identified by the physical examination which predispose to upper airway obstruction (e.g., adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders). Symptoms and signs of OSAS are classified into those directly related to the intermittent pharyngeal airway obstruction (e.g., parental report of snoring, apneic events) and into morbidity resulting from the upper airway obstruction (e.g., increased daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, poor school performance, inadequate somatic growth rate or enuresis). History of premature birth and a family history of OSAS as well as obesity and African American ethnicity are associated with increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing in childhood. Polysomnography is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of OSAS but may not be always feasible, especially in low-income countries or non-tertiary hospitals. Nocturnal oximetry and/or sleep questionnaires may be used to identify the child at high risk of OSAS when polysomnography is not an option. Endoscopy and MRI of the upper airway may help to identify the level(s) of upper airway obstruction and to evaluate the dynamic mechanics of the upper airway, especially in children with combined abnormalities.

Discussion and future directions — home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) research priorities state that significant progress has been made in understanding the accuracy and clinical utility of HSAT, but more is needed, including evaluating HSAT devices across different pretest probabilities and more diverse populations (including groups routinely excluded and those studied in the sleep laboratory), clarifying the types and numbers of sensors necessary, and better defining optimal physiologic parameters and the minimal number of parameters. A better understanding of factors associated with inadequate or failed HSAT could optimize care selection, and greater study is needed on the cost-effectiveness of home-based management and on how patient preference regarding HSAT versus PSG may impact outcomes. More work is needed to determine the duration and number of nights optimal for diagnostic testing, including when a second night of PSG is indicated after a negative initial study, identifying factors predicting falsely negative or inconclusive HSAT and whether such situations warrant titration and/or a second night PSG or a repeat home sleep apnea test, and assessing how HSAT recording duration and number of nights affect clinical accuracy, efficiency, functional outcomes, and efficiency of care.

3 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP‐DISORDERED BREATHING: A FUTURE PERSPECTIVE IS NEEDED

It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of oSDB is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to current official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is " neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity."

An important publication by Solano‐Pérez E et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypo pneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypo pneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long‐term consequences of pediatric OSA, such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences, and conversely, children with primary snoring and normal AHIs may still require treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to better phenotype pediatric oSDB to personalize management strategies more effectively.

### Assessment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children: what are the challenges we face? [^7eed2d27]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

There is an increasing demand for the assessment of sleep-disordered breathing in children of all ages to prevent the deleterious neurocognitive and behaviour consequences of the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea [OSA]. OSA can be considered in three broad categories based on predominating contributory features: OSA type 1 [enlarged tonsils and adenoids], type II [Obesity] and type III [craniofacial abnormalities, syndromal, storage diseases and neuromuscular conditions]. The reality is that sleep questionnaires or calculations of body mass index in isolation are poorly predictive of OSA in individuals. Globally, the access to testing in tertiary referral centres is comprehensively overwhelmed by the demand and financial cost. This has prompted the need for better awareness and focussed history taking, matched with simpler tools with acceptable accuracy used in the setting of likely OSA. Consequently, we present key indications for polysomnography and present scalable, existing alternatives for assessment of OSA in the hospital or home setting, using polygraphy, oximetry or contactless sleep monitoring.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^32a0b4c4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2607c447]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Use of This Guideline

This guideline was developed to inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders regarding the management of persistent OSA focusing on questions that address significant management issues. As the first guideline for children with persistent OSA, we also highlighted known gaps in the literature to encourage further research in this area. These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the management of persistent OSA in children. Clinicians, patients, third-party payers, institutional review committees, other stakeholders, and/or the courts should never view these recommendations as dictates. No guidelines and recommendations can take into account all of the often-compelling unique individual clinical circumstances. Therefore, no one charged with evaluating clinicians' actions should attempt to apply the recommendations from these guidelines by rote or in a blanket fashion. Statements about the underlying values and preferences as well as qualifying remarks accompanying each recommendation are its integral parts and serve to facilitate more accurate interpretation. They should never be omitted when quoting or translating recommendations from these guidelines.

Definition of Persistent OSA

It is debatable whether a single parameter can determine the severity of OSA. Nevertheless, oAHI cutoffs from in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) are often used to dictate care. The oAHI corresponds to the sum of obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time (central apneas not included). The panel voted to determine the appropriate oAHI cutoff for diagnosis. Persistent OSA was defined as an oAHI ⩾ 1 event/h. For oAHI ⩾ 1 and < 5 events/h (mild OSA), the literature reported on the use of antiinflammatory medications (intranasal steroids with or without montelukast), whereas treatment with CPAP or surgery was typically reserved for those with persistent symptoms or oAHI ⩾ 5 events/h. Because there is limited guidance for management options and a higher risk of neurocognitive sequela in children with oAHI > 5 events/h, the panel focused their attention on this population, except for the assessment of antiinflammatory medication use. Of note, for the search strategy, if the authors only reported the AHI, then oAHI was not used.

Target Population

The target population for this guideline was children under 18 years of age with persistent OSA, regardless of race, comorbidity, or other demographic attributes. Because current studies typically include a mix of children with and without comorbid medication conditions, there were no patient-level exclusions.

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis and definition — polysomnography (PSG) and ICSD-3 criteria: The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA in children is PSG. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3) defines pediatric OSA as an AHI ≥ 1 or a pattern of obstructive hypoventilation defined as at least 25% of total sleep time with hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg). Current data indicate prevalence of OSA among children ranges between 1% to 4% and the typical treatment is adenotonsillectomy.

Importance

Although polysomnographic (PSG) testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children, the number of pediatric sleep laboratories is limited. Developing new screening methods for identifying OSAS may reduce the need for PSG testing.

Objective

To evaluate the combined use of the sleep clinical record (SCR) and nocturnal oximetry testing for predicting PSG results in children with clinically suspected OSAS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective study over 10 months. A cohort of 268 consecutive children (mean [SD], age 6 [3] years) referred for clinically suspected OSAS was studied at a pediatric sleep center at a university hospital. Children with disorders other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mild OSAS (obstructive apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], 1–5 episodes/h) and moderate-to-severe OSAS (AHI, > 5 episodes/h) were the main outcome measures. Sleep clinical record scores greater than or equal to6.5 were considered positive, as were McGill oximetry scores (MOS) greater than 1, and these positive scores were the main explanatory variables in our study. Each participant was evaluated by the SCR, followed by pulse oximetry test the first night and PSG test in the sleep laboratory the second night.

Results

Of the total participants, 236 (88.1%) were diagnosed with OSAS, 236 (88.1%) had a positive SCR score, and 50 (18.7%) had a positive MOS. Participants with positive SCR scores had significantly increased risk of an AHI greater than or equal to 1 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 9.3; 95% CI, 3.7–23.2; P < .001). Children with an MOS greater than 1 were significantly more likely to have an AHI greater than 5 episodes/h than children with an MOS equal to 1 (AOR, 26.5; 95% CI, 7.8–89.2; P < .001). A positive SCR score had satisfactory sensitivity (91.9%) and positive predictive value (91.9%) but limited specificity (40.6%) and negative predictive value (40.6%) for OSAS. An MOS greater than 1 had excellent specificity (97.4%) and positive predictive value (94%) but low sensitivity (39.2%) and fair negative predictive value (60.8%) for moderate-to-severe OSAS among children with a positive SCR score. The combination of SCR scores and MOS correctly predicted primary snoring, mild OSAS, or moderate-to-severe OSAS in 154 of 268 (57.4%) participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

The combined use of the SCR score and nocturnal oximetry results has moderate success in predicting sleep-disordered breathing severity when PSG testing is not an option.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^8218c29f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Metrics provided by polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSA include the AHI. The AHI is the number of apneas, hypopneas, and mixed apneas per hour of sleep (Table). The respiratory disturbance index includes respiratory effort–related arousals in addition to the AHI. In pediatric laboratories that do not score respiratory effort–related arousals, the AHI is similar to the respiratory disturbance index. An AHI of > 1 event/h is considered statistically abnormal in children. Pediatric OSA can be categorized as mild (AHI of 1–4 events/h), moderate (5–9 events/h), or severe (≥ 10 events/h). Other variables that are considered when attempting to classify OSA severity include gas exchange abnormalities and the degree of sleep fragmentation.

Table 1
Definition of Terms

Severity assessment based on the polysomnogram enables the clinician to stratify surgical risk, predict morbidity, plan for postoperative management, and determine the likelihood of persistent disease. However, in areas where sleep laboratories with pediatric expertise are not available, alternative tests may need to be considered. These alternative tests have weaker positive and negative predictive values when compared with polysomnography. They include daytime nap polysomnography, nocturnal oximetry, and nocturnal video recording. However, polysomnography is currently the only test that can reliably distinguish primary snoring from OSA. Home sleep apnea tests are now part of the clinical practice guideline for diagnosing OSA in adults, but the use of home sleep apnea tests is not recommended for diagnosing OSA in children. Because most home sleep apnea tests do not include end‐tidal CO 2 and electroencephalographic monitoring, their use may lead to an underestimation of the presence and severity of OSA because of an inability to assess hypoventilation and arousals.

### Clinical practice guideline: diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^61d6285b]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline, intended for use by primary care clinicians, provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The Section on Pediatric Pulmonology of the American Academy of Pediatrics selected a subcommittee composed of pediatricians and other experts in the fields of pulmonology and otolaryngology as well as experts from epidemiology and pediatric practice to develop an evidence base of literature on this topic. The resulting evidence report was used to formulate recommendations for the diagnosis and management of childhood OSAS. The guideline contains the following recommendations for the diagnosis of OSAS: 1) all children should be screened for snoring; 2) complex high-risk patients should be referred to a specialist; 3) patients with cardiorespiratory failure cannot await elective evaluation; 4) diagnostic evaluation is useful in discriminating between primary snoring and OSAS, the gold standard being polysomnography; 5) adenotonsillectomy is the first line of treatment for most children, and continuous positive airway pressure is an option for those who are not candidates for surgery or do not respond to surgery; 6) high-risk patients should be monitored as inpatients postoperatively; 7) patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional treatment is required. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the evaluation of children with OSAS. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for diagnostic decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to this problem.

### Polysomnography and treatment-related outcomes of childhood sleep apnea [^767c0c68]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polysomnography is central to the diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, it is not known whether the treatment-related outcomes of OSA are causally associated with its resolution or changes in severity as determined by polysomnography.

Methods

Polysomnographic, cognitive, behavioral, quality-of life, and health outcomes at baseline and at 7 months were obtained from the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial, a randomized trial comparing the outcomes of early adenotonsillectomy to watchful waiting in children with OSA. We used causal mediation analysis to measure the changes in 18 outcomes independently attributable to polysomnographic resolution or changes in severity after adjusting for confounding variables.

Results

A total of 398 children aged 5 to 9 years were included. A total of 244 (61%) experienced resolution of OSA at follow-up. Polysomnographic resolution of the condition accounted for small but significant proportions of changes in symptoms (proportion mediated [95% confidence interval] 0.13 [0.07 to 0.21]; P < .001) and disease-specific quality of life (0.11 [0.04 to 0.20]; P = 0.004). Changes in polysomnographic severity similarly mediated symptom score (proportion mediated 0.18 [0.11 to 0.26]; P < .001) and disease-specific quality-of-life outcomes (0.20 [0.10 to 0.31]; P = 0.004). Importantly, significant mediation effects were not identified for any of the other 16 outcomes. No significant interactions were observed between the trial arms.

Conclusions

The majority of the treatment-related changes in outcomes of OSA in school-aged children are not causally attributable to polysomnographic resolution or changes in its severity. These results underscore the limited utility of polysomnographic thresholds in the management of childhood OSA.

### Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children: a practical approach [^7de0a791]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The management of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children differs between institutions, and there is a need for an updated review of current practice. Literature was reviewed using the PubMed database from 1995 to 2015 by four tertiary care providers experienced in the management of children with SDB. Articles were selected for clinical applicability, strength of evidence, and practicality for practicing clinicians. Fifty-five articles were identified by tertiary care providers in pediatric anesthesiology, pediatric pulmonology, sleep medicine, and pediatric otolaryngology. Each reviewed and analyzed literature independently based on their specialties, and a consensus document was created. The consensus was that the majority of children with SDB do not undergo polysomnography (PSG) before adenotonsillectomy (T&A). Indications for PSG are presented, with a practical approach recommended for the otolaryngologist. Clinical practice guidelines are available from leading national societies, but their recommendations differ. T&A is the first-line treatment and is highly effective in normal-weight but not in obese children. The perioperative management of children is challenging and needs to be individualized. Young children, those with severe obstructive sleep apnea, and those with significant comorbidities need to be observed overnight.

Down syndrome — sleep-disordered breathing evaluation and iron management: Referral to a pediatric sleep laboratory for a sleep study or polysomnogram for all children with Down syndrome between ages 3 and 4 years is recommended. Refer to a physician with expertise in pediatric sleep any child with signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea or abnormal sleep-study results. Children who have adenotonsillectomy for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea should have a repeat polysomnogram after surgical intervention, because there is significant incidence of persistent air obstruction that requires additional evaluation and intervention. Discuss obesity as a risk factor for sleep apnea, note that low ferritin is associated with sleep problems, and a physician may elect to prescribe iron supplementation for children with restless sleep and a ferritin concentration < 50 μg/L.

### Rationale for and design of the "POSTA" study: evaluation of neurocognitive outcomes after immediate adenotonsillectomy compared to watchful waiting in preschool children [^bd9ba762]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Polysomnography (PSG)

Each participant identified by questionnaire will undergo full overnight sleep studies using standard clinical pediatric techniques and analyses. At each acquisition point, the sleep study results will only be included if they capture a minimum of 4 h recording time and at least 2 cycles of REM sleep; if these are not obtained, a repeat PSG will be undertaken.

Total sleep time and the obstructive apnoea hypopnea index (AHI) defined as the total number of obstructive apnoeas, mixed apnoeas, and obstructive hypopneas per hour of sleep will be calculated. PSG will be scored using American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2007 guidelines, as these guidelines were current at the time of study design and its commencement.

Sleep study concordance

As sleep studies will be carried out in 3 different sleep laboratories, a maximum of two experienced sleep technologists will be solely responsible for analysis of the PSG studies in each center. Analysis criteria have been agreed upon and those involved in analyzing studies will meet regularly to evaluate studies and ensure concordance. No published data exists on multi-center trial concordance for pediatrics.

The severity of OSA is defined by the number of obstructive apnoea & hypopnea events that occur per hour of sleep time expressed as the index of events per hour (OAHI). Standard diagnostic categories for pediatric OSA will be used and are: Primary Snoring < 1 event/h; mild OSA 1–5 events/h; moderate OSA 5–10 events/h; and severe OSA > 10 events/h. Severe OSA experience nocturnal respiratory failure and severe desaturations, and there is clinical imperative for them to receive the beneficial effects of adenotonsillectomy.

Data collection & storage

This study will generate a significant amount of data, due to the large amounts of data points per test and the 2 time points of study. The database for POSTA has been custom-designed to allow handling of this data. It is a secure centralized web-based system that allows transfer of data directly from source for many of the data points. Each study site can upload information directly into the centralized system, ensuring clean and compatible data for analysis. The direct export of PSG and neurocognitive data into this central database will minimize errors that could otherwise occur from manual data entry. Summary data can be generated and exported to relevant statistical packages according to requirements for data analysis.

### Effectiveness of adenotonsillectomy vs watchful waiting in young children with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea: a randomized clinical trial [^a2e8e16e]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Adenotonsillectomy (ATE) is one of the most common surgical procedures to treat children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but to our knowledge there are no randomized clinical trials confirming the benefit of surgery compared with watchful waiting in children between 2 and 4 years of age.

Objective

To determine whether ATE is more effective than watchful waiting for treating otherwise healthy children with mild to moderate OSA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2014 to December 2017 at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. A total of 60 children, 2 to 4 years of age, with an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) score of 2 or greater and less than 10, were randomized to ATE (n = 29) or watchful waiting (n = 31). A total of 53 participants (88%; ATE, n = 25; watchful waiting, n = 28) completed the study. Data were analyzed from August 2018 to December 2018.

Interventions

Adenotonsillectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in mean OAHI score change. Secondary outcomes were other polysomnography parameters, score on the Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (OSA-18) questionnaire, and subgroup analyses. Polysomnography and the OSA-18 questionnaire were completed at baseline and after 6 months.

Results

Of the 60 included children, 34 (57%) were boys and the mean (SD) age at first polysomnography was 38 (9) months. Both groups had a decrease in mean OAHI score, and the difference in mean OAHI score change between the groups was small (-1.0; 95% CI, -2.4 to 0.5), in favor of ATE. However, there were large differences between the groups in favor of ATE regarding the OSA-18 questionnaire (eg, total OSA-18 score: -17; 95% CI, -24 to -10). Also, a subgroup analysis of 24 children with moderate OSA (OAHI ≥ 5 and < 10) showed a meaningful difference in mean OAHI score change between the groups in favor of ATE (-3.1; 95% CI, -5.7 to -0.5). Of 28 children, 10 (36%) in the watchful waiting group received ATE after the follow-up, and 7 of these had moderate OSA at baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found only small differences between the groups regarding changes in OAHI, but further studies are needed. However, there were large improvements in quality of life after ATE. These results suggest that otherwise healthy children with mild OSA and mild effect on quality of life may benefit from watchful waiting, while children with moderate OSA should be considered for ATE.

### Do young children with nonsevere obstructive sleep apnea benefit from adenotonsillectomy? [^9e3538d1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea in children is characterized by snoring, disrupted sleep, and daytime sequelae such as hyperactivity and poor behavior. The severity of OSA in children is classified according to the apnea–hypopnea index on full-night polysomnography. Children with an AHI score greater than 1 or 2 and less then 10 are considered to have mild to moderate OSA. Traditionally, adenotonsillectomy has been the primary treatment for pediatric OSA. However, over the past several years controversy has emerged regarding the best management strategy for pediatric patients with nonsevere disease. Recent studies have shown that watchful waiting1 and therapy with anti-inflammatory medications2 are also effective treatments for children with mild to moderate OSA. Further research is needed to establish evidence-based treatment protocols for children with nonsevere OSA. Baldassari CM.

### Snoring and obstructive sleep apnea in children… [^1dd35b34]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Half of the children or fewer with symptoms suggestive of OSAS actually had the condition. Clinical symptoms may raise the suspicion, but it is not possible to establish the diagnosis without PSG. Because snoring and obstructive symptoms may resolve over time, a normal PSG finding may help the clinician decide on an observation period. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in most cases of pediatric OSAS. Obstructive symptoms may continue after adenoidectomy alone. Central apneas did not differ among the 3 groups. There were no significant differences in apneic events between the PS group and the control group. Four children, 3 of them in the OSAS group, had 1 central apnea each lasting longer than 20 seconds with desaturation below 90%. The mean OSA score had changed significantly from 3. 4 to –3.

1. The only child with a postoperative OSA score greater than 0 was a boy, the only one to still snore on most nights.

The snoring was thought to be lighter, however, and he was more alert in the daytime. The other 4 children continued to snore irregularly; 1 of them reported still having laborious breathing at night. There was a distinct improvement in the PSG results after the operation. All indexes except those for central apneas were significantly improved. The mean OAHI dropped from 6. 9 to 0.
3. The remaining obstructive events were also improved, as were all hypopnea indexes. Two children still had pathologic OAHIs postoperatively: the boy mentioned above had a score of 5. 1 and a girl had 1.
0. All the other children had OAHIs of less than 1. The periods of cardiac arousals decreased significantly, but did not disappear.

Normal PSG findings can help the clinician justify an observation period for the snoring child, since the stability of the PSG findings in the conservative group seems to indicate that, during a short interval, primary snorers do not have a tendency to develop OSA, supporting the earlier findings. 7 The finding that snoring may be restricted to a period of childhood, 1 and that almost half of the children in the conservative group showed spontaneous regression of the obstructive symptoms over the follow-up period, further supports the idea of an observation period.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement — home sleep apnea test (HSAT) in children: Use of a home sleep apnea test is not recommended for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children, and for this statement children are defined as individuals < 18 years old; the ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of individual circumstances, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. The clinical use of HSATs in pediatric populations is not recommended due to insufficient evidence, with limited literature comparing HSATs to polysomnography (PSG), inability to identify literature on HSAT devices that monitor CO2 or identify arousals, and limited comparisons in children with comorbidities or in young children.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis, multidisciplinary management and lifelong care of individuals with achondroplasia [^52465f18]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — respiratory issues and sleep-disordered breathing: Upper airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children warrant that an overnight polysomnography and sleep study "should be performed in the first year of life or at the first signs of sleep-disordered breathing, whichever comes earliest; in any case, these studies should be performed no later than at 2 years of age." Decisions about foramen magnum decompression surgery are "based on clinical and radiological reasons, including the results of polysomnography," and "the absence of central apnoea on a sleep study should not diminish the indication… in the presence of clinical and/or MRI criteria," with the note that "surgical decompression might lead to neurological and developmental improvement." Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is the "first-line treatment for OSA in children," and post-operative polysomnography "should be completed within 2–4 months after adenotonsillectomy." Children with severe OSA undergoing upper airway surgery "should be observed for post-operative complications," and all individuals treated surgically "should be evaluated for persistent or recurrent disease with follow-up sleep study assessments." For persistent OSA after adenotonsillectomy, "additional airway surgeries might be an option" following evaluation by an otolaryngologist or craniofacial surgeon with relevant expertise, and those with residual OSA "should be assessed for alternative treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure." Individuals on continuous positive airway pressure "should be assessed by a sleep medicine specialist on a regular basis" to determine when repeat sleep studies are needed since severity can change over time. Given risk of respiratory failure during infections, preventative measures such as "avoidance of passive smoking and contact with infected persons" are justified, and "respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies can be considered."

### Can history and physical examination reliably diagnose pediatric obstructive sleep apnea / hypopnea syndrome? A systematic review of the literature [^db3cc808]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Using an evidence-based technique, systematically review the literature to evaluate the accuracy of routine clinical history and physical examination in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in the pediatric patient.

Study Design and Setting

The biomedical literature was systematically reviewed. Articles comparing the results of clinical evaluation to polysomnography (PSG) were selected. The level of evidence was assessed using established evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines.

Results

Twelve articles were identified using the search criteria. Eleven of 12 articles concluded that clinical evaluation is inaccurate in the diagnosis of OSAHS. The level of evidence was good to very good (Grade B/B+).

Conclusion/Significance

Clinical history and physical examination are not reliable for diagnosing OSAHS compared with overnight PSG. Complicating the interpretation of this work is the lack of a validated PSG threshold of clinically significant disease. There is an urgent need for the development of adequate screening tests with validated clinical outcomes.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) comorbidity — sleepiness metrics and MSLT implications: Excessive daytime sleepiness is typically mild in pediatric OSA with Epworth Sleepiness Scale averages of 7.2 in untreated OSA vs 5.1 in treated OSA; in 54 pediatric OSA patients, 7 (13%) had mean sleep latencies < 10 minutes and all 7 had apnea-hypopnea indexes ≥ 10 events/h with shorter sleep latencies associated with oxygen desaturation nadirs < 92%; in a mixed-age OSA/suspected OSA cohort (age range 6–85 years), 56% were considered to have 2 or more SOREMPs on MSLT; based on these data, moderate-to-severe OSA should be treated prior to PSG–MSLT evaluation, and caution should be taken not to misattribute cortical arousals to respiratory events given the low diagnostic threshold (apnea-hypopnea index > 1 event/h) in children.

Cost/implementation

There are no data regarding costs or cost-effectiveness of CPAP therapy for children with persistent OSA. The cost of therapy varies worldwide and is largely dependent on device/mask and payor type. The panel believed the cost may be significant, as treatment is long term. Moreover, if there are other options for treatment (e.g. surgery), the cost-effectiveness of CPAP may be lower. As such, CPAP is cost-effective if it is the only viable treatment option.

If coverage is provided by insurance, proof of "good" adherence to the therapy is typically required. Currently, insurance companies use adult criteria for determining adherence, which further complicates things. Even if covered, the supplies are expensive and often require repeated out-of-pocket costs. For children with craniofacial abnormalities, some patients may not be able to find a good-fitting mask, and custom masks are not easy to obtain.

Within the United States and worldwide, inequities exist regarding access to specialists, sleep laboratories, centers for pediatric mask fitting, or home care services. The importance of access to centers with pediatric-specific expertise is higher for children with persistent OSA, who often have medical complexities. In regions with limited access to PSG, treatment with autoadjusting CPAP is encouraged/preferred. Last, at the time of writing, there are large supply chain issues with obtaining CPAP machines, and there has been a global recall on some devices, which has significantly impacted availability.

What others are saying

The AAP and the Pediatric Society of New Zealand both recommend the use of CPAP in children with persistent OSA.

Remarks/future research opportunities

There is a need for:

- Well-designed studies examining short- and long-term adherence to treatment, with a particular focus on what constitutes acceptable adherence in children.
- Large, multicenter studies focusing on outcomes that have not been adequately targeted (QOL, mood, weight changes, cognitive function, behavioral changes, adverse events, snoring, sleepiness [subjective and Epworth sleepiness scale], oxygen saturation).
- A focus on the long-term impact of CPAP masks on facial growth and the use of custom masks.
- Comparative effectiveness data and cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with other therapies
- Standardization of variables used to define OSA, such as AHI, oAHI, and respiratory disturbance index, as well as pediatric definitions for effectiveness and adherence.

Question 2: Should children with persistent OSA undergo orthodontic/dentofacial orthopedic treatment?

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, with comorbidities), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pulse oximetry as an initial diagnostic test for sleep-disordered breathing in pediatric patients with comorbid disorders if cardiorespiratory sleep studies are not available. Be cautious when interpreting abnormal results because desaturations may have varying causes. Consider referring patients to more complex studies to assess for hypoventilation and determine the cause and mechanisms of desaturation.

1 Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by partial or complete airway obstruction during sleep which affects 1%−4% of children. Long‐term consequences of untreated OSA include pulmonary and systemic hypertension, insulin resistance, impaired neurocognitive and behavioral functioning, and reduced quality of life. Early identification of OSA is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment to potentially reverse associated negative outcomes.

Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of OSA. However, there are significant barriers that limit access for children. Referral for PSG is associated with high rates of loss to follow‐up, with approximately half of children not completing the evaluation. In the United States of America, socioeconomic status and geographic barriers increase wait times for children from underserviced communities. In Canada, pediatric PSG wait time can be up to 2 years due to a lack of PSG resources, and this time has been further exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Other screening tools for the detection of OSA include home polygraphy, oximetry, and patient questionnaires. While home polygraphy allows for the measurement of respiratory events, airflow, and oxygen levels, it is unable to detect arousals or hypercapnia, often leading to an underestimation of OSA severity. This limitation, along with the fact that it remains incompletely validated, resulted in a lack of endorsement from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, although it is used in resource‐limited settings in other countries. Oximetry is less costly than sleep studies but is not uniformly funded across Canada, so accessibility remains a barrier. Additionally, while overnight oximetry has a high positive predictive value (PPV) for OSA, a normal oximetry study does not rule out OSA. Patient questionnaires have consistently been reported to have limited sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of OSA. Overall, these methods have restricted accessibility and/or only correlate weakly with PSG findings. Alternate accessible and reliable screening tools are needed to accurately identify and prioritize children most likely to have OSA for definitive evaluation with PSG.

Key Action Statement 8 — intranasal corticosteroids for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS): Clinicians may prescribe topical intranasal corticosteroids for children with mild OSAS in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for children with mild postoperative OSAS (Evidence Quality: Grade B, Recommendation Strength: Option). Mild OSAS is defined, for this indication, as an AHI < 5 per hour. Several studies have shown that intranasal steroids decrease the degree of OSAS; however, although OSAS improves, residual OSAS may remain, and nasal steroids are not recommended as a first-line therapy. Benefits include improvement in mild OSAS and accompanying symptoms with a preponderance of benefit over harm, low risk of steroid-related adverse effects, and a moderate role for patient and family preference when OSAS is mild. Response to treatment should be measured objectively after a course of treatment of approximately 6 weeks, and because the long-term effect is unknown with individual variability in response, clinicians should continue to observe patients for symptoms of recurrence and adverse effects; long-term observation is required.

### Adenotonsillectomy for treatment of mild sleep-disordered breathing in children… [^ab164c1b]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Meaning In children with mild SDB, adenotonsillectomy resulted in no statistically significant differences in changes in executive function or attention but led to improved secondary outcomes including symptoms, behavior, and blood pressure. Importance The utility of adenotonsillectomy in children who have habitual snoring without frequent obstructive breathing events is unknown. Conclusions In children with mild SDB, adenotonsillectomy, compared with watchful waiting, did not significantly improve executive function or attention at 12 months. However, children with adenotonsillectomy had improved secondary outcomes, including behavior, symptoms, and quality of life and decreased blood pressure, at 12-month follow-up. CHAT enrolled children with OSA, excluding approximately one-half of all children who were adenotonsillectomy candidates but who had infrequent obstructive events.

6 Although children who have habitual snoring without frequent obstructive events may be at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, 7 the effect of adenotonsillectomy on behavioral and health outcomes in these children is not known. The difference between groups was not statistically significant. The GNG sustained-attention d-prime value improved slightly from baseline to 12 months in both groups without evidence of group differences. Sensitivity analysis based on multiple imputation yielded similar results. There are several potential explanations for the lack of observed effect on executive function and attention. Improvements may be difficult to discern, given the wide range of factors influencing cognitive function and test performance.

Cognitive testing in controlled conditions may not accurately reflect performance in real-world situations when children need to attend to multiple tasks and may be influenced if sleep was suboptimal prior to assessment. Another possible explanation is that past studies that have identified an association between cognitive impairment and SDB may have been biased, as suggested by a large cross-sectional study that showed marked attenuation of an association between habitual snoring and cognition after accounting for multiple confounders. 30.

1 INTRODUCTION

The spectrum of obstructive sleep‐disordered breathing (oSDB) in children ranges from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Primary snoring is characterized by snoring occurring more than three nights per week with normal overnight polysomnography (PSG) and is present in 6%–17% of all children. OSAS is defined by an increased apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI) — the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour — during PSG and is present in 1%–5% of all children. It is widely acknowledged that an AHI of at least 5 per hour warrants consideration of treatment, most commonly adenotonsillectomy. However, when the AHI is less than 5 per hour and there are no clinical signs of complications related to oSDB, watchful waiting may be a valid approach. Official guidelines generally recommend performing an overnight PSG in all children with a history of chronic snoring to measure the AHI, assess the severity of oSDB, and determine the need for treatment. In practice, however, most children do not have access to overnight PSG due to the limited availability of sleep laboratories worldwide.

My personal review of last year's literature on oSDB in children focuses on publications dealing with the recognition of children who require treatment for oSDB, including the place of overnight PSG in their management.

Regarding specific circumstances for central sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to be particularly cautious when obtaining oximetry to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea in < 2 years old pediatric patients since they are predisposed to CSA (due to developmental immaturity), and oxygen desaturations cannot discriminate between obstructive and central events.

Objective

This technical report describes the procedures involved in developing recommendations on the management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

Methods

The literature from 1999 through 2011 was evaluated.

Results and Conclusions

A total of 3166 titles were reviewed, of which 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II through IV. The prevalence of OSAS ranged from 0% to 5.7%, with obesity being an independent risk factor. OSAS was associated with cardiovascular, growth, and neurobehavioral abnormalities and possibly inflammation. Most diagnostic screening tests had low sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of OSAS resulted in improvements in behavior and attention and likely improvement in cognitive abilities. Primary treatment is adenotonsillectomy (AT). Data were insufficient to recommend specific surgical techniques; however, children undergoing partial tonsillectomy should be monitored for possible recurrence of OSAS. Although OSAS improved postoperatively, the proportion of patients who had residual OSAS ranged from 13% to 29% in low-risk populations to 73% when obese children were included and stricter polysomnographic criteria were used. Nevertheless, OSAS may improve after AT even in obese children, thus supporting surgery as a reasonable initial treatment. A significant number of obese patients required intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) postoperatively, which reinforces the need for inpatient observation. CPAP was effective in the treatment of OSAS, but adherence is a major barrier. For this reason, CPAP is not recommended as first-line therapy for OSAS when AT is an option. Intranasal steroids may ameliorate mild OSAS, but follow-up is needed. Data were insufficient to recommend rapid maxillary expansion.

### Polysomnography for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children under 2 years of age [^9c4ab6b5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Analysis of PSG data was completed by a single experienced scorer using the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). 34 Although AASM sleep staging criteria can be applied starting at 2 months of age, sleep staging for infants < 6 months of age was completed using the criteria outline by Anders et al. 35 as the standard protocol in the laboratory where the study was completed. For the purpose of analysis, active sleep (AS) in infants < 6 months and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) in infants ≥ 6 months of age were combined as AS/REM and quiet sleep (QS) in infants < 6 months and slow wave sleep (SWS) in infants ≥ 6 months of age were combined as QS/SWS. Obstructive apnea was defined as the cessation of airflow (< 10% of baseline level) for a minimum duration of two missed breaths with evidence of on‐going respiratory efforts. Central apnea was defined as the cessation of airflow (< 10% of baseline level) for a minimum of two missed breaths if followed by an arousal, awakening or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation, or for ≥ 20 sec in the absence of any associated events. Mixed apneas included central and obstructive components in the same event. Hypopneas were defined based on a decrease in airflow between 10–50% of baseline which was associated with an arousal, awakening, or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation. Apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated based on the number of apneas and hypopneas during sleep divided by the total sleep time. The obstructive‐mixed AHI (OMAHI) included obstructive and mixed apneas and hypopneas, while the central AHI (CAHI) included central apneas and hypopneas. Oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was calculated based on the number of oxygen desaturation events ≥ 3% during sleep divided by the total sleep time (TST). Classification of SDB severity by AHI was based on pediatric studies where AHI < 1 event/hr is considered normal, AHI 1–5 events/hr indicates mild SDB, AHI 5–10 events/hr indicates moderate SDB, and AHI > 10 events/hr indicates severe SDB. 36, 37 Severity classification by physicians was obtained from the physician report for the PSG. This was either included in the PSG interpretation report or in the first clinic letter following the completion of the PSG. Treatment recommendations were also recorded. Where the physician classification crossed two categories (e.g. mild to moderate), the most severe category was assigned.

### Polysomnography for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children under 2 years of age [^20c0ccf9]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Polysomnography (PSG) is the accepted standard for measuring sleep disordered breathing (SDB) including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in both adults and children. 1, 2 In children > 1 year of age undergoing in‐laboratory attended PSG, an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) > 1.5 events/hr of sleep is statistically abnormal. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, the cut‐off values that define clinically significant abnormalities, or level at which treatment is likely to alter outcome are yet to be determined. Therefore, PSG results, including but not limited to AHI, are part of the information used by clinicians to diagnose SDB and OSA. 7 PSG criteria used in research studies to define SDB and OSA vary and are based on cut‐offs applied to AHI, 8 respiratory disturbance index (RDI), 9 obstructive AHI (OAHI), 10, 11, 12, 13 or a combination of respiratory parameters on PSG. 14 Criteria used to determine SDB in infancy are less well‐reported with no accepted criteria to define an abnormal AHI in children less than 1 year of age. In fact, infants < 1 year of age are recognized to have unique issues with respect to SDB such that this group is excluded from practice guidelines. 2, 15

There are several reasons why applying the same criteria for an abnormal AHI in children to infants may not be appropriate. Prior to birth, the fetus does not rely on breathing for gas exchange and, therefore, there is considerable variability of both the amplitude and frequency of fetal breathing movements. 16 After birth, variability continues to decrease such that a more stable pattern of both breathing and heart rate develops. Apnea, 17 periodic breathing, 18, 19 and oxygen desaturation 20, 21, 22, 23 during sleep are normal events in healthy infants in the first few weeks after birth. Decrease in respiratory events with increasing age reflects greater stability in the respiratory control system. 20, 23 Infants have more compliant upper airways and chest wall which increase the collapsibility of the upper airway and predisposes to paradoxical respirations. 24, 25, 26 Finally, infant arousal responses are immature with greater variability in the arousal response to stimuli such as hypoxemia and changes in upper airway resistance. 27, 28 This variability in arousal response, along with greater variability of oxygen desaturation events, is likely to impact scoring of central apneas and hypopneas and, thus, alter the normal range of AHI in younger infants.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, technical considerations), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain regular monitoring with a minimum of pulse oximetry and CO2 monitoring if patients are on CPAP therapy or bilevel positive airway pressure therapy.

### Managing the child with persistent sleep apnea [^cca8f94a]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 2% to 4% of American children, and is associated with metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive sequelae. The primary treatment for pediatric OSA is adenotonsillectomy. Children with obesity, craniofacial syndromes, and severe baseline OSA are at risk for persistent disease. Evaluation of persistent OSA should focus on identifying the causes of upper airway obstruction. Interventions should be tailored to address the patient's symptomatology, sites of obstruction, and preference for surgical versus medical management. Further research is needed to identify management protocols that result in improved outcomes for children with persistent OSA.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^d1465980]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Split-night polysomnography (PSG) diagnostic accuracy — In adults evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the initial truncated PSG (first 2–3 hours) compared to the full-night recording showed strong correlation of 2-hour and 3-hour apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with full-night AHI (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.93 and 0.97). Diagnostic performance from the truncated period included sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67 to 0.90) and specificity of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.98) using AHI ≥ 5, and sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.00) using AHI ≥ 15. Comparing the first 3 hours versus total sleep time, concordance correlation coefficient adjusted for REM and supine sleep was 0.96 with an accuracy of 93%, and accuracy for AHI cutoffs of ≥ 5, ≥ 10 and ≥ 15 were 95%, 97% and 99.5%. A 2-hour recording identified an optimal AHI cutoff of ≥ 8 events/h with sensitivity 0.92, and another study comparing the first 3 hours to the entire night did not find a significant difference in AHI. Given the lack of definitive data, the task force (TF) elected not to designate a specific AHI threshold to initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration during a split-night study protocol, and the quality of evidence for diagnostic accuracy was downgraded to low due to indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias.

### Quality measures for the care of pediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^9aff7646]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

The Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a Task Force to develop quality measures as part of its strategic plan to promote high quality patient-centered care. Among many potential dimensions of quality, the AASM requested Workgroups to develop outcome and process measures to aid in evaluating the quality of care of five common sleep disorders: insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea in adults, obstructive sleep apnea in children, restless legs syndrome, and narcolepsy. This paper describes the rationale, background, general methods development, and considerations in implementation of these quality measures in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. This document describes measurement methods for five desirable process measures: assessment of symptoms and risk factors of OSA, initiation of an evidence-based action plan, objective evaluation of high-risk children with OSA by obtaining a polysomnogram (PSG), reassessment of signs and symptoms of OSA within 12 months, and documentation of objective assessment of positive airway pressure adherence. When these five process measures are met, clinicians should be able to achieve the two defined outcomes: improve detection of childhood OSA and reduce signs and symptoms of OSA after initiation of a management plan. The AASM recommends the use of these measures as part of quality improvement programs that will enhance the ability to improve care for patients with childhood OSA.

### Use of polysomnography and home sleep apnea tests for the longitudinal management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical guidance statement [^147ee923]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical guidance — follow-up polysomnography (PSG) and home sleep apnea test (HSAT) use in adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is specified as follows: Follow-up PSG or HSAT is not recommended for routine reassessment of asymptomatic patients with OSA on PAP therapy; however, follow-up PSG or HSAT can be used to reassess patients with recurrent or persistent symptoms, despite good PAP adherence. Follow-up PSG or HSAT is recommended to assess response to treatment with non-PAP interventions. Follow-up PSG or HSAT may be used if clinically significant weight gain or loss has occurred since diagnosis of OSA or initiation of its treatment. Follow-up PSG may be used for reassessment of sleep-related hypoventilation and/or sleep-related hypoxemia following initiation of treatment for OSA. Follow-up PSG or HSAT may be used in patients being treated for OSA who develop or have a change in cardiovascular disease. Follow-up PSG may be used in patients with unexplained PAP device-generated data.

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^ecd0de2c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children — operational definition and thresholds are specified using the obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (oAHI). The oAHI corresponds to the sum of obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time (central apneas not included). Persistent OSA was defined as an oAHI ≥ 1 event/h. For oAHI > 1 and < 5 events/h (mild OSA), the literature reported antiinflammatory medications, whereas treatment with CPAP or surgery was typically reserved for those with persistent symptoms or oAHI > 5 events/h. Because of limited guidance and a higher risk of neurocognitive sequela in children with oAHI > 5 events/h, the panel focused their attention on this population; for the search strategy, if only AHI was reported, oAHI was not used.
