## Question

A 9-year-old girl with a history of atopic dermatitis presents to your clinic with persistent erythematous, pruritic patches on her eyelids and neck. Her mother reports that the rash flares up frequently despite regular use of emollients and short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids. She is concerned about the potential side effects of long-term steroid use, especially on the delicate skin of her daughter's face and neck. On examination, you note mild involvement of the eyelids and moderate involvement of the neck, with no signs of infection.

Based on current EADV guidelines, what topical therapy would you recommend for this patient's atopic dermatitis affecting delicate areas, and how would your choice differ between mild and moderate-to-severe disease? Briefly justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best topical therapy for a 9-year-old girl with atopic dermatitis on delicate areas (eyelids and neck), including how recommendations differ between mild and moderate-to-severe disease, and how to justify the choice with EADV/ETFAD guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and severity stratification. Then, I should verify the EADV/ETFAD position on first-line therapy for delicate areas. Next, I will differentiate treatment by severity, including induction and maintenance strategies. After that, I need to check safety considerations and counseling points. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and confirm alignment with guideline strength and certainty.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and severity assignment. The child has persistent, pruritic AD on the eyelids and neck, with eyelid involvement mild and neck involvement moderate, and no signs of infection; the mother is concerned about steroid-related adverse effects on thin skin, which is a key driver for agent selection in sensitive areas [^2894cfa9].

> I need to verify the EADV/ETFAD stance on delicate areas. The 2020 EADV/ETFAD position paper explicitly recommends topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) as first-line therapy in delicate body areas, with pimecrolimus preferred for mild disease and tacrolimus for moderate-to-severe disease and for long-term topical treatment, which directly addresses the mother's concern about steroid exposure on the face and neck [^2894cfa9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning steroids entirely. I should confirm the role of topical corticosteroids (TCS) in sensitive areas. Contemporary guidelines still endorse TCS as effective anti-inflammatory therapy, but they advise avoiding prolonged continuous use of medium-to-high potency agents on sensitive skin and favor intermittent, lowest-effective-potency strategies; in delicate areas, many clinicians prioritize TCIs to mitigate atrophy risk, which aligns with EADV/ETFAD's TCI-first approach in these regions [^b74d110f] [^3f170fdc] [^2894cfa9].

> For mild disease on the eyelids, I should confirm the preferred agent and formulation. EADV/ETFAD recommends pimecrolimus 1% cream as first-line in delicate areas for mild AD; it is nonsteroidal and suitable for the thin periocular skin, and can be used intermittently at the first signs of pruritus or erythema to prevent flares, which fits this child's mild eyelid involvement [^2894cfa9] [^64bcd8bb].

> For moderate disease on the neck, I need to ensure I am choosing the stronger TCI and planning maintenance. EADV/ETFAD advises tacrolimus for moderate-to-severe AD and for long-term topical therapy; induction can be twice daily until clearance or near-clearance, followed by proactive twice-weekly application to previously involved sites to reduce relapses, which matches the child's moderate neck involvement and frequent flares [^2894cfa9] [^421623c0] [^fe929f66].

> Wait, let me verify the practical sequencing and whether a short steroid pulse is ever appropriate in sensitive areas. Expert algorithms suggest that for acute flares in sensitive sites, a brief course of low-potency TCS can be layered with or alternated with a TCI to gain rapid control, then transitioned back to TCI-only maintenance; this balances efficacy and safety when inflammation is more intense, and is consistent with broader guidance to minimize steroid exposure on thin skin [^64bcd8bb] [^b74d110f].

> I should double-check safety counseling and monitoring. TCIs are generally well tolerated; transient burning or stinging can occur, and patients should be counseled on proper application amounts and sun protection, especially on exposed areas like the neck; importantly, the boxed warning about malignancy risk has not been substantiated in real-world pediatric data, but counseling remains prudent [^8d1009a7].

> Let me consider adjuncts and what to avoid. Emollients remain foundational and should continue at least daily; dilute bleach baths are not routinely recommended for mild disease and may be considered only selectively in moderate-to-severe disease with clear instructions; I should also avoid prolonged continuous TCS on the face/neck and avoid high-potency classes in these regions to mitigate atrophy risk [^41d22e60] [^736562b7] [^3f170fdc].

> I will now synthesize the plan. For the eyelids (mild): pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily at the first sign of itch or erythema, with continued daily emollients; for the neck (moderate): tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment twice daily until clearance or near-clearance, then proactive twice-weekly tacrolimus to previously involved areas to prevent flares; if the neck flare is intense, a short, time-limited course of low-potency TCS can be layered or alternated with tacrolimus for rapid control before transitioning back to TCI-only maintenance, with explicit return precautions and follow-up to reassess control and tolerability [^2894cfa9] [^421623c0] [^64bcd8bb] [^b74d110f].

> But wait, what if topical therapy fails despite adherence and optimization? I should confirm escalation thresholds. If disease remains uncontrolled with appropriate topical therapy and education, guidelines support considering systemic options in eligible patients; however, dupilumab is approved from age 12 years, so for a 9-year-old, traditional immunosuppressants or phototherapy would be the principal considerations if escalation is needed, ideally in coordination with pediatric dermatology [^7ba59e36] [^9b13e31f] [^f9903c05].

> In summary, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise and reference-aligned. Per EADV/ETFAD 2020, for AD involving delicate areas, TCIs are first-line: pimecrolimus for mild disease and tacrolimus for moderate-to-severe disease and for long-term maintenance, with emollients continued and judicious, intermittent use of low-potency TCS only when necessary for acute control; this approach directly addresses the mother's concerns while maintaining efficacy and safety in a 9-year-old with eyelid and neck involvement [^2894cfa9] [^421623c0] [^b74d110f].

---

Per EADV/ETFAD 2020, **topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are first-line** for delicate areas (eyelids, neck) in pediatric atopic dermatitis, with pimecrolimus preferred for mild disease and tacrolimus for moderate-to-severe disease or long-term use [^2894cfa9]. TCIs avoid steroid-induced atrophy and are safe for the face and intertriginous sites [^27890d6c]; apply twice daily until clearance, then taper to twice weekly for maintenance [^421623c0] [^fe929f66]. Use low-potency topical corticosteroids only for short courses (≤ 7 days) if inflammation is severe or refractory, and continue emollients daily [^b74d110f] [^41d22e60].

---

## EADV/ETFAD 2020 recommendations for delicate areas

The EADV/ETFAD 2020 guidelines provide **clear recommendations** for managing AD in delicate areas:

- **First-line therapy**: TCIs are recommended as first-line therapy for delicate areas (eyelids, face, neck, intertriginous regions) [^2894cfa9].

- **Mild disease**: Pimecrolimus 1% cream is preferred for mild AD in delicate areas due to its favorable safety profile and efficacy [^2894cfa9].

- **Moderate-to-severe disease**: Tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment is recommended for moderate-to-severe AD or for long-term treatment in delicate areas [^2894cfa9].

- **Proactive therapy**: TCIs are recommended for proactive therapy to prevent relapses, with twice-weekly application to previously affected areas [^421623c0] [^fe929f66].

---

## Rationale for TCI use in delicate areas

TCIs are preferred in delicate areas because they **do not cause skin atrophy**, unlike topical corticosteroids, making them suitable for long-term use on thin skin [^27890d6c]. They also have a favorable safety profile in pediatric patients, with minimal systemic absorption and no significant long-term adverse effects reported [^notfound]. Clinical studies demonstrate significant efficacy in reducing inflammation, pruritus, and relapse rates in delicate areas [^notfound].

---

## Practical application of TCI therapy

For practical application, **induction therapy** should involve applying pimecrolimus or tacrolimus twice daily to affected areas until clearance or near-clearance is achieved. For **maintenance therapy**, apply TCIs twice weekly to previously affected areas to prevent relapses [^421623c0] [^fe929f66]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, proper application techniques, and the importance of continued emollient use [^a3a44057].

---

## Role of topical corticosteroids (TCS)

While TCIs are first-line in delicate areas, **TCS remain important** for short-term management of acute flares or severe inflammation. Use low-potency TCS (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) for short courses (≤ 7 days) to rapidly control inflammation, then transition back to TCIs for maintenance [^b74d110f]. Avoid prolonged use of TCS in delicate areas to prevent skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and other adverse effects [^3f170fdc].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures should include **daily emollients** to maintain skin barrier function and reduce relapse risk [^41d22e60]. Identify and avoid triggers such as allergens, irritants, and stressors [^a3a44057]. Provide education on proper skin care, application techniques, and adherence to therapy [^a04afdbf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Alternative therapy** | **Maintenance therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | Pimecrolimus 1% cream | Low-potency TCS (≤ 7 days) | Twice-weekly pimecrolimus |
| Moderate-to-severe | Tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment | Low-potency TCS (short course) | Twice-weekly tacrolimus |

---

Per EADV/ETFAD 2020, **TCIs are first-line** for delicate areas in pediatric AD: pimecrolimus for mild disease and tacrolimus for moderate-to-severe or long-term use, with proactive maintenance to prevent relapses. Reserve low-potency TCS for short rescue courses, and maintain daily emollients and trigger avoidance.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1–4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5–7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-dupilumab for children and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^e454dbd8]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of atopic dermatitis, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based), its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome and age group. In addition, future approaches and research priorities are discussed.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines 2023: highlights [^9f5fc744]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, with a complex pathogenesis. It is characterized by eczematous skin lesions, pruritus, and recurrent skin infections and has a negative impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force Atopic Dermatitis Guideline Panel recently released updated AD guidelines. This guideline focuses on addressing clinical questions using trustworthy guideline development standards, including mitigating the potential influence of financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. A multidisciplinary panel used systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform specific recommendations addressing optimal use of topical treatments, dilute bleach bath, dietary avoidance/elimination, allergen immunotherapy, and systemic treatments. The comprehensive recommendations, emphasizing the third principle of evidence-based medicine-that evidence alone is never enough, and that patient values and preferences must be carefully considered when determining optimal treatments for patients and populations-provide a framework to support clinicians in selecting an optimal treatment plan for each patient. This review provides an overview of the guideline and discusses how those recommendations relate to current practice.

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^b549e6b8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

### Developing drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children (≥ 3 months to… [^f9e8f6f9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children. Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease. Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option. Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design. Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children. The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for "the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject". Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design. Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population. We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (≥ 3 months to < 18 years of age). This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).

### Efficacy and safety of topical brepocitinib for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis: a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, dose-ranging and parallel-group study [^3b971bb4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic skin disease that affects up to 10% of adults and 20% of children in developed countries. AD negatively impacts the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers/families, with greater disease severity being associated with poorer HRQoL. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, guidelines recommend regimented hygiene, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which can be used in combination with other treatments such as phototherapy for moderate‐to‐severe or refractory AD. The ultimate goals for treatment are to repair and maintain the skin barrier, to reduce sensations of itching and burning, and to prevent AD relapse. Despite current treatments, there is still an unmet need for safe and effective therapies to improve disease management and long‐term patient outcomes.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — Recommendation 12 (mild disease; dilute bleach baths): In patients with mild atopic dermatitis, the JTF panel suggests against adding dilute bleach baths to topical therapy (no dilute-bleach based) baths (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). The estimated treatment effect of dilute bleach baths for milder AD (eg, EASI of 10) was, on average, small (−2.2 points in comparison to a minimally important difference of 6.6). The guideline panel inferred that most well-informed patients with mild AD are likely to place a high value on maintaining a simple treatment routine that is minimally disruptive, and most fully informed patients are likely to value avoidance of the burdens of bleach baths and their uncertain harms over likely a small, possibly unimportant, benefit in AD severity, while acknowledging substantial variability in values such that a number of patients might opt for adjunctive dilute bleach baths even if disease activity is mild.

### When does atopic dermatitis warrant systemic therapy? Recommendations from an expert panel of the international eczema council [^524d1500]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although most patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are effectively managed with topical medication, a significant minority require systemic therapy. Guidelines for decision making about advancement to systemic therapy are lacking.

Objective

To guide those considering use of systemic therapy in AD and provide a framework for evaluation before making this therapeutic decision with the patient.

Methods

A subgroup of the International Eczema Council determined aspects to consider before prescribing systemic therapy. Topics were assigned to expert reviewers who performed a topic-specific literature review, referred to guidelines when available, and provided interpretation and expert opinion.

Results

We recommend a systematic and holistic approach to assess patients with severe signs and symptoms of AD and impact on quality of life before systemic therapy. Steps taken before commencing systemic therapy include considering alternate or concomitant diagnoses, avoiding trigger factors, optimizing topical therapy, ensuring adequate patient/caregiver education, treating coexistent infection, assessing the impact on quality of life, and considering phototherapy.

Limitations

Our work is a consensus statement, not a systematic review.

Conclusion

The decision to start systemic medication should include assessment of severity and quality of life while considering the individual's general health status, psychologic needs, and personal attitudes toward systemic therapies.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Good practice statement — clinicians managing all severities of atopic dermatitis (AD) should, before issuing any new therapy, perform the following: ensure the correct diagnosis and identify complicating diagnoses; provide education, for instance an information guide about the disease and an action plan; address trigger avoidance; ensure proper medication use and adherence; and encourage application of a bland moisturizer titrated to symptomatic benefit (at least once, often multiple times, per day).

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — Recommendation 11 (moderate–severe disease; dilute bleach baths): In patients with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis, the JTF panel suggests, in addition to topical therapy, dilute bleach baths over usual (no dilute bleach-based) baths (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the probability to improve AD severity by 50% with adjunctive dilute bleach baths was 32% vs 22% in the control group, with patients using dilute bleach baths likely to see effects in AD severity within 4 weeks of treatment and little to no difference of adverse events, with mild events consisting of dry skin and irritation. Values and preferences examples note that an EASI (scale of 0–72) of 40 might observe a modest improvement by 8.8 points, whereas an EASI of 10 may improve by 2.2 points, and the panel inferred that patients would value the moderate certainty for a 10% higher chance of halving the severity of their AD. Implementation guidance emphasizes that dilute bleach baths should be adjunctive to standard AD skin care and can be suggested if minimally disruptive, used as an adjunct to otherwise good skin care, with clear written instructions, and after consideration of the extent of open skin.

### Topical therapy for atopic dermatitis: what is new and the new paradigm [^a8c83ad3]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that requires a complex management strategy, which often involves multiple and diverse topicals and systemic treatment regimens. While topical steroids and more recently calcineurin inhibitors have been the mainstay therapy for mild-to-moderate disease, recent advances in the understanding of AD pathogenesis have led to the development of different new targets, rapidly widening our therapeutic armamentarium. This review summarizes their efficacy and safety data. We also review topical optimization strategies, including the recently published topical volume calculator, to maximize long-term disease control, especially when using multiple agents at the same time.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

Strength of recommendation and certainty of evidence — definitions used in this atopic dermatitis guideline are as follows: Strong recommendation for the use of an intervention implies that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens and that the recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances; strong recommendation against implies that risk and burden clearly outweigh benefits and that the recommendation applies to most patients in most circumstances; good practice statement is guidance viewed by the Work Group as imperative to clinical practice when supporting evidence was considerable but indirect and certainty about an intervention's impact was high with benefits clearly outweighing harms, and these are strong recommendations whose implementation is considered to clearly result in beneficial outcomes; conditional recommendation for the use of an intervention implies that benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens and that the most appropriate action may differ depending on the patient or other stakeholder values; conditional recommendation against the use of an intervention implies that risks and burden are closely balanced with benefits with similar dependence on patient or stakeholder values. Certainty-of-evidence categories are defined as high (very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect), moderate (moderately confident in the estimate with a possibility the true effect is substantially different), low (confidence in the estimate is limited and the true effect may be substantially different), and very low (the estimate of effect is very uncertain and the true effect may be substantially different).

Topical ruxolitinib — patient preferences and implementation in mild atopic dermatitis (AD): The panel inferred that most well-informed patients with mild AD would prefer to avoid the uncertain small increase in serious harms over the modest benefits of adding topical ruxolitinib compared with standard care, and use might be minimized when used on less than 20% body surface area, in nonimmunocompromised nor immunosuppressed patients, and in a short-term or noncontinuous manner. Although the panel did not yet render an official recommendation for topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) vs ruxolitinib and many clinical experts and patients still want TCS or TCI first, experts expressed that although most patients may not prefer ruxolitinib as first-line treatment, it might be a resource to consider for those for whom TCS and TCI do not yield sufficient control.

### Efficacy of nonprescription moisturizers for atopic dermatitis: an updated review of clinical evidence [^41d22e60]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects more than 18 million people in the USA. Daily moisturization is the standard or "bedrock" of the basic disease management of AD. A comprehensive review of 14 independent published guidelines from across the globe (USA, UK, Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Canada, South Africa, and individual European countries) revealed that daily moisturization was a consistent recommendation for AD management.

Guidelines recommend liberal application of moisturizer on lesional and nonlesional skin, ideally at least twice daily. In mild AD, a daily moisturizer may be the primary therapy but should also be continued as complementary therapy when treating moderate and severe disease. Reviews of this subject area have revealed similar recommendations; however, these studies were mainly focused on the active ingredients applied or on less recent or selected studies, respectively.

The objective of this review was to evaluate and present the clinical data behind commercially available products in a succinct guide based on accepted scientific criteria, so that healthcare providers can make informed choices and recommendations to their patients for proven therapies.

Conditions to consider include that "Allergic comorbidities that will likely be responsive to immunotherapy (eg, allergic rhinitis, or asthma with relevant sensitization) may lead to benefits for multiple diseases and therefore favor AIT", "Values and preferences regarding SCIT vs SLIT (eg, convenience, age, travel plans)", and the "plausibility of allergen sensitization to reflect allergy". The linked review included "23 RCTs (11 SCIT and 12 SLIT)" with "1957 adult and pediatric patients (median of study mean ages, 19 years; range of means, 4–34 years)", mostly to "HDMs (D pteronyssinus or D farinae)", with AIT "typically for 12 (range 3–36) months", added to "standard topical therapy including TCSs and moisturizers", and "Most of the studies included polysensitized patients in addition to HDM sensitization".

Definitions of Flare in AD Clinical Guidelines

Eleven past and current clinical guidelines on the management of AD across the USA, Europe, and Asia — including guidance on flares — were identified. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2014 guidelines on the prevention of AD flares described such disease episodes as "periods of acute worsening" but stopped short of providing a precise definition. Instead, it was noted that definitions vary across studies and that this is an ongoing area of research. However, a specific definition is absent from the 2023 edition on AD management with topical therapy, despite recommending flare prevention as a critical primary efficacy outcome.

The AAAAI and ACAAI Joint Task Force published evidence-based guidelines for AD treatment in 2024; these refer to flare in AD as "active disease" and "uncontrolled disease", which requires treatment to induce remission. These definitions are vague and inappropriate, in that flares typically occur during the management of active disease, with any flares occurring during inactive disease referred to as "relapses". However, the guideline recommendations for future research suggest to increase the emphasis on PROMs, such as RECAP, which is a seven-item questionnaire designed to capture the experience of disease control.

A position paper on the management of AD by the 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) task force and the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) recognized flare as a clinically meaningful term. However, the authors acknowledged the term is "difficult to delineate", suggesting the definition of "acute, clinically significant worsening of signs and symptoms of AD requiring therapeutic intervention". This definition was mirrored in the 2022 European Guidelines on AD (EuroGuiDerm), which differed to the ETFAD definition only by the absence of "acute". Despite defining flare, the authors of both guidelines did not provide guidance on the signs and symptoms which constitute flare, nor did they define "clinically meaningful", falling short of providing a clear measurable definition of flare for use in clinical trials.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) — skin tone–inclusive inflammation assessment and implications for care are described: The guideline states we define erythema to include transient skin alterations characteristic of active AD inflammation, including erythema, shades of brown, violaceous, or gray appearances. Postinflammatory dyspigmentation (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) may persist for months to years and be important to patients. Principles of AD care remain similar for all skin types, and the relevance of these findings to informing treatment selection is not clear and, so far, multiple agents display no differential treatment response across these groups.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) potency classification and safe-use considerations — TCS are classified in multiple ways, with 1 to 7 in the US system and 1 representing the most potent; the US system is best used in research but in clinical practice there are effectively 4 classes of potency of topical treatments, so both systems must be known to interpret and apply the literature. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin), and continuous and prolonged use of low-potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects.

### Practical algorithm to inform clinical decision-making in the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis [^64bcd8bb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder associated with skin barrier dysfunction, the prevalence of which has increased dramatically in developing countries. In this article, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with mild-to-moderate and severe atopic dermatitis flares in daily clinical practice. An international panel of 15 dermatology and allergy experts from eight countries was formed to develop a practical algorithm for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis, with a particular focus on topical therapies. In cases of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis involving sensitive skin areas, the topical calcineurin inhibitor pimecrolimus should be applied twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis. For other body locations, patients should apply a topical calcineurin inhibitor, either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis, such as pruritus, or twice weekly in previously affected skin areas. Emollients should be used regularly. Patients experiencing acute atopic dermatitis flares in sensitive skin areas should apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily or alternate once-daily topical corticosteroid/topical calcineurin inhibitor until symptoms improve. Following improvement, topical corticosteroid therapy should be discontinued and patients switched to a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Maintenance therapy should include the use of pimecrolimus once daily for sensitive areas and tacrolimus for other body locations. This treatment algorithm can help guide clinical decision-making in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) — dilute bleach baths: A linked systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found the probability to improve AD severity by 50% with adjunctive dilute bleach baths was 32% vs 22% in the control group, with little to no difference in adverse events, which were mainly mild dry skin and irritation. Given the relatively minor improvement, the panel suggests that dilute bleach baths may be beneficial in patients with moderate and severe AD, while some patients may lack access to a bathtub or find baths too burdensome, and in mild disease the limited magnitude of improvement was not felt to justify the burden.

- salt baths

- topical crude plant extracts

- Chinese herbs

- acupuncture or acupressure

- autologous blood therapy

- bioresonance

- massage therapy

- aroma therapy

Mycophenolate mofetil (mycophenolic acid) for moderate-severe atopic dermatitis — In patients with moderate-severe AD refractory, intolerant, or unable to use mid- to high-potency topical treatment and systemic treatment inclusive of a biologic recommended previously, the panel suggests against using mycophenolate (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Mycophenolate is contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used for patients intending to conceive, and patients who prefer a different adverse effect profile and its required monitoring, and who can wait a longer period of time for symptom relief, may prefer mycophenolate over other immunosuppressive agents; the availability and value placed by patients and caregivers on other safer systemic treatment alternatives may influence decision making.

This is an exciting time in the management of atopic dermatitis due to the development of several biologics, Janus Kinase inhibitors, and new topical therapies. Furthermore, evidence-based guidelines allow provision of individualized patient care. Management includes education on trigger avoidance, appropriate use of topicals to ensure efficacy and avoid side effects while attending to the psychosocial needs and priorities of the patient/caregivers. The synthesis of this information facilitates a balanced discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to allow for shared decision-making. Together these options provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. The current strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling and advice about daily life. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^96a97fdd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Gaps in research — priorities for topical atopic dermatitis (AD) therapies. There are significant gaps in our current understanding of various topical AD therapies, and studies are needed which examine quality of life and other patient-important outcomes, changes to the cutaneous microbiome, as well as long term follow-up, and use in special and diverse populations (eg, pregnancy, lactation, immunosuppression, multiple co-morbidities, skin of color, and pediatric). Studies of moisturizer use in AD vary widely in methods, duration, endpoints and active ingredients, making it difficult to draw conclusions, and compare or aggregate data from various studies; future studies should prioritize standardization of study methods and study endpoints, larger sample sizes, and sufficient follow-up times. Additionally, studies examining variations in bathing and additives such as sodium hypochlorite and magnesium chloride are needed, and further research is called for to augment WWT data in adults, addressing variability in topical therapy, use of antiseptic solution in the wraps, and composition of wrap material; increased use of new systemic AD treatment options in moderate-to-severe disease may also result in a selection bias toward milder disease in topical therapy studies.
