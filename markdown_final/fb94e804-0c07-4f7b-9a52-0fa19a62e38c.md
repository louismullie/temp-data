## Question

what makes atrial fibrillation valvular

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what makes atrial fibrillation "valvular" and how to classify it for anticoagulation decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical definition and why it existed. Then, I should verify the modern guideline stance and whether the term has been retired. Next, I will identify the two scenarios that still mandate warfarin rather than DOACs. After that, I should review which valve diseases are actually considered "non-valvular" for DOAC eligibility. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically usable definition and note any exceptions or timing nuances, especially around bioprosthetic valves and early post-procedure periods [^116WJdoc] [^111h6BFn].

> Let me first confirm the historical context. Traditionally, "valvular AF" meant AF occurring in the setting of rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, because these conditions carry uniquely high thromboembolic risk and were excluded from the pivotal DOAC trials, leaving warfarin as the standard of care in those subgroups [^115ew82W] [^1176E2p1].

> Wait, let me verify the current guideline position before I overgeneralize. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline explicitly recommends abandoning the "valvular" versus "non-valvular" terminology for etiologic classification, precisely because it is imprecise and can mislead clinicians about anticoagulant choices, even though the term persists in drug labels and trial lexicons [^116WJdoc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — terminology may have changed, but the two scenarios that still require warfarin over DOACs remain unchanged in practice. I need to ensure I name them correctly: moderate or greater mitral stenosis of any cause, and any mechanical prosthetic heart valve, because both confer very high thromboembolic risk and lack supportive DOAC evidence; in these cases, warfarin is recommended irrespective of CHA2DS2-VASc score [^111h6BFn] [^116jXM56] [^1127iB7y].

> Let me consider which valve diseases are actually eligible for DOACs, since this is where confusion often arises. Native valve disease other than rheumatic mitral stenosis — such as mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis or regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and degenerative or calcific valve disease — does not fall into the "must-use warfarin" category; in these patients, DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin based on CHA2DS2-VASc risk, with shared decision-making [^1147eqo8].

> I should double-check the bioprosthetic valve nuance, because timing matters. For bioprosthetic valves, DOACs are acceptable once beyond the early postoperative period, typically after 3 months, whereas in the first 3 months after surgical or transcatheter implantation, warfarin is reasonable if new-onset AF occurs; this timing-based approach reflects early thrombogenicity and limited early data for DOACs in this window [^1127iB7y] [^114CzYcY].

> Hmm, wait a minute — some clinicians still call mitral valve repair "valvular AF" and avoid DOACs, but I need to check whether that is accurate. North American guidance has historically grouped mitral valve repair with scenarios favoring VKA early after surgery, whereas European guidance does not consider repaired native valves as a contraindication to DOACs; practically, many patients with remote mitral valve repair are treated with DOACs once beyond the early postoperative period, aligning with the broader "non–rheumatic MS, non-mechanical" group [^114FVAN7] [^115kcF36].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable answer, even though the labels are outdated. In current practice, AF is functionally "valvular" for anticoagulant selection when there is moderate or greater mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, in which case warfarin is indicated; otherwise, AF with other valve diseases is treated as "non-valvular" for this purpose, and DOACs are generally preferred based on CHA2DS2-VASc, with attention to timing after bioprosthetic valve procedures and shared decision-making for repair scenarios [^111h6BFn] [^1147eqo8] [^1127iB7y].

> But wait, what if I am overgeneralizing about "all other valve disease" being okay for DOACs? I should confirm that the pivotal DOAC trials did include substantial proportions of patients with native valve disease such as mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis, and subgroup analyses did not show loss of efficacy, though some signals of higher extracranial bleeding with rivaroxaban in VHD have been observed; this supports the safety of DOACs in most native VHD, with agent selection tailored to bleeding risk and comorbidities [^114u9XWF] [^113DUepq].

> I need to ensure I close the loop on the terminology point. Even though the ACC/AHA now advises retiring "valvular" versus "non-valvular" for classification, the binary still operationally guides anticoagulant choice today because labels and evidence bases remain anchored to those exclusions; therefore, the practical, risk-based distinction above remains the most clinically coherent way to answer "what makes AF valvular" in the context of anticoagulation [^116WJdoc] [^111h6BFn].

Atrial fibrillation is considered "valvular" when it occurs in the presence of **mechanical heart valves** or **moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** (especially rheumatic) [^111h6BFn] [^116ER5ds]. These conditions carry a **high thromboembolic risk**, so warfarin is the only approved anticoagulant [^1127iB7y]; DOACs are contraindicated due to inadequate stroke prevention and increased valve thrombosis risk [^1127iB7y]. AF with other valve diseases (e.g. mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis/regurgitation, bioprosthetic valves) is "non-valvular" and managed with DOACs or warfarin based on CHA2DS2-VASc [^1147eqo8] [^112A8pFv].

---

## Historical definitions and evolution

Historically, AF was dichotomized as "valvular" or "non-valvular" based on the presence of specific valvular lesions [^114V63pS]. Initially, "valvular AF" referred to AF associated with **rheumatic mitral valve disease**, **prosthetic heart valves**, or **mitral valve repair** [^111PxcYM]. Over time, definitions evolved, and current guidelines have refined the criteria to address modern valve interventions and anticoagulant options [^113Gi2Wv].

---

## Current clinical criteria for valvular atrial fibrillation

According to the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guidelines, AF is considered "valvular" when it occurs in the presence of either of the following:

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Any mechanical prosthetic heart valve, regardless of position (aortic, mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary) [^116ER5ds].

- **Moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis**: Particularly rheumatic mitral stenosis, due to its high thromboembolic risk [^1149dkV9].

These criteria reflect the **unique pathophysiology and thromboembolic risk** associated with these valvular conditions, necessitating specific anticoagulation strategies [^116MCYhc].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation

Valvular heart disease, especially mitral stenosis and mechanical valves, predisposes to AF through several mechanisms:

- **Structural remodeling**: Chronic valve disease causes left atrial enlargement and fibrosis, creating a substrate for AF initiation and maintenance [^1153aEta].

- **Hemodynamic stress**: Valve stenosis or regurgitation increases atrial pressure and wall stress, promoting electrical instability and AF [^1153aEta].

- **Thromboembolism**: AF with valvular disease, particularly mitral stenosis, significantly increases the risk of left atrial thrombus formation and systemic embolization [^1149dkV9].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

The classification of AF as "valvular" has **significant clinical implications**, particularly regarding anticoagulation therapy:

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Patients with valvular AF (mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis) require lifelong anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) due to the high risk of thromboembolic events. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated in these patients due to inadequate stroke prevention and increased risk of valve thrombosis [^111h6BFn] [^116jXM56].

- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Warfarin therapy requires regular INR monitoring and dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation levels [^115xaGyN].

- **Surgical considerations**: In patients with valvular AF undergoing valve surgery, concomitant surgical ablation or left atrial appendage exclusion may be considered to reduce AF recurrence and thromboembolic risk [^113p9RB4] [^115YQdLg].

---

## Distinction from non-valvular atrial fibrillation

AF is considered "non-valvular" when it occurs in the absence of mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^116Bx42F]. Non-valvular AF includes AF associated with other valvular lesions, such as mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, or regurgitation, and bioprosthetic valves. In these patients, **DOACs are preferred** over warfarin for stroke prevention, guided by the CHA2DS2-VASc risk score [^1147eqo8] [^112A8pFv].

---

## Controversies and ongoing debates

Despite current guidelines, some controversies persist regarding the classification and management of valvular AF:

- **Bioprosthetic valves**: The optimal anticoagulation strategy for patients with bioprosthetic valves and AF remains debated, particularly in the early postoperative period [^1141ykm8].

- **Mild mitral stenosis**: The role of DOACs in patients with mild mitral stenosis or degenerative valve disease is still under investigation, with limited evidence supporting their use in these populations [^111x47Kt].

- **Terminology**: Some experts advocate abandoning the "valvular" versus "non-valvular" terminology altogether, proposing alternative classifications based on specific valvular lesions and anticoagulation requirements [^116WJdoc] [^1122LUU4].

## Valvular vs. non-valvular atrial fibrillation

| **Feature** | **Valvular af** | **Non-valvular af** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | AF with mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis | AF without mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis |
| Anticoagulation | Warfarin (INR-guided) | DOACs or warfarin (CHA2DS2-VASc-guided) |
| Examples | - Mechanical valves <br/> - Moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis | - Mitral regurgitation <br/> - Aortic stenosis/regurgitation <br/> - Bioprosthetic valves |
| Thromboembolic risk | High | Variable (CHA2DS2-VASc-guided) |

---

Atrial fibrillation is considered "valvular" when it occurs with mechanical heart valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, conditions with high thromboembolic risk that require warfarin anticoagulation [^111h6BFn]. This classification guides anticoagulation choice and stroke-prevention strategies, distinguishing these cases from non-valvular AF, in which DOACs are typically preferred [^1147eqo8].

In patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation and symptom onset within 48 hours, rhythm control is preferred over rate control if the patient is younger than 65 years. For patients with congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, hypertension, or permanent atrial fibrillation, rate control remains the favored strategy.

### Does asymptomatic atrial fibrillation exist? [^1178gB4p]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is currently defined as symptomatic by asking patients if they are aware of when they are in AF and if they feel better in sinus rhythm. However, this approach of defining AF as symptomatic and asymptomatic fails to adequately consider the adverse effects of AF in patients who are unaware of their rhythm including progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF, and the development of dementia, stroke, sinus node dysfunction, valvular regurgitation, ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. Labeling these patients as asymptomatic falsely suggests that their AF requires less intense therapy and puts into question the notion of truly asymptomatic AF. Because focusing on patient awareness ignores other important consequences of AF, clinical endpoints that are independent of symptoms are being developed. The concept of AF burden has more recently been used as a clinical endpoint in clinical trials as a more clinically relevant endpoint compared to AF-related symptoms or time to first recurrence, but its correlation with symptoms and other clinical outcomes remains unclear. This review will explore the impact of AF on apparently asymptomatic patients, the use of AF burden as an endpoint for AF management, and potential refinements to the AF burden metric. The review is based on a presentation by the senior author during the 2023 16th annual European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (ECAS) congress in Paris, France.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — Intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) provides the following directives: In patients with VHD and AF for whom surgical intervention is planned, the potential symptomatic benefits and additional procedural risks of adjunctive arrhythmia surgery at the time of cardiac valvular surgery should be discussed with the patient. For symptomatic patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF who are undergoing valvular surgery, surgical pulmonary vein isolation or a maze procedure can be beneficial to reduce symptoms and prevent recurrent arrhythmias. For patients with AF or atrial flutter who are undergoing valve surgery, left atrial (LA) appendage ligation/excision is reasonable to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. In patients undergoing LA surgical ablation of atrial arrhythmias and/or LA appendage ligation/excision, anticoagulation therapy is reasonable for at least 3 months after the procedure. For patients without atrial arrhythmias who are undergoing valvular surgery, LA appendage occlusion/exclusion/amputation is potentially harmful.

### Defining nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a quest for clarification [^1176E2p1]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation since the publication of the 4 major pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors. The definition of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is unclear, varying from one trial to another and even between North American and European guidelines, which is a source of uncertainties in clinical practice. However, many patients with atrial fibrillation present signs of valvular involvement, and clarification of this term is needed to not deny NOACs to patients based on the wrong perception that they may have valvular atrial fibrillation. The currently unique contraindications to NOACs are patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, as stated by the recent 2015 position paper of the European Heart Rhythm Association. Patients with native heart valve involvement, regardless of their severity, are suitable for NOAC therapy. Patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and mitral valve repair may be suitable for NOACs except for the first 3 and the first 3–6 months postoperatively, respectively. Patients with transaortic valve implantation or percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty are also considered as being eligible for NOACs, although the bleeding risk has to be carefully considered in this population often requiring a combination with antiplatelet therapy. Future studies are warranted to increase the level of evidence of use of NOACs, particularly in patients with transaortic valve implantation and valvular surgery, and to determine whether they could be used in the future in the only 2 remaining contraindications.

Atrial fibrillation in valvular heart disease (VHD) — anticoagulation recommendations are as follows. In patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mitral stenosis of moderate or greater severity and history of atrial fibrillation, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended over DOACs, independent of the CHA2DS2-VASc score to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death (1 B-R). In patients with atrial fibrillation and valve disease other than moderate or greater mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, DOACs are recommended over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (1 B-NR).

### Detailed causality between the valvular calcification and recurrent atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation [^113CbhDP]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1

The relationship between cardiac calcification and cardiovascular events is well‐established, although the clinical impact of valvular calcification on arrhythmia incidence remains unclear. In their study, Liu et al. demonstrated that valvular calcification independently increased the risk of recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation following radiofrequency catheter ablation. However, several points warrant further exploration.

While the correlation between mitral valve calcification and left atrial remodeling, elevated left atrial pressure, and atrial fibrillation development seems plausible, it remains uncertain why other forms of valvular calcification were similarly linked to atrial fibrillation recurrence. Additionally, the authors could shed light on why calcification of the pulmonary valve did not exhibit an association with recurrent atrial fibrillation.

The exclusion of individuals with rheumatic heart disease raises methodological questions. Further elaboration on the methodology for their exclusion would be beneficial, particularly considering the challenges in distinguishing rheumatic valvular disease from other forms of valvular pathologies. Notably, rheumatic fever can give rise not only to mitral stenosis but also to mitral regurgitation.

In the study, the authors dichotomized the presence of valvular calcification. While acknowledging that computed tomography stands as the gold standard for quantifying cardiac calcification, it would be advantageous if the authors quantified the degree of valvular calcification, treating them as continuous variables. Otherwise, assuming approximately 90% of the participants had no valvular calcification could raise concerns regarding the accuracy of their conclusions.

Addressing the practical implications of their findings is pivotal. It would be valuable for the authors to propose potential therapeutic or prophylactic strategies for individuals with valvular calcification. For instance, should additional linear ablations be considered alongside conventional pulmonary vein isolation?

Valvular heart disease (VHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) — risk and management options: VHD and AF commonly coexist, and "AF independently predicts the risk of cerebrovascular events among patients with valve disease". This risk "may be addressed with the use of oral anticoagulation, percutaneous and surgical LAAO, and surgical ablation as described in Sections 6.5.1 ("Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA"), 6.5.2 ("Cardiac Surgery — LAA Exclusion/Excision"), and 6.8.5 ("AF in VHD")".

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^1151roRM]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate versus rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate-limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^113ikTaU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the evolving definition of NVAF as described by current guidelines and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the DOAC pivotal trials in terms of native valve lesions. The thromboembolic risk and recommended treatment options in AF in the presence of different types of valvular heart lesions are discussed, followed by an assessment of the accumulated evidence for the efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients with AF and concomitant valvular heart lesions.

### Critique on "Evaluation of the presence of native valvular disease in patients with atrial fibrillation using the EHRA (evaluated heartvalves, rheumatic, or artificial) classification" [^112GFsrL]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should (a) record the kind and severity of echocardiographic lesions, (b) conduct lesion‐specific outcome analyses, (c) compare anticoagulants using propensity/causal approaches, and (d) take time‐updated risk ratings into account. These actions, if verified, would assist in improving anticoagulation thresholds for patients who are currently close to recommended cutoffs, as also emphasized in the 2020 ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation management. In summary, Escolar Conesa et al. offer a crucial indication that "non‐valvular" AF is diverse: native valvular involvement can identify a minority at increased risk for thrombosis and hemorrhage, necessitating more careful examination and specialized treatment. This interplay between AF and valvular heart disease, and its implications for anticoagulation, has been highlighted in recent reviews. To inform clinical treatment, the work should stimulate prospective, lesion‐stratified research.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation associated with valvular heart disease: a joint consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis, endorsed by the ESC working group on valvular heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia society of Southern Africa (CASSA), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), South African heart (SA heart) association and sociedad latinoamericana de estimulación cardíaca y electrofisiología (SOLEACE) [^115jvmx9].

Scientific rationale of consensus recommendation symbols — action strength definitions are as follows: Recommended/indicated is supported when there is "Scientific evidence that a treatment or procedure is beneficial and effective. Requires at least one randomized trial, or is supported by strong observational evidence and authors' consensus", and is described elsewhere as a "recommended/indicated treatment (or procedure)". "May be used or recommended" corresponds to "General agreement and/or scientific evidence favour the usefulness/efficacy of a treatment or procedure. May be supported by randomized trials based on small number of patients or not widely applicable", and "Should NOT be used or recommended" reflects "Scientific evidence or general agreement not to use or recommend a treatment or procedure". This categorization "should not be considered as being directly similar to that used for official society guideline recommendations which apply a classification (I–III) and level of evidence (A, B, and C) to recommendations".

Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk — valvular heart disease (VHD): Significant heart murmur is associated with increased AF risk with HR 2.38; any diastolic or grade ≥ 3/6 systolic murmur shows increased risk with population-attributable fraction 21.9% that decreased over time to 3.1%. Mendelian randomization links genetically predicted AF risk with VHD, including rheumatic fever (OR 1.26) and nonrheumatic VHD (OR 1.27).

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 1–5) state that disease stages in patients with valvular heart disease "should be classified (Stages A, B, C, and D) on the basis of symptoms, valve anatomy, the severity of valve dysfunction, and the response of the ventricle and pulmonary circulation". In evaluation, history and physical examination findings "should be correlated with the results of noninvasive testing (ie, ECG, chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram)", and if discordance exists, clinicians should "consider further noninvasive (computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, stress testing) or invasive (transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization) testing to determine optimal treatment strategy". For patients with valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (except those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis), the anticoagulation decision "with either a vitamin K antagonist or a non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, should be made in a shared decision-making process based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score", and those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis and atrial fibrillation "should receive oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist". Patients with severe valvular heart disease being considered for valve intervention "should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, with either referral to or consultation with a Primary or Comprehensive Valve Center". For severe aortic stenosis, treatment "with either a transcatheter or surgical valve prosthesis should be based primarily on symptoms or reduced ventricular systolic function", and "earlier intervention may be considered if indicated by results of exercise testing, biomarkers, rapid progression, or the presence of very severe stenosis".

Cardiology Clinical Practice Guideline Level of Evidence and Class of Recommendations Definitions

It is important to understand how the guidelines evolve in order to keep pace with advances in clinical practice. An important, previous study demonstrated that only a median of 11% of ACC/AHA recommendations before 2009 were based on LOE A and nearly half relied on LOE C. 5 Additionally, this same article determined that only 19% of recommendations were of class I with LOE A. However, little is known about how the guidelines have evolved over the past decade. There was only 1 study looking at the change in guidelines over the past decade, but this previous study only focused on atrial fibrillation. 8

Our study examined all cardiology topic areas of ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines published in the past decade, stratified by 6 topic areas ([1] arrhythmias; [2] prevention; [3] acute and stable ischemia; [4] heart failure; [5] valvular heart disease; and [6] vascular medicine) to assess changes in the number of recommendations as well as the distribution of recommendations across LOE and COR over time (Table 2). 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in valvular heart disease (VHD) — class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE): "1 A For patients with AF and native valve heart disease (except rheumatic mitral stenosis [MS]) or who received a bioprosthetic valve > 3 months ago, a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is an effective alternative to VKA anticoagulation and should be administered on the basis of the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score". "1 C-EO For patients with AF and rheumatic MS, long-term VKA oral anticoagulation is recommended". "2a B-NR For patients with new-onset AF ≤ 3 months after surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, anticoagulation with a VKA is reasonable". "3: Harm B-R In patients with mechanical heart valves with or without AF who require long-term anticoagulation with VKA to prevent valve thrombosis, NOACs are not recommended".

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^114DbC5X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Decisions regarding the use of VKAs versus DOACs can be challenging in patients with AF and concomitant VHD. Currently, there are few data on the efficacy and safety of DOACs in VHD, and there is little direct evidence to support treatment recommendations in clinical practice. Efforts should be made to improve understanding of the benefits and risks of DOAC treatment in patients with AF and concomitant VHD. Specific and widely acceptable definitions of valvular AF and NVAF are needed to guide clinical practice and the design of future trials. Further controlled studies and analyses of results from trial participants identified as having had VHD would be informative to help clearly identify appropriate candidates for treatment with DOACs. As patients with AF and VHD are known to be at a higher risk of thromboembolism than those without, the future challenge will be to translate the findings of the DOAC trials into clinical practice.

Valvular heart disease — NOAC use and bridging considerations with bioprosthetic valves — Although phase III trials comparing non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with warfarin excluded patients with moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, some included other valvular heart disease and bioprosthetic valve replacement or repair; many patients late after bioprosthetic valve replacement or native valve repair are treated safely with direct oral anticoagulants, and bridging decisions in these individuals can follow the same strategy as for atrial fibrillation without moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis.

### Is anticoagulating haemodialysis patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation too risky? [^111mcn4x]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

There is an increasing understanding of the risks from atrial fibrillation (AF) in the current era. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, the prevalence of AF is significantly higher compared to the general population and those with earlier stages of CKD. Although anticoagulation of these patients may seem appropriate, there is a lack of conclusive evidence that it provides the same protection from thromboembolic complications as it does in patients not on dialysis. In addition, the increased risk of bleeding in patients requiring dialysis makes the use of anticoagulants less favourable. This article aims to discuss the problem of AF in dialysis patients, summarise the current evidence around the use of oral anticoagulants for AF in ESRD and provide some practical suggestions on management of AF in the haemodialysis population.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115e7VGM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A meta‐analysis comprising the overall patient population of 4 large clinical trials showed that NOACs, compared with warfarin, further decreased the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, death, and intracranial hemorrhage in nonvalvular AF patients. 19 Although experts may well understand that the term nonvalvular actually denotes that these trial patients do not have significant mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart valves, others may be hesitant to apply NOACs to AF patients with other types of VHD. The current study makes it clear that NOACs have similar benefits in terms of reducing stroke or systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients both with and without VHD.

No dedicated clinical trial to date has compared NOACs with warfarin in AF patients with moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis, and so warfarin use in these patients is suggested. 4 The use of a NOAC, dabigatran, in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin and thus is not justified for these patients. 20

This study has limitations. First, a meta‐analysis is a retrospective approach, and subgroup analysis in patients with and without VHD was not prespecified in the original clinical trials. Second, AF patients with and without VHD had different baseline characteristics, as did patients enrolled in the 4 trials. Substantial bias might remain despite statistical adjustment. Third, the RE‐LY and ENGAGE AF trials used both higher and lower dose NOACs as active treatment agents, and their comparisons with warfarin were reported separately. Because this was a study‐level meta‐analysis, we were unable to combine groups of NOAC in a trial to create a single pairwise comparison. Consequently, only data from the higher dose NOACs versus warfarin were used in this meta‐analysis.

In conclusion, this meta‐analysis showed that AF patients with native VHD had a higher risk of all‐cause mortality and major bleeding. NOACs, compared with warfarin, reduced stroke or systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients with or without VHD. Although evidence supported increased extracranial bleeding risk among VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin, there was no increase in mortality risk. Our results further establish that for AF patients with native VHD, NOACs are an attractive alternative to warfarin for stroke preventive therapy.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation but underlying native mitral and aortic valve disease participating in the ROCKET AF trial [^116SwWPC]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Is non-valvular atrial fibrillation a misnomer?

The generally accepted term 'non-valvular AF' is misleading since the ROCKET AF trial, as well as other trials (Table 1), has allowed the inclusion of patients who, although not having mitral stenosis or artificial heart valves or valve repair, could have other types of valvular heart disease. In ROCKET AF, these valvular lesions were considered by the recruiting investigator and his or her team as significant. As long as there is no agreed-upon new term, 'non-valvular AF' will continued to be used, but one should always stress that this does not exclude patients with other types of valvular heart disease from therapy with novel anticoagulants like rivaroxaban.

Limitations

The protocol did not include precise quantification of valve disease. However, the term 'significant' valvular lesion implied that the physician did not consider it as less than moderate. On the other hand, it could also not be of such haemodynamic significance that cardiac surgery would be necessary in the foreseeable future since this was an exclusion criterion. Thus, the majority of patient can be suspected to have had moderate valve disease.

Some baseline characteristics of patients with SVD differed significantly from those of patients without SVD. Thus, despite statistical adjustments, substantial bias might remain, and, therefore, results should be regarded as hypothesis generating. Finally, the number of events in the group of patients with SVD, especially intracranial bleeding, was particularly low, which may indicate that these differences may have occurred by chance.

Introduction

There is a paucity of data on the risk of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or non–central nervous system (CNS) arterial embolism in a contemporary cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and all forms of valvular heart disease (VHD). Historical data have shown, in small cohorts of individuals with mechanical valves (MVs) and rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), worse outcomes in patients with these valve disorders in the setting of AF. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Recent clinical trials of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with AF have varied in their definition of VHD and, consequently, inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment. 6, 7, 8, 9 DOAC trials largely excluded individuals with hemodynamically significant valve disease, moderate or severe MS, or MVs and had few patients with bioprosthetic valves, prior surgical repair, or balloon valvuloplasty on the basis of the perception of a higher risk for stroke in the setting of AF.

The objectives of this analysis were as follows: (1) to assess the prevalence of VHD in a contemporary community‐based population with AF, (2) to describe clinical characteristics among those with significant VHD, (3) to determine oral anticoagulation use and time in therapeutic range (TTR) among VHD categories, and (4) to evaluate thromboembolic events, major bleeding events, and mortality across a spectrum of VHD categories.

### EHRA practical guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary [^114838d5]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Both physicians and patients will have to learn how to use these drugs effectively and safely in specific clinical situations. This text is an executive summary of a practical guide that the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) has assembled to help physicians in the use of the different NOACs. The full text is being published in EP Europace. Practical answers have been formulated for 15 concrete clinical scenarios: (i) practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (ii) how to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (iii) drug-drug interactions and pharmacokinetics of NOACs; (iv) switching between anticoagulant regimens; (v) ensuring compliance of NOAC intake; (vi) how to deal with dosing errors; (vii) patients with chronic kidney disease; (viii) what to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a risk of bleeding?; (ix) management of bleeding complications; (x) patients undergoing a planned surgical intervention or ablation; (xi) patients undergoing an urgent surgical intervention; (xii) patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (xiii) cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (xiv) patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (xv) NOACs vs. VKAs in AF patients with a malignancy. Since new information is becoming available at a rapid pace, an EHRA web site with the latest updated information accompanies the guide (www.NOACforAF.eu). It also contains links to the ESC AF Guidelines, a key message pocket booklet, print-ready files for a proposed universal NOAC anticoagulation card, and feedback possibilities.

Introduction

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 4‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared with patients with sinus rhythm, 1, 2, 3 and the risk of stroke is up to 17‐fold higher in AF patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. 1 Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, including warfarin, is indicated for AF patients with mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, 4 and these 2 types of valvular heart disease (VHD) were generally excluded from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus warfarin in nonvalvular AF patients. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, the aforementioned trials actually enrolled patients with other native valve pathologies, 5, 6, 7, 8 rendering the term nonvalvular AF a misnomer. The term nonvalvular heart disease, used in the original NOAC trials, may cause some clinicians to hesitate before prescribing NOACs to AF patients with any form of VHD.

Several post hoc analyses evaluating the effect of NOACs in comparison with warfarin in AF patients with VHD have been published. 9, 10, 11 A review of NOACs in AF patients with VHD, based on the aforementioned publications, suggested that little direct evidence exists to support treatment recommendations in clinical practice 12; however, relevant data 13 from the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation‐Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial were not included. The objective of this study was to systematically review the totality of the published literature to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the overall efficacy and safety profiles (ie, stroke or systemic embolism, all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage) of NOACs, compared with warfarin, in AF patients with and without VHD.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in valvular heart disease (VHD) — For patients with AF and native valve heart disease (except rheumatic mitral stenosis [MS]) or who received a bioprosthetic valve > 3 months ago, a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is an effective alternative to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation and should be administered on the basis of the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 A). For patients with AF and rheumatic MS, long-term VKA oral anticoagulation is recommended (1 C-EO). For patients with new-onset AF ≤ 3 months after surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, anticoagulation with a VKA is reasonable (2a B-NR). In patients with mechanical heart valves with or without AF who require long-term anticoagulation with VKA to prevent valve thrombosis, NOACs are not recommended (3: Harm B-R).

Mechanical heart valves and mitral stenosis — NOAC use guidance specifies that the use of the NOACs in patients with AF and mechanical valve prosthesis is contraindicated. Randomized clinical trials testing the efficacy and safety of direct oral FXa inhibitors in patients with AF and mechanical heart valve prosthesis are lacking, and until more data are available, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are contraindicated in such patients. Until more data are available, AF patients with any degree of rheumatic mitral valve stenosis and those with moderate-to-severe non-rheumatic mitral stenosis should not be treated with NOACs. The efficacy and safety of NOACs for stroke/SE prevention may be similar in AF patients with and without conservative valve surgery or bioprosthetic valves based on small numbers of patients in post hoc analyses of RCTs.

Background

The presence of valvular heart disease may affect the risk of stroke and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation. Community‐based estimates of prevalence and outcomes of specific forms ofin patients withare lacking.

Methods and Results

We examined the prevalence of, anticoagulation use, mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and bleeding among a community cohort of patients with. Significantwas defined as follows: (1) moderate/severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve; (2) bioprosthetic valve, surgical repair, or balloon valvuloplasty; and (3) moderate/severe aortic regurgitation or stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or tricuspid regurgitation. Proportional hazards models were performed to test the association betweengroups and outcomes. Among 9748 patients with, 2705 (27.7%) had significant. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with mitral stenosis/mechanical valve (91.8%). Compared with individuals with no significant, individuals with aortic regurgitation/aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or tricuspid regurgitation (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.42) had the highest risk of death. There were no differences in stroke or transient ischemic attack and major bleeding among individuals with and without significant. Patients withand aortic stenosis had the highest risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.62).

Conclusions

Significantis common among patients within community practice. In a community cohort of patients withand 2 2 ‐c score ≥ 2, most were anticoagulated. Individuals withand moderate‐to‐severe biologicalhave more comorbidities and a higher mortality risk; however, stroke and major bleeding are similar among those with and without significant.

In 2013, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published a Practical Guide on the use of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, European Heart Rhythm A. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

EHRA practical guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary. Eur Heart J 2013;34:2094–2106). The document received widespread interest, not only from cardiologists but also from neurologists, geriatricians, and general practitioners, as became evident from the distribution of > 350 000 copies of its pocket version (the EHRA Key Message Booklet) world-wide. Since 2013, numerous new studies have appeared on different aspects of NOAC therapy in AF patients. Therefore, EHRA updated the Practical Guide, including new information but also providing balanced guiding in the many areas where prospective data are still lacking. The outline of the original guide that addressed 15 clinical scenarios has been preserved, but all chapters have been rewritten. Main changes in the Update comprise a discussion on the definition of 'non-valvular AF' and eligibility for NOAC therapy, inclusion of finalized information on the recently approved edoxaban, tailored dosing information dependent on concomitant drugs, and/or clinical characteristics, an expanded chapter on neurologic scenarios (ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage under NOAC), an updated anticoagulation card and more specifics on start-up and follow-up issues. There are also many new flow charts, like on appropriate switching between anticoagulants (VKA to NOAC or vice versa), default scenarios for acute management of coronary interventions, step-down schemes for long-term combined antiplatelet-anticoagulant management in coronary heart disease, management of bleeding, and cardioversion under NOAC therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^112Ljm8a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.
- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

Atrial fibrillation with associated heart disease — specific cardiovascular conditions associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) include valvular heart disease (most often, mitral valve disease), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension, particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present; AF may also be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease (especially atrial septal defect in adults), with additional potential etiologies such as restrictive cardiomyopathies (including amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and endomyocardial fibrosis), cardiac tumors, and constrictive pericarditis; other heart diseases include mitral valve prolapse with or without mitral regurgitation, calcification of the mitral annulus, and idiopathic dilation of the right atrium (RA), and AF is commonly encountered in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.

Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease complicated singly or in combination by the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), previous systemic embolism, or left atrial thrombus, we recommend vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease and normal sinus rhythm, without left atrial enlargement, we do not suggest antithrombotic therapy unless a separate indication exists (Grade 2C). For patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), not complicated by AF, who have not had systemic embolism, unexplained transient ischemic attacks, or ischemic stroke, we recommend against antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1C). In patients with mitral annular calcification complicated by systemic embolism or ischemic stroke, we recommend antiplatelet agent (APA) therapy (Grade 1B). For patients with isolated calcific aortic valve disease, we suggest against antithrombotic therapy (Grade 2C). But, for those with aortic valve disease who have experienced ischemic stroke, we suggest APA therapy (Grade 2C). For patients with stroke associated with aortic atherosclerotic lesions, we recommend low-dose aspirin (ASA) therapy (Grade 1C). For patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and a patent foramen ovale (PFO), we recommend APA therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with mechanical heart valves, we recommend VKA therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with mechanical heart valves and history of vascular disease or who have additional risk factors for thromboembolism, we recommend the addition of low-dose aspirin ASA to VKA therapy (Grade 1B). We suggest ASA not be added to long-term VKA therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves who are at particularly high risk of bleeding (Grade 2C). For patients with bioprosthetic heart valves, we recommend ASA (Grade 1B). For patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and additional risk factors for thromboembolism, we recommend VKA therapy (Grade 1C). For patients with infective endocarditis, we recommend against antithrombotic therapy, unless a separate indication exists (Grade 1B).

Treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been undergoing significant changes recently. This is due partly to different mechanisms proposed for persistent and permanent AF and partly due to the introduction of energy-based techniques, providing less invasive procedures. This article aims to review the mechanisms of AF leading to the changes in clinical practice and to review the results of surgery, energy-based, and percutaneous techniques. It is difficult to compare and contrast the results of reported series in the literature due to different definitions of AF; freedom from and recurrence of it. Furthermore, in most series it is difficult to distinguish results of surgery for lone AF and AF associated with valvular heart disease and coronary artery disease.

### Analysis of the ESC / EACTS 2020 atrial fibrillation guidelines with perioperative implications [^111Aq1Qi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia worldwide, with an individual lifetime risk of approximately 37% in the United States. Broadly defined as a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with disorganized atrial activation, AF results in an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, valvular heart disease, and impaired quality of life, and confers a significant burden on the health of individuals and society. AF in the perioperative setting is common and a significant source of perioperative morbidity and mortality worldwide. The latest iteration of the European Society of Cardiology AF guidelines published in 2020 provide the clinician a valuable road map for the management of this arrythmia. This expert review will comprehensively analyze the 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines and provide perioperative management tools for the clinician.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of valvular heart disease in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the ORBIT-AF (outcomes registry for better informed treatment for atrial fibrillation) [^117KWZSF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of valvular heart disease (VHD) may affect the risk of stroke and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Community-based estimates of prevalence and outcomes of specific forms of VHD in patients with AF are lacking.

Methods and Results

We examined the prevalence of VHD, anticoagulation use, mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and bleeding among a community cohort of patients with AF. Significant VHD was defined as follows: (1) moderate/severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve; (2) bioprosthetic valve, surgical repair, or balloon valvuloplasty; and (3) moderate/severe aortic regurgitation or stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or tricuspid regurgitation. Proportional hazards models were performed to test the association between VHD groups and outcomes. Among 9748 patients with AF, 2705 (27.7%) had significant VHD. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with mitral stenosis/mechanical valve (91.8%). Compared with individuals with no significant VHD, individuals with aortic regurgitation/aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or tricuspid regurgitation (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.42) had the highest risk of death. There were no differences in stroke or transient ischemic attack and major bleeding among individuals with and without significant VHD. Patients with AF and aortic stenosis had the highest risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.62).

Conclusions

Significant VHD is common among patients with AF in community practice. In a community cohort of patients with AF and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2, most were anticoagulated. Individuals with AF and moderate-to-severe biological VHD have more comorbidities and a higher mortality risk; however, stroke and major bleeding are similar among those with and without significant VHD.

Evaluated Heartvalves, Rheumatic or Artificial (EHRA) functional categorization — This document proposes that the term 'valvular AF' is outdated and introduces a functional EHRA scheme for atrial fibrillation (AF) with valvular heart disease (VHD) in relation to oral anticoagulation (OAC) use. EHRA Type 1 refers to AF patients with VHD needing therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and includes mitral stenosis (moderate-severe, of rheumatic origin) and mechanical prosthetic valve replacement. EHRA Type 2 refers to AF patients with VHD needing therapy with a VKA or a NOAC (non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant), also taking into consideration CHA2DS2VASc score risk factor components, and includes mitral regurgitation, mitral valve repair, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonic stenosis, bioprosthetic valve replacements, and trans-aortic valve intervention (TAVI).

### Mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation [^114kLMF6]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

This paper is of great value as it refocuses attention to valvular atrial fibrillation, MS and their associated risks. Additionally, it indicates that the incidence of MS is higher outside of Europe, with a recent Swedish register study reporting an incidence rate of about 2 per 100 000 persons between 2003 and 2010. Kim et al now raise the interesting question of whether anticoagulant treatment in patients with MS should be revised, for example, introducing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as primary anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists. This statement is based on the finding of the plateauing risk of stroke and thrombotic events, as well as the increasing incidence of intracerebral bleeding. Ultimately, the available evidence does not provide an answer to this question, as patients with MS were excluded from the respective NOAC trials. However, the observed high associated risk in this population and the higher incidence in non-Western countries underline the need for randomised controlled trials of anticoagulant therapy in patients with MS.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111E5b6k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta‐analysis of 4 RCTs comparing NOACs and warfarin in > 70 000 AF patients, we found that one‐fifth of patients with "nonvalvular" AF had moderate or severe VHD. AF patients with VHD were at modestly higher risk of all‐cause mortality and major bleeding than those without VHD. Importantly, the benefits of NOACs in comparison with warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism were consistent in AF patients with or without VHD.

Prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with AF cannot be overemphasized. Traditionally, the vitamin K antagonists, notably warfarin, have been the cornerstone for stroke prevention in patients with AF 17; however, warfarin has a narrow window of therapeutic benefit, marked variation in its effect in different patients, a need for a long‐term coagulation monitor, and increased risks of major bleeding, especially devastating intracranial hemorrhage. 18 Although the original individual NOAC trials were designed as noninferiority trials and not superiority, this meta‐analysis of the pooled trials shows the NOACs, in aggregate, to be superior to warfarin for patients both with and without VHD. We observed substantial heterogeneity in major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage end points among AF patients with VHD for which dabigatran, edoxaban, and apixaban reduced major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage versus warfarin, whereas rivaroxaban appeared to increase major bleeding and did not reduce intracranial hemorrhage. Although rivaroxaban significantly reduced intracranial hemorrhage overall in the ROCKET trial, this effect was not seen in patients with VHD. 16 Still, there was no increase in mortality risk in VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin. We noted that several recent observational analyses of real‐world outcomes with NOACs have been reported recently. Those results have been mixed regarding extracranial bleeding risk with rivaroxaban.

Native valve diseases — In atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease (VHD), the main phase III studies of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) used variable exclusion criteria; some trials (ROCKET-AF and ARISTOTLE) only excluded mechanical valve prostheses and significant (moderate to severe) mitral stenosis, sub-analyses found no differences in efficacy between patients with and without VHD, while in ROCKET-AF there was more bleeding on rivaroxaban than on vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in patients with VHD; an observational Loire Valley Atrial Fibrillation Project analysis compared patients with and without valve disease and, although VHD showed higher univariable stroke/thromboembolism risk, after adjustment the difference was no longer significant with older age and higher CHA2DS2-VASc, and the text notes that post hoc analyses are hypothesis generating and that large randomized controlled trials are needed to define the role of NOACs in AS, non-rheumatic AR and MR.

1 Introduction

At least one‐third of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have some degree of valvular involvement. Like AF, valvular heart disease (VHD) increases with aging and degeneration of cardiac tissues. This degeneration or calcification is accelerated by several risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, which are related with both entities.

Long‐term follow‐up data from the original Framingham cohort identified VHD as an independent risk factor for AF development. Both entities perpetuate each other due to the overload of volume and pressure, which causes dilation and remodeling of the cardiac chambers, a mechanism that favors arrhythmia. For example, aortic stenosis increases the systolic pressure of the left ventricle (LV), subsequently, the LV hypertrophies, causing an increase in pressure in the left atrium (LA). Subsequent LA dilates and remodeling. Furthermore, VHD and AF appear to be independent causes of morbidity and mortality when they are related to each other.

AF has traditionally been classified as "valvular" and "non‐valvular". The former referred to patients with AF and moderate or severe mitral stenosis of rheumatic origin and/or mechanical valve prosthesis. The latter involves the rest of non‐rheumatic valve affection, or the absence of these. Nevertheless, there is major heterogeneity in the definition of valvular and non‐valvular AF. Some physicians assume that any valve disease should be considered as "valvular" AF. Clinical practice guidelines and clinical trials consider only mechanical valve prosthesis and rheumatic mitral stenosis are considered as "valvular" AF. However, its differentiation in terms of thromboembolism risk has not been investigated in detail and the definition of valvular AF remains controversial.

An appropriate definition of "valvular AF" is mandatory to identify a subgroup of patients with similar pathophysiology of thrombo‐embolism (TE) risk, and treatment strategies; however, this would be challenging given the major heterogeneity of the condition.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation but underlying native mitral and aortic valve disease participating in the ROCKET AF trial [^113CTJS6]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Large, multicentre randomized trials – have recently established the efficacy and safety of novel direct-acting oral anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular AF. In these trials, non-valvular AF was defined as the absence of (rheumatic) mitral stenosis and prosthetic heart valves (Table 1), but haemodynamically relevant valve disease was also generally excluded. However, uncertainty and even confusion exists among physicians as to whether patients with other types of SVD and AF paradoxically fall under the category of non-valvular AF and may be treated by novel anticoagulants. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in ROCKET AF, a large fraction of included patients had SVD.

Definition of non-valvular atrial fibrillation

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology 2006 guidelines stated that 'The term "non-valvular AF" is restricted to cases in which the rhythm disturbance occurs in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease, a prosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair'. imilarly, the recent update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines continue to divide AF into 'valvular' or 'non-valvular' categories. 'Valvular AF' was used to imply that AF is related to rheumatic valvular disease (predominantly mitral stenosis) or prosthetic heart valves. The pinpointing of rheumatic mitral stenosis and prosthetic heart valves as separate entities is based on the generally accepted higher risk of thromboembolic stroke in these patients.

### Direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease without mechanical valves [^116K6P2y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2021 Task Force for the Management of VHD of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery recommended the use of DOACs over warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with aortic stenosis, aortic and mitral regurgitation, or aortic bioprostheses. The 2024 updated guidelines stated that warfarin remains the first‐line therapy in patients with AF and moderate–severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves. Patients with VHD were excluded from most trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOACs. However, the approval trials had a small number of patients with aortic stenosis or regurgitation or mitral regurgitation. It is worth noting the variations in the use of VHD definitions among patients with AF across trials and observational studies. Some clinical guidelines eliminated the term valvular AF in their most updated versions. The 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AF developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery recommended that the terms valvular/nonvalvular AF should be abandoned.

Our research offers valuable insights into the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with AF and VHD, which can serve as a foundation for future investigations in this population. Firstly, based on the lower bleeding rate, edoxaban may be a safer alternative to warfarin. However, there is limited real‐world evidence of its effectiveness in patients with AF and VHD. Secondly, further research is needed to understand the impact of concurrent use of antiplatelet therapy on the bleeding outcomes associated with DOAC use. Lastly, our findings indicate that the rate of bleeding‐related hospitalization is higher in patients over 65 years old, especially in those who use DOACs. However, more data are necessary to confirm whether this rate varies among individual DOACs. Addressing these critical knowledge gaps can assist health care providers in tailoring treatment approaches and care to individual patients.

Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in atrial fibrillation — Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology give a class IIb recommendation for LAAO in AF patients with high stroke risk and contraindications to long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC). Antithrombotic therapy following LAAO has not been well evaluated, and it is not even known whether OAC or antiplatelet therapy or no therapy is preferable; when possible after LAAO, most centres use a 6-week period of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (target INR 2.5) followed by once daily clopidogrel (75 mg).

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes with rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation but underlying native mitral and aortic valve disease participating in the ROCKET AF trial [^114TPQ2x]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the ROCKET AF trial, every seventh patient had SVD. This proportion is probably a low estimate of the prevalence of SVD in clinical practice. – Importantly, AF patients with SVD experienced the same stroke-prevention benefit from oral anticoagulants as did AF patients without SVD. The quantitative interaction in bleeding rates that were higher with rivaroxaban than with warfarin in patients with SVD requires special attention and careful use of rivaroxaban in these patients. Therefore, SVD patients, except for those with haemodynamically significant mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart valves, represent an important part of the spectrum of non-valvular AF to which the results of trials of oral anticoagulants apply, at least as far as the use of rivaroxaban is concerned.

The type of patients included in this trial corresponds to the definition of non-valvular atrial fibrillation as was just re-emphasized in the very recent AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. Since these patients are encompassed in the prescription labels of the drug regulatory authorities, it is important for the physician to know that there might be some differences between patients with and without SVD, even if patients meet the criteria for non-valvular AF.

Clinical evaluation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) — minimum evaluation includes history and physical examination to define presence and nature of symptoms associated with AF; clinical type of AF (first episode, paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent); onset of the first symptomatic attack or date of discovery of AF; frequency, duration, precipitating factors, and modes of termination of AF; response to any pharmacological agents that have been administered; and presence of any underlying heart disease or other reversible conditions (e.g., hyperthyroidism or alcohol consumption). Electrocardiogram is used to identify rhythm (verify AF), LV hypertrophy, P-wave duration and morphology or fibrillatory waves, preexcitation, bundle-branch block, prior MI, and other atrial arrhythmias, and to measure and follow the R-R, QRS, and QT intervals in conjunction with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Transthoracic echocardiogram is used to identify valvular heart disease; LA and RA size; LV size and function; peak RV pressure (pulmonary hypertension); LV hypertrophy; LA thrombus (low sensitivity); and pericardial disease. Blood tests of thyroid, renal, and hepatic function are specified for a first episode of AF, when the ventricular rate is difficult to control.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DUepq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The original non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) trials in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) enrolled patients with native valve pathologies. The object of this study was to quantify the benefit-risk profiles of NOACs versus warfarin in AF patients with native valvular heart disease (VHD).

Methods and Results

Trials were identified by exhaustive literature search. Trial data were combined using inverse variance weighting to produce a meta-analytic summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin. Our final analysis included 4 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 71 526 participants, including 13 574 with VHD. Pooling results from included trials showed that NOACs versus warfarin reduced stroke or systemic embolism (HR: 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60–0.82) and intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.92) in AF patients with VHD. However, risk reduction of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage was driven by apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (HR for major bleeding: 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 0.33 [95% CI, 0.25–0.45]) but not rivaroxaban (HR for major bleeding: 1.56 [95% CI, 1.20–2.04]; HR for intracranial hemorrhage: 1.27 [95% CI, 0.77–2.10]).

Conclusions

Among patients with AF and native VHD, NOACs reduce stroke and systemic embolism compared with warfarin. Evidence shows that apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban also reduce bleeding in this patient subgroup, whereas major bleeding (but not intracranial hemorrhage or mortality rate) is significantly increased in VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban. NOACs are a reasonable alternative to warfarin in AF patients with VHD.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116ncxRY]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — bridging during interruption of oral anticoagulation in prosthetic valve patients — For bioprosthetic heart valves or annuloplasty rings receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF), it is reasonable to consider the need for bridging anticoagulant therapy around invasive procedures on the basis of the CHA2DS2-VASc score weighed against bleeding risk. For patients undergoing invasive procedures who have 1) a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with any thromboembolic risk factor, 2) an older-generation mechanical AVR, or 3) a mechanical mitral valve replacement, bridging anticoagulation therapy during the preoperative time interval when the international normalized ratio (INR) is subtherapeutic is reasonable on an individualized basis with risks of bleeding weighed against benefits of thromboembolism prevention.

### Safety and efficacy of novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease [^113T4VYF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

A significant percentage of patients with AF have VHD, and on the basis of the current definition of valvular AF, they are classified as patients with "nonvalvular AF". For these patients, 4 NOACs can be used for primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic events. The definition of valvular AF has evolved to include rheumatic mitral stenosis and mechanical valve, bioprosthetic heart valve, and mitral valve repair, according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society 2014 guidelines 26; or mechanical heart valves and hemodynamically significant valve disease, severe enough to warrant surgical or percutaneous intervention, according to a recent consensus from the European Heart Rhythm Association. 27 The randomized controlled trials of NOACs 2, 3, 4, 5 excluded patients with severe mitral stenosis (ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE‐AF [Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation], RE‐LY, ROCKET‐AF), prosthetic or mechanical valves (excluded in all 4 pivotal trials), and hemodynamically significant valve disease (ROCKET‐AF and RE‐LY trial). However, 26.4% of patients in the ARISTOTLE trial, 21.8% of patients in the RE‐LY trial, and 14.1% of patients in ROCKET‐AF included those with at least moderate VHD, which, in the vast majority of cases, was mitral regurgitation. The rationale behind exclusion of severe mitral stenosis or hemodynamically significant valve disease was the increased thromboembolic risk and the need for surgical or percutaneous intervention. Furthermore, on the basis of the results of the RE‐ALIGN (Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients With Mechanical Heart Valves) trial, 28 the use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. In our study, we excluded patients who had valve replacement (likely attributable to hemodynamically significant valve disease) during the study period.

### Mechanistic insights into mitral regurgitation due to atrial fibrillation: "Atrial functional mitral regurgitation" [^111bKMWE]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is common, and definitive management of significant MR often requires percutaneous or surgical correction. Lone atrial fibrillation has been proposed to result in "atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR)" via left atrial enlargement and mitral annular dilation. Patients with AFMR may represent a subgroup in which a rhythm control strategy may be preferred and catheter ablation is a promising nonsurgical therapy. This review discusses the anatomy of the mitral valve apparatus and MR classification schemes. Potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AFMR the implications for treatment will be discussed in detail.

### Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: where are we now? [^1131hFnL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers increased risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events, and oral anticoagulation therefore is the essential part of AF management to reduce the risk of these complications. Until recently, the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, e.g., warfarin) were the only oral anticoagulants available, acting by decreased synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VI, IX, and X). The VKAs had many limitations: delayed onset and prolonged offset of action, variability of anticoagulant effect among patients, multiple food and drug interactions affecting pharmacological properties of warfarin, narrow therapeutic window, and obligatory regular laboratory control, which all made warfarin "inconvenient" both for patients and clinicians. The limitations of VKAs led to development of a new class of drugs collectively defined as non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which included direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs avoid many of the VKA drawbacks. In this review, we will focus on the current evidence justifying the use of NOACs in non-valvular AF.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^116ZhfT7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Large randomized controlled trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of the 4 approved DOACs for the prevention of SSE in patients with NVAF. 9, 10, 11, 12 The design of these trials was based on historic randomized controlled trials of adjusted‐dose warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, which generally excluded patients with severe or moderate mitral stenosis and prosthetic heart valves. DOACs were associated with a similar or lower risk of SSE compared with warfarin. Additionally, rates of major and intracranial bleeding with any DOAC were similar to or lower than the rates with warfarin. As these studies established the efficacy and safety of DOACs to reduce the risk of SSE in patients with NVAF, 9, 10, 11, 12 they generally excluded patients with mitral stenosis or artificial heart valves or valve repair. However, they commonly included patients with other types of valvular heart disease (VHD), including mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and mitral valve prolapse.

NVAF appears to have been interpreted differently in the designs of the DOAC pivotal trials. Because definitions of NVAF vary, there is uncertainty as to whether patients with certain valve diseases may be considered to have NVAF, and whether DOACs are appropriate for these patients. In a recent survey of physicians who treat patients with AF, only about one‐half to two‐thirds of respondents agreed that the existing definitions of NVAF were sufficiently clear. 13 A clear definition of NVAF is missing from the current literature.

VHD is commonly associated with AF; a recent registry of patients with AF across 9 European countries showed that valvular abnormalities coexisted in 63.5% of AF patients. 14 The presence of concomitant VHD significantly increases the risk of stroke in AF. 15 The potential role of DOACs in patients with specific types of VHD has not been directly assessed. Current guidelines provide specific recommendations for the use of DOACs to reduce stroke risk in patients with NVAF; however, reduction in SSE risk in patients with AF in the setting of specific valvular heart lesions is less well defined. Current research is focused on identifying other potential roles of DOACs in specific clinical conditions, including AF associated with VHD or with a prosthetic heart valve. Thus, it is possible that the range of indications for DOAC use will expand in the future.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease: a systematic review [^111B9Leh]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are indicated for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), which, according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines, excludes patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. However, the data regarding use of DOACs in AF patients with other types of valvular heart disease (VHD) are unclear. We aimed to summarize and evaluate the literature regarding the safety and efficacy of DOAC use in NVAF patients with other types of VHD. After an extensive literature search, a total of 1 prospective controlled trial, 4 subanalyses, and 1 abstract were identified. Efficacy of the DOAC agents in NVAF patients with VHD mirrored the overall trial results. Bleeding risk was significantly increased in VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban, but not for dabigatran or apixaban. Of the bioprosthetic valve patients enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, no safety or efficacy concerns were identified. In conclusion, subanalyses of DOAC landmark AF trials revealed that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban may be safely used in AF patients with certain types of VHD: aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. More evidence is needed before routinely recommending these agents for patients with bioprosthetic valves or mild mitral stenosis. Patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves should continue to receive warfarin, as these patients were excluded from all landmark AF trials.

Mitral stenosis — There has not yet been a randomized trial comparing vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in these patients; rheumatic mitral stenosis prevalence is low in Western countries but remains high in Eastern Europe, India, Africa, South America, and south East Asia, and in light of this the use of NOACs is described as attractive; patients with moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis were excluded from the pivotal NOAC trials; nevertheless, NOACs could be considered in mitral stenosis due to degenerative mechanisms or calcification without rheumatic involvement.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease [^116eifRe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In the absence of specific RCTs addressing this subpopulation of patients with VHD, these results therefore reinforce the data showing that treatment with DOACs is safe and effective in patients with AF with a broad spectrum of VHDs such as mitral regurgitation, bioprosthetic valves (including mitral), aortic stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, valve repair, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation(Figure).

Figure 1
Current indications for treatment with direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists in patients with AF and VHD.

DOACs indicates direct oral anticoagulants; EHRA, Evaluating Heart Valve, Rheumatic, or Artificial; VHD, valvular heart disease; and VKAs, vitamin K antagonists.

The dichotomization of patients in valvular or nonvalvular AF when addressing treatment with anticoagulants can be misleading for physicians as actually only patients with mechanical heart valves and moderate to severe rheumatic valve disease cannot be currently treated with DOACs. An agreement document from several scientist societies has proposed a functional EHRA (Evaluating Heart Valve, Rheumatic, or Artificial) classification system to direct the choice of oral anticoagulants for the AF and VHD populations. In this classification, EHRA type 1 VHD refers to patients with AF with VHD needing therapy with a VKA, and EHRA type 2 VHD, refers to AF patients with VHD needing therapy with a VKA or a DOAC, also taking into consideration the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score risk.

Currently included in EHRA type 1 VHD are patients with mechanical heart valves and moderate to severe rheumatic valve disease. In these patients, VKAs still remain, after all these years, as the anticoagulant to be used. We will have to wait and see whether ongoing RCTs such as DAVID‐MS (DAbigatran for Stroke preVention in Atrial Fibrillation in MoDerate or severe mitral stenosis), which is currently evaluating Asian patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis, will be able further expand the use of DOACs.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of valvular heart disease in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the ORBIT-AF (outcomes registry for better informed treatment for atrial fibrillation) [^116rrkNh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Largely on the basis of data from decades ago, VHD, independent of the presence of AF, is thought to be associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events. 2, 3, 4, 5 This risk is greatly amplified in the presence of AF. 15 AF in the setting of rheumatic MS and mechanical prosthetic valves is unequivocally associated with a high risk of thromboembolism. 18 On the basis of experience and the high risk of stroke in patients with moderate or severe MS, and concerns for valve thrombosis in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, contemporary trials of DOACs largely excluded those patients, but included patients with other types of moderate or severe VHD.

Our findings add to available data by including patients with MS/MV, bioprosthetic valve replacement, and other types of valve procedures, including surgical repair and balloon valvuloplasty. Specifically, our registry population differed from ARISTOTLE, ROCKET AF, ENGAGE AF in that it contained patients with MS/MV (n = 403). In addition, ARISTOTLE (n = 251) and ROCKET AF (n = 106) had few patients with bioprosthetic heart valves, surgical repair, or balloon valvuloplasty compared with our ORBIT‐AF cohort (n = 455). ENGAGE AF had 325 individuals with prior valve surgery; however, the study did not report outcomes specifically for this cohort. Adjusted outcomes differed among the 4 cohorts. Patients with significant VHD in ARISTOTLE had higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism than patients without significant VHD (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.10–1.62; P = 0.003). In ROCKET AF, ENGAGE AF, and our study population, there were no differences in stroke or systemic embolic events in those with or without significant VHD. In ENGAGE AF and ARISTOTLE, individuals with significant VHD had a greater risk of death than patients without significant VHD (adjusted HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.26–1.56] and 1.48 [95% CI, 1.32–1.67], respectively; P < 0.001). Patients with significant VHD in ARISTOTLE and our cohort did not have higher rates of major bleeding compared with those without significant VHD. Conversely, in ROCKET AF and ENGAGE AF, major bleeding occurred significantly more frequently in patients with significant VHD (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.10–1.57] [P = 0.0027] and 1.21 [95% CI, 1.03–1.42] [P = 0.020], respectively). In our community cohort of patients with significant VHD, patients with moderate‐to‐severe AR, AS, MR, or TR had higher mortality than those without VHD; however, no differences were observed in major bleeding. A recent meta‐analysis analyzed 71 683 patients, 13 585 with VHD enrolled in the RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy), ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF clinical trials. This represents the largest evaluation of a cohort of patients with AF and VHD. Relative to patients with AF without VHD, those with VHD had higher mortality and major bleeding. There were no differences in the rates of stroke or systemic embolic events. 19

Data Extraction

All data from eligible studies were extracted by 2 independent investigators according to a standard protocol. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third investigator and by referencing the original report. Recorded data variables were trial name, eligibility criteria, types of VHD, mean age, proportion of women in the study, baseline characteristics, percentage of persistent or permanent AF, baseline CHADS 2 scores, history of stroke, history of myocardial infarction, history of heart failure, percentage of prior warfarin use, renal status, and follow‐up duration.

Study Quality Assessment

All included studies were derived from RCTs. The risk of bias (eg, selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias) of the original included trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias algorithm.

Objectives

The objectives of these analyses were (1) to evaluate differences in baseline characteristics among AF patients with and without VHD; (2) to compare the rates of stroke or systemic embolism, all‐cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients with and without VHD; and (3) to assess the efficacy (stroke or systemic embolism, all‐cause mortality) and safety (major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage) of NOACs in comparison to warfarin in AF patients with and without VHD.

Evolving Definitions of NVAF

Definitions of NVAF have changed with successive editions of authoritative guidelines. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) 2001 guidelines, NVAF was defined as rhythm disturbance occurring in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease or a prosthetic heart valve. 16 In the 2006 update to these guidelines, the definition was revised to include AF in the absence of mitral valve repair. 17 The ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2014 guidelines define NVAF as AF in the absence of rheumatic mitral stenosis, a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. 18 The 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines for the management of AF states that AF is conventionally described as "valvular" or "nonvalvular". The ESC defines valvular AF as AF associated with rheumatic VHD (predominantly mitral stenosis) or prosthetic heart valves. 5 The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines use the term "non‐rheumatic AF" synonymously with NVAF. 3

In a recent consensus, the European Heart Rhythm Association, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACCA), HRS, and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society defined NVAF as AF in the absence of prosthetic mechanical heart valves or hemodynamically significant valve disease, referring to a valve lesion severe enough to warrant surgical or percutaneous intervention or that would have an impact on survival or well‐being. 19

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews when conducting the review, and PRISMA 2020 for reporting the review. As this is a protocol, we followed both sets of guidance until the end of the Methods sections.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early versus late initiation of oral anticoagulation in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related ischaemic stroke. We will exclude cross‐over trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster‐randomised trials. Quasi‐randomised controlled trials are controlled trials where participants are allocated to different arms of the trial using a method of allocation that is not truly random (e.g. allocation by day of week). There will be no language restrictions.

Types of participants

We will include participants who meet the following criteria:

adults (aged 18 years or older);
diagnosed with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation; and
a definite clinical diagnosis of ischaemic stroke.

We will exclude the following participants:

people with absolute contraindications to the use of oral anticoagulant medications; or
pregnant or breastfeeding women.

We will define non‐valvular atrial fibrillation as atrial fibrillation documented by electrocardiogram (12‐lead or Holter monitoring), without moderate‐to‐severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, including permanent, persistent, paroxysmal nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation after stroke.

Ischaemic stroke will be defined as a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit and evidence of acute cerebral infarction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), or as a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic stroke with symptoms lasting more than 24 hours excluding other causes.

There are no restrictions on gender, ethnic background, or the settings that participants come from.

Management of trials that include a mixed population of eligible and ineligible participants will entail contacting the study authors for data concerning the subset of interest. Where we cannot obtain such data, we will document the circumstances descriptively as part of the narrative.

Valvular atrial fibrillation in pregnant women — Pregnancy by itself is a prothrombotic state and the coalescence of venous stasis and hypercoagulability results in nearly a five-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. The continuously changing pharmacokinetics of LMWH during the various trimesters adds an additional challenge and requires monitoring by peak and trough anti-Xa levels, which is often not feasible. Since anticoagulation is recommended in pregnant women with AF at risk of stroke, to minimise teratogenic risk and intrauterine bleeding, the ESC guidelines recommend that dose adjusted heparin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy and in the 2–4 weeks before delivery. VKA or heparin can be used in the remaining trimesters of the pregnancy. In the absence of adequate safety data, NOACs should be avoided in pregnancy and in women planning a pregnancy.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) classification and anticoagulation resumption after ICH in atrial fibrillation are outlined. The forms of ICH are often classified by mechanism as traumatic or nontraumatic/spontaneous. In patients with atrial fibrillation and high-risk thromboembolic conditions such as mechanical valve or rheumatic valvular disease, anticoagulation is often resumed early after ICH regardless of mechanism, whereas for other patients the decision to resume requires careful risk–benefit assessment of patient-specific factors. Traumatic etiologies generally carry lower long-term recurrence risk and anticoagulation is generally considered safe to resume, while nontraumatic/spontaneous etiologies are generally associated with higher recurrence risk. For patients with ICH deemed at high risk of recurrence, LAA closure may be a viable alternative to anticoagulation, though data on efficacy and safety are lacking in this population.

### Valvular heart disease patients on edoxaban or warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^113wDeJB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coexisting valvular heart disease (VHD) is of substantial interest.

Objectives

This study explored outcomes in patients with AF with and without VHD in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial, comparing edoxaban with warfarin.

Methods

Valvular heart disease was defined as history or baseline echocardiography evidence of at least moderate aortic/mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, or prior valve surgery (bioprosthesis replacement, valve repair, valvuloplasty). Patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves were excluded from the trial. Comparisons were made of rates of stroke/systemic embolic event (SSEE), major bleeding, additional efficacy and safety outcomes, as well as net clinical outcomes, in patients with or without VHD treated with edoxaban or warfarin, using adjusted Cox proportional hazards.

Results

After adjustment for multiple baseline characteristics, compared with no-VHD patients (n = 18,222), VHD patients (n = 2,824) had a similar rate of SSEE but higher rates of death (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.26 to 1.56; p < 0.001), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.43; p < 0.001), and major bleeding (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.42; p = 0.02). Higher-dose edoxaban regimen had efficacy similar to warfarin in the presence of VHD (for SSEE, HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.07, in patients with VHD, and HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.07, in patients without VHD; p interaction [p int] = 0.26; and for less major bleeding, HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.02 in patients with VHD, and HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.94, in patients with no VHD; p int = 0.57).

Conclusions

The presence of VHD increased the risk of death, major adverse cardiovascular events, and major bleeding but did not affect the relative efficacy or safety of higher-dose edoxaban versus warfarin in AF.
