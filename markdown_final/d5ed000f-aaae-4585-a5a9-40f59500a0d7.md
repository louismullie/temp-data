## Question

With posterior hip replacement can an individual play competitive sports

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if an individual can play competitive sports after a posterior hip replacement, and if so, under what conditions and with what risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "competitive sports" is defined and classified by impact and contact. Then, I should verify what the posterior approach changes mechanically and in terms of dislocation risk. Next, I will review evidence on return-to-sport rates and timelines after THA, and whether approach-specific data exist. After that, I need to examine the risks of higher-impact activity on implant durability and dislocation. Finally, I will synthesize practical, sport-specific recommendations and a decision framework for counseling, including rehabilitation and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate recreational and competitive participation. Competitive sports span low-impact (e.g., golf, doubles tennis), moderate-impact (e.g., singles tennis, cycling, skiing), and high-impact/contact sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, martial arts), and return-to-sport outcomes and risks vary substantially across these categories, with most contemporary guidance emphasizing a shift toward lower-impact activities post-arthroplasty while acknowledging exceptions for experienced athletes and specific implants [^112rwmZy] [^113yLTFN].

> Now, I need to check what the posterior approach actually changes biomechanically. The posterior approach remains common and effective, but it carries a higher theoretical dislocation risk due to disruption of posterior soft tissues; that said, modern enhanced soft-tissue repair, larger femoral heads, and dual-mobility bearings have mitigated this risk in many series, and AAOS guidance notes no universally preferred approach, with approach selection individualized to surgeon experience and patient factors, including activity goals [^114pFtZ6] [^1156pFQ6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about approach dictating activity. I initially thought posterior approach patients might have uniformly lower return-to-sport rates, but wait, let me verify comparative data. Several matched studies suggest patients undergoing direct anterior THA report earlier and more frequent return to recreational activities and are more likely to attempt their preoperative sport, yet objective functional scores are often similar between approaches, and a matched midterm study found no significant differences in strenuous sports participation between posterolateral and anterolateral groups, indicating that approach alone does not determine activity ceiling in all patients [^114FK4y4] [^115hK2vh] [^114FCnTQ].

> Next, I should review the overall return-to-sport evidence after THA, regardless of approach. Umbrella review data show roughly 82% of patients return to some sport at a mean of 6 months, with most resuming low- to moderate-impact activities between 7 and 12 months; preoperative participation is the strongest predictor, and patients tend to shift away from high-impact sports even when they return successfully, which aligns with biomechanical prudence after arthroplasty [^112rwmZy] [^115QTi5e].

> I will now examine whether higher-intensity sport participation increases complications or revisions. A large prospective cohort (SAFE-T) found no association between higher-intensity activity and worse PROMs or increased revision over 5 years, though certain activities like singles tennis, squash, and snowboarding correlated with more activity-related pain; conversely, a long-term comparative study associated high-impact sport with greater polyethylene wear and more revisions, underscoring that risk may be activity- and implant-specific rather than universal [^114PvzH6] [^1169BnYC].

> Let me consider sport-specific guidance and where competitive play fits. Golf, cycling, swimming, doubles tennis, and Nordic walking are broadly endorsed and commonly resumed after THA, with golf cohorts showing faster return and even improved performance metrics; in contrast, European surgeon consensus places soccer, basketball, handball, full-contact sports, and martial arts in the "not allowed" category for many patients, particularly early postoperatively, reflecting concerns over dislocation, periprosthetic fracture, and implant wear [^113SLkR6] [^115QTi5e] [^113yLTFN] [^112CsBJw].

> But wait, what if the patient is an experienced, highly motivated competitor in a higher-impact sport? Case series and surveys suggest that some individuals do return to moderate- and even select high-impact activities, including running and competitive tennis, especially with modern bearings and meticulous technique, yet these are exceptions requiring individualized risk–benefit counseling and close follow-up; survivorship data from resurfacing cohorts also show dose-dependent associations between very high activity loads and revision risk, reinforcing caution rather than prohibition [^114EoC6R] [^117A3dxS] [^111MiEhy].

> I should double-check the role of implant and surgical factors that can modulate risk for active patients. Larger femoral heads and dual-mobility constructs increase jump distance and reduce dislocation risk, which can be advantageous for athletes; however, component position and pelvic orientation remain critical, and even optimal implants cannot fully offset the mechanical demands of repetitive high-impact loading, so expectations must be calibrated accordingly [^1156pFQ6] [^114pFtZ6].

> Next, I should review rehabilitation and timing, because safe return hinges on tissue healing and neuromuscular control. Contemporary guidance supports structured, progressive rehabilitation with eventual resumption of impact activities after soft-tissue healing and strength recovery, typically in the 3–6 month window for many sports, with higher-intensity competitive resumption often closer to 6–12 months; preoperative activity level, motivation, and BMI influence outcomes, and supervised therapy can improve participation compared with unsupervised care in some settings [^113gwxEx] [^112rwmZy] [^113yLTFN] [^115gmn3s].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Yes, many individuals can return to competitive sports after posterior-approach THA, but the sports are predominantly low- to moderate-impact, and return is most predictable when the patient was already participating at a competitive level preoperatively, has ideal component position and modern bearing constructs, undergoes methodical rehabilitation, and accepts a monitored, gradual progression with sport-specific technique adjustments; high-impact and contact sports are not categorically forbidden but carry higher risks of pain, dislocation, and potential implant wear, and should be approached with caution and shared decision-making [^112rwmZy] [^1169BnYC] [^114PvzH6].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling message is balanced. I should confirm that posterior approach patients are not inherently barred from competition, but they may face a slightly higher theoretical dislocation risk that can be mitigated by implant selection and rehabilitation; I should also emphasize that the strongest evidence supports return to low- and moderate-impact competitive activities, whereas high-impact competition requires exceptional circumstances, careful selection, and close surveillance for symptoms and implant performance over time [^114pFtZ6] [^112rwmZy] [^1156pFQ6] [^113gwxEx] [^1169BnYC].

Patients can return to **competitive sports after posterior hip replacement**, but success depends on the sport's impact level, patient factors, and surgical technique. Most patients return to **low-impact sports** (e.g. golf, cycling, swimming, doubles tennis) by 3–6 months, with 70–90% returning by 6–12 months. High-impact or contact sports (e.g. soccer, basketball, rugby) are generally discouraged due to higher risks of dislocation, implant wear, and revision; if pursued, they require careful selection, modern implants, and close follow-up. Modern posterior approaches with enhanced soft-tissue repair and larger femoral heads have reduced dislocation risk, but patients should still follow precautions and progress gradually under supervision [^117YAbnc] [^112rwmZy] [^111YRViT].

---

## Factors influencing return to competitive sports

Several factors influence the ability to return to **competitive sports** after posterior hip replacement:

- **Sport type and impact level**: Low-impact sports (e.g. golf, cycling, swimming, doubles tennis) are generally safe and encouraged, while high-impact or contact sports (e.g. soccer, basketball, rugby) carry higher risks and are often discouraged [^112rwmZy] [^113yLTFN].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, preoperative activity level, BMI, and overall health significantly influence return-to-sport outcomes. Younger, active patients with lower BMI and good health are more likely to return to competitive sports [^1148kttv] [^115QTi5e].

- **Surgical technique and implant selection**: Modern posterior approaches with enhanced soft-tissue repair, larger femoral heads, and advanced bearing surfaces (e.g. ceramic-on-ceramic) have improved stability and reduced dislocation rates, facilitating safer return to sports [^117YAbnc] [^1156pFQ6].

---

## Evidence on return to competitive sports

Recent studies provide encouraging data on returning to **competitive sports** after posterior hip replacement:

- **Low-impact sports**: Approximately 70–90% of patients return to low-impact sports within 6–12 months postoperatively, with significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life [^112rwmZy].

- **High-impact sports**: While some patients successfully return to high-impact sports, the risks of complications, including dislocation, implant wear, and revision surgery, are significantly higher. Careful patient selection, modern implant technology, and close follow-up are essential [^1169BnYC] [^112rwmZy].

- **Golf**: Golf is particularly popular among patients undergoing hip replacement, with studies showing that 88% of golfers return to the sport, often with improved performance and reduced pain [^113SLkR6] [^111NC4hW].

---

## Risks and complications associated with competitive sports

Returning to **competitive sports** after posterior hip replacement carries potential risks and complications:

- **Dislocation**: The posterior approach historically carries a higher risk of dislocation, although modern techniques and implant designs have significantly reduced this risk [^114pFtZ6] [^117YAbnc].

- **Implant wear and loosening**: High-impact activities can accelerate implant wear, potentially leading to loosening and revision surgery [^1169BnYC] [^112rwmZy].

- **Periprosthetic fracture**: High-impact or contact sports increase the risk of periprosthetic fracture, particularly in patients with osteoporosis or other bone quality issues [^notfound].

---

## Surgical technique and implant selection

Advances in surgical technique and implant selection have significantly improved outcomes for patients returning to **competitive sports**:

- **Enhanced soft-tissue repair**: Modern posterior approaches incorporate enhanced soft-tissue repair, reducing dislocation risk and improving stability [^117YAbnc].

- **Larger femoral heads**: Larger femoral heads (≥ 36 mm) provide greater stability and range of motion, facilitating safer return to sports [^1156pFQ6].

- **Advanced bearing surfaces**: Ceramic-on-ceramic and highly cross-linked polyethylene bearings reduce wear and improve implant longevity, particularly beneficial for active patients [^notfound].

---

## Rehabilitation and return-to-sport protocols

Structured rehabilitation and return-to-sport protocols are essential for safe and successful return to **competitive sports**:

- **Early rehabilitation**: Early mobilization, strength training, and functional exercises are critical components of rehabilitation, typically beginning within days after surgery [^113gwxEx].

- **Gradual progression**: Patients should progress gradually from low-impact activities to more demanding sports, with careful monitoring of pain, function, and implant stability [^112rwmZy].

- **Patient education**: Education on proper technique, body mechanics, and activity modification is essential to minimize risks and maximize performance [^111wVLnn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations emphasize **individualized decision-making** and **shared decision-making** between patients and surgeons. Low-impact sports are generally encouraged, whereas high-impact or contact sports should be approached with caution and require careful patient selection, modern implant technology, and close follow-up [^112rwmZy] [^113yLTFN].

---

Patients can return to **competitive sports after posterior hip replacement**, particularly low-impact activities such as golf, cycling, and swimming. High-impact or contact sports carry higher risks and require careful selection, modern surgical techniques, and close follow-up. Individualized decision-making and structured rehabilitation are essential for safe and successful return to sports.

### Hip replacement in the athlete: is there a role? [^112qMPc7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Sport and total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been regarded by many as being mutually exclusive. The primary indication for hip arthroplasty has always been pain. With advances in the technology surrounding hip replacement surgery and increasing patient expectations of what THA can offer, there is a growing demand for hip replacement with the aim of returning to sporting activity. The aim of this review article is to report the advances in hip replacement surgery that aim to make the procedure more suitable for the sporting individual and to summarise the literature on the subject of returning to sports after THA.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^117YAbnc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful operations in orthopaedics because of its pain relief, functional improvement, high satisfaction, and low complication rates. The rates of THA have increased over the past several decades. Sloan et alreported that the annual incidence of primary THA in the United States increased by 105% from 2000 to 2014 and projected a 71% growth by 2030 (635,000 procedures). As a consequence of improved survivability, younger patients are being offered THA and surgeons must be prepared to counsel patients regarding participation in sport and recreational activities after hip arthroplasty.

Sport and recreation can have positive benefits on the overall health and quality of life for older individuals, and the most common deterrent is medical limitations. Physical activity trends over the past three decades have changed, leading to more people older than 50 participating in recreational activity. A cross sectional study found that 30% of adults aged 55 to 64 participated in sport in 2005, an increase from 11.9% in 1985. Before hip arthroplasty, approximately 35% of patients in European studiesand up to 80% of patients in Australian studiesparticipated in sport. Several European studies have characterized return to sporting activity after THA and found greater than 60% of return to physical activity after lower limb arthroplasty.

Over the past two decades, the rate of direct anterior approach (DAA) THA has increased in popularity despite no definitive high level evidence for long-term superiority to the traditional posterior approach (PA). The initial increase in popularity was aimed at reducing dislocation rates in THA; however, as enhanced capsular closure and larger heads became more popular, dislocation became less common with the PA. DAA has continued to gain popularity because of a desire to decrease soft-tissue damage and improve recovery. Although perception is that DAA results in less tissue damage, this has not been supported in the literature. Most studies comparing DAA with PA focus on early recovery, and there is little comparing return to recreational activity or sport profiles of DAA and PA hip arthroplasties.

Return to recreational activity may influence choice of surgical approach. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of two surgical approaches (direct anterior and posterior) on return to recreational activity. We hypothesized that there would be no difference between direct anterior and posterior approach regarding patients' return to recreational activity.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^115LfK1T]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Fifty-nine percent of patients returned to some form of recreational activity after THA. The most common recreational activities were walking, cycling, and exercise classes. Compared with the posterior approach, patients undergoing THA using the direct anterior approach were more likely to attempt their preoperative sporting activities, participated in a greater amount of recreational activities, and had a stronger perception that the approach influenced their return to recreational activities. A prospective randomized study would be valuable to analyze recreational profiles throughout recovery from THA. These findings may help practitioners counselling patients regarding recreational activities after total hip arthroplasty.

### Return to sporting activity after total hip arthroplasty – A survey of members of the British hip society [^111YRViT]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Total hip arthroplasty is increasingly performed in younger, more active patients. Thirty-five percent of patients are involved in sports preoperatively, and a desire to return to sporting activity is now a major expectation. Sporting activity potentially risks premature failure of the implant, and there is no consensus or guidelines among British or European surgeons performing total hip arthroplasty in sporting patients.

Methods

The current practice of British Hip Society members was explored through a Web-based survey. Of the 260 members surveyed, 109 responded.

Results

The majority of respondents (33%) would perform uncemented, 29.1% would perform hybrid, 15.5% would perform fully cemented, and 11.7% would perform a resurfacing hip arthroplasty for sporting patients. The preferred approach is the standard posterior (68.9%) and preferred bearing couples are ceramic-on-ceramic (39.8%) and ceramic-on-polyethylene (36.9%). Half of respondents would opt for a femoral head smaller than 36 mm, whereas 22.3% would use a head 36 mm or larger. A third would allow patients to return to sports between 6 and 12 weeks after surgery, whereas 43.7% advise patients to wait until 3 months postoperatively. All respondents allow patients to return to low-impact activities, but significant caution is exercised with regard to taking part in high-impact activities.

Conclusion

We report the practice of a specialist group of hip surgeons, the majority of which consider themselves young adult hip specialists. We believe that these data may be of use to help inform the practice of our colleagues when performing arthroplasty in sporting patients and may serve to inform future consensus guidelines.

### Is there a difference in physical activity levels in patients before and up to one year after unilateral total hip replacement? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113r2aBE]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was change in physical activity within the initial 12 months post-total hip replacement. Physical activity was defined using the British Government's, Department of Health's definition being: 'all forms of activity such as everyday walking or cycling to get from "A to B", active play work-related activity, active recreation (such as working out in a gym), dancing, gardening or playing active games, as well as organised and competitive sport'. All outcomes that measured physical activity were considered for this systematic review. This included, but is not limited to, accelerometer and physical activity questionnaires, for example physical activity score for the elderlyand global physical activity questionnaire.

Secondary outcome measures for this study were considered to be any measure that measures physiological exercise capacity, this includes but is not limited to maximal and submaximal exercise tests. Measures of strength or power, such as strength dynamometry, were not considered measures of physical activity in this systematic review and therefore excluded. Similarly, biomechanical measures, such as walking speed and peak impact force, were not considered measures of physical activity, as these are measures of physiological and/or biomechanical efficiency.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^112CsBJw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Return to sport and recreation after THA is a complex intersection of patient and surgeon preferences combined with objective pain and functional outcome. The most current recommendations from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) from 2007 regarding return to athletic activity after THA are based on a survey to member surgeons. Most high-impact activities were not allowed. Intermediate and low-impact activities for the most part were allowed. The authors noted that compared with previous surveys performed in the 1990s, surgeons had become more liberal with their acceptance of allowing patients to participate in intermediate and higher-impact activities after THA. This change was because of the perception that patients and implants can handle increased loads and greater extremes of motion. A similar survey was conducted in Denmark in 2014 and found profoundly different opinions on the attitude of surgeons on patients returning to athletic activities. The survey found that 55% of high-volume arthroplasty surgeons allow for high-impact activities after THA compared with 21% in the AAHKS 2007 survey. At our institution, policies regarding participation in activities post-THA are much more lenient than the 2007 AAHKS guidelines. Decision-making is based on the patients' experience and a risk benefit conversation with the patient about the potential risk of increased wear on the implant, fracture, and hip dislocation.

The recreation profile is not the first of its kind in hip arthroplasty but is the first to compare direct anterior and posterior approaches. The study by Wylde et al.has the most extensive sport profile after total joint arthroplasty. The authors found that approximately 26% of patients were unable to return to sporting activities after hip arthroplasty. These results are similar to our findings with 22% of patients reporting that their hip limited their ability to return to recreational activity and 41% admitting that they did not return to sport. The most common low-impact activities reported by Wylde et al. were swimming, walking, and golf. Our study found that walking, cycling, and exercise classes are the most common. This may be a reflection of recreational trends in our population. The total number of reported recreational activity responses by DAA arthroplasty outweighed the PA arthroplasty 122 to 81. A clear limitation in this study is the lack of data on preoperative recreational activities. Therefore, we were not able to determine whether the difference in recreational profile is related to the surgical approach or patients' preoperative inclinations.

### Sport after total hip arthroplasty: undoubted progress but still some unknowns [^115RbdwB]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

In this review, we discuss the evidence for patients returning to sport after hip arthroplasty. This includes the choices regarding level of sporting activity and revision or complications, the type of implant, fixation and techniques of implantation, and how these choices relate to health economics. It is apparent that despite its success over six decades, hip arthroplasty has now evolved to accommodate and support ever-increasing patient demands and may therefore face new challenges.

### Is there a difference in physical activity levels in patients before and up to one year after unilateral total hip replacement? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111t22BD]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Total hip replacement is one of the most common elective orthopaedic operations. A total of 620,300 total hip replacements were undertaken in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from April 2003 to December 2013. Osteoarthritis is the most common indication, estimated to be the principle reason for 93% of total hip replacements. Of these patients, 40% are male, with the median age at operation being 69 years.

Physical activity is a generic term encompassing any activity that involves movement that results in an increase in heart rate and calorific expenditure, the amount of calories burnt. Physical activity can be subdivided into three categories: (1) everyday activity, e.g. active travel such as walking or cycling; (2) active recreation, e.g. gardening, home improvement or recreational walking; and (3) sport that may be competitive or non-competitive.

Previous systematic reviews have focused on total hip replacement and exercise – or alternatively have combined total hip and knee replacements together. No previous systematic reviews have investigated the relationship between total hip replacement and physical activity, and specifically whether physical activity changes after total hip replacement. This is an important void in the evidence-base, as physical inactivity has been associated with the development of numerous non-communicable diseases. Given this, the purpose of this systematic review is to answer the question: Is there a difference in physical activity levels in patients before and up to one year after unilateral total hip replacement?

### Athletic activity after total joint arthroplasty [^111wVLnn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Demand for total joint arthroplasty is projected to increase in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. With increasing frequency, patients who have a hip or knee replacement expect to, and choose to, participate in athletics following rehabilitation. In general, patients who have had a hip or knee replacement decrease their participation in, and intensity of, athletic activity following the total joint arthroplasty. The orthopaedic literature on athletic activity after total joint arthroplasty is limited to small retrospective studies with short-term follow-up. Expert opinion regarding appropriate athletic activity after total joint arthroplasty is available from the Hip Society and the Knee Society. When patients who have undergone joint replacements choose to participate in athletic activity, orthopaedic surgeons should provide information with which to evaluate the risk of sports activity and recommend appropriate athletic activity.

### Sports activity after total hip resurfacing [^114EoC6R]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about sports activity after total hip resurfacing.

Hypothesis

Patients undergoing total hip resurfacing can have a high level of sports activity.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

The authors evaluated the level of sports activities with a standardized questionnaire in 138 consecutive patients (152 hips) 2 years after total hip resurfacing. Range of motion, Harris hip score, and Oxford score were assessed, and radiological analysis was performed.

Results

Preoperatively, 98% of all patients participated in sports activities. Two years postoperatively, 98% of the patients participated in at least 1 sports activity. The level of sports activity decreased after surgery. The number of sports activities per patient decreased from 3.6 preoperatively to 3.2 postoperatively. Intermediate- and high-impact sports, especially tennis, soccer, jogging, squash, and volleyball, showed a significant decrease while the low-impact sports (stationary cycling, Nordic walking, and fitness/weight training) showed a significant increase. Physical activity level at the time of follow-up as measured by the Grimby scale was significantly higher than in the year before surgery. Duration of sports participation per week increased significantly after surgery. Men had a significantly higher sport level than women before and after surgery. Eighty-two percent felt no restriction while performing sports. One-third missed certain sports activities such as jogging, soccer, tennis, and downhill skiing. The Harris hip and Oxford scores showed a significant increase postoperatively.

Conclusion

The results of this short-term follow-up study show that sports activity after total hip resurfacing surgery is still possible. Physical activity level increased with a shift toward low-impact sports. Duration of sports participation increased. High-impact sports activities decreased. These findings can be important for the decision-making process for hip surgery and should be communicated to the patient.

### Sports activity after short-stem hip arthroplasty [^115EXaDV]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

No data are available about the sports activity of patients with bone-conserving short-stem hip implants.

Hypothesis

Patients can return to a good level of sports activity after implantation of a short-stem hip implant.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

The sports activity level of 68 patients (76 hips) after short-stem hip arthroplasty was assessed for a minimum of 2 years after implantation. In addition to the clinical examination, a detailed evaluation of the patients' sports pattern was obtained. Furthermore, the results were analyzed with regard to gender (female and male) and age (≤ 55 and > 55 years).

Results

After a mean of 2.7 years, patients showed a Harris Hip Score (HHS) of 93.6, a Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score of 9.5, and a University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score of 7.6, with each individual participating on average in 3.5 different disciplines after surgery compared with 3.9 before surgery. High-impact activities decreased significantly postoperatively, whereas low-impact activities increased significantly. The duration of the sports activities remained stable, while the frequency actually increased. In contrast, men participated preoperatively in more sports than women (4.3 men vs 3.3 women). However, because of a pronounced decrease in high-impact activities by men, both genders participated in an equal number of sports postoperatively (3.5 men vs 3.5 women). Finally, 45% (n = 31) reported at least one activity that they missed. Most of them were disciplines with an intermediate- or high-impact level.

Conclusion

Patients with a short-stem hip implant can return to a good level of activity postoperatively. Participation in sports almost reached similar levels as preoperatively but with a shift from high- to low-impact activities. This seems desirable from a surgeon's point of view but should also be communicated to the patient before hip replacement.

### Safe activity participation following elective total hip replacement: the SAFE-T investigation [^114PvzH6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Total hip replacement (THR) is one of the most common elective orthopaedic surgeries performed, with increasing demand among younger individuals. Few evidence-based guidelines exist on safe activity participation following THR, including whether high-intensity sport participation is safe for individuals. The purpose of this study was to identify if increased intensity of physical activity following THR was associated with increased activity-related pain and increased revision rates.

Methods

Two groups undergoing THR were recruited: preoperative (cohort 1) and 5–7 years postsurgery (cohort 2); both followed for 5 years. Activity was self-reported through validated questionnaires and grouped into categories from 'A' (low intensity, eg, aquafit) to 'F' (high intensity, eg, tennis). The primary outcome was the presence of hip pain during activity (binary variable, Y/N), measured by the association between hip pain and intensity of activity (categories A-F). Secondary outcomes included activity duration, revision rate or a change in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).

Results

1098 individuals were included in this study (cohort 1: n = 588, cohort 2: n = 510). Regression analysis showed no significant interaction between activity intensity and hip pain across all time points. Approximately 20.6% of all activity (11.0% of participants) occurred in the highest intensity categories (E and F); these subjects showed no decrease in activity duration, worsening PROMs or increased revision rates compared with lower intensity activity groups (all p > 0.05). When analysing by individual activities, certain activities (eg, snowboarding, squash, tennis and backpacking) were more correlated with hip pain (r > 0.60), while others (eg, snorkelling, swimming, home weights, aquafit, cross-country skiing and sledding) were less likely to have hip pain (r < -0.60).

Conclusions

This study showed that higher-intensity activities do not lead to decreased activity duration, worsening patient-reported outcomes or increased revision rates following THR, although certain activities may be associated with increased pain. These findings can inform patient counselling after THR.

### Does impact sport activity influence total hip arthroplasty durability? [^1169BnYC]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Return to sport is a key patient demand after hip arthroplasty and some patients are even involved in high-impact sports. Although polyethylene wear is related to the number of cycles and the importance of the load, it is unclear whether high-impact sport per se influences THA durability.

Questions/Purposes

Therefore, we compared (1) function between the patients involved in high-impact sports and the patients with lower activities as measured by the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS); (2) linear wear rates; and (3) survivorships considering revision for mechanical failure with radiographic signs of aseptic loosening as the end point.

Methods

We retrospectively identified 70 patients who engaged in high-impact sports and 140 with low activity levels from among 843 THAs from a prospectively collected database performed between September 1, 1995, and December 31, 2000. Patients were evaluated at a minimum followup of 10 years (mean, 11 years; range, 10–15 years) by two independent observers. We obtained a HHS and HOOS at each followup.

Results

The mean HOOS was higher in the high-impact group for three of the five subscales of the HOOS. Mean linear wear was higher in the high-impact group than in the low-activities group. We also found a higher number of revisions in the high-activity group.

Conclusions

Our observations confirm concern about the risk of THA mechanical failures related to high-impact sport, and patient and surgeons alike should be aware of these risks of mechanical failures.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^116QfR9Q]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for acetabular dysplasia — survivorship and return-to-sport outcomes from recent reviews include Twenty-four level IV studies (3471 patients, 3655 hips) with a mean follow-up of 54.2 months (range, 1–336 months) reporting a median survival time for a PAO of 16 years with a 10-year survivorship rate of 75.9% and a 20-year survivorship rate of 36.5%, and an athlete-focused review defining "competitive athlete" broadly as participation in any sport at any level from recreational to professional reported that Six level III and IV studies met inclusion criteria with a greater than 70% return-to-sport rate in these competitive athletes.

### Changes in sports activity after periacetabular osteotomy: a qualitative and quantitative analysis [^115w8wJp]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Reasons for changing sports can vary and go beyond hip disorders. It was previously shown that the main reason for a postoperative increase of sports activity after PAO was reduced hip pain. Previously identified reasons for a decrease of sports activity postoperatively were various. Persistent hip pain, continued concerns for preserving the hip joint, medical advice, and a change in life circumstances were mentioned. However, these analyses lack details on the specific sports and their practice.

In our cohort, 42% of the patients changed sports after PAO. Of the 14% of patients who started new sports postoperatively, about half reported resolution of preoperative symptoms to be the reason, while the other half started new sports to improve the hip function. Of the 28.4% of patients who had stopped sports, one-third indicated reasons unrelated to the operated hip joint, while the other two-thirds indicated persistent hip discomfort or reduced exercise tolerance of the hip. Only in 2 cases was a physician's recommendation given as the reason for discontinuing a sport.

It has been previously shown that high levels of athletic activity in patients with DDH lead to an earlier onset of hip symptoms. During the orthopaedic consultation, these very active patients are often initially recommended to exhaust nonoperative therapy, which includes adjusting sports activity. However, the question arises whether an adjustment of the activity level is also necessary after a successful PAO, with physiologic acetabular coverage ideally being achieved.

In a study by Hara et al,161 patients (183 hips) were investigated to determine whether exercise after PAO affected the progression of osteoarthritis at 100-month follow-up. It was found that higher activity did not cause progression of osteoarthritis. However, with a mean age of 42 years and a participation of 5% of the study population in high-impact sports, possible conclusions for active and very active patients seem limited here.

Overall, the evidence of the influence of high-impact sports on osteoarthritis progression after PAO is scarce, thus leading to a lack of uniform recommendations for sports after PAO.

This study had several limitations. First was the retrospective study design and potential recall bias in patients' responses to possible change of sport as well as sport frequency and duration. However, it can be assumed that patients remembered the changes in their sports activity in the relatively short follow-up. Second, the dropout in our cohort was relatively high. Nevertheless, the final study population was still relatively large compared with that in previous studies assessing athletic activity after PAO.

### Sports after hip resurfacing arthroplasty [^1139jBFL]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

No information is available concerning patients' sports activity after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.

Hypothesis

Patients treated by hip resurfacing arthroplasty will be able to achieve a high level of sports activity.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

We surveyed 112 patients by postal questionnaire to determine their sporting activities at a mean of 23.5 (range, 9–40) months after hip resurfacing surgery. Data were also analyzed separately for older and younger patients and women and men, respectively.

Results

Of 112 patients, 110 participated in an average of 4.6 sport disciplines after surgery, compared with 105 patients pre-operatively engaged in an average of 4.8 disciplines. About 26% performed sports 4 times per week or more — almost 60% for longer than 60 min at each session. A high proportion of our patients were still engaged in downhill skiing (51%) and in high-impact disciplines such as tennis (12%) or contact sports (22%). More than 50% of the patients commenced sports within the first 3 months after surgery. During activities, 70% were completely pain-free. The group of older patients (mean age, 60.2 years) participated in more different disciplines with a higher weekly frequency and longer session length than younger patients (mean age, 46.4 years).

Conclusion

The present study reports for the first time on the detailed sports activity and activity extent after hip resurfacing arthroplasty. Our patients could return to a high level of sports participation after surgery. Age-related differences were found that have not yet been published. Nevertheless, further follow-up is necessary to assess the influence of high-level activity on loosening and revision rates after hip resurfacing arthroplasty.

### Return to sports after total hip arthroplasty: an umbrella review for consensus guidelines [^112rwmZy]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current recommendations on safe return to sports (RTS) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) are subjective and based on studies of varying quality.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to synthesize systematic reviews and meta-analyses on post-THA RTS to propose practice guidelines identifying which sports can be resumed, when they can be resumed, and what risks are present.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

This umbrella review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) protocol and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases were searched. Included studies were either systematic reviews or meta-analyses addressing primary or secondary outcomes. Outcomes of interest included safe sports after THA, time to RTS, prognostic indicators of RTS, reasons patients do not RTS, percentage of patients who RTS, implant complications, and objective classification of sports by impact level. Included reviews had data extracted and were assessed for methodological quality using the JBI protocol. The authors defined RTS as "returning to a sport the patient participated in at any point preoperatively".

Results

Patients demonstrated a trend toward lower-impact sports postoperatively. Sports were classified as low (eg, walking), moderate (eg, downhill skiing), or high impact (eg, soccer). A total of 82% (range, 55%-104%) of patients were able to RTS at a mean time of 6 months (range, 4–7 months). The best prognostic indicator for RTS was previous experience in that sport. The main reason patients did not RTS was surgeon recommendation. Aseptic loosening was the most cited complication after RTS.

Conclusion

Most patients are able to return to preoperative levels of low- (eg, walking) and moderate-impact (eg, hiking) sports between 7 and 12 months after THA. Patients planning a return to high-impact (eg, singles tennis) sports should be counseled on the possible risks of traumatic injuries and aseptic loosening and monitored closely.

### Is there a difference in physical activity levels in patients before and up to one year after unilateral total hip replacement? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144LmFR]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Data extraction and critical appraisal

Data from all eligible articles were extracted using a data extraction table. The primary reviewer (TW) independently screened and extracted data from each eligible article. Following the independent screening and extraction from the primary reviewer, a second reviewer (SL) checked the screening and extraction for accuracy. Any disagreement in screening or data extraction were resolved through discussion. A third reviewer (TS) was not needed to adjudicate any disagreements, on this occasion there were no disagreements. Data extracted included: Number of participants, age, gender, indication for total hip replacement (e.g. osteoarthritis), physical activity measure and pre-/postoperative total hip replacement physical activity data. In the event of missing data, the corresponding authors were emailed and asked for further information.

All included studies were appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Cohort Study Checklist. This is a 12-item appraisal tool that has been previously used in rehabilitation research. An additional question (6c. Was the characteristics of excluded participants examined?) was incorporated to the appraisal tool, as this was considered specifically important to this review to better ascertain generalisability and acceptability of physical activity to the population. All included articles were independently assessed using this tool by one reviewer (TW), and verified by a second (SL). Any disagreements in critical appraisal assessment were resolved through discussion, if needed a third reviewer (TS) was available to resolve any disagreements.

Data synthesis and analysis

Heterogeneity was initially assessed by examining the data extraction tables by three reviewers (TW, AC, TS). When clinical homogeneity was assumed a meta-analysis was deemed appropriate. If clinical heterogeneity was evident, a narrative review of the evidence was undertaken.

For each meta-analyses, statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 and Chi 2 statistics. When I 2 was 20% or less and Chi 2 was less than p = 0.10, a fixed-effects model was adopted. When this was not satisfied, a random-effect model was used. All meta-analyses were assessed as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and presented using forest plots. To determine whether age was a potentially important variable for outcome, a subgroup analysis was undertaken to assess the levels of physical activity pre- vs. postoperatively, specifically for people aged 65 years or over. Analyses were undertaken using Review Manager software (Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer Program] Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).

### Surgeon recommendations for physical activity in patients with pediatric hip conditions [^1143KQti]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Respondents achieved the lowest average standardized consensus when asked if they would suggest restrictions on activity type, recommending restrictions approximately half of the time. This suggests greater concern about the kinds of activities that patients engage in, especially impact activities, as opposed to duration and intensity. Concerns regarding activity type may include increased risk of acute injuries to the hip with contact sports, as well as repetitive joint-loading with high impact and, to a lesser extent, weight-bearing activities, causing surgeons to limit participation in these activities. Certain impact sports have specifically been associated with an increased risk of hip osteoarthritis (OA) and cam deformity, albeit mainly in high-level male athletes. A recent study by Leopold et alfound a shift in DDH patients' PA behaviors after periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) — although activity levels increased with regard to frequency and duration, patients changed to more low-impact sports participation, suggesting shared concerns about such activities.

Another contentious topic among respondents was the relationship between PA and hip OA. While increased risk of hip OA progression has been observed in elite athletes, it is not consistently observed in individuals who engage in normal levels of PA, including those with existing joint pathology. In fact, PA is often encouraged as a therapeutic treatment for OA to improve symptoms and physical function. The benefits and drawbacks of PA may be complicated in hip patients, who are at greater risk of developing OA secondary to their condition. – Few studies have examined this relationship, with a single study by Hara et al, demonstrating that postoperative participation in sports after PAO has no effect on OA progression. In contrast, a study by Matheney et alfound that DDH patients with higher activity levels presented earlier for hip preservation surgery, suggesting that increased activity levels may lead to earlier presentation of arthrosis. However, it must be noted that many factors may lead a patient to seek surgery at earlier ages, with studies demonstrating a general trend toward decreasing age at presentation for total hip replacements over recent decades. Further investigation is needed to understand the long-term effects of preoperative and postoperative PA in this population and its potential dose-dependent effects on hip health.

### Are hip precautions necessary post total hip arthroplasty? A systematic review [^116YS48K]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common and effective treatment of hip osteoarthritis. Activity restrictions known as hip precautions are widely practiced in rehabilitation post THA, aiming to foster healing and prevent hip dislocation. The focused clinical question was: Does the application of hip precautions in patients post THA versus unrestricted activities significantly decrease the risk of prosthetic dislocation?

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials or cohort studies with a comparative group and minimum 6 months follow-up, with dislocation as an end point. Retrieved titles were assessed independently by 2 reviewers for inclusion and underwent standardized data extraction.

Results

Title search produced 80 potentially relevant articles. Five articles were retrieved for data extraction of which 2 met a prior eligibility criteria. No eligible studies were found that concerned posterior approaches to hip arthroplasty, so the results of this review concern only anterolateral approaches. Neither included study showed any benefit of hip precautions in preventing dislocation.

Conclusion

The rate of dislocation after anterolateral THA is low and is not improved by hip precautions. Hip precautions are associated with a slower return to activities, significant expense, and decreased patient satisfaction. Existing studies risk being compromised by a type II error, but a definitive study may be prohibitively large and expensive.

### Predictors of participation in sports after hip and knee arthroplasty [^1148kttv]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

While the primary objective of joint arthroplasty is to improve patient quality of life, pain, and function, younger active patients often demand a return to higher function that includes sporting activity. Knowledge of rates and predictors of return to sports will help inform expectations in patients anticipating return to sports after joint arthroplasty.

Questions/Purposes

We measured the rate of sports participation at 1 year using the UCLA activity score and explored 11 variables, including choice of procedure/prosthesis, that might predict return to a high level of sporting activity, when controlling for potential confounding variables.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 736 patients who underwent primary metal-on-polyethylene THA, metal-on-metal THA, hip resurfacing arthroplasty, revision THA, primary TKA, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and revision TKA between May 2005 and June 2007. We obtained UCLA activity scores on all patients; we defined high activity as a UCLA score of 7 or more. We evaluated patient demographics (age, sex, BMI, comorbidity), quality of life (WOMAC score, Oxford Hip Score, SF-12 score), and surgeon- and procedural/implant-specific variables to identify factors associated with postoperative activity score. Minimum followup was 11 months (mean, 12.1 months; range, 11–13 months).

Results

Preoperative UCLA activity score, age, male sex, and BMI predicted high activity scores. The type of operation and implant characteristics did not predict return to high activity sports.

Conclusions

Our data suggest patient-specific factors predict postoperative activity rather than factors specific to type of surgery, implant, or surgeon factors.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, prognostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### What sports are safe following total joint arthroplasty? An analysis of revision rates at a mean 5-year follow-up [^113abjrj]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite theoretical risks of fatigue wear, there is little empirical evidence correlating postoperative impact level from physical activity with failure rates following total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA). This study aimed to assess the relationship between the impact level from self-reported sports and physical activity participation and revision rates following primary arthroplasty.

Methods

A survey was conducted on recreational sports participation among primary elective THA and TKA patients from an urban, academic health system between June 1, 2011 and January 31, 2022. A total of 1,622 THA and 1,388 TKA respondents were included in the study. The survey was administered cross-sectionally at various time points, with a minimum follow-up of at least one year required for inclusion (THA - 5.3 years; TKA - 4.8 years post-operation on average). Patients were divided into four cohorts based on participation and intensity of the sport: no sports, low-impact sports, intermediate-impact sports, and high-impact sports. Descriptive comparisons were made to evaluate revision rates and mean time to follow-up among these groups in THA and TKA patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to assess 10-year implant survivability.

Results

Healthier and younger patients who underwent THA or TKA were significantly more likely to participate in intermediate- to high-impact sports and were found to have non-inferior revision rates compared to those who engaged in no sports or low-impact sports: THA (2.9 [no sports] versus 1.9 [low-impact] versus 1.6% [intermediate/high impact]), TKA (3.0 versus 1.6 versus 0.0%). When analyzing aseptic versus septic revisions separately, no notable patterns or differences were observed.

Conclusion

At a mean 5-year follow-up, healthier and younger patients who participated in intermediate- and high-impact physical activities had non-inferior revision rates as compared to patients who were less active. These findings offer guidance for clinicians when advising patients on the safe resumption of sports activities following total joint arthroplasty.

### Return to sports after joint preservation hip surgery [^116M3Z8S]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement results from a mismatch of congruency between the femoral head and the acetabulum. This condition is most common among young, active patients and may lead to pain, decreased quality of life, and inability to participate in athletics. Hip preservation surgery is widely performed is used as a definitive treatment option in athletes at all levels of competition. Athletes have reported high rates of return to play and satisfaction and expect rehabilitation to require approximately 4 to 6 months. This article provides an overview of femoroacetabular impingement, including diagnosis and treatment, with focus on athletes and return to play.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^114FK4y4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total hip arthroplasty offers relief and functional improvement, with the rate of direct anterior approach (DAA) increasing compared with the posterior approach (PA). This study aimed to assess the effect of surgical approach on return to recreational activity after total hip arthroplasty. Total hip arthroplasty performed for primary or posttraumatic osteoarthritis were identified; 100 DAA patients were matched with 100 PA patients on age, sex, diagnosis, and surgical year. Patients were mailed a recreational activity survey, Harris Hip Function, and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires. Two hundred surveys were mailed, 130 (65%) responded (66 DAA and 64 PA) and were included. The mean follow-up was 2.5 years for the DAA group and 2.3 years for the PA group (P = 0.256). Among DAA patients, 51% returned to activity within 6 months, compared with 44% of PA patients (P = 0.360). Among those who returned to activity, 71% in the DAA group tried their main presurgery sport, compared with 53% in the PA group (P = 0.019). Twenty-eight percent of DAA patients and 4% of PA patients reported the surgical approach influenced their return to activity (P = 0.001). Outcome scores were clinically similar between groups. Objective data did not favor one approach over the other.

### Sports participation after shoulder replacement surgery [^116mY3Cj]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Return to sports after total hip or knee replacement surgery has been extensively described. However, the return to general sporting activities after shoulder replacement surgery has not been well documented. With improved implant survivorship, patient expectation of function is high.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome and ability of patients returning to sports after shoulder replacement surgery.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Seventy-five patients (86 shoulder replacements) who participated in sports or recreational activities before surgery were followed for a minimum of 2 years. Their preoperative and postoperative sports participation and level of competition were assessed. The frequency of their activity, modifications in activity, and length of time it took to resume sports participation after the operation were all reviewed.

Results

The mean age at follow-up was 65.5 years (range, 24–88). The average follow-up was 3.7 years (range, 2–9.4). Sixty-four percent of the patients stated that one of the reasons they had the surgery performed was participation in sports. Thirty-four of 48 of these patients (71%) demonstrated an improvement in their ability to play their sport and 50% increased their frequency of participation postoperatively. Softball athletes demonstrated the least favorable return; only 2 of 10 patients returned. Swimming, tennis, and golf were the most popular sports; participants in these sports showed the most favorable improvement and actual return. The mean time to partial return to sports was 3.6 months, and 5.8 months to full participation.

Conclusion

Patients are able to successfully return to sports after shoulder arthroplasty. Many returned with improved performance and increased frequency in participation in a timely manner.

### Integrated care programmes for sport and work participation, performance of physical activities and quality of life among orthopaedic surgery patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117VyZJs]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Orthopaedic surgery, such as hip or knee arthroplasty, ACL surgery, hamstring or rotator cuff repair, is primarily aimed at reducing pain and improving joint function. Usual care for patients eligible for orthopaedic surgery typically consists of the surgical procedure as well as presurgery evaluations, pharmaceutical treatments and postsurgery clinical check-ups and rehabilitation including physical therapy. However, usual care of most patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery is rarely explicitly aimed at participation in daily activities such as sports and work (eg, returning to previous levels of participation). This can be seen in core outcome definitions for orthopaedic conditions in the knee and hip, backand upper extremities. This is remarkable given the importance of participation in sports and work for patients after orthopaedic surgery, especially for patients who are of working age for whom resumption of societal participation is an important treatment goal. Moreover, return to sports and work is typically delayed and/or not successful for many of these patients. For instance, patients undergoing joint replacement surgery considered advice regarding participation to be inconsistent and not tailored to their individual circumstances, which often left them with the feeling that they would have been able to recover sooner than what they had actually accomplished.

Societal participation is considered of primary importance for orthopaedic surgery patients. Here, societal participation is both the performance of and the participation in daily activities such as sports and work. Participation in daily activities such as sports and work is highly relevant for many orthopaedic surgery patients in the general population, as inability to participate in society is accompanied by a significant impact on patients' quality of life (QoL), general and mental health. In addition, apart from the medical costs associated with surgery, the economic burden largely consists of indirect costs such as work productivity loss due to absenteeism. In line with this evidence, and in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), activities and participation are thought of as a complex interplay between body functions and structures, personal and environmental factors, and health.

### Periacetabular osteotomy in athletes with symptomatic hip dysplasia allows for participation in low-, moderate-, and high-impact sports, with greater than 70% return to sport for competitive athletes: a systematic review [^113k6yWK]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To systematically review the literature and report the rate of return to sport (RTS) in athletes following periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for symptomatic hip dysplasia.

Methods

A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for clinical studies reporting on athletes undergoing PAO surgery for symptomatic hip dysplasia. A quality assessment was performed using the Methodological Index of Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) grading system. Data collection included study characteristics, demographics, radiographic measurements, rate and timing of RTS, baseline and most recent patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and subsequent surgeries.

Results

Six studies met inclusion criteria with 341 patients undergoing PAO. There were 2 level III and 4 level IV studies, with an average MINORS score of 11. Preoperative and postoperative lateral center edge angles ranged from 8° to 18° and 23° to 41.3°, respectively. One study reported solely on dancers with a 63% rate of RTS at 1 year postoperatively. Two other studies reported RTS of 80% and 82% for multiple sports, with slightly lower rates (73% and 78%) in competitive athletes. Three studies demonstrated a comparable distribution of sports participation, from the preoperative to postoperative period, in low-impact (61.4% to 72.1% and 63.7% to 85.7%), moderate-impact (10.3% to 21.0% and 4.3% to 25.4%), and high-impact (8.5% to 17.6% and 5.1% to 10.8%) sports. Three studies reported time to RTS after PAO, ranging from 8.8 to 12.8 months. Of the 3 studies noting reasons for not returning to sport, concerns related to the operative hip ranged from 36.4% to 67%. Of the studies that reported both preoperative and postoperative PROs, improvements in all values were observed, with modified Harris Hip Scores and Hip Disability Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores at most recent follow-up ranging from 81 to 95 and 72 to 93, respectively.

Conclusions

In athletes with symptomatic hip dysplasia undergoing PAO, postoperative participation in low-, moderate-, and high-impact sports was observed, with greater than 70% RTS for competitive athletes. These findings suggest that PAO, with appropriate indications, is an efficacious treatment option in this active patient population with severe dysplasia.

### Athletic activity after lower limb arthroplasty: a systematic review of current evidence [^115QTi5e]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, our aim was to explore whether or not patients are able to return to athletic activity following lower limb joint replacement. We also investigated any evidence as to whether participation in athletic activity post-joint replacement increases complications and reduces implant survival. A PubMed, Embase and Sports Discus search was performed using the MeSH terms 'Sport', 'Athletic', 'Athlete', 'Physical', 'Activity', 'Arthroplasty', 'Total Hip Replacement', 'Hip Resurfacing', 'Total Knee Replacement', 'Unicompartmental Knee Replacement' and 'Unicondylar Knee Replacement'. From this search, duplications were excluded, the remaining abstracts were reviewed and any unrelated to the search terms were excluded. The remaining abstracts had their full papers reviewed. Following joint replacement, participation in sporting activity is common principally determined by pre-operative patient activity levels, BMI and patient age. The type of joint replaced is of less significance. Total time spent performing activity does not change but tends to be at a lower intensity. There is little evidence in the literature of an association between high activity levels and early implant failure.

### Effects of physical activity on long-term survivorship after metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty: is it safe to return to sports? [^114suu4N]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

In previous studies, we identified multiple factors influencing the survivorship of hip resurfacing arthroplasties (HRAs), such as initial anatomical conditions and surgical technique. In addition, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score presents a ceiling effect, so a better quantification of activity is important to determine which activities may be advisable or detrimental to the recovered patient. We aimed to determine the effect of specific groups of sporting activities on the survivorship free of aseptic failure of a large series of HRA.

Patients and Methods

A total of 661 patients (806 hips) representing 77% of a consecutive series of patients treated with metal-on-metal hybrid HRA answered a survey to determine the types and amounts of sporting activities they regularly participated in. There were 462 male patients (70%) and 199 female patients (30%). Their mean age at the time of surgery was 51.9 years (14 to 78). Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.5 kg/m 2 (16.7 to 46.5). Activities were regrouped into 17 categories based on general analogies between these activities. Scores for typical frequency and duration of the sessions were used to quantify the patients' overall time spent engaging in sporting activities. Impact and cycle scores were computed. Multivariable models were used.

Results

We found no association between any category of activity and a decrease in survivorship. Impact and hip cycle scores also failed to show any association with revision for aseptic failure or wear.

Conclusion

Return to sporting activities after surgery is safe for patients treated with well-designed and well-implanted HRA. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2019;101-B:1186–1191.

### Running activity after hip resurfacing arthroplasty: a prospective study [^117A3dxS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The ability to return to sports activities (especially running) after hip resurfacing arthroplasty seems to be very important for young and active patients who have developed osteoarthritis.

Purpose

To assess the quality of return to sports after hip resurfacing arthroplasty by examining the time spent running, weekly mileage, and the possibility of returning to competition in a series of patients.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

A prospective, consecutive series of 202 patients (215 hip resurfacings) was assessed to evaluate the possible resumption of running activity (time spent, weekly mileage, return to competition). Of this initial cohort, 40 patients (43 resurfacings, 21%) practiced running preoperatively. Mean age at hip resurfacing arthroplasty was 50.7 years (range, 31–61 years). No patients underwent revision surgery. A questionnaire was administered to assess the number, type, and level of sports activities. Among patients who practiced running, we determined, preoperatively and at last follow-up, their weekly mileage and whether they were competitors.

Results

At last follow-up, 33 of 40 patients (36/43 hips) still practiced running (P = .74), with 91.6% of them resuming running. Mean average recovery time before running at a level assessed as good by patients was 16.4 weeks (range, 5–36 weeks). The number of patients running more than 4 hours per week increased from 18 to 23. Similarly, the time devoted to running at last follow-up remained high (mean, 3.1 hours per week) with no statistically significant difference from the preoperative period (P = .54). Moreover, patients were still engaged in competition without statistical difference between the 2 periods (P = .82).

Conclusion

Running is possible after hip resurfacing, and runners can even return to some level of competition, but this short follow-up series of hip resurfacing in athletes should be interpreted with caution regarding implant survival.

### Return to athletic activity after total hip arthroplasty. consensus guidelines based on a survey of the hip society and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons [^112ZhoVU]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2007). Low credibility.

A web-based survey was developed to evaluate joint arthroplasty surgeon's preferences for the return to sporting activities after total hip arthroplasty. This survey listed 30 groups of activities (37 specific sports) and was sent to all members of the Hip Society and American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. All surgeons were asked to grade each activity as follows: allow, allow with experience, not allowed, or undecided. Results were computed using a power analysis, Z test, and chi(2) test to determine statistical significance. There were a total of 549 responses giving an overall response rate of 72%, with 93% (92/99) of the Hip Society members and 72% (522/727) of American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons members responding to the survey. Consensus guidelines and postoperative timing for the return to specific activities are presented.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^111n1jDL]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The effect of surgical approach on THA outcome is controversial. Several studies compared PA and DAA in regards to functional recovery. DAA seems to result in earlier discontinuation of gait aids, increased steps per day, and less pain and narcotic requirements. Validated outcome measurements including Harris Hip Score (HHS), HOOS, Western Ontario and McMasters Universities osteoarthritis index have been reported in randomized controlled trials comparing DAA and PA. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) study by Zhao et alfound improved HHS scores at 3 months with DAA. In a recent retrospective study, Graves et aldemonstrated no significant difference in University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score between DAA and PA, but a slight transient improvement favoring DAA in Physical Rand−12 scoring. In a meta-analysis by Wang et al, DAA resulted in higher HHS and lower VAS at 2 and 4 weeks. These differences disappear three to six months postoperatively. In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Higgins et al, nine studies comparing DAA and PA approach THA were analyzed for functional outcome measures. Four of the nine studies had outcomes favorable to DAA and the other five were not significantly different. Some have attributed early improved postoperative recovery to less tissue damage; however, Meneghini et alfound that both approaches had notable tissue damage.

To our knowledge, there has been no study directly evaluating the effect of surgical approach on return to recreational activities. Traditional measures of functional outcome such as the Harris Hip Score and HOOS Jr. are not sensitive to higher levels of activity and may have ceiling effects that do not effectively measure functional differences that allow for participation in recreational activities. Although recreational profiles have been performed on patients undergoing THA, none have compared the types of activities performed postoperatively based on surgical approach.

Finally, a notable difference was observed in patients' perception of whether the surgical approach affected their return to activity after the THA (28% in the DAA group vs 4% in the PA group). This difference may be indicative of selection bias. HH-F and HOOS Jr. scores were clinically similar in the two groups, but more patients having a DAA believed that surgical approach was an important variable in their outcome. Although difficult to study, the effect of patient perception of the surgical procedure, independent of objective and subjective outcome measure, is intriguing and may be worthy of further study.

### The relationship of sporting activity and implant survivorship after hip resurfacing [^111MiEhy]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of sports on the durability of the prosthesis after hip resurfacing has not been studied, to our knowledge. The purpose of this study was to correlate sporting activity levels calculated as Impact and Cycle Scores with the survivorship of the hip resurfacing implants.

Methods

Four hundred and forty-five patients were surveyed from one to five years after surgery. The mean age of the patients was 48.7 years, and 74% were men. The Impact and Cycle Score included two scores: an Impact Score and a Hip Cycle Score. All patients were also evaluated with the University of California at Los Angeles activity score. Twenty-three patients (twenty-seven hips) underwent revision surgery after they had completed the survey.

Results

The mean duration of follow-up at the time of survey data collection was 1.9 years (range, 1.0 to 4.9 years), and the mean follow-up period was 10.2 years (range, 6.1 to 13.7 years). The mean Impact Score was 28.1 (range, 0 to 128), and the mean Hip Cycle Score was 33 (range, 0 to 144). Positive correlations were found between the University of California Los Angeles activity score and the Impact Score (r = 0.535) or Hip Cycle Score (r = 0.497). After adjustment for femoral component size, body mass index, and femoral defect size, a 10-point increment in Impact Score corresponded to a 37% increase (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 1.59) in the risk of revision arthroplasty, while a 10-point increment in the Hip Cycle Score increased the risk of revision by 22% (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.41). Patients with an Impact Score of < 50 had a risk of revision 3.8 times lower (hazard ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 8.9) than that of the patients with an Impact Score of ≥ 50, with a survivorship rate at eight years of 96.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.6% to 98.0%) compared with 88.8% (95% confidence interval, 74.7% to 95.3%). We found no association between the University of California at Los Angeles activity score and the survivorship of the implants.

Conclusions

High levels of sporting activities can be detrimental to the long-term success of hip resurfacing devices, independently from other risk factors. Patients seeking hip resurfacing are usually young and should limit their involvement in sports to levels that the implant construct will be able to tolerate.

### Sports participation in patients with hip dysplasia before and up to 20 years after periacetabular osteotomy [^1132makS]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic hip dysplasia in skeletally mature, young patients is often treated with periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). While studies have focused on radiographic and pain-related outcomes, evidence on sports participation is limited.

Purpose

To determine the proportion of patients who (1) participate in sports, (2) perform their preferred sports, and (3) report improved sports performance after PAO and to investigate if preoperative patient characteristics could predict these outcomes during the first 5 years after PAO.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

This cohort study investigated self-reported sports function in patients who underwent PAO using prospectively collected data from an institutional database. Eligible patients had undergone PAO and responded to at least 1 question related to sports participation. Patients reported on sports participation, ability to perform preferred sports, and improvements in sports performance before PAO as well as at 6 months and 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after PAO.

Results

Of 2398 patients surveyed, 1891 were eligible for inclusion. Of the respondents at each time point, 45% reported participating in sports before PAO, and 56% and 60% reported sports participation at 6 months and 2 years after PAO, respectively. Being sports active, having a higher educational level, and having a low pain level before PAO were associated with higher odds of participating in sports after PAO. An improvement in sports function was reported by 56% of the respondents at 6 months and by 61% at 2 years after PAO, and the ability to perform preferred sports was reported by 41% at 6 months and by 63% at 15 years. Time, a higher educational level, and a good quality of life score were associated with higher odds of performing preferred sports after PAO.

Conclusion

Up to 62% of patients who underwent PAO for hip dysplasia participated in sports after PAO. Over half reported improved sports performance and eventually participated in their preferred sports. Being sports active or having a better pain score before PAO was predictive of participating in sports, while a high quality of life score was predictive of performing preferred sports.

### No differences in midterm sports participation or functional scores after total hip arthroplasty by posterolateral Vs anterolateral approach [^114FCnTQ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) frequently question surgeons on return to sports. We compared midterm sports participation and functional scores after THA by posterolateral approach (PLA) vs anterolateral approach (ALA).

Methods

Of 1381 patients who underwent uncemented ceramic-on-ceramic THA for primary osteoarthritis, 503 were excluded because of preoperative or postoperative lower limb surgery, leaving 594 operated by PLA and 284 by ALA. Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Oxford Hip Score (OHS), satisfaction, as well as motivation, participation, and discomfort regarding 22 sports were collected. A 1:1 matching was performed to obtain 2 groups of PLA and ALA patients with similar age, gender, body mass index, and sports motivation.

Results

Matching yielded 2 equal groups of 259 patients. There were no significant differences in FJS (P = .057), OHS (P = .685), satisfaction (P = .369), or rates of participation in light (P = .999), moderate (P = .632), or strenuous sports (P = .284). Participation in strenuous sports was reported by 50 PLA (19%) and 61 ALA (24%) patients, with differences for downhill skiing (22 vs 39), running (10 vs 19), and cross-country skiing (18 vs 10). More than 50% of motivated patients practiced most of their sports. Severe discomfort was reported similarly in PLA and ALA patients, mainly during running (13 vs 11), team ball games (9 vs 7), and downhill skiing (7 vs 8).

Conclusion

There were no significant differences between PLA and ALA patients in terms of OHS, FJS, satisfaction, or sports participation rates. There is little or no evidence to promote an approach based on sports participation or functional improvement.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, comparative study.

### What are young patients doing after hip reconstruction? [^115NMykR]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2012). Low credibility.

We assessed primary hip arthroplasty patients younger than 50 years in terms of activity and function. We hypothesized that young patients are more active than previously thought. Physician activity recommendations were compared with patient-reported participation levels in activities. Sixty-one patients (65.3%) were reached by telephone. Average age was 43.18 years; body mass index, 29.46. "Recommended activities" increased by 33%. High-Activity Arthroplasty Score and University of California at Los Angeles scores were 11.69 and 6.87, respectively. Patients were 98% satisfied with their postoperative function, and 95% would redo the procedure. Activities stopped due to fear of injury (29%), physician recommendation (26%), hip pain (14%), early fatigue (17%), and decreased interest (14%). The average period to postoperative survey administration was 30.06 months (range, 10–81 months). Postoperative recommendations for the young total hip arthroplasty patient should be a balance between joint prosthesis preservation and regular activity participation.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^112oYeb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths, limitations and impact on clinical practice

Several sport disciplines in this study have not been investigated previously. Limitations of the study are the low number of participants in some sport disciplines, shorter follow-up of female athletes, and the lack of and THA's before 1987. The width of the CIs, for example, in figure 4, shows the uncertainty and low statistical power of our estimates in sports with few athletes. History of injury and occupation are two unmeasured potential confounders. Recall and response bias may have influenced the original data collection. The RHR estimates are subject to built-in selection bias and should be interpreted with care. The relatively low number of THAs prevents a sensible subanalysis on different causes of receiving the THA. Furthermore, the mechanisms leading to THA for elite athletes can be multiple and complex, rendering the surgeon-reported cause of THA of minor interest in this study. We have used hip as the unit and adjusted for clustering of hips within individual in the analyses. We consider this to strengthen the analyses, since athletes in sport disciplines with a high risk may have bilateral THAs, which both will be included in the analyses. Still, it is important to take multiple observations per individual into account in the analyses. We found deviations for the proportionality for impact and BMI for males, thus care should be taken in the interpretation of these regression coefficients.

Our findings are primarily generalisable to elite athletes of northern European origin, as the cohort of former Norwegian world-class athletes includes athletes with participation in international competitions or finishing top three in national competitions. However, all athletes of approximately the same training and competition history (eg, serious youth athletes, athletes on high national levels) may be thought to have a similar risk, even if they did not reach the medal podium. The results are less generalisable to leisure time exercisers.

We recommend that elite athletes are targeted for hip OA prevention efforts. For males, this is more important for athletes from the high joint impact sport disciplines than the low joint impact sport disciplines. Further studies are needed to determine the accurate risk of sport disciplines other than male handball, football and cross-country skiing, and to determine why former elite male handball athletes have such a high risk. With the expected increase of OA in the coming decades, further studies to answer these questions should be feasible.

### Allowed activities after primary total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty [^113xbium]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

It is essential for total knee arthroplasty patients to return to their previous level of activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This article reviews the current recommendations regarding return to physical activity after total knee arthroplasty and trying to find the balance between levels of activity and prosthetic joint preservation. In general, most total joint replacement patients are able to return to their previous level of activity and to a lesser extent to sports. This article discuss patients' actual levels of activity including their return to work and sport and the factors that influence meeting their expectations for surgery.

### Athletic activity after joint replacement [^1177FYpN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The first decade of the 21st century has been declared the "Bone and Joint Decade" by 35 nations and 44 states in the United States as of March 2001. It is not surprising that Americans are interested in musculoskeletal disease and the treatment of bone and joint disorders because our population is aging, the prevalence of arthritic joints is increasing, and senior Americans are demonstrating a strong desire to stay active in activities of daily living and athletics. One of the most successful treatments for painful arthritic joints, which limit activity, is total joint replacement, which predictably relieves pain and improves function. Much has been written about the technical aspects of total joint arthroplasty. Less has been written about safe and appropriate activities for patients who have had joint replacement operations. This article evaluates athletic activity after joint replacement by reviewing the orthopaedic literature and surveying members of The Hip Society, The Knee Society, and The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Society. The authors have developed consensus recommendations for appropriate athletic activity for patients who have had joint replacement operations. This article is intended to serve as a guide for orthopaedic surgeons and primary care physicians who give patients recommendations for athletic activity after joint replacement. This article is also intended to stimulate further research in the area of athletic activity after total joint arthroplasty.

Policy recommendation

No consensus was achieved in the first round. The panel was generally divided between allowing members to perform the tasks without restriction and allowing only screened members to perform them. The steering committee then reformulated the question based on comments from round 1 and additional discussions with experts (box 1). In round 2, the experts reached a consensus in favour of allowing CAF members with a THA to perform all 10 tasks under the conditions outlined in box 1.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^117RWALp]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Results of Recreational Activity Survey

Patients were asked to list up to five recreational activities. We included any activity that would be considered "capable of achieving a result requiring physical exertion and/or physical skill". The total number of recreational activities reported from the DAA group was 122 compared with 81 in the PA group (Table 3). This suggested a more active recreational profile for those who received the DAA compared with PA. Low-impact activities were more common in both cohorts.

Table 3
Types of Recreational Activities Reported

Walking was the most common recreation in both cohorts (40% in the DAA group and 32% in the PA group). Exercise classes such as jazzercise or boot camp were found to be the most common high-impact activity in both groups.

### Reliable improvements in participation in low-impact sports following implantation of a patellofemoral inlay arthroplasty at mid-term follow-up [^1153Z8hc]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study was that PFIA leads to a subjective improvement of knee function enabling a high return to sports rate of 94% in the successfully treated patients and 76% of the entire patient cohort including failures. The statistical improvement of all measured clinical and activity scores corresponds with an improved subjective ability to perform low-impact sports, as well as a higher frequency of sport sessions and level of sports postoperatively. Our secondary hypothesis was rejected, as we were not able to detect factors that predict the postoperative ability to perform sportive activities in a statistically significant manner.

While the results of this study underscore the positive effect of the treatment and comprehensively document the consequential improvement of activity and return to sports, the extent of improvement remains limited. Though the results produced in our study are of substantial clinical interest, the minimal clinically relevant difference for the WOMAC score of 15 points determined in a validation study in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was not surpassed with a preoperative-to-postoperative delta of 10 in our transformed WOMAC results and the smallest detectable difference of 1.16 point in the Tegner activity scores was narrowly missed with a preoperative-to-postoperative delta of 1.13 point in our results. Furthermore, a complete liberation from pain according to the VAS pain scale could not be achieved across the patient cohort by the surgery, observing persistent pain with a median intensity of two points. This is noteworthy, as pain was identified to be the most common barrier to return to sports after arthroplasty of the lower extremity, according to a large retrospective study by Wylde et al. While Tegner activity scale results range below the average of 5.7 established for a healthy population of comparable age, the average patient treated with PFIA is able to participate in low-impact sports such as jogging on even ground twice a week, as well as cycling and cross country skiing, as correlated to a Tegner scale of 4. This may realistically reflect the sportive demands of the average patellofemoral OA patient, who has been limited in the participation of pivot and contact sports due to the severity of the primary knee injury for years prior to surgery. Nevertheless, these results have to be considered, when preoperatively discussing realistic outcomes of PFIA with more competitive athletes suffering from patellofemoral OA. Furthermore, our patient collective is not involved in high-impact sports (Table 3). However — while this may require preoperative expectation management of young and active patients — it reflects the general clinical guidelines for sports participation after knee arthroplasty. After patellofemoral arthroplasty, only sports with a moderate risk profile for secondary implant damage — characterized by low direct impact and low extensor loads — are recommended. Furthermore, the results need to be put into perspective for the active patient: While 94% of the non-failing patients returned to an equal or higher level of sports after PFIA treatment, only 74% reported an improved subjective sporting ability.

### Return to sports after total hip arthroplasty: a survey among members of the European Hip Society [^113yLTFN]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The study's aim was to summarize the recommendations given by members of the European Hip Society (EHS) regarding sport activities after total hip arthroplasty (THA).

Methods

Members of the EHS were invited to complete an online web-based questionnaire including recommendations for 47 sports disciplines. The questions regarding the specific sports were also divided into 4 subcategories: "allowed", "allowed when experienced", "not allowed", and "no opinion". Four intervals for resuming the sports activities after THA were evaluated: within 6 weeks after THA, 6 to 12 weeks after THA, 12 weeks to 6 months after THA, and more than 6 months after THA. Consensus on resuming sports was analyzed.

Results

A total of 150 (32.9%) EHS members participated in the survey. Agreement was found for 5 sports activities in the first 6 weeks after THA, for 10 activities, 6 to 12 weeks after surgery, for 26 activities, 3 to 6 months after THA, and for 37 of 47 activities, 6 months after surgery. Sports activities which were not allowed after THA were handball, soccer and football, basketball, full contact sports, and martial arts.

Conclusion

This is the first report describing the recommendations of European hip arthroplasty surgeons on resuming sport activity after THA. Most physical activities were allowed for the patients 6 months after THA. The experience of the patient in performing a distinct sport activity did not influence the recommendations to return to former sports activities. European surgeons are progressively mitigating restrictions to sports after THA. Further studies should evaluate the effects of this trend on patients' outcome and implant survival.

### Mountain sports and total hip arthroplasty: a case report and review of mountaineering with total hip arthroplasty [^115ws48j]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Participation in certain sports after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is common. Some high-risk sports such as extreme endurance sports with risks of falls and fractures are often cautioned against, except when the sport was participated in preoperatively and an excellent physical condition is present postoperatively. In this article, current concepts pertaining to this issue in general and in relation to mountain sports are discussed after a description of the activities of a 69-year-old patient who received cementless bilateral THAs in 1987 and 1995 and who resumed, after each rehabilitation, his preoperative sports practice (eg, walking and high-altitude mountaineering [6000+ m]). The patient, who was experienced in alpine and high-altitude mountaineering, was able, after his first operation, to climb classic alpine peaks (4000+ m) as well as participate in difficult and strenuous climbs outside Europe (Kilimanjaro, Elbrus, and Rolwaling trekking). After the second operation and an intensive rehabilitation program, he was able to climb 2 mountains in the range of 6000+ m. With excellent physical training, a long preoperative practice of the sport, and an intensive and careful rehabilitation, patients with a THA are, under specific circumstances, able to perform mountaineering at a very high, even professional level without signs of prosthesis loosening or higher than normal wear of the bearing materials.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^115hK2vh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 130 (65%) patients responded to the custom survey and were included in the study. Of the 130 THA, 66 were DAA and 64 were PA. The follow-up duration was similar between the DAA and PA groups (Table 1). The American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status classification scores and body mass index (BMI) were captured from the arthroplasty database. Preoperative HH-F scores and HOOS Jr. were also captured from the database. The ASA was graded one or two in 75.4% of patients and slightly favored the DAA group. BMI differed between groups (24.6 in DAA vs 27.0 in PA; P = 0.006).

Table 1
Patient Demographics and Outcome Scores

HH-F and HOOS Jr. scores are presented in Table 1. No statistically significant difference was noted in preoperative HH-F scores between the two groups; however, the PA group started at a slightly lower level than the anterior group (28.2 and 30.9, respectively). Postoperative HH-F scores were slightly higher for the DAA group compared with the PA group (42.4 and 41.0, respectively; P = 0.048). The change in HH-F scores was not different between the two groups. Preoperative, postoperative, and change HOOS Jr. scores were similar between groups.

Seven recreation-related questions were included in the survey (Appendix). Six months after the THA, 51% of patients in the DAA group returned to recreational activities compared with 44% of patients in the PA group (P = 0.360). Twenty-six percent of patients in the DAA group and 39% of patients in the PA group did not return to sport after surgery at any time point (P = 0.102). Among those who did return to activity after the THA, 71% of patients in the DAA group responded that they had attempted their main presurgery sport compared with 53% of patients in the PA group (P = 0.019) (Table 2). Twenty-eight percent of patients in the DAA group and 4% of patients in the PA group reported that the surgical approach influenced their return to sport (P = 0.001).

### Evaluation of exercise interventions and outcomes after hip arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114USbEQ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

A key theme for further research should be the identification of potential subgroups who might gain an advantage by supervised group or individual outpatient rehabilitation. Of further interest is the assessment of digital or internet-based interventions (eg, smartphone apps) regarding cost-effectiveness compared with standard face-to-face interventions. Another area of interest is the comparison of different forms of exercise therapy with each other to determine a potentially superior mode of exercise training for rehabilitation. However, given the current paucity of literature, pairwise meta-analyses may be limited in drawing such conclusions. Network meta-analysis may be more suitable for determining potentially superior modes of exercise training and have recently gained traction in the field of sports medicine. Studies should focus on strong methodological rigor and larger sample sizes reduce the risk of bias and increase the certainty in observations. To ensure a low risk of bias, placebo- or sham-controlled trials should be considered. Furthermore, the studies should follow current guidelines for intervention description (eg, the template for intervention description and replication checklist) to enable transparent evaluation and replication of intervention programs and should report factors potentially influencing the findings (eg, comorbidities and pain management). Moreover, reporting of adverse events needs to be strictly implemented, as this was lacking in approximately two-thirds of all included trials.

The strengths of our study include the overall assessment of preoperative and postoperative exercise intervention to give a concise overview of the whole rehabilitation process for total hip arthroplasty. Furthermore, we included a number of potential outcomes, as opposed to only pain or physical function. We also only combined studies that included hip arthroplasty, rather than those that included other joint replacements (eg, knee arthroplasty). Statistical sensitivity analyses were conducted to further check the robustness and validity of the results.

### Can we identify why athletes fail to return to sport after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156Aa7H]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

No previous systematic review has focused on the athletes who fail to return to sport after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS).

Purpose

To review the literature on the athletes who fail to return to sport after hip arthroscopy for FAIS to determine the rate of nonreturning athletes and explore the reasons for their inability to return to sport after arthroscopic FAI surgery.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Three electronic databases were searched for eligible articles. Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles using prespecified criteria. Eligible articles were those that clearly stated the rate of athletes who did not return to sport after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. Data collected were the rate of patients who did not return to sport, the level of competition (high level, recreational, or mixed), the type of sport, comments on patients who did not return to sport, the rate of subsequent hip surgeries (total hip replacement or revision hip arthroscopy) in nonreturning athletes, and the reported reason for not returning to sport. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty studies were eligible for inclusion, and 1093 athletes were analyzed. The weighted rate of athletes who did not return to sport after hip arthroscopy for FAIS was 12.1% (95% CI, 7.7–17.4). Only 2 studies (2/20;10%) reported the age of the athletes who did not return, while sex was reported in 3 studies (3/20;15%). The estimated proportion of athletes who did not return to sport because of hip-related issues was significantly greater than the percentage of athletes who did not return for reasons unrelated to their hip (74.3% vs 22.3%; P < .0001). Persistent hip pain was the most commonly reported factor (52/110 patients; 47.2%) associated with failure to return to sport. Whether the nonreturning athletes underwent any subsequent hip procedure after hip arthroscopy for FAIS was reported in only 4 out of 20 studies (20%). There was evidence of publication bias and study heterogeneity.

Conclusion

The estimated rate of athletes who did not return to sport after hip arthroscopy for FAIS was 12%, with the majority of athletes being unable to return because of persistent hip pain. There is a severe lack of evidence on the athlete characteristics and clinical course of the nonreturning athletes, and the rate of subsequent hip procedures is unknown. The outcomes and reasons for athletes not returning to sport should be reported in detail to improve patient care.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^116VmRmh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has some important limitations. Selection bias was possible in that the decision on which approach to use was made using a shared decision-making model. In this approach, the patient's opinions and desires are incorporated into the surgeon's decision regarding what approach might provide the lowest risk and best chance of a favorable outcome. In this model, central obesity as evidence by a large pannus, or complex anatomy or deformity might favor the use of the PA over DAA. Owing to factors such as direct to consumer marketing, patients often perceive that the direct anterior approach results in more rapid rehabilitation and higher levels of function, even when this has not been supported by peer-reviewed literature. Surgeons may often use this perception to leverage patients' "belief" in their surgical outcome, creating a placebo effect of sorts.

It is also possible that the two groups were different populations. Although patient characteristics were remarkably similar in almost every demographic variable including ASA classification as an indicator of medical comorbidities (Table 1), a statistical difference was noted in BMI that could confound the study finding. We note that although the PA group had a statistically higher BMI than the DAA group (24.6 vs 27), this difference, although statistically different, was not necessarily a clinically important difference and often represent differences in muscle mass rather than the levels of obesity. In this study, both groups had similar preoperative hip function and activity scores despite differences in BMI. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that BMI may play a role in activity levels of patients, regardless of the medical or surgical intervention being studied.

### Factors influencing early rehabilitation after THA: a systematic review [^111jttYF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A wide variation exists in rehabilitation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) in part due to a paucity of evidence-based literature. We asked whether a minimally invasive surgical approach, a multimodal approach to pain control with revised anesthesia protocols, hip restrictions, or preoperative physiotherapy achieved a faster rehabilitation and improved immediate short-term outcome. We conducted a systematic review of 16 level I and II studies after a strategy-based search of English literature on OVID Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases. We defined the endpoint of assessment as independent ambulation and ability to perform activities of daily living. Literature supports the use of a multimodal pain control to improve patient compliance in accelerated rehabilitation. Multimodal pain control with revised anesthesia protocols and accelerated rehabilitation speeds recovery after minimally invasive THA compared to the standard approach THA, but a smaller incision length or minimally invasive approach does not demonstrably improve the short-term outcome. Available studies justify no hip restrictions following an anterolateral approach but none have examined the question for a posterior approach. Preoperative physiotherapy may facilitate faster postoperative functional recovery but multicenter and well-designed prospective randomized studies with outcome measures are necessary to confirm its efficacy.

### Systematic exposure in revision total hip arthroplasty: the posterior approach [^111rTnXz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

As indications for total hip arthroplasty (THA) continue to expand, and patients continue to live longer with more active lifestyles, the incidence of revision THA is expected to rise. General orthopaedic surgeons are now beginning to consider doing revision THA surgery because of the increased revision burden being experienced nationwide. While classical approaches to the hip can be used for simple revisions, extensile exposure techniques in conjunction with selective soft-tissue releases are often required for adequate visualization for more complex revision cases. This review provides a systematic approach to surgical exposure for revision THA using the posterior approach. The surgeon should follow a stepwise progression to obtain safe, adequate, and reproducible visualization of both the acetabulum and the proximal femur.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^1155gtPd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings and interpretation

At present, this is the most extensive study on this topic so far, due to a high number of participants, female representation, a longitudinal design and the large number of sport disciplines represented. Overall, having been an elite athlete was associated with a doubled risk of THA when compared with the general population, both for female and male athletes. Female athletes had the highest absolute risk, but males had the highest relative risk (risk increase) when compared with the respective female and male general population. Approximately 1 in 9 former elite female athletes and 1 in 12 former elite male athletes received THA, compared with approximately 1 in 16 females and 1 in 26 males of the general population. As elite athletes represent the highest healthy segment of a population, their elevated risk of THA may be thought as remarkable.

### What factors affect posterior dislocation distance in THA? [^1156pFQ6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dislocation remains common after total hip arthroplasty. Efforts have been made to identify and minimize risk factors. One such factor, jump distance, or the distance the femoral head must travel before dislocating, has been poorly characterized with respect to three-dimensional kinematics.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore determined: (1) the three-dimensional stability of four different component designs; (2) whether the degree of abduction and anteversion affects the stability; (3) whether pelvic inclination angles affected stability; and (4) which combination of these three factors had the greatest stability.

Methods

We created a positionable three-dimensional model of a THA. Acetabular components were modeled in various abduction and anteversion angles and in two different pelvic inclinations which simulate standing and chair-rising activities.

Results

The posterior horizontal dislocation distance increased as inclination angle and femoral head size increased. The 48-mm resurfacing typically had lower jump distances and was at risk of posterior edge loading at 30° inclination. The highest jump distance for all positions and activities occurred with the dual-mobility bearing.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that monoblock cups require extremely accurate positioning for low dislocation risk and that pelvic orientation may increase dislocation risks.

Clinical Relevance

As a result of the dual-mobility designs having the greatest resistance to dislocation, these cups may be appropriate for patients who are at risk for dislocation in difficult primary situations and in revision hip arthroplasty procedures in which proper component orientation may be less likely to be achieved.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^115cX2KR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participant data linkage

The included cohort of former Norwegian world-class athletesconsisted of athletes from 51 different sport disciplines, who had represented Norway in international championships or been ranked top three in domestic championships from 1936 through 2006. In 2006, the athletes received an invitation letter with a questionnaire, including a request for consent to participate in the cohort. Of the 3427 athletes, 3386 consented to participating in further studies on lifestyle disease.

The NAR was established in September 1987 and contains data on all THAs in Norway, with a 98% completeness of reporting. On 31 October 2020 by applying the unique 11-digit identity number of Norwegian citizens, we linked the elite athletes to the NAR for information on THA. On the same date, we also obtained data on death and emigration through from the National Population Register of Norway.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^116wXLWH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing DAA and PA surgical approaches in total hip arthroplasty regarding patient-reported return to recreational activity. Several novel findings were present within these data. The results of the recreational activity questionnaire were statistically favorable toward DAA THA in two questions and trending toward DAA in the others. HH-F and HOOS Jr. scores did not clinically favor one surgical approach over the other. This may be related to the ceiling effect of the HH as noted by Wamper et alThe HOOS Jr. does not have ceiling limitations of HHbut may not be sensitive enough to detect a difference in recreational activities. The HOOS sport and recreation subscore may be a more useful outcome measure for these data. In a study of TKA patients, Steinhoff et al evaluated the use of the KOOS and found it was more sensitive and had less ceiling effects than the Knee Society score. A similar study has not been performed in the hip. The sport and recreational activity questionnaire used in this study has not been validated, which is a weakness, but given the lack of a detailed and validated tool, we believe a customized activity questionnaire was appropriate for the purposes of this study. A 65% response rate was obtained for the survey. The 35% who did not respond may have been because of the patient changing addresses or not wanting to participate. There was an equal response rate between anterior and posterior approaches.

### Golf after total hip and knee arthroplasty: getting back into the swing [^111NC4hW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Golf is a popular sport with an estimated 60 million participants worldwide. The sport remains popular among older adults, including those with a total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) because of the low-moderate intensity of the activity. Accordingly, golfers who are contemplating undergoing THA or TKA are interested in the rate of return to play, outcomes, and limitations after surgery. The factors affecting return to golf are numerous, including patient-specific factors and biomechanical changes in the hip and knee affecting the golf swing. Specifically, younger age, male sex, and lower body mass index are independent predictors of return to golf. Furthermore, changes in leg length, alignment, and implant type/position can also affect function and play. Despite these factors, golfing patients routinely demonstrate successful return to their sport with less pain and improved mobility after THA and TKA. A comprehensive preoperative evaluation, expectation setting to return to any recreational activity, patient-specific surgical planning, and a functional rehabilitation program can provide optimal outcomes in those wishing to return to golf after total joint arthroplasty.

### Is posterior hip instability associated with cam and pincer deformity? [^1125psZr]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior hip instability is an increasingly recognized injury in athletes; however, the function of patients after these injuries and an understanding of the pathoanatomy and underlying mechanism are currently unclear.

Questions/Purposes

We determined (1) the function of patients after these hip injuries using validated, self-reported outcome instruments and (2) the specific pathoanatomy sustained in these events to better understand the mechanism of posterior hip instability.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all 22 athletes presenting to our clinics with a posterior acetabular rim fracture confirming a posterior hip instability episode. Radiograph, CT, and MRI findings were documented in all patients. Intraoperative findings were recorded in patients undergoing surgery. There were 19 males and three females with an average age of 22 years (range, 13–31 years). Minimum followup was 2 years (average, 4 years; range, 2–16 years).

Results

The mean modified Harris hip score was 94, Hip Outcome Scores for Activities of Daily Living and Sport were 99 and 87, respectively, and 20 of 22 athletes returned to sport. The most common constellation of pathoanatomy was a posterior labral tear with rim fracture, anterior labral tear, capsular tear, ligamentum teres avulsion, and chondral injury of the femoral head with loose bodies. Sixteen of the 18 patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) had a twisting or noncontact mechanism of injury.

Conclusions

When posterior hip subluxation is recognized and avascular necrosis avoided, these athletes generally have high functional outcome scores and high rates of return to sport. There is an apparent association between the occurrence of posterior hip instability and the presence of structural abnormalities often associated with FAI, which may contribute to a mechanism of FAI-induced posterior subluxation.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^113gwxEx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline — post–total hip arthroplasty (THA) physical therapy emphasizes that exercise, mobility, and physical activity "should be a part of postoperative care, regardless of the manner in which it is implemented". Cost considerations note that "there is a cost associated with supervised physical therapy", but these are "a relatively small portion of the total course of peri- and postoperative care", and feasibility has "no major concerns". Acceptability reflects that "structured physical therapy is commonly prescribed for patients after THA", although "some stakeholders may have concerns that there is no guidance as to which patients are likely to have equivalent outcomes with unsupervised exercise after total hip arthroplasty (THA)". Evidence and research needs are described as "mixed, showing either a benefit to physical therapy or no difference when compared to unsupervised home exercise", with "future research… warranted" to clarify benefits, to include individualized and progressive programs with "both short- and long-term performance-based and self-reported measures", and to identify "which patients are likely to succeed without formal physical therapy".

### Hip resurfacing in an 88-year-old patient? Highlighting selection criteria for hip resurfacings in patients older than 65 years [^114dfrpu]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2009). Low credibility.

The success of hip resurfacings in the older population is still to be determined, although it has been an attractive option in the much younger patients with arthrosis of the hip. We present a 95-year-old active, independent patient who underwent a Birmingham hip resurfacing at 88 years of age. More than 7 years after surgery, the original components are still in situ, and the patient is pain-free with a very active lifestyle at the age of 95 years. Hip resurfacings are not without risks, and we highlight the evolution of strict selection criteria for patients older than 65 years who may be suitable candidates for hip resurfacing arthroplasty.

### Similar rate of return to sports activity between posterior-stabilised and cruciate-retaining primary total knee arthroplasty in young and active patient [^111ZMds4]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study certainly has limitations. The lack of randomised allocation increases the risk of selection bias. The lack of blinding of patients and assessors increases the risk of detection and attrition biases. However, we must point out that randomisation and blinding in elective surgery is not well accepted by patients and surgeon alike. General health measures were not considered for analysis and the investigations have been conducted irrespective of the aetiology of osteoarthritis (idiopathic, osteonecrosis, dysplasia, trauma). The patients were enrolled irrespective of the level and league of sport practiced; although this may impact the reliability of the present study, we remark that all patients performed sport at the recreational level and none at elite or competition level. At our institution we retained the patella as standard; whether patellar resurfacing affects the clinical outcome has not been fully clarified.

The study setting is a high-volume, tertiary referral hospital, so our findings may not be generalisable to institutions where TKAs are not performed as frequently. Moreover, this study followed patients for only 3 years post-surgically; however, patient activity levels may change beyond this period.

Finally, the time to return to sport was not assessed, which could have provided additional value to the results of the present investigation. These findings help to manage patient expectations. In particular, for young and active patients with knee osteoarthritis, both the CR and PS implants can be considered safe procedures which allow a high return to sports activity in the midterm.

These findings inform shared decision-making and can help to manage patient expectations after surgery. In particular, in young active patients with or without the PCL, both CR and PS implants should be considered the gold standard in total knee replacement surgery with a high level of return to sports activity.

### Changes in sports activity after periacetabular osteotomy: a qualitative and quantitative analysis [^112YFTUM]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Patients undergoing periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip are usually young and active with high functional demands. Those who participate in sports seek surgical therapy to resume or maintain sports activities. There is little evidence regarding the postoperative level of activity and the extent to which sports activity changes after PAO both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Purpose:

The aim of this study was to determine the change in activity level as measured using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score and the changes in qualitative and quantitative sports activity.

Study Design:

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods:

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 123 hips in 111 patients who underwent PAO for developmental dysplasia of the hip between January 2015 and June 2017. UCLA activity score, International Hip Outcome Tool 12, and Subjective Hip Value, as well as practiced sports, frequency and duration of sports activity, and time to return to sports, were assessed. Eventual changes in practiced sports and reasons for those changes were recorded.

Results:

Of the participating patients, 85% were female and 15% were male. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 27.7 ± 7.3 years. Mean follow-up was 63 ± 10 months. UCLA score (5.08 ± 2.44 vs 6.95 ± 1.74; P < .001), International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (41.4 ± 22.2 vs 72.6 ± 22.9; P < .001), and Subjective Hip Value (42.8 ± 24.3 vs 80.4 ± 17.8; P < .001) increased significantly from pre- to postoperatively. Significantly more patients participated in low-impact sports postoperatively (31.7% vs 52%; p = 0.001). Participation in high-impact sports decreased (42.3% vs 36.6%; p = 0.361). The overall sports activity rate increased significantly (78.8% vs 90.8%; p = 0.008). Quantitatively, sports frequency in times per week (P < .001) as well as length of exercise per time (P = .007) increased significantly. A total of 52 patients (42%) changed sports activities postoperatively. Of these, 35 (28.4%) reported having stopped previously practiced sports after surgery, while 17 (13.8%) reported having started new sports. Reasons for starting and stopping certain sports varied and included hip- and non–hip related ones. In only 2 cases was physician's advice given as a reason for changing the sport.

Conclusion:

Patients can improve their sports activity both qualitatively and quantitatively after PAO. However, a relevant proportion of patients adjusts their sports activities for a variety of hip-related and non–hip related reasons.

### Direct anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty improves the likelihood of return to previous recreational activities compared with posterior approach [^113ZpVCS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Our institutional review board approved joint arthroplasty database was used to identify 145 consecutive primary THA using the DAA between 2015 and 2018 by a single surgeon (WDB). The surgeon began using anterior approach approximately 4 years before data review for this study. No patients within the first year (approx. 50 cases) of DAA were included in this study to avoid learning curve bias. Patients undergoing revision arthroplasty were excluded. Decision to perform DAA or PA was up to the surgeon's discretion using a shared decision-making process with the patient. DAA THA were matched 1:1 with PA THA performed by the same surgeon during the same period, based on age (± 2 years), sex, diagnosis, and year of surgery. Implant geometry was up to the discretion of the surgeon. The surgeon prefers the use of size 32 mm or larger femoral heads, based on compatibility with the acetabular implant. The diagnosis for all patients was either primary or posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Enhanced recovery protocols were used with patients ambulating on the day of surgery. Postoperative pain management was identical between the two groups. Patients who had an intraoperative complication or underwent a revision arthroplasty during the follow-up period were excluded. DAA and PA surgeries were performed using consistent methods for soft-tissue handling and technical protocols. A minimum of one-year follow-up was required. A custom survey (Appendix,) was developed to analyze return to recreational activity, based on a previous study with osteochondral allografts. The custom survey, along with the Harris Hip Function (HH-F) survey and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Joint Replacement (HOOS Jr.), was mailed to 100 DAA and 100 PA patients. A second mailing to the same patients was performed if there was no response within 2 months.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary management of osteoarthritis of the hip [^114pFtZ6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Exposure approach — total hip arthroplasty for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip: High quality evidence supports that there are specific risks and benefits to each surgical approach and that there is not a preferred surgical approach for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Quality of Evidence is High and Strength of Recommendation is Moderate★★★ (Downgraded), with evidence from two or more "High" quality studies and a downgrade based on the EtD framework. Each surgical approach is associated with specific risks and benefits, including that a posterior approach is associated with an increased risk of dislocation and an anterior approach associated with an increased risk of wound complications. The decision to use a specific approach should be based on a surgeon's training and experience and should be individualized to each patient, with patient–surgeon informed decision-making about risks and benefits. No studies specifically addressed associated costs and resource utilization; the approach does not incur any direct costs, some approaches may require special instrumentation or equipment associated with an increase in cost, and comparative cost-effectiveness data are limited. This recommendation should be readily implemented as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice, and a variety of approaches are utilized in total hip arthroplasty.

### Return to competitive level of play and performance in regular golfers after total hip arthroplasty: analysis of 599 patients at minimum 2-year follow-up [^113SLkR6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is performed in an increasingly younger and athletic population. Regular and competitive golfers are concerned with the likelihood of recovering their preoperative level of play. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of primary THA on golfers' game, with a minimum follow-up of two years.

Methods

Questionnaires were sent to the French Golf Federation's golfing members. Those who were older than 40 years and had undergone a unilateral primary THA provided information on the timing of return to play, pain during golfing, transportation mode, drive length, handicap and weekly playtime, before hip replacement, and postoperatively. In addition, data relating to the surgical procedure were collected.

Results

Surveys were completed by 883 competitive golfers of which 599 were eligible for inclusion. The mean time to return to a complete 18-hole course was 4.73 months (SD 4.15, range: 0.7–36). Participants surveyed at a minimum 2 years after THA played at a higher level than before surgery with a handicap improvement of 1.8 (P < .01) and increased their mean weekly playtime from 8.8 to 9.3 hours (P = .24, NS). Eighty-eight percent reported an increased or no change in drive distance. Hip pain while playing golf decreased after surgery (6.8 to 2.5 on the visual analog scale, P < .001).

Conclusion

This study highlighted that hip arthroplasty allowed regular and competitive golfers to return to the course with better golfing comfort than before surgery and with an objective improvement in driving distance and level of play.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^116KUCac]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the 11th highest contributor to disability. Joint replacement surgery may be the final result of severe, symptomatic and long-term OA. The indications for total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgery vary, but typically include pain, loss of function, radiological changes and failed conservative therapy (mainly exercise and pharmacological treatment). In the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register (NAR), the reason for surgery is reported as idiopathic OA in 74.1% and trauma sequelae (secondary OA) in 7.7% of cases. With an increasing prevalence of OA, knowledge on potential modifiable risk factors for OA development is vital. High age and female sex are known unmodifiable risk factors for hip OA. Established modifiable risk factors include increased body mass index (BMI) at a young age, injuryand occupation. Further hip joint specific risk factors include acetabular dysplasiaand the bony morphological variants of cam morphology, the latter with higher incidence among athletes than among the general population.

Physical activity, including elite athletic activity, has been regarded as a potential modifiable risk factor, though study findings are inconclusive. Biomechanical modelling suggests that moderate mechanical loading is necessary for cartilage homeostasis, supported by clinical studies showing cartilage thinning in spinal cord-injured individuals. In vitro studies on explant models indicate that cyclic, intermittent cartilage loading stimulates chondrocyte metabolism. Another hypothesis is that muscle weakness plays a role in the pathogenesis of OA, and evidence shows that exercise therapy is beneficial in the early management. Surprisingly, leisure time physical activity, defined as the amount of leisure time being physically active, including commuting to and from work, may increase the risk of receiving arthroplasty. Heavy manual work has also been associated with increased prevalence of OAand an increased risk of early THA revision. Preliminary evidence also suggests that tactical personnel (firefighters, military service and veteran parachutists) have a greater incidence and prevalence of OA.

### Similar rate of return to sports activity between posterior-stabilised and cruciate-retaining primary total knee arthroplasty in young and active patient [^112Mraxe]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No difference was reported between the CR and PS implants in activity PROMs, ROM, weekly hours dedicated to sport, and the rate of return to sport at approximately five years of follow-up in active adults. The same endpoints demonstrated no difference between younger and older patients or men and women. No statistically significant difference in implant survivorship according to the Kaplan–Meier curve has been evidenced.

### Outcomes after primary hip arthroscopy in athletes older than 40 years compared with nonathletes [^115io9NF]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Master athletes (MAs), or athletes older than 40 years, make up a patient population whose outcomes after primary arthroscopic hip surgery are largely unknown.

Purpose

To report minimum 2-year outcomes of MAs after primary hip arthroscopy and compare their results to a propensity-matched nonathlete (NA) control group.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected between February 2008 and April 2019 and retrospectively reviewed for all patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy. Patients were included if they were older than 40 years and had preoperative data for the modified Harris Hip Score, Nonarthritic Hip Score, Hip Outcome Score-Sports Specific Subscale, and visual analog scale score for pain. MAs reported participating in organized sports competition within 1 year before surgery and were propensity matched to a control group of patients who did not report participating in organized sports competition (NAs). Patient characteristics, radiographic and intraoperative findings, surgical procedures performed, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were reported and compared between the groups. The rates of achieving the minimal clinically important difference and maximum outcome improvement satisfaction threshold were recorded.

Results

A total of 366 hips were eligible; 328 (89.6%) had adequate follow-up data. 328 patients met inclusion criteria but 88 were not included due to the restrictions of the propensity score match ratio. Of these, 80 hips (76 patients) were classified as MAs (mean age, 48.9 ± 6.2 years) and were propensity matched 1:2 to an NA control group. Groups were comparable for baseline demographic and radiographic parameters, intraoperative findings, and procedures performed. MAs had significantly better baseline and minimum 2-year PROM scores (P < .05), higher satisfaction (P = .01), and higher rates of achieving clinically meaningful improvement across all the outcome tools used (P < .05). MAs, when compared with NAs, had lower rates of secondary arthroscopy (0% vs 7.5%, respectively; p = 0.001) and conversion to total hip arthroplasty (12.5% vs 26.9%, respectively; p = 0.011).

Conclusion

MAs demonstrated favorable outcomes after primary hip arthroscopy. When compared with a propensity score-matched control group of NA patients, MAs demonstrated better preoperative and postoperative PROMs, higher rates of clinically meaningful improvement, and lower rates of secondary arthroscopy and conversion to total hip arthroplasty. Absolute improvements in PROM scores were similar between the groups.

### Changes in sports activity after periacetabular osteotomy: a qualitative and quantitative analysis [^111VxDgb]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip are usually young and active with high functional demands. Those who participate in sports seek surgical therapy to resume or maintain sports activities. There is little evidence regarding the postoperative level of activity and the extent to which sports activity changes after PAO both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the change in activity level as measured using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score and the changes in qualitative and quantitative sports activity.

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 123 hips in 111 patients who underwent PAO for developmental dysplasia of the hip between January 2015 and June 2017. UCLA activity score, International Hip Outcome Tool 12, and Subjective Hip Value, as well as practiced sports, frequency and duration of sports activity, and time to return to sports, were assessed. Eventual changes in practiced sports and reasons for those changes were recorded.

Results

Of the participating patients, 85% were female and 15% were male. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 27.7 ± 7.3 years. Mean follow-up was 63 ± 10 months. UCLA score (5.08 ± 2.44 vs 6.95 ± 1.74; P < .001), International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (41.4 ± 22.2 vs 72.6 ± 22.9; P < .001), and Subjective Hip Value (42.8 ± 24.3 vs 80.4 ± 17.8; P < .001) increased significantly from pre- to postoperatively. Significantly more patients participated in low-impact sports postoperatively (31.7% vs 52%; p = 0.001). Participation in high-impact sports decreased (42.3% vs 36.6%; p = 0.361). The overall sports activity rate increased significantly (78.8% vs 90.8%; p = 0.008). Quantitatively, sports frequency in times per week (P < .001) as well as length of exercise per time (P = .007) increased significantly. A total of 52 patients (42%) changed sports activities postoperatively. Of these, 35 (28.4%) reported having stopped previously practiced sports after surgery, while 17 (13.8%) reported having started new sports. Reasons for starting and stopping certain sports varied and included hip- and non-hip related ones. In only 2 cases was physician's advice given as a reason for changing the sport.

Conclusion

Patients can improve their sports activity both qualitatively and quantitatively after PAO. However, a relevant proportion of patients adjusts their sports activities for a variety of hip-related and non-hip related reasons.

### Sports participation 25 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective longitudinal study comparing patients with patellar tendon and hamstring tendon grafting to uninjured controls [^114fQ9m9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals who have sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury often describe returning to sports as a primary reason for choosing ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with postoperative rehabilitation over rehabilitation alone. However, according to 1 systematic review and meta-analysis, only 55% of those who undergo ACLR return to their preinjury level of sports.

Evidence of post-ACLR sports participation is clouded by inconsistencies in the definition of sports level between different measures. For example, return-to-sports (RTS) measures have been defined variably as return to either preinjury sports, competitive sports, pivoting sports, or overall sports activity, or according to the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Sport and Recreation sub-score or the mean Tegner score. In addition, as highlighted by Lindanger et al, some measures do not necessarily capture the extra challenges posed by competitive levels of sports participation, which include higher speeds over greater distances and increased accelerations and decelerations, while others incorporate work and other nonsporting factors into their classification. Regardless, it is a common belief among researchers and clinicians that ACL injury will limit long-term participation in sports, even if the ACL is reconstructed.12

Conclusion

A panel of arthroplasty experts concluded, based on video analysis, that CAF fitness evaluations are generally safe for members with a THA. In addition, we defined criteria to minimise the risk of injury. Our findings apply narrowly to annual fitness evaluations; broader occupational safety considerations are trade specific and require further analysis.

### Sports participation in patients after total hip arthroplasty vs periacetabular osteotomy: a propensity score-matched Asian cohort study [^112swUBq]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

No studies have compared sports participation between total hip arthroplasty (THA) and periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) in matched Asian cohorts. We investigated sports participation and activity levels in Asian THA cohort, and compared them between THA and PAO cohorts.

Methods

Multivariate analyses were applied to determine which factors were associated with postoperative sports participation and University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score in (1) 524 THA patients and (2) 487 acetabular dysplasia patients (295 THA patients and 192 PAO patients). In addition, postoperative sports participation and UCLA score were compared between 62 THA and 62 PAO patients after adjusting for baseline characteristics with propensity score matching.

Results

Sports participation and UCLA score significantly increased after THA (P < .001 in both analyses). Preoperative sports participation was the factor most associated with both postoperative sports participation and UCLA score in both 524 THA patients and 487 acetabular dysplasia patients (P < .001 in all analyses). Multivariate analysis in 487 acetabular dysplasia patients demonstrated that THA, compared with PAO, was negatively associated with postoperative sports participation (P < .001), but not postoperative UCLA score (P = .22). THA patients showed significantly lower rate of postoperative sports participation (32.3% and 51.6%, respectively, P = .046), but not postoperative UCLA score (5.0 ± 1.6 and 5.2 ± 1.9, respectively, P = .47) compared with matched PAO patients.

Conclusion

THA significantly increased both sports participation and activity levels. Both multivariate and propensity score-matched analyses showed that postoperative activity levels were comparable between THA and PAO cohorts.

### Integrated care programmes for sport and work participation, performance of physical activities and quality of life among orthopaedic surgery patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115gmn3s]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Quantitative analysis

Nine studies with n = 1158 patients could be pooled in a meta-analysis (table 2). Findings showed overall small significant effects (scale 0–100) of the intervention, when compared with the control group; short term (2.62 (95%CI 1.16 to 4.08); I² = 17%) and long term (5.05 (95%CI 2.64 to 7.46); I² = 53%) (figure 4). A single study showed a non-significant small short-term effect of active referral as single component (2.87 (95%CI −3.84 to 9.58)); three studies reported on intervention elements of e/mHealth, reporting significant short-term (1.98 (95%CI 1.38 to 2.58); I² = 0%) and long-term (3.52 (95%CI 1.62 to 5.41); I² = 0%) effects (online supplementary material 9). Three studies reported on a multicomponent intervention, showing significant short-term (5.13 (95%CI 2.33 to 7.90); I² = 0%) and long-term (7.76 (95%CI 5.02 to 10.51); I² = 0%) effects. Three studies reported on patients undergoing surgery to their back, reporting significant short-term (2.04 (95%CI 1.44 to 2.64); I² = 0%) and long-term (5.22 (95%CI 2.18 to 8.26); I² = 51%) effects (online supplementary material 10). Two studies reported on effects of patients undergoing hip surgery, significant at short term (5.49 (95%CI 2.36 to 8.61); I² = 0%) and non-significant at long term (4.37 (95%CI −1.58 to 10.31); I² = 76%). Two studies reported on patients undergoing knee surgery with a non-significant short-term effect: 0.62 (95%CI −3.55 to 4.79); I² = 0%. One study reported on patients undergoing surgery to their upper extremities also with a non-significant short-term effect: 1.48 (95%CI −5.60 to 8.56).

### Return to golfing activity after joint arthroplasty [^115TRP36]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients who are considering total joint arthroplasty, including hip, knee, and shoulder replacement, are concerned with their likelihood of returning to golf postoperatively as well as the effect that surgery will have on their game.

Purpose

To review the existing literature on patients who have undergone major joint arthroplasty (hip, knee, and shoulder), to examine the effects of surgery on performance in golf, and to provide surgeon recommendations as related to participation in golf after surgery. A brief review of the history and biomechanics of the golf swing is also provided.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature in the online Medline database, evaluating articles that contained the terms "golf" and "arthroplasty". Additionally, a web-based search evaluating clinical practice recommendations after joint arthroplasty was performed. The research was reviewed, and objective and anecdotal guidelines were formulated.

Results

Total joint arthroplasty provided an improvement in pain during golfing activity, and most patients were able to return to sport with variable improvements in sport-specific outcomes.

Conclusion

In counseling patients regarding the return to golf after joint arthroplasty, it is our opinion, on the basis of our experience and those reported from others in the literature, that golfers undergoing total hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty can safely return to sport.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^113Z3AR7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Participation in certain sport disciplines, or categories of sport disciplines, have been associated with a higher prevalence of hip and knee OA. A study of former National Football League players found that OA prevalence depended on field position. A 2017 systematic review investigated the risk of hip OA in male elite athletes and found a fivefold increase in risk for handball players; but also identified a paucity of data on female athletes. Another systematic review, from 2016, concluded that elite sport participation increased the risk for OA, but that the evidence was weak. Study design limits the conclusions that can be drawn from these reviews with many case–control or cross-sectional studies included. Evidence from a small number of longitudinal studies show an increased risk of OA with increasing levels of activity.

Clifford and Mallon created a joint impact classification based on a literature review and their clinical experience, and it has since been applied to compare OA risk across sports. Some data suggest that high joint impact sport disciplines increase the risk of developing hip OA, apart from long-distance running. One study, on male athletes only, found an increased risk of receiving an arthroplasty after high joint impact sports participation (soccer, handball, hockey).

Robsahm et al established a cohort of 3428 former Norwegian world-class athletes to study their risk for cancer compared with the Norwegian population and between sport disciplines. This large cohort provides an ideal opportunity to clarify the relationship between hip health and participation in a variety of elite sport disciplines. We linked this cohort of former athletes with a national register of all patients receiving THA. We aimed to investigate the influence of elite athletic activity on THA risk later in life. Our hypothesis is that elite athletic activity increases the risk of receiving a THA later in life.

### What sport activity levels are achieved in patients after resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction for a proximal femur bone sarcoma? [^1133KtsV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Ollivier et al. reported that higher activity levels led to risk of implant failure and lower implant survivorship. In this current study nine of 16 patients developed complications during their postoperative period and had revision surgery. Apart from a possible relationship of high activity and cup loosening (failure Type II) as well as mechanical disconnection of a module and loosening of the cone at another time (failure Type III), with the numbers of patients we had, we could not demonstrate an obvious sports-related association with prosthetic failures. Two patients were continuously practicing alpine skiing and did not shown negative effects on acetabular and femoral components so far, but with a larger number of patients and longer followup, it may be shown that a correlation does exist. Similarly, the patients who took up playing golf after hip arthroplasty may also not lead to higher revision rates after hip arthroplasty, but we do not have a sufficient number of patients playing golf to know if the same is true for patients with tumor.

Our data can show that patients after tumor megaprostheses of the proximal femur can regularly play moderate sports and that long time periods are required to recover and adjust after operations of this magnitude but can reach comparable levels to patients after elective hip surgery after 5 years. However, the fact that patients can participate in sports with these implants does not mean that they should do so. Future studies will need to evaluate carefully–in the context of more complete, longer term followup of larger groups of patients–the degree to which sports participation might influence implant durability. With the numbers we had, we could not identify patient-specific factors predicting postoperative activity nor a relationship between type of surgery, implant, or surgical factors and activity levels. Sport activities may be an important part of some young persons' lives, especially in a world of growing emphasis on mobility. Endoprosthetic implants for elective joint surgery attempt to adapt these requirements. Our data in this young cohort of patients suggest that there is a desire to participate in sports activities as reflected in the high number of patients participating in sports at 5-year followup, but this may not be true for all populations, cultures, or specific patients. With the numbers of patients we had, we could not show that sports was related to revision in survivors; however, failures resulting from higher activity levels with further followup cannot be excluded.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^116oNjkw]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data preparation

The main independent variable of interest related to the risk of receiving a THA in our study was sport discipline. In addition, the joint impact classification (table 1), was applied to categorise sport disciplines in subgroups. We considered sport disciplines not included in the classification as 'unclassified'. Age, sex and adolescent BMI (weight and height at age 20 was obtained from the questionnaire) was adjusted for in the analyses.

Table 1
Sport disciplines represented in the cohort of Norwegian world-class athletes and their category of joint impact after the classification of Clifford and Mallon

The cohort of former Norwegian world-class athletes established by Robsahm was used to identify elite athletes in the NAR. From the questionnaire, age of first national or international competition, age of retirement from athletic carrier and anthropometric measures were obtained. The hips of the athletes were followed in NAR until age of receiving a primary THA, age of death emigration, or age at 31 October 2020 (end of follow-up), whichever occurred first. For athletes who retired from active sport before 1 September 1987, we used their age on 1 September 1987 as age at start of follow-up. Death, emigration and end of follow-up were considered censored observations. If the first registered THA was a revision surgery (removing or replacing a previous THA), the follow-up was censored at the age of the revision. The follow-up period, and hence age, for the athletes started at establishment of the NAR (1 September 1987); data on athletes retired before this date were analysed as left-truncated. The athletes may experience bilateral THAs; hence, hip was considered as the unit of observation, resulting in two records per athlete. Median age of follow-up was calculated according to Schemper and Smith.

### Effect of knee arthroplasty on sports participation and activity levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Yyb36]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The incline in surgical procedures, the increased desires and expectations of patients to continue participation in sports activities, and the well-established positive impact of exercise on experienced quality of life, urge the need for evidence-based guidelines on sport participation after KA. As a first step to improve our insights on this topic, the present review aimed to systematically evaluate the available scientific literature on the effect of KA procedures on sports participation and activity levels after the rehabilitation period. Three research questions have been formulated in order to fully elucidate the aim of this review: (1) how does sports participation and activity level change from 1 year prior to knee replacement surgery (Pre-KA) to at least more than 1 year post-knee arthroplasty (Post-KA)? (2) How does sports participation and activity level change from before the onset of restricting symptoms (Pre-ORS) to within 1 year pre-surgery (Pre-KA)? (3) How does sports participation and activity level change from Pre-ORS to at least more than 1 year Post-KA? For each research question, we will look into the effect of KA in general, as well as evaluate the effect of UKA and TKA procedures in specific, on sports participation and activity levels. We hypothesise KA will have a positive effect on sports participation and activity levels compared with the situation from within 1-year presurgery, in particular in patients who remain active until close before surgery. In comparison to Pre-ORS, we expect participation in low-impact sports to increase after KA, while we expect participation in high-impact sports to decrease. In addition, we expect sport participation to be higher after UKA in comparison to TKA.

### Functional patient-reported outcome measures after hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and content analysis using the international classification of functioning, disability, and health [^11713fZS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that some tools (eg, HOOS and KOOS) were not originally developed for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, modification of these PROMs based on aspects that are deemed important by patients after arthroplasty could be beneficial. On the other hand, some of the included PROMs that were specifically developed for hip or knee arthroplasty (eg, Oxford Knee Score and the 12‐item HOOS) also did not address some core aspects of activity and participation. Therefore, clinicians and researchers aiming to fully assess these categories should prioritize PROMs that cover them. Alternatively, researchers with expertise in instrument development may choose to modify existing PROMs or develop new ones if no instruments currently address categories of interest. In addition, some PROMs with limited activity and participation coverage, such as the Marx scale and OARS, focus only on specific domains. In contrast, those with broader coverage, such as KOOS, 2011 KSS‐A, and HOOS, contain items across more activity and participation components. The extent of activity and participation coverage does not indicate superiority or inferiority of PROMs. Different PROMs, whether focusing on specific or broader aspects of activity and participation, may be suitable depending on their alignments with the intended purpose.

Some PROM items cover more than one concept of activity and participation, increasing the complexity of the item, which could potentially impact its interpretation from the patient's perspective. For example, one item of the 2011 KSS‐A, "How much does your knee bother you during hobbies (eg, distance walking, gardening, cycling, swimming, etc)?" encompasses four distinct concepts. This complexity may pose challenges for patients in understanding and selecting an appropriate response, particularly if they experience difficulty in some activities while having no trouble with others. In addition, some wording could lead to challenges in interpreting the item, particularly the concepts that fail to distinguish between changing and maintaining body position. For example, an item in 2011 KSS concerning squatting could be interpreted as either "squatting" or "maintaining a squatting position". Another instance involves an item from PAQ‐knee, "Please rate your degree of satisfaction with your ability to use your knee", which lacks adequate information because of the phrase "ability to use". Therefore, PROMs containing a high number of items with multiple concepts or concepts that are not addressed adequately may not yield accurate results.

### Five-year outcomes after arthroscopic surgery for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome in elite athletes [^114G7bH2]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Consecutive elite athletes undergoing arthroscopic treatment for FAIS between November 2011 and December 2012 were followed prospectively for 5 years. Patients were treated at 2 hospitals by 3 high-volume surgeons (M.S.). The outcomes at the 1-year follow-up were reported by Sansone et alfor this particular cohort of patients.

The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of FAIS, having undergone arthroscopic treatment after a nonsatisfactory result following nonsurgical treatment, and an age < 40 years. To define "elite athlete", the Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) was used. The patients included in this study had an activity level of 7 or 8 before the onset of symptoms. An HSAS activity level of 7 corresponds to defined competitive sports with moderate physical demand at the elite level, such as alpine skiing, skating, and dancing, or more physically demanding sports in semielite leagues or at the collegiate level, such as soccer, ice hockey, tennis, martial arts, and track and field.

HSAS activity level 8 corresponds to more physically demanding sports at the elite level, such as soccer, martial arts, tennis, and track and field. A combination of symptoms, physical examination, and radiological findings formed the basis of diagnosis of FAIS in this study. Radiological findings corresponding to FAIS include cam, pincer, or both. The exclusion criterion was any surgical treatment on the studied hip before the arthroscopic treatment or a conversion to total hip arthroplasty within the 5-year follow-up period.

Preoperatively and 5 years after surgery, all the athletes were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire on the following PROMs:

HAGOS, with 6 dimensions covering symptoms, pain, function in daily living, function in sports and recreation, participation in physical activities, and hip- and/or groin-related quality of life
EQ-5D and EQ-VAS (European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions Questionnaire and European Quality of Life–Visual Analog Scale)
A standardized instrument evaluating health-related quality of life
iHOT-12, a shorter version of the iHOT-33, developed to measure health-related quality of life and changes after the treatment of hip disorders in young and active patients
HSAS to measure the level of physical activity
A visual analog scale for hip function
A single question regarding patient satisfaction (yes/no)

### Preoperative planning to prevent dislocation of the hip [^111izxXt]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Because treatment for dislocations after a total hip arthroplasty are a major therapeutic challenge, prevention of this complication is paramount. To minimize the potential for instability, preoperative planning must not only include radiographic templating, but also identification of patient and surgical variables that could increase the likelihood of dislocation. This article discusses considerations such as patient characteristics, surgical experience, the operative approach, component design and positioning, and postoperative treatment and education.

### Effect of knee arthroplasty on sports participation and activity levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111P9iQB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

It is known that there are complex factors that affect participation in physical activity before and after knee surgery, such as knee function, personal barriers and beliefs, self-efficacy, social support and ageing. Interestingly, among the perceived facilitators and barriers to exercise after surgery, reasons not related to the replaced knee are reported more frequently than those related to the replaced knee. The most common facilitators to physical activity were related to the patients' motivation to improve symptoms or surgery outcomes, their personal commitment to physical activity and/or to engage in an active lifestyle, and conscious monitoring and awareness of activity levels to ensure they were being active throughout the day. The most common reported barriers for participating in any sport activity after KA were a lack of motivation, precaution to preserve the prosthesis, a medical condition due to other comorbidities and pain or a physical limitation due to their knee. Notably, it appears that men are more likely to return to sport postoperatively than women. Among the measures of knee function, scores on the physical-related 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) domains showed the strongest correlation with both number of sport activitiesand activity level. In this perspective, postoperative sport activities and activity levels appear to be more related to patient-specific factors rather than sociodemographic factors, type of surgery, implant, bearing surface diameter or operating surgeon.

Based on the actual postoperative sport participation of patients as shown in this review and previous research, the most popular sports were swimming, cycling and (Nordic) walking/hiking, while participation in high-impact activities such as ball sports, running/jogging and skiing strongly decreased compared with Pre-ORS. After muscle strength and muscle control of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles have been sufficiently recovered, it is encouraged to perform low-impact activities as they help improve general health and cardiovascular fitness. Muscular rehabilitation in terms of strength and coordination is in this sense important for the safety and protection of the joint, in which preoperative physiotherapy may be helpful to accelerate this recovery process postoperatively. Although it is typically advised to strongly discourage patients with knee arthroplasty from participation in high-impact sports, and a common sense of caution should be taken in mind, our findings do indicate that it is not impossible to participate in high-impact sport activities after KA. Notably, participation in (aqua)aerobics and fitness increased from Pre-ORS to Post-KA. During these medium-impact activities, it is recommended to put emphasis on a high number of repetitions with minimal resistance.

### Psychological readiness is related to return to sport following hip arthroscopy and can be assessed by the hip-return to sport after injury scale (hip-RSI) [^115wMvLh]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Data collection/procedure

In the first step, the 127 HA patients responded to an online survey, including the Hip-RSI (assessing current psychological readiness to RTS), current RTS status, as well as self-reported hip function. Patients provided their current RTS status according to consensus terminology by answering whether they had (a) not returned to sport (did not participate in any sport or exercise) or returned to (b) participation (general participation in any sport or exercise), (c) sport (participation in previous sport or exercise on lower performance level than prior to hip symptoms), or (d) sport performance (participation in previous sport or exercise on same or higher performance level than prior to hip symptoms). Patients also reported their current hip function regarding quality of life and participation in sport, recreation, and physical activity by responding to two valid and reliable PROMS for hip arthroscopy patients — the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT12) and the sport subscale of the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). Among other domains, the iHOT12 measures hip-related function in sports and recreational physical activities. The HAGOS sport subscale measures a construct directly related to sport participation.

The expert panel received a public link to an anonymous online survey in which they were asked to rate the relevance of the individual Hip-RSI items. The expert panel was asked to rate the relevance of all 12 Hip-RSI items for the assessment of psychological readiness to RTS in hip arthroscopy patients with regard to the domain which they are supposed to measure. Rating was performed on a 4-point Likert scale (1 not relevant; 2 somewhat relevant; 3 quite relevant; 4 highly relevant). Furthermore, the expert panel was asked in an open question to indicate if they thought the scale was lacking items concerning aspects of specific relevance for HA patients.

Analytical procedure

Data management

The Hip-RSI score was calculated as mean of the included items (scale 0–100, with 100 representing highest psychological readiness). The HAGOS subscale sport were computed as a score representing the percentages of the maximal score (100), with zero representing extreme amounts of hip and groin problems and 100 representing no hip and groin problems. iHOT12 scores are computed as the mean of the 12 items, on a scale from 0 to 100 with 0 representing the worst possible hip function and 100 representing the best possible hip function.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^112KiQ7b]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Hip fracture — femoral neck surgical treatment and precautions are specified as follows: For unstable, displaced femoral neck fractures, unipolar or bipolar hemiarthroplasty with cemented stem, anterior or posterior approach is used, with a lower dislocation rate in hemiarthroplasty than in THA (total hip arthroplasty); dislocation precautions (limiting adduction, flexion, internal rotation) may be recommended for the posterior approach, while usually, no dislocation precautions are used for patients with the anterior approach. For stable femoral neck, minimally displaced valgus impacted femoral neck fractures, fixation with percutaneous cannulated screws is listed. Although evidence is limited, THA is often chosen over hemiarthroplasty for more active or younger patients.

### What is the association of elite sporting activities with the development of hip osteoarthritis? [^113P8NEh]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Male athletes participating in certain elite sporting activities may be at an increased risk for development of hip osteoarthritis (OA) later in life. However, the strength of the association of participation in sporting activities with the increased risk of hip OA has not been well summarized.

Purpose

To investigate the association of certain high-impact sporting activities with the risk of development of hip OA in elite athletes by conducting a systematic review of the available literature.

Study Design

Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify all potential studies. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, which included participation in elite-level sporting activities, greater than 50% male athletes in the study population, diagnosis of hip OA by radiograph, hospital admission or total hip arthroplasty (THA), and greater than 80% follow-up. Exclusion criteria were recreational sporting activities, primarily female cohorts as there was a dearth of available literature on the topic, and self-reported symptoms without radiographic confirmation of diagnosis. Most studies were with European athletes, where elite-level was defined as involvement in national- or professional-level competition.

Results

Participation across elite-level impact sports was associated with increased risk of development of hip OA when compared with matched controls (odds ratio, 1.8–8.7). Twelve of 15 studies reviewed demonstrated an odds ratio of 1.8 or greater of developing hip OA in elite-level athletes. Handball was associated with the highest rate of OA of any sport, nearly 5 times that of matched controls. Soccer players demonstrated between 2 and 9 times increased risk of hip OA as defined by radiography or THA. Hockey players demonstrated 2 to 3 times increased risk of hip OA (THA or hospital admission). Five studies investigating the association of competitive long-distance running with hip OA demonstrated inconsistent results.

Conclusion

Currently available literature suggests that male athletes participating in elite impact sports (soccer, handball, track and field, or hockey) are at an increased risk of developing hip OA, while those participating in high-level long-distance running do not have a clearly elevated risk. Further research is warranted to elucidate the pathomechanics of development of hip OA in these patients.

### Activity recommendations after total hip and knee arthroplasty: a survey of the American association for hip and knee surgeons [^113xEoR9]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2009). Low credibility.

There are limited data to guide surgeon recommendations regarding activities after total joint arthroplasty. The present study aims to better clarify the current community standards. A questionnaire was distributed to the members of the American Association for Hip and Knee Surgeons attending the 2007 annual meeting inquiring about recommendations for 15 activities for patients with total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty. One hundred thirty-nine surveys were returned. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze the data. More than 95% of the responses placed no limitations on low-impact activities including level surface walking, stair climbing, level surface bicycling, swimming, and golf. Higher-impact activities were more commonly discouraged, although there was considerable variability. Recommendations after total hip arthroplasty were more liberal compared to those after total knee arthroplasty. Higher-volume surgeons tended to be more liberal in their recommendations. No responder indicated that there was strong scientific evidence for their recommendations. Investigations are needed to elucidate the long-term effects of higher load and/or higher cycle activities on total joint arthroplasty.

### Risk of total hip arthroplasty after elite sport: linking 3304 former world-class athletes with the Norwegian arthroplasty register [^115pozGY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Former elite athletes have a doubled THR risk compared with the general population for both sexes. Approximately 1 in 9 former elite female athletes and 1 in 12 former elite male athletes had undergone THA. The joint impact classification is associated to THA risk in former elite male athletes, but its association to THA risk for former elite female athletes is unclear.

### Arthroscopic treatment for femoroacetabular impingement yields favourable patient-reported outcomes and method survivorship at 10-year follow-up [^111KE5Wu]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The patients completed the following PROMs preoperatively and at the 10‐year follow‐up:
International Hip Outcome Tool short version (iHOT‐12), a shorter version of the iHOT‐33, which measures both health‐related quality of life and changes after treatment in young, active patients with hip disorders.
Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS). The HAGOS questionnaire consists of six subscales: Symptoms, Pain, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec), Participation in Physical Activities (PA) and hip and/or groin‐related Quality of Life (QOL). The scores of each subscale are summed up and transformed to a 0–100 scale. A score of 0 represents severe hip and/or groin problems, while a score of 100 represents no hip and/or groin problems. With an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 0.81 and 0.89 for the six subscales, the test–retest reliability of the Swedish version of HAGOS is found to be very good.
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ‐5D) and European Quality of Life–Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS), a standardized instrument evaluating health‐related quality of life. This PROM is a descriptive system that comprises five dimensions: mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. Previous studies have shown that this instrument is valid and reliable.
Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS), a PROM measuring the level of physical activity in patients with FAIS. The HSAS scale consists of nine different levels, from lowest being 'No recreational or competitive sports' to highest 'Competitive sports (elite level)'. The Swedish version of HSAS has been found to be reliable (test‐retest reliability, ICC 0.930) and to have good content validity when compared to the Tegner score (r = 0.794).
VAS scale for hip function.
A question regarding satisfaction with surgery (yes/no).

### Psychological factors are important to return to pre-injury sport activity after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: expect and motivate to satisfy [^116XkzEw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of the present study is the small sample size, and therefore, the results need to be confirmed in future studies. High motivation can be assumed to be a prerequisite to good adherence to a rehabilitation protocol; however, we did not empirically evaluate adherence in our study. Further, there are no data on whether every participant was cleared to return to sport or exactly when participants returned to sport. Instead, participants answered whether they had returned or not to their pre-injury sport activity at 52 weeks after surgery. This raises the potential for recall bias. However, given that returning to sport is a discrete and typically highly anticipated event, the chances of it being influenced by recall bias are likely to be low. Moreover, besides the psychological factors analysed in our study, other factors such as the surgery, rehabilitation and physical function may influence whether an individual returns to sport.

This study found that higher motivation during the rehabilitation was associated with returning to pre-injury sport activity. Facilitating motivation during the rehabilitation might have a beneficial effect on the person's ability to achieve their participation goal.

### Return to sport after bilateral single stage total hip arthroplasty using the direct anterior approach: a case control study [^112buPXV]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is currently performed on active patients with increasing functional demands. Single stage bilateral THA is indicated in younger patients in good general health. Our objective is to evaluate the return to sport (RTS) in patients who underwent bilateral single stage THA compared to unilateral THA.

Methods

This retrospective case control study was conducted between 2013 and 2017. All patients who underwent bilateral single stage THA were included. The control group had unilateral THA performed and was matched based on age, body mass index, gender, and surgery date (2 controls for each bilateral case). All surgeries were performed by a single senior surgeon using the direct anterior approach. The University of California Los Angeles activity score was collected at the last follow-up. A questionnaire regarding RTS, motivation, and satisfaction was assessed.

Results

Thirty-two patients were included in the study, of whom 21 were men. The average age was 60.7 ± 9.6 years, body mass index was 26 ± 4 kg/m 2, and mean follow-up was 20.1 ± 11.6 months. Twenty-eight patients overall (87%) returned to sport after the procedure. Twenty-five of these (89%) returned to the same sport, and 17 (68%) participated at the same intensity. The average time to RTS was 4 ± 2.8 months. These results were at least as good as those after unilateral THA. The level of motivation of the patient was the only predictive factor for RTS (P < .001).

Conclusion

Bilateral single stage THA via a direct anterior approach allows for RTS and to a similar level in the majority of patients in whom this procedure is indicated.

Level Of Evidence

Comparative retrospective study, Level III.

### Difference in return to sports activity after hip arthroplasty by THR… [^1157xLMX]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This study aims to evaluate the return to activity in younger patients under 50 years old after undergoing either total hip replacement or hip resurfacing, as performed in everyday practice. This research will be observational, meaning patients will not be randomly assigned to different treatment groups. To objectively assess participents; return to everyday, professional, and sports activities, validated questionnaires will be sent to participents in addition to routine clinical practice. The study will be prospective and comparative based on the type of prostheses used. Research Hypothesis Regardless of the type of implants used, total hip arthroplasty yields excellent results in young patients with early resumption of activities, including sports. A meta-analysis of 11 studies comprising 2297 patients shows that 70%-90% of patients resumed sports activities within 6–12 months post-THA.

A more recent systematic literature review confirms that 82% of patients have resumed sports activity on average at 6 months. Ethical Considerations This study complies with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Participant data will be anonymized to ensure confidentiality. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Expected Results It is expected that there will be no significant difference in physical activity level at 1 year between patients operated with different types of prostheses. The results will provide valuable information on the optimal type of prosthesis for young patients undergoing THA and contribute to improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.
- Compare the time to return to physical and sporting activity in the year following hip arthroplasty.
- Compare the time to return to usual professional activity.
- Evaluate the quality of return to activity. Evaluate early complications after total hip arthroplasty.
- Compare the participants postoperative experience.
- Analyze the factors influencing the return to physical activity.
- Describe the type of implant, surgical approach and clinical parameters in each group Evaluation criteria Main evaluation criterion The main evaluation criterion is the 1-year difference in the UCLA score measuring participants physical activity in relation to their usual level for the resurfacing group and for all THAs.
- The time to return to activities and sports
- The time to return to usual professional activity
- The quality of return to activity is evaluated by the Oxford hip functional scores. Complications and the rate of revision surgery. Participants experience is measured by the SHV Score and the Forgotten Hip Score at all study visits compared to the preoperative value.

General Recommendations for Orthopaedic Surgeons BEFORE Metal-on-Metal Hip Resurfacing Surgery
- Consider your patient's individual characteristics. Each implant has a unique set of benefits and risks which will result in different outcomes in different patient populations.
- Select a metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implant for your patient only after determining that the benefits of using a MoM hip resurfacing implant outweigh the risks, in comparison to using alternative total hip systems. General Recommendations for Orthopaedic Surgeons AFTER Metal-on-Metal Hip Replacement and Resurfacing Surgery.
- Assessment of organs and systems for changes including systemic adverse events in cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine and renal systems.
- Appropriate radiographs to check for implant positioning and osteolysis
- Schedule certain patients with increased risk of device wear or adverse reaction to metal debris for closer follow-up. These may include: Follow-Up for Symptomatic Patients Clinical Evaluation
- If a patient experiences local symptoms more than three months after metal-on-metal hip implant surgery, conduct a thorough evaluation, with attention to abductor weakness or Trendelenburg sign to identify abductor damage.
- Follow-up of symptomatic patients with MoM hip implants should occur at least every six months.
- Guide your clinical evaluation by the symptoms and physical findings, including an assessment for well-known and more common emergent complications including joint infection, implant loosening, peri-prosthetic facture and dislocation.
- Recognize that localized lesions associated with reactions to metal debris may also present with pain or a variety signs and symptoms including:

- Local nerve palsy
- Palpable mass
- Local swelling
- Joint dislocation or subluxation
- Abductor weakness.
- In extreme cases, adverse local tissue reactions may significantly damage periprosthetic bone, muscle, and nerves. Therefore patients with progressing ALTR, may be considered for earlier revision to prevent extensive damage.
- If you recommend revision, advise patients of the surgical risks of revision as well as the expected outcomes, including: .
