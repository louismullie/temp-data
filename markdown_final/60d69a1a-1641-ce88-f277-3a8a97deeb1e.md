## Question

Fred was having a party and was responsible for buying canned soda. He figured every guest would drink 2 sodas and he was inviting 15 people to the party. The local store had a deal on sodas that week. Every 6 pack of canned sodas was on sale for $3.00. How much would it cost Fred to buy enough sodas for every guest to have 2 cans?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much it would cost Fred to buy enough canned soda for 15 guests, assuming each guest drinks 2 sodas, when 6-packs are on sale for $3.00 each. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of cans required. Then, I should verify how many 6-packs are needed and whether to round up. Next, I will calculate the total cost. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider any practical implications like extra cans or storage, even though the question is purely about cost.

> Let me first confirm the total demand. With 15 guests and 2 sodas per guest, that is 15 multiplied by 2, which equals 30 cans of soda needed for the party [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the packaging and rounding. Each 6-pack contains 6 cans, so 30 cans divided by 6 cans per pack equals exactly 5 packs, so no rounding is needed here; Fred should buy 5 six-packs to meet the demand precisely [^notfound].

> I will now examine the cost calculation. At $3.00 per 6-pack, 5 packs times $3.00 equals $15.00 total cost for the soda supply [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should double-check the arithmetic to avoid a mistake. 5 times 3 is indeed 15, so the total cost is $15.00, and this matches the exact can count without leftover or shortage, assuming each guest consumes exactly 2 cans [^notfound].

> But wait, what if some guests want more than 2 cans or a few cans are damaged or lost? Practically, Fred might consider buying an extra 6-pack for buffer, which would add $3.00 and bring the total to $18.00, though the question specifically asks for the minimum cost to cover 2 per guest, so the correct answer remains $15.00 unless otherwise specified [^notfound].

> Final answer: Fred will spend $15.00 to buy enough soda for 15 guests to have 2 cans each at the sale price of $3.00 per 6-pack [^notfound].

---

Fred needs **30 cans** of soda (15 guests × 2 cans each). At $3.00 per 6-pack, he should buy **5 six-packs**, which cost **$15.00 total**. This ensures exactly 30 cans with no leftovers or shortage.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Total number of guests | 15 |
| 2 | Number of sodas per guest | 2 |
| 3 | Total number of sodas needed (guests × sodas per guest) | 15 × 2 = 30 |
| 4 | Number of sodas per 6-pack | 6 |
| 5 | Number of 6-packs needed (total sodas ÷ sodas per pack) | 30 ÷ 6 = 5 |
| 6 | Cost per 6-pack | $3.00 |
| 7 | Total cost (number of 6-packs × cost per pack) | 5 × $3.00 = $15.00 |

---

Therefore, Fred will spend **$15.00** to buy enough soda for his party.

### A social return on investment analysis of a free meal program to support rural cancer patients and caregivers travelling for treatment [^3714a34e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis for evaluative SROI ratio

When the meal cost (AU$12.70) was shifted to guests (i.e. no meal subsidy), the SROI ratio reduced to 1:2.33, with meal cost saved accounting for 6% of the social value generated, and the value of time saved and travel or delivery cost saved increasing to 67% and 26%, respectively (Online Resource 6). When meal cost was set at AU$7.70 (i.e. subsidised by AU$5.00), the SROI ratio reduced to 1:2.62, with meal cost savings accounting for 16% of the social value generated, and time saved and travel or delivery cost saved accounting for 60% and 23%, respectively (Online Resource 7).

Acceptability of the free meal program

Most guests (91%) who received a free meal reported consuming all or almost all their meal. Compared to the Baseline (B) phase, both meal enjoyment and satisfaction were higher in the Intervention (I) phase (I: 90% vs. B: 54% and I: 92% vs B: 81%, respectively) (Table 3). Few guests reported negative after-effects of their free meal compared to the Baseline phase (I: 96% vs. B: 77%). Seventy percent indicated they planned to purchase additional meals from the vending machine during their stay. From qualitative feedback on Intervention surveys, those who did not plan to purchase additional meals commonly indicated they were short-stay guests (i.e. 1 night) or had brought other food with them. When asked how much they would be willing to pay for a meal on arrival at the lodge if it was not free, average willingness to pay was AU$15.00 (range: AU$5.00–$50.00).

### Implementation of health-promoting retail initiatives in the healthier choices in supermarkets study-qualitative perspectives from a feasibility study [^02691bcf]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Implementation of the initiatives

The implementation of the initiatives was challenged. Firstly, we found that not all the preparations for the implementation were finished in time for the scheduled day. On the scheduled day, the retailer decided to push back the implementation by 1 week. The main reasons were that there had been some misunderstandings around the ordering of the smaller sodas. It was informed that the smaller soda would be a 330 mL can instead of the 375 mL bottle at the price of DKK 10.00 (~ 1.3 euros). The 500 mL bottle usually sold at the coolers cost DKK 16.00 (~ 2.2 euros). The Danish Cancer Society and the research group had two concerns about this: 1) the use of a can instead of a bottle would make the interpretation of the results very difficult, as the bottle and the can have two different functions to the customer — with the can, the product would be consumed all at once, whereas the bottle with the screw lid could be saved for later after it had been open; 2) the price was too low — the price per litre would be lower on the smaller sodas than it had been on those replaced. No changes were made despite these concerns.

Secondly, just days before the implementation, the retailers informed the other partners that they would stick with cans for the test of smaller-sized sodas and that they would now be 250 ml. They acknowledged that both the size and the packing were not optimal but that the optimal 375 mL in a bottle was just not possible. Additionally, they informed the researchers that they could no longer find the new bags produced for the pick'n'mix sweet display.

These challenges led to a delay of the implementation of the initiatives by 1 week, but also a staggered implementation, where the initiatives were implemented when ready (the soda initiative 2 weeks later and the bags for pick'n' mix sweets 8 weeks later). The retailers agreed to push back the end day correspondingly, upholding the 6 weeks of implementation. Table 3 shows an overview of the implementation of the four initiatives according to the day and week of the feasibility test period.

### Association of a community campaign for better beverage choices with beverage purchases from supermarkets [^f64006d7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Data are needed to evaluate community interventions to reduce consumption of sugary drinks. Supermarket sales data can be used for this purpose.

Objective

To compare beverage sales in Howard County, Maryland (HC), with sales in comparison stores in a contiguous state before and during a 3-year campaign to reduce consumption of sugary beverages.

Design, Setting, and Partipicants

This observational experiment with a control group included 15 HC supermarkets and 17 comparison supermarkets. Weekly beverage sales data at baseline (January 1 to December 31, 2012) and from campaign years 1 to 3 (January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015) were analyzed. A difference-in-differences (DID) regression compared the volume sales per product per week in the HC and comparison stores, controlling for mean product price, competitor's product price, product size, weekly local temperature, and manufacturer.

Exposures

The campaign message was to reduce consumption of all sugary drinks. Television advertising, digital marketing, direct mail, outdoor advertising, social media, and earned media during the 3-year period created 17 million impressions. Community partners successfully advocated for public policies to encourage healthy beverage consumption in schools, child care, health care, and government settings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales were tracked of sugary drinks highlighted in the campaign, including regular soda, sports drinks, and fruit drinks. Sales of diet soda and 100% juice were also tracked. Sales data are expressed as mean fluid ounces sold per product, per store, per week.

Results

Regular soda sales in the 15 HC supermarkets decreased (-19.7%) from 2012 through 2015, whereas sales remained stable (0.8%) in the 17 comparison supermarkets (DID adjusted mean, -369 fl oz; 95% CI, -469 to -269 fl oz; P < .01). Fruit drink sales decreased (-15.3%) in HC stores and remained stable (-0.6%) in comparison stores (DID adjusted mean, -342 fl oz; 95% CI, -466 to -220 fl oz; P < .001). Sales of 100% juice decreased more in HC (-15.0%) than comparison (-2.1%) stores (DID mean, -576 fl oz; 95% CI, -776 to -375 fl oz; P < .001). Sales of sports drinks (-86.3 fl oz; 95% CI, -343.6 to 170.9 fl oz) and diet soda (-17.8 in HC stores vs -11.3 in comparison stores; DID adjusted mean, -78.9 fl oz; 95% CI, -182.1 to 24.4 fl oz) decreased in both communities, but the decreases were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

A locally designed, multicomponent campaign to reduce consumption of sugary drinks was associated with an accelerated decrease in sales of regular soda, fruit drinks, and 100% juice. This policy-focused campaign provides a road map for other communities to reduce consumption of sugary drinks.

### The short-term impacts of the Philadelphia beverage tax on beverage consumption [^71608cb6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

On January 1, 2017, Philadelphia implemented a beverage tax of $0.015/ounce on sugar ("regular") and sugar-substitute ("diet") beverages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate impact of the tax on residents' consumption of soda, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and bottled water.

Methods

A repeat cross-sectional study design used data from a random-digit-dialing phone survey during a no-tax period (December 6–31, 2016) and a tax period (January 15-February 31, 2017) among 899 respondents in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and 878 respondents in three nearby comparison cities. Survey questions included frequency and volume of bottled water and beverages. Outcomes were daily consumption, and 30-day consumption frequency and volume. Propensity score-weighted difference-in-differences regression was used to control for secular time trend and confounding. Covariates were sociodemographics, BMI, health status, smoking, and alcohol use. Analyses were conducted in 2017.

Results

Within the first 2 months of tax implementation, relative to the comparison cities, in Philadelphia the odds of daily consumption of regular soda was 40% lower (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.97); energy drink was 64% lower (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.17, 0.76); bottled water was 58% higher (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.13, 2.20); and the 30-day regular soda consumption frequency was 38% lower (ratio of consumption frequency = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.98).

Conclusions

Early results suggest that the tax influenced daily consumption of regular soda, energy drinks, and bottled water. Future studies are needed to evaluate longer-term impact of the tax on sugared beverage consumption and substitutions.

### Economics and obesity policy [^a983bcee]. International Journal of Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

This paper elucidates the challenges surrounding the economics of some popular obesity-related policy proposals. Solid economic justifications for anti-obesity policies are often lacking, and evidence suggests policies like fat and soda taxes or restrictions on food stamp spending are unlikely to substantively affect obesity prevalence. In short, many of the same factors that make obesity such a complicated and multifaceted issue extend to the economic analysis of public health policies.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^750f7056]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Intervention costs

Country specific resource needs and costs were derived using the WHO-CHOICE database, which includes detailed component specific estimates of inputs (ingredients) required for each intervention stage for each country's government and the estimated unit price for each input in that country including for example costs of human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment, and mass media (see supplementary eMethods). To facilitate comparisons between countries, we converted all costs to international dollars (I$) (see supplementary eMethods), which account for each nation's currency as well as purchasing power parity. One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower incomes than the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved would be much lower). We summed costs by year to calculate the total cost of the 10 year intervention for each country, with 3% annual discounting.

We modeled only governmental intervention costs, for several reasons. First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately. Second, net industry sector costs for product reformulation in each country would be difficult to determine because once the relevant reformulation has been undertaken in any single country, the knowledge of that reformulation can be extended with much less additional cost to other countries. For example, multinational companies transfer improved recipes and reformulation strategies across borders with no cost, as do food scientists moving between firms, and so on. Third, in contrast to recent US models, we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survivaland because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally. Because including such cost savings would be optimal according to many cost effectiveness guidelines, our results for overall cost effectiveness should be considered a conservative estimate.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^6c888ae1]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

American Optometric Association hypoglycemia management during eye care — the treatment of a hypoglycemic episode may include the following steps: check blood glucose to confirm hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL); treat mild or moderate hypoglycemia (54–70 mg/dL) by giving 15–20 g of simple carbohydrates orally as immediate treatment, with options including 4 oz of fruit juice, 5 to 6 oz regular soda, 1 tablespoon of table sugar or honey, 2 tablespoons of raisins, or 3 to 4 glucose tablets; if initial blood glucose is ≤ 54 mg/dL, give 20–30 g of simple carbohydrates; re-check blood glucose after 15 minutes and repeat treatment until blood glucose returns to at least 90 mg/dL; provide a snack if the patient's next meal is more than one hour away (such as 6 saltine crackers, 3 graham cracker squares, or 1/2 peanut butter sandwich); dial 911 if patient is unconscious and treat with glucagon and/or intravenous glucose if it is available in the office; when patient is alert enough to swallow, give fruit, fruit juice, or sugar-sweetened soda immediately and follow steps 2 to 4.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^672e0c47]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

School meal reimbursement and costs — Higher quality school meals engender substantial costs; despite an additional $0.06 per meal allocated by the 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization, reimbursement for food service over the past 20 years has never kept pace with rising expenses or inflation; the National School Boards Association cited that, even by the USDA's conservative estimates, the recent reimbursement rates (2010) will cover less than one-half the costs of implementing the new nutrition standards over the next 5 years; if prices of nonreimbursed meals increase, more children may bring meals from home, purchase food from other sources, or skip meals altogether, each of which will be detrimental to achieving better diet quality; additional federal and state budget cuts in the near-term threaten many aspects of child nutrition strategy and are an important point of advocacy for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^14a58bc8]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Later childhood and adolescence — population beverage patterns and sugar-sweetened beverage associations include that only 19 percent of male teens and 9 percent of female teens consumed at least 3 glasses of milk per day, whereas 39 percent of males and 29 percent of females consumed at least one 12-ounce can of soda per day. Soft drink consumption in the United States has increased more than 300 percent over the past two decades, and 56–85 percent of school-aged children consume at least one soft drink daily. Higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with significantly lower milk consumption, and increased soda consumption predicted greater increases in BMI; BMI increased 0.01 unit for each 100 grams of soda consumed, and for every 100 grams of soda consumed, average daily calorie intake increased by about 82 calories. A 2006 systematic review included 21 (of 30) studies in children and adolescents and concluded that greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is significantly associated with both weight gain and obesity; two RCTs reviewed showed significant reductions in overweight and obesity when intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was limited.

### Impact of wine bottle and glass sizes on wine consumption at home: a within-and between-households randomized controlled trial [^3914cc5f]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the set of pre‐specified covariates included in the statistical model, there was evidence of an effect of intervention period, with households drinking 358.2 mL (95% CI = 229.2–487.0, P < 0.001) less wine during the second study period compared to the first (Table 3; Supporting information Appendix S4: Figure S1). There was also a significant main effect of bottle size order, with households purchasing larger bottles first, consuming 303.0 mL (95% CI = 72.0–533.9, P = 0.012) less wine per 14‐day period compared to households purchasing smaller bottles first (Table 3; Supporting information Appendix S4: Figure S2 and Table S2). There were also significant main effects of baseline consumption, guest consumption, out‐of‐home consumption and the duration of the 'usual behaviour' period. More wine was consumed per 14‐day study period when households' self‐reported baseline wine consumption was higher (a 1.93‐ml increase per 14‐day period for each 1‐ml increase in baseline weekly consumption; 95% CI = 1.80–2.06, P < 0.001) or reported having guests who drank from their study wine (a 0.66‐ml increase for each 1 mL consumed by guests; 95% CI = 0.42–0.91, P < 0.001). Less wine was consumed per 14‐day study period when households reported drinking wine out of the home (0.14‐ml decrease for each 1‐ml consumed out of the home; 95% CI = −0.23 to −0.06, P = 0.001). Less wine was also consumed per study 14‐day period for each extra log‐day spent in the 'usual behaviour' period (−378.3 ml; 95% CI = −249.8.1 to −508.1, P < 0.001) (Table 3).

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^ad0fa891]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps more critically, although this analysis can highlight significant relationships between beverages purchased, it cannot explain why these relationships exist. Why, for example, would an increase in price of high-sugar drinks appear to cause some mid-income households to reduce expenditure on them, but also increase their purchase of lager? It may be that it narrows the relative price difference to make lager appear more 'affordable', through changing the households' cost-benefit calculations of SSB versus lager, but this sort of behavioural explanation requires further, primary, research. It may be easier to explain some of the complementary relationships – that for instance purchase of beer or wine falls as the price of SSB increases as there is less money available overall, or because for some drinks they are mixed, but again we cannot really understand the possible explanations without further primary research. Nonetheless, the presence of this range of significant substitute and complementary relationships between SSB and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages suggests an urgent need for follow-up work based on with primary research to understand the reasons for the relationships.

### Public policies to reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents [^6b794523]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Sugary drink tax cost-effectiveness in childhood obesity — modeling evidence: A higher tax of 20% would most likely have the greatest effect on reducing consumption. The Childhood Obesity Intervention Cost-Effectiveness Study (CHOICES) found implementation of a sugary drink tax to be the most cost-effective strategy to address childhood obesity, leading to prevention of 575 000 cases of childhood obesity and a health care savings of $30.78 per dollar spent over 10 years. Such taxes are most effective when accompanied by a broad education campaign to help stakeholders understand the risks of sugary drink consumption and the rationale and benefits of the tax.

### Impact of bottle size on in-home consumption of wine: a randomized controlled cross-over trial [^853fa166]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Descriptive information regarding the primary and secondary outcomes and covariates according to bottle size and intervention order are shown in Table 2. There was no significant difference in the mean volume of wine ordered per household in each bottle size [50 cl bottles: 6135.5 mL (SD = 2207.0); 75 cl bottles: 6122.0 mL (SD = 2197.6); paired ‐t (165) = 0.763, P = 0.463], evidence that households adhered to the instructions to order the same volume of wine during each study period.

Table 2
Study outcomes and covariates (mean, SD) during each 14‐day intervention period according to intervention order (n = 166).

Primary outcome: volume of wine consumed

The volume of wine consumed with the 75 cl bottles was 172.7 mL higher per household per 14‐day period compared to the 50 cl bottles (Table 2; Supporting information, Plot 1, Data S6). This appears to be due primarily to a reduction in consumption in the second period by the group who purchased 75 cl bottles first, although the difference in effect between the two groups was not statistically significant. After adjusting for pre‐specified covariates, models showed that bottle size had a significant impact on volume consumed, with 191.1 mL (95% CI = 42.03–339.2) more wine consumed per 14‐day period from 75 cl bottles than from 50 cl bottles (Table 3; Supporting information, Plot 2, Data S6). Given the total volume of wine consumed across households per 14‐day period (4292 ml), this equates to a 4.5% (95% CI = 1.0 to 7.9%) increase in consumption with 75 cl bottles compared to 50 cl bottles.

Table 3
Mixed‐effect regression model estimates (95% CI) for volume (ml) of wine consumed per 14‐day period (n = 166).

Baseline consumption, guest consumption and the duration of the 'usual behaviour' period each had a significant impact on consumption volume. More wine was consumed per 14‐day intervention period when households self‐reported higher baseline levels of wine consumption or had guests who drank from their study wine, with less wine consumed for each extra day spent in the 'usual behaviour' period (Table 3).

### Public policies to reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents [^eac34766]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — Scope and sugary drink expenditures are quantified: SNAP "provides food for 45 million families, including 23 million children," "serving approximately 1 in 4 US children," and "Each day, SNAP dollars pay for 20 million servings of sugary drinks at an annual cost of $4 billion." Modeling of removing sugary drinks from SNAP estimates that "510 000 type 2 diabetes mellitus person-years and 52 000 deaths could be averted, with a savings of $2900 per quality-adjusted life-years saved." Policy constraints and evaluation context are noted: "States cannot make changes to SNAP benefits without a waiver from the USDA. Nonetheless, the USDA has repeatedly rejected states' requests for waivers and pilot studies that would eliminate sugary drinks from SNAP." Benefit adequacy is relevant because "the current SNAP benefit amounts to an average of $1.40 per person per meal," and evaluation capacity exists: "In 2008, Congress directed $20 million to fund a pilot project to subsidize fruit and vegetable purchases within SNAP."

### Implementation of health-promoting retail initiatives in the healthier choices in supermarkets study-qualitative perspectives from a feasibility study [^49b67c22]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Smaller product sizes of sodas at the checkout desk

As seen from Table 3, we did observe the implementation of a smaller product size of the targeted sodas in all coolers, besides the one at the bakery, in the week leading up to the agreed date. We hereafter observed a full implementation of 250 mL cans during the first 2 weeks of implementation. During the third week and the beginning of the fourth week, we observed a mix of 250 and 330 mL cans or only 330 mL cans. The store manager explained that this was probably due to non-delivering from the supplier. At the end of the fourth week and for the last 2 weeks, we observed a full implementation of 250 mL cans. As the targeted size of the initiative was a 375 mL bottle, the initiative was not implemented as intended. After the 6-week feasibility test period, we observed that the smaller 250 mL cans were available in all coolers for at least eight more weeks. As expected, the presentation of the coolers fluctuated over the period. On days of stocking (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the coolers would look neat and full, while they would appear more empty or messy on other days.

Customer responsiveness

We observed very few customers who bought any products from the coolers, and we did not get to talk to any customers about the initiative. However, the observations in the store showed no distinct change in customers' behaviour around the coolers nor expressions of discontent or excitement with the initiative. In an interview with the store manager, he explained that he believed customers had not noticed the change.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^6ad224ad]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School health guidelines — added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages, and empty calories in children and adolescents — state that although the dietary guidelines do not have a recommendation for the maximum daily intake of added sugar, they recommend that persons reduce their intake of added sugars; added sugar contributes approximately 18% of total daily calories in children and adolescents, with sugar-sweetened beverages contributing an average of 8% of energy intake among persons aged 2–18 years; males aged 12–19 years consume an average of 22.0 oz of full-calorie soda per day, females consume an average of 14.3 oz of full-calorie soda and 6.3 oz of fluid milk; empty calories from added sugar and solid fats contribute 40% of daily calories for persons aged 2–18 years, and approximately half of these empty calories come from six sources including soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, grain desserts, pizza, and whole milk.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^3fde0719]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — Recommendation 1 (fluid intake) states: "ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)." Low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake is associated with a reduction in stone recurrence, with no difference between tap water and Fiuggi brand oligomineral water; persons already drinking recommended amounts or with contraindications "should not be directed to increase their fluid intake further." Decreasing consumption of soft drinks is associated with reduced recurrence only for beverages "acidified by phosphoric acid, such as colas," and not for drinks "acidified by citric acid, such as fruit-flavored sodas."

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^ad8fa039]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on school snacks, sweetened beverages, and added sugars describes how food is available in school in 3 venues and highlights beverage guidance and persistent nutrition issues. Food is available in school in 3 venues: federally sponsored school meal programs; items sold in competition to school meals (a la carte, vending machines, school stores); and foods in informal settings such as packed meals and snacks, bake sales, fundraisers, sports booster sales, in-class parties, or other school celebrations. High-energy, low-nutrient beverages contribute substantial calories but little nutrient content to a student's diet. In 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that sweetened drinks be replaced in school by water, white and flavored milks, or 100% fruit and vegetable beverages. Although regulations and industry changes have decreased availability of nutrient-poor options, regular access to foods of high energy and low quality remains a school issue, with contributions from students, parents, and staff. Pediatricians are positioned to promote nutrient-rich foods within calorie guidelines and to emphasize nutritional value, variety, appropriate portion, and steady improvements in quality rather than simply advocating for elimination of added sugars. The introduction notes that consistently, 30% to 40% of daily energy of children and adolescents is consumed as energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and drinks, and that more than 55 million children and teenagers attend the nation's 105 000 schools.

Collins 2016 SNAP reports that intake of sugar from SSB decreased by −0.5 g/day (95% CI −2 to 1) for the comparison of USD 60 versus no USD benefit a month, increased by 1 g/day (95% CI −1 to 3) for the comparison of USD 60 versus USD 30 benefit a month, and decreased by −2 g/day (95% CI −4 to 1) for the comparison of USD 30 versus no USD benefit a month.

SSB consumption (Waehrer 2015, very low‐certainty evidence)

Waehrer 2015 reports that median SSB intake increased by 34 kcal/day (95% CI 7 to 60) at eight months (triple interaction between SNAP, ARRA and a low education indicator, controlling for total energy intake, as reported in Table 8 of the study's primary report). In an alternative model, not controlling for total energy intake, SSB intake increased by 26 kcal/day (SE 13, P < 0.01).

Secondary outcomes: share of participants usually drinking non‐fat or low‐fat milk, programme costs

Collins 2016 SNAP reports that the share of participants usually drinking non‐fat or low‐fat milk decreased by −0.04% (95% CI −2 to 2) for the comparison of USD 60 versus no USD benefit a month, increased by 0.2% (95% CI −1 to 2) for the comparison of USD 60 versus USD 30 benefit a month, and decreased by −0.2% (95% CI −2 to 2) for the comparison of USD 30 versus no USD benefit a month.

Collins 2016 SNAP reports that in 2012 (one of the two years in which an economic evaluation of the programme was done), programme costs were USD 214 per child, including USD 58 administrative costs and USD 156 benefit costs. The study reports that administrative costs could be expected to be lower if the programme were to be scaled up and implemented as an ongoing programme.

### Ingestion of diet soda before a glucose load augments glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion [^25fa302b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In summary, artificial sweeteners in combination with glucose increase GLP-1 secretion, but the clinical significance of this observation remains to be determined. Additional studies are needed to isolate the effects of individual sweeteners in diet sodas and should include individuals with metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes, a condition typically associated with loss of the incretin effect. In light of the large number of individuals using artificial sweeteners on a daily basis, it appears essential to carefully investigate the associated effects on metabolism and weight.

### Trends in beverage consumption among high school students-United States, 2007–2015 [^5b01e0f7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Daily soda and juice consumption were assessed with the questions "During the past 7 days, how many times did you drink a can, bottle, or glass of soda or pop, such as Coke, Pepsi, or Sprite? (Do not count diet soda or diet pop)" and "During the past 7 days, how many times did you drink 100% fruit juices such as orange juice, apple juice, or grape juice? (Do not count punch, Kool-Aid, sports drinks, or other fruit-flavored drinks.)" Response options were "I did not drink soda or pop during the past 7 days" or "I did not drink 100% fruit juice during the past 7 days," "1 to 3 times during the past 7 days," "4 to 6 times during the past 7 days," "1 time per day," "2 times per day," "3 times per day," or "4 or more times per day." Students who selected "1 time per day," "2 times per day," "3 times per day," or "4 or more times per day" were categorized as daily soda or juice drinkers; all other students were categorized as non-daily soda or juice drinkers. Daily milk consumption was assessed with the question "During the past 7 days, how many glasses of milk did you drink? (Count the milk you drank in a glass or cup, from a carton, or with cereal. Count the half pint of milk served at school as equal to one glass.)" Response options were "I did not drink milk during the past 7 days," "1 to 3 glasses during the past 7 days," "4 to 6 glasses during the past 7 days," "1 glass per day," "2 glasses per day," "3 glasses per day," or "4 or more glasses per day." Students who selected "1 glass per day," "2 glasses per day," "3 glasses per day," or "4 or more glasses per day" were categorized as daily milk drinkers; all other students were categorized as non-daily milk drinkers.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^7bf6ba27]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Items sold in competition to school meals: new national standards — Competitive foods sold in vending machines and a la carte lines represent a far less nutritious option than the USDA-sponsored school meals; until 2010, federal law restricted the sale of carbonated drinks, candies, and other "foods of minimal nutritional value" only in the cafeteria during meal service hours, leaving many nutrient-poor products available for sale with lax oversight; access to "empty calories" has been associated with higher daily energy intake and greater BMI and with displacement of more nutrient-rich alternatives; many schools that have taken steps to improve the nutritional quality of competitive foods have not reported subsequent losses in total revenue and in some cases have even increased revenue and school meal participation; in 2004, the AAP published a policy statement ("Soft Drinks in Schools"), and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation published "School Beverage Guidelines" in 2007; a report from the alliance issued in 2010 cited an 88% decrease in total calories shipped to schools, a 95% reduction in the grams of added sugars shipped to schools, and a 65% decline in shipments of full-calorie soft drinks.

### Diet soda intake and risk of incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^b805e517]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In MESA, diet soda consumption was positively associated with both incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Associations between diet soda and risk of type 2 diabetes were of greater magnitude than the associations observed between diet soda and metabolic syndrome. Consistent with these findings, diet soda was associated with development of high fasting glucose and high waist circumference during follow-up but not with other metabolic syndrome components, suggesting that in this analysis, metabolic syndrome associations were driven more by a pre-diabetic condition than the "syndrome" per se. The frequency of diet beverage consumption in the general population and the even greater reported consumption of diet beverages in individuals at high risk for these conditions make dissemination of these findings to a wider audience imperative.

Despite accumulating evidence of the existence of these associations, we are cautious not to conclude causality between diet soda and the diabetic or pre-diabetic condition. The possibility of confounding by other dietary and lifestyle/behavioral factors cannot be excluded from these observational studies. We pose three questions when interpreting our results: two that are predicated on an assumption of causality and one that is not dependent on a causal interpretation of these findings.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^0f4b9b6f]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drink caffeine content and safety thresholds — energy drinks vary in caffeine concentration, with most containing 32 mg·100 mL−1 and others containing 30 to 134 mg of caffeine per 100 mL, a concentration that greatly exceeds the FDA-imposed limit of 20 mg of caffeine per 100 mL for traditional soda; small format energy shots (~60 mL) are approximately 6-fold to 12-fold the concentration limit. Coffee caffeine content varies between 48 mg and 317 mg per serving. Reports note that agitation and tachycardia can occur at doses as low as 50 mg, while caffeine doses of less than 200 mg in a 70-kg adult are unlikely to produce toxicity; the role of rate of consumption and preexisting conditions in serious energy drink-related adverse events has not been elucidated.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^e0666b6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Energy from beverages sold, SSB purchases and SSB sales (one CBA and two ITS studies, very low‐certainty evidence)

Ng 2014a reports that the energy content of beverages (including SSB) sold by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge decreased by −14 kcal/per capita/day compared to a decrease by −3 kcal/per capita/day for national‐brand companies not participating in the pledge at four years, and a decrease by −14 kcal/per capita/day for private‐label brands. (Study authors note that some private‐label brands covered by the analysis were produced by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge; the comparison with national‐brand companies not participating in the pledge may therefore be the better comparison). Ng 2014a also reports that SSB sales by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge decreased by −7 kcal/per capita/day at four years (no P values or CIs reported, data for the control group not reported).

Ng 2014b reports that SSB purchases from companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge measured in kcal/household/day decreased less than expected, based on pre‐intervention trends during a four‐year follow‐up period in both the intervention and control groups (P < 0.001, results shown graphically only, see appendix figure C3 of Ng 2014b; for SSB purchases the study does not report a direct numerical comparison between the intervention and control groups).

Taillie 2015 reports that after the implementation of Walmart's Healthier Food Initiative the percentage volume of SSB purchased from Walmart decreased more steeply than expected, based on pre‐intervention trends (P < 0.01, results shown graphically only, see appendix exhibit 3 of Taillie 2015), and more than for other chain retailers during a three‐year follow‐up period (results shown graphically only).

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^a30bffc9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Although many of the associations at the aggregate level are replicated across income groups, the effect of increasing the price of SSBs on purchases of other beverages shows some variance by income group, particularly for the high-income versus the low- and medium-income groups. In the high-income group, increases in the price of high-sugar SSBs decreases the purchase of cider (0·5% for 1% price increase), while in the middle-income group it reduces the purchases of spirits (0.2% for 1% price increase) but no decrease is evident in alcohol purchases in the low-income group. For medium-income groups there is also an increase in lager purchase if the price of high-sugar SSB increases. For an increase in the price of medium-sugar drinks, a common pattern is seen of complementary purchases, predominantly with juice and lager, across all income groups; although of different magnitudes.

Augmented Synthetic Control Estimates for Composite Changes in Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Price and Sales Volume

A, This panel shows the percentage change in shelf prices (in US dollars) in response to implementing an excise SSB tax for the staggered adoption composite analysis. B, This panel shows the percentage change in volume sold (in oz). The blue line represents the composite treated unit, and the gray lines represent in-space placebo estimates from the donor pool, which comprise untaxed localities. Percentage changes are calculated for the average of the pretreatment means of each of the 5 treated localities. The light blue dotted line represents the start of the SSB tax. The composite effect size estimates and P values are provided in each panel.

Each city in the composite analysis was equally weighted. The procedure and context through which each city introduced an SSB tax varies, and the findings are intended for policymakers considering tax implementation in specific geographies. The population-weighted composite estimates are similar (eFigures 8 and 9 in Supplement 1).

The analyses for different urbanicity cutoffs generated similar results (eFigures 10 and 13 in Supplement 1). In Supplement 1, eFigures 5 and 6 show the individual city ASC analyses.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^c8cade33]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

The full dataset consists of 31 919 households, of which 80% appear in both years (25,535), providing ~6 million beverage purchases disaggregated at the brand and package level, which were aggregated into 11 distinct beverage groups for this study: (i) high-sugar drinks, containing more than 8 g sugar/100 mL (assuming a dilution rate of 1:4 as used by the British Soft Drinks Association for concentrated SSBs); (ii) medium-sugar drinks, with 5–8 g sugar/100 mL; (iii) diet/low-sugar drinks, with less than 5 g sugar/100 mL; (iv) fruit juices; (v) milk-based drinks (excluding pure milk); (vi) water; (vii) beer; (viii) lager; (ix) cider; (x) wines; and (xi) spirits. Note that the high-, medium-, and low-sugar drinks are grouped to match the structure of the proposed levy on sugary drinks producers in the UK which will be enacted in April 2018. As many beverages are storable and not purchased very frequently, data was aggregated at 4 week intervals for each household, providing a total of 575 965 household-month observations. Even at this level of aggregation, a substantial amount of zero expenditure months remain, as most households do not buy beverages from each category of drinks every month, and some households never buy certain categories during the whole sample period (ranging from 15% for fruit juices to over 50% for cider). A two-step procedure was followed to take account of this censoring of the dependent variable in the estimation strategy. The AIDS approach was adapted for the panel data context to allow control for unobserved household heterogeneity via a fixed effects specification. The full specification, including the procedures for handling censoring, endogeneity of prices and total expenditure, and estimation of price elasticities is provided in online supplementary appendix 1.

### Policies to solve the salt problem [^b2b3b668]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diets high in sodium have long been known to raise blood pressure, which, in turn, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Though authoritative recommendations have been made in the past several decades for federal policies and programs to reduce sodium consumption, measures adopted to date have not been effective. We recommend a comprehensive public health approach to reduce sodium in the food supply and prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths and billions of dollars in health-care costs each year.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^8f1c499a]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Of more interest, is the impact on alcohol purchases when the price of SSBs increases. Figures 1–4 present the (statically significant, P < 0.05) impacts on alcohol beverage purchase from a change in price of (high- and medium-sugar) SSBs for the total sample (figure 1) and then for each income group (figures 2–4).

### Healthy-lifestyle behaviors associated with overweight and obesity in US rural children [^e5f2e884]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Approximately 40% of parents reported that their child eats less than 2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day compared to the average 2 servings of fruits and 2.5 servings of vegetables that are recommended. This is also similar to what others have found in that most children do not consume the recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables to support a healthy diet. A 2010 study of 5–11 year old children (n = 3761) enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that on average, children consume 1.4 servings of fruits and 2.4 servings of vegetables per day. Another recent study reported that households below 350% of the federal poverty level were at higher risk for consuming energy-dense fruits and vegetables (i.e. fruit juice and french fries). Overall, our findings suggest that most children do not meet recommendations for physical activity, screen time and diet. Our study shows that rural children over consume calories from soda and sugar sweetened beverages, which is similar to findings from other studies. Almost all of the parents reported that their child consumes at least one soda and one sugar-sweetened beverage per day. Given that each additional 8-oz serving of sugar-sweetened beverage can correspond to an increase of 106 calories per day, rural children in the CHANGE Study may be consuming up to 200 discretionary calories per day from beverages. If this is over and above caloric requirement for normal growth and development, it could help explain the high rates of overweight and obesity seen in the population.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^23022b8f]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

What is already known on this subject

The WHO promotes taxation on tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods, and particularly sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) as a central government tool to reduce their consumption and prevent non-communicable diseases. Alcohol has been highly taxed for decades in many countries and there is by now a large body of literature on the price responsiveness for alcoholic drinks. With increasing interest in fiscal measures on unhealthy food and drink, research on the demand for SSB has grown over the past three decades. But, the demand interrelationships between them are unknown; important as both contribute to energy intake and come with their own set of health risks.

What this study adds

This is the first study to analyse the demand for non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages in the same analysis, based on data from a representative sample of ~32 000 GB households for 2012–2013 providing ~6 million individual beverage purchases for at-home consumption, which are aggregated into 11 beverage groups. The study highlights the complexity of estimating the impact of a single price increase, for example, for SSBs. Increasing the price of SSBS has the potential to both decrease and increase the purchase of alcohol, suggesting more nuanced price options across a range of beverages may be more effective than a single tax on high-sugar beverages.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^b00cdc9a]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Sodium reduction intervention

We modeled the effects and costs of a 10 year government "soft regulation" policy to reduce population sodium consumption (see supplementary eTable 1 for details of the model assumptions). The intervention program was modeled on recent experience in the UKand included government supported industry agreements to reduce sodium in processed foods, government monitoring of industry compliance, and a public health campaign targeting consumer choices. In the UK, for example, this intervention was based on collaboration between national government offices focused on nutrition (Food Standards Agency) and health (ministers of public health), together with non-governmental advocacy organizations (Consensus Action on Salt & Health). The program applied sustained pressure on food manufacturers to pursue progressive reformulation, reinforced by food group specific targets, independent monitoring, and a sustained media campaign against excess salt intake. The program we modeled was thus more robust and costly than simple "voluntary reformulation."

We assumed the intervention would scale up linearly over 10 years, with one 10th of the total sodium reduction in the first year, two 10ths in the second, and so on, reaching full efficacy in the final year. We recognized that alternative programs, such as mandatory regulation, would likely have larger effects, reduce sodium consumption more quickly, and at lower cost, but may be less politically feasible in many countries.

### Cost effectiveness of a sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax in the U.S [^a94f57b2]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption through taxation is a promising public health response to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. This study quantifies the expected health and economic benefits of a national sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax of $0.01/ounce over 10 years.

Methods

A cohort model was used to simulate the impact of the tax on BMI. Assuming ongoing implementation and effect maintenance, quality-adjusted life-years gained and disability-adjusted life-years and healthcare costs averted were estimated over the 2015–2025 period for the 2015 U.S.

Population

Costs and health gains were discounted at 3% annually. Data were analyzed in 2014.

Results

Implementing the tax nationally would cost $51 million in the first year. The tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 20% and mean BMI by 0.16 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 0.06, 0.37) units among youth and 0.08 (95% UI = 0.03, 0.20) units among adults in the second year for a cost of $3.16 (95% UI = $1.24, $8.14) per BMI unit reduced. From 2015 to 2025, the policy would avert 101,000 disability-adjusted life-years (95% UI = 34,800, 249,000); gain 871,000 quality-adjusted life-years (95% UI = 342,000, 2,030,000); and result in $23.6 billion (95% UI = $9.33 billion, $54.9 billion) in healthcare cost savings. The tax would generate $12.5 billion in annual revenue (95% UI = $8.92, billion, $14.1 billion).

Conclusions

The proposed tax could substantially reduce BMI and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy. Concerns regarding the potentially regressive tax may be addressed by reduced obesity disparities and progressive earmarking of tax revenue for health promotion.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^7db7db80]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Sweet-tasting products — nonnutritive sweeteners may have a role: "Additional improvements in nutrient density of sweet-tasting products could be obtained if nonnutritive sweeteners are used as a tool to replace added sugars and help lower caloric intake." The document notes, "Several nonnutritive sweeteners have been accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration as safe and have shown good safety over time," yet "data are scarce on long-term benefits for weight management in children and adolescents or on the consequences of long-term consumption." It concludes, "Continued research is needed."

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^ceada962]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Globally, the estimated average cost effectiveness ratio of the 10 year intervention was approximately I$204 per DALY saved (95% uncertainty interval I$149 to I$322) (table 1). This did not include potential savings from lower healthcare costs or higher productivity owing to averted cardiovascular disease events, which would each further improve the estimated cost effectiveness. The estimated cost effectiveness ratio was lowest (best) in lower middle income (I$111, I$81 to I$175) and upper middle income countries (I$146, I$109 to I$223), higher in low income countries (I$215, I$139 to I$400), and highest in high income countries (I$465, I$341 to I$724). By region, the lowest cost effectiveness ratios were in South Asia and East/Southeast Asia (I$116 and I$123, respectively). In Central Asia/Eastern and Central Europe, high intervention efficacy partly offset its higher projected cost, generating the next best cost effectiveness ratio (I$211, I$157 to I$324).

Table 1
Cost effectiveness by income and geographic region of a national government supported policy intervention to reduce sodium consumption by 10% over 10 years*

DALYs = disability adjusted life years; UI = uncertainty interval; SBP = systolic blood pressure; GDP = gross domestic product; CVD = cardiovascular disease; CHD = coronary heart disease.

*National program including: public health campaign targeting consumer knowledge and choices, government supported industry agreements to reduce sodium in processed foods to specific targets, and government monitoring of industry compliance. These results reflect the total effect over a 10 year policy intervention that includes planning (year 1), development (year 2), partial implementation (years 3–5), and full implementation (years 6–10). To enable comparisons between countries, all costs were evaluated in international dollars (I$), accounting for each nation's currency and purchasing power parity. One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower income than in the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per DALY saved would be much lower).

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^bdb23cde]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Added sugars and health outcomes — the page states that added sugars offer no nutritional benefits while noting sugars themselves are not necessarily harmful; it warns that at extreme intake levels of more than 25% to 30% of total calories, sugars can displace other nutrients; it cites the DGA Advisory Committee that under isocaloric controlled conditions, added sugars, including sugar-sweetened beverages, are no more likely than other energy sources to cause weight gain and reports no causative connection with type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart disease, or behavioral disorders; reviews found a nonlinear relationship with nutrient content and that even a moderately high intake was not necessarily associated with decrements; care is advised when prohibiting sugar-containing products in children; and the form of added sugars matters, with soft drinks, sugar, and sweets more likely to negatively affect diet quality, whereas dairy foods, milk drinks, and presweetened cereals may have a positive impact.

### The impact of a sweetened beverage tax on beverage volume sold in cook county, Illinois, and its border area [^e7edc5b0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is linked to adverse health outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of the 2017 Cook County, Illinois, Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT) on the volume of taxed and untaxed beverages sold in Cook County and its 2-mile border area.

Design

Pre-post intervention-comparison site difference-in-differences study.

Setting

Cook County, Illinois, and St. Louis City and County, Missouri, 2016 to 2017.

Participants

Universal product code-level store scanner data from supermarkets and grocery, convenience, drug, mass merchandise, and dollar stores.

Measurements

Beverage volume sold of taxed and untaxed beverages, across product categories and sizes.

Results

Volume sold of taxed beverages decreased by 27% (ratio of incidence rate ratios [RIRR], 0.73 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.75]) on average in Cook County relative to St. Louis during the 4 months that the SBT was in effect (compared with the same 4-month pretax period), with a net decrease of 21% after increases in volume sold in its border area (cross-border shopping) were taken into account. The magnitude of the decrease in volume sold across types of taxed beverages was heterogeneous: -32% (RIRR, 0.68 [CI, 0.65 to 0.72]) for soda versus -11% (RIRR, 0.89 [CI, 0.82 to 0.97]) for energy drinks, -37% (RIRR, 0.63 [CI, 0.59 to 0.66]) for artificially sweetened beverages versus -25% (RIRR, 0.75 [CI, 0.72 to 0.79]) for SSBs, and -29% (RIRR, 0.71 [CI, 0.68 to 0.74]) for family-size versus -19% (RIRR, 0.81 [CI, 0.79 to 0.84]) for individual-size beverages. There was no significant change in volume sold of untaxed beverages in Cook County or its border area.

Limitation

Data source did not allow for evaluation by store type or distance of outlets from the border.

Conclusion

The Cook County SBT led to a substantial reduction in the volume sold of taxed beverages in Cook County. Part of this effect was offset by cross-border shopping. Cross-border shopping was limited to tax avoidance and did not extend to untaxed beverages.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^39467b4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Frequent consumption of excess amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is a risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dental caries. Environmental interventions, i.e. interventions that alter the physical or social environment in which individuals make beverage choices, have been advocated as a means to reduce the consumption of SSB.

Objectives

To assess the effects of environmental interventions (excluding taxation) on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened milk, diet-related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, and on any reported unintended consequences or adverse outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched 11 general, specialist and regional databases from inception to 24 January 2018. We also searched trial registers, reference lists and citations, scanned websites of relevant organisations, and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included studies on interventions implemented at an environmental level, reporting effects on direct or indirect measures of SSB intake, diet-related anthropometric measures and health outcomes, or any reported adverse outcome. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) and interrupted-time-series (ITS) studies, implemented in real-world settings with a combined length of intervention and follow-up of at least 12 weeks and at least 20 individuals in each of the intervention and control groups. We excluded studies in which participants were administered SSB as part of clinical trials, and multicomponent interventions which did not report SSB-specific outcome data. We excluded studies on the taxation of SSB, as these are the subject of a separate Cochrane Review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risks of bias of included studies. We classified interventions according to the NOURISHING framework, and synthesised results narratively and conducted meta-analyses for two outcomes relating to two intervention types. We assessed our confidence in the certainty of effect estimates with the GRADE framework as very low, low, moderate or high, and presented 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified 14,488 unique records, and assessed 1030 in full text for eligibility. We found 58 studies meeting our inclusion criteria, including 22 RCTs, 3 NRCTs, 14 CBA studies, and 19 ITS studies, with a total of 1,180,096 participants. The median length of follow-up was 10 months. The studies included children, teenagers and adults, and were implemented in a variety of settings, including schools, retailing and food service establishments. We judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain, and most studies used non-randomised designs. The studies examine a broad range of interventions, and we present results for these separately. Labelling interventions (8 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that traffic-light labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs, and low-certainty evidence that nutritional rating score labelling is associated with decreasing sales of SSBs. For menu-board calorie labelling reported effects on SSB sales varied. Nutrition standards in public institutions (16 studies): We found low-certainty evidence that reduced availability of SSBs in schools is associated with decreased SSB consumption. We found very low-certainty evidence that improved availability of drinking water in schools and school fruit programmes are associated with decreased SSB consumption. Reported associations between improved availability of drinking water in schools and student body weight varied. Economic tools (7 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that price increases on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. For price discounts on low-calorie beverages reported effects on SSB sales varied. Whole food supply interventions (3 studies): Reported associations between voluntary industry initiatives to improve the whole food supply and SSB sales varied. Retail and food service interventions (7 studies): We found low-certainty evidence that healthier default beverages in children's menus in chain restaurants are associated with decreasing SSB sales, and moderate-certainty evidence that in-store promotion of healthier beverages in supermarkets is associated with decreasing SSB sales. We found very low-certainty evidence that urban planning restrictions on new fast-food restaurants and restrictions on the number of stores selling SSBs in remote communities are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between promotion of healthier beverages in vending machines and SSB intake or sales varied. Intersectoral approaches (8 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that government food benefit programmes with restrictions on purchasing SSBs are associated with decreased SSB intake. For unrestricted food benefit programmes reported effects varied. We found moderate-certainty evidence that multicomponent community campaigns focused on SSBs are associated with decreasing SSB sales. Reported associations between trade and investment liberalisation and SSB sales varied. Home-based interventions (7 studies): We found moderate-certainty evidence that improved availability of low-calorie beverages in the home environment is associated with decreased SSB intake, and high-certainty evidence that it is associated with decreased body weight among adolescents with overweight or obesity and a high baseline consumption of SSBs. Adverse outcomes reported by studies, which may occur in some circumstances, included negative effects on revenue, compensatory SSB consumption outside school when the availability of SSBs in schools is reduced, reduced milk intake, stakeholder discontent, and increased total energy content of grocery purchases with price discounts on low-calorie beverages, among others. The certainty of evidence on adverse outcomes was low to very low for most outcomes. We analysed interventions targeting sugar-sweetened milk separately, and found low- to moderate-certainty evidence that emoticon labelling and small prizes for the selection of healthier beverages in elementary school cafeterias are associated with decreased consumption of sugar-sweetened milk. We found low-certainty evidence that improved placement of plain milk in school cafeterias is not associated with decreasing sugar-sweetened milk consumption.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence included in this review indicates that effective, scalable interventions addressing SSB consumption at a population level exist. Implementation should be accompanied by high-quality evaluations using appropriate study designs, with a particular focus on the long-term effects of approaches suitable for large-scale implementation.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^151ac2d9]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

The responsiveness to price change for high- and medium-sugar drinks is slightly higher in low-income groups, especially relative to high-income groups and there are several significant impacts on expenditure shares for other beverages, including alcoholic purchases, which encompass a wider selection of alcoholic products. With one exception, these relationships are all complementary, indicating a reduction in alcohol purchase as the price of SSB increases, thus conferring potentially greater health benefits to those on lower incomes. However, most of this effect is driven by changes in price to the medium-sugar drinks.

The marked difference between those soft-drinks containing medium versus high levels of sugar is worth noting. Most policy, enacted or proposed, and research to date, has only distinguished between no or low-sugar beverages and 'sugar-sweetened' beverages, and so produced a binary relationship. The analysis presented here however indicates that collapsing SSBs into no-sugar versus sugar drinks may lose important nuances, and significantly that a price increase only on high-sugar content beverages will have a far lower cumulative effect than price increases which also include medium sugar drinks. Together with the likely adverse impact on alcohol purchases from increasing the price of diet/low-sugar beverages, policy may be more effective through a more nuanced consideration of price options across a range of beverages as in the soft drink industry levy proposed for the UK.

### Effect of front-of-package information, fruit imagery, and high-added sugar warning labels on parent beverage choices for children: a randomized clinical trial [^23fc338e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Beverage Choice

Compared with participants in the control group, among whom a mean (SE) 41.0% (1.8%) chose a high–added sugar beverage, fewer participants chose a high–added sugar beverage for their child in conditions with no 100% vitamin C claim or fruit imagery (absolute difference: −7.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −12.6 to −2.6 percentage points [relative difference: −18.4%; 95% CI, −30.6% to −6.3%]; P = 0.003) and with warnings (high–added sugar warning only: −5.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.5 to −0.5 percentage points [−13.4%; 95% CI, −25.6% to −1.2%]; P = 0.03; warning and teaspoons of added sugar disclosure: −6.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −11.4 to −1.4 percentage points [−15.6%; 95% CI, −27.8% to 3.3%]; P = 0.01) (Table 2; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). These results were largely driven by reduced selection of high–added sugar fruit drinks and increased selection of no–added sugar fruit drinks; there were no significant differences in selection of low–added sugar fruit drinks, 100% juice, soda, milk, or water between control and experimental groups (Figure 3 A; eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Among participants who chose high–added sugar fruit drinks, selection of bottles vs pouches did not differ between groups (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).

### The use of nonnutritive sweeteners in children [^29ebbfec]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Nonnutritive sweeteners and children with obesity — weight outcomes evidence is mixed across study designs. NNSs "pass through the human gastrointestinal tract without being digested, providing sweet taste without added calories," yet "the data are conflicting as to whether consuming NNSs leads to weight loss or weight gain." Cross-sectional pediatric studies "reported positive associations between NNS intake and BMI (ie, high NNS intake is associated with higher BMI)," but "results from longitudinal follow-up are conflicting." A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported that replacing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with NNSs in school-aged children was "associated with reduced weight gain (not weight loss) during an 18-month period." Additional studies include adults with overweight "(eg, mean age 19 years)" showing greater weight reduction with aspartame versus control, and a South Africa youth study where "intake of 25 mg of sucralose per day by youth 6 to 11 years of age was associated with a lower BMI-for-age z score… compared with sugar intake." Prospective pediatric cohorts are mixed: one in "2- to 5-year-olds (n = 1345)" "did not identify an association," with "intake of diet soda… low (< 5 oz per day)," whereas another among school-aged youth "(n = 164)" found that "for each 12 oz of diet soda consumed per day, there was a 2-year BMI z score that was 0.156 higher than predicted on the basis of baseline-BMI z score."

### Sodium intake among persons aged ≥ 2 years-United States, 2013–2014 [^217e3c8d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

† A measure that accounts for differences in the amount of calories consumed from foods obtained from each source, defined as mg of sodium per 1,000 kcal.

§ Food source categories were analyzed from responses to the question, "Where did you get this (most of the ingredients for this) [food name]?" "Cafeteria at school" and "child care center" were combined in one category. Sources other than those shown were combined under "other" and included "from someone else/gift", and 19 other sources (e.g. vending machine), including "missing," "do not know," and "other/specify".

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^3035b42f]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

†Income categorizations are based on the World Bank classification system.

As expected, cost effectiveness ratios were sensitive to variations in estimated intervention cost. We evaluated the proportion of the world's adult population living in countries with a cost effectiveness ratio (I$/DALY) < 0.05×GDP per capita and < 0.5×GDP per capita, for varying intervention costs that were 25%, 50%, 150%, 200%, or 500% of baseline cost estimates (see supplementary eFigure 3). For a 10% reduction in sodium intake, under the base case scenario for cost estimates, 89% of the global adult population would live in countries with a cost effectiveness ratio < 0.05×GDP per capita. This decreased to 23% of the global adult population if costs were fivefold higher, 68% if costs were twofold higher, and 85% if costs were 1.5-fold higher. In contrast, 96% of the global adult population would live in countries with a cost effectiveness ratio < 0.05×GDP per capita if costs were half as large, and 99% if costs were one quarter as large. For a 30% reduction in sodium intake, the corresponding figures for a benchmark of < 0.05×GDP per capita were 85%, 92%, 96%, 98%, 99.1%, and 99.3% of the global adult population based on intervention costs that were 500%, 200%, 150%, 50%, or 25% of the baseline cost estimates, respectively. We also made comparisons against a cost effectiveness ratio benchmark < 0.5×GDP per capita, still substantially below the WHO criterion of 1×GDP per capita as highly cost effective. For a 10% reduction in sodium intake, even if the intervention costs were fivefold greater than the baseline estimate, 96% of the world's population would live in countries with a cost effectiveness ratio < 0.5×GDP per capita; and for a 30% reduction in sodium intake, 99% would.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^422e482f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

SSB sales (two ITS studies, moderate‐certainty evidence)

Boelsen‐Robinson 2017 reports that baseline sales of red‐labelled beverages (mainly SSB) were 2343 items/months, or 62% of all beverage items sold through vending machines on hospital premises. One year after the intervention was implemented, the number of red‐labelled beverages sold decreased by −56% (95% confidence interval (CI) −67 to −45), and the volume of red‐labelled beverages sold decreased by −61% (95% CI −73 to −49) compared to a counterfactual scenario based on pre‐intervention trends adjusted for seasonal effects and autocorrelation. The total volume of red‐labelled beverage sales was 1263 l/month at baseline, and decreased by −61% (95% CI −73 to −49). The total amount of sugar in all beverages sold was 129 kg/month at baseline, and decreased by −69% (95% CI −82 to −56). For the number of red‐labelled beverage items outcome data are also shown graphically, illustrating that the steepest reduction occurred at the time point when the intervention was implemented, and that the reduction persisted throughout the follow‐up period of one year.

Hartigan 2017 reports that the share of sold beverage items labelled red (mainly SSB) decreased from 56% at baseline to 32% at the end of the data collection period, i.e. 15 months post‐intervention (P < 0.001), from which we calculated a decrease of −25 percentage points. The study does not report the absolute number of red‐labelled beverages sold at baseline or post‐intervention. The study does not report if baseline trends and seasonality were taken into account in the analyses, and a graphical representation of the data suggests that the share of red‐labelled beverages may have already been declining at baseline. Underlying trends may therefore have contributed to the observed effects.

### Dietary and economic effects of eliminating shortfall in fruit intake on nutrient intakes and diet cost [^fa26955e]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Beyond economic constraints, there are additional challenges in increasing whole fruit consumption among children. One factor that might drive a preference for fruit juice over whole fruit includes the ease of storage, preparation and portioning, which may be particularly important in institutional settings. Spoilage and wastage due to over-ripening of fresh fruit is also a challenge. According to USDA estimates, 25% of fresh fruit at the consumer level is lost due to over-ripening or spoilage, compared to 11% for processed fruits (which includes fruit juice along with canned and frozen fruit). Furthermore, fruit juices may be more convenient for parents and caregivers who have time constraints and may look for easy and quick options. Beyond individual-level barriers, there is some evidence that individuals residing in more deprived neighborhoods may have limited access to fresh fruits at local stores, which may influence fresh/whole fruit consumption. In addition, while access to whole/fresh fruit in stores may vary by neighborhood characteristic and type of store, fruit juice is generally available.

This study had a number of limitations. First, the consequences of adding whole fruit and fruit juice to diets of children to remove any shortfall in fruit consumption fails to measure the actual dietary behavior of children/adolescents. As such, our findings represent an estimate of the potential dietary and economic impact of adding fruit juice/whole fruit to the diets of children/adolescents. As a related issue, this model often included small amounts of juice (e.g. 1–2 fluid ounces), which would be difficult to consume in a real-world setting, where most children likely consume juice from larger cups or packages. A second limitation is that our models did not explore other potential substitution scenarios that may improve diet quality for children/adolescents. For example, replacing snacks foods or desserts with whole fruit would further reduce total energy intake, increase nutrient density and fruit consumption, while reducing consumption of added sugars, sodium or solid fats. Determining the foods to replace with fruit is a subjective exercise, and may fail to capture probable dietary behaviors. In addition, this analysis did not evaluate the nutritional or economic consequences of altering other components of the diet, such as increasing vegetable or whole grain consumption. Third, the monetary cost of adding whole fruit and fruit juice to the diets of children is based on a single, nationally representative database of prices that does not account for seasonal or regional variations in food prices, or difference in prices between stores and restaurants.

Smart Snacks in School — beverage requirements permit specific drinks and portion sizes: "Schools may sell plain or carbonated water; unflavored low-fat milk, unflavored or flavored fat-free milk and milk alternatives… and 100% fruit and/or vegetable juice… containing no added sweeteners," and, except for water, "portion sizes are limited to 8 oz in elementary schools and 12 oz in middle and high schools." In high schools, additional options include calorie-free drinks "(≤ 5 kcal per 8-oz serving and up to 10 kcal per 20-oz serving size)," and for smaller servings one option is "other beverages in ≤ 12-oz servings: one is beverages with < 40 kcal per 8 oz or ≤ 60 kcal per 12 oz."

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^a87ad2d5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Lifestyle and behavioral factors associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms include beverage choices, timing, and weight. In the Nurses' Health Study, "Six servings of coffee, tea, and soda were associated with increased reflux symptoms compared with zero servings per day," and "Substituting water for 2 servings of coffee, tea, and soda was associated with a decrease in GERD symptoms." Weight-related data show that "Weight gain has been associated with the new onset of GERD symptoms," and a Norwegian population-based study "assessed weight and GERD symptoms at baseline and 10 years later and identified a dose-dependent improvement in GERD symptoms with weight loss." One study "documented a 40% reduction in frequent GERD symptoms in women who reduced their BMI by 3.5 or more compared with controls," and "A meta-analysis suggests that weight loss in overweight patients, avoidance of eating before going to sleep, and smoking cessation are effective in relief of GERD symptoms."

Risk of bias in included studies

Following the procedures outlined in Assessment of risk of bias in included studies, we made a summary 'Risk of bias' assessment for each outcome. We classified seven studies from the 65 that measured consumption as at overall high risk of bias with respect to this outcome (Ahn 2010; Diliberti 2004; Goldstein 2006; Huss 2013; Mishra 2012 (S1); Raynor 2009; Wansink 2005d), with the remaining 58 studies classified as at overall unclear risk of bias. We classified nine of the 13 studies that measured selection (without purchase) as at overall unclear risk of bias with respect to this outcome (DiSantis 2013; Fisher 2003; Fisher 2013; Koh 2009; van Kleef 2012; Wansink 2003 (S1); Wansink 2003 (S2); Wansink 2006; Wansink 2011a (S4)), with four at high risk of bias (Wansink 1996a (S1); Wansink 1996b (S2); Wansink 1996c (S4); Wansink 2005d).

Decisions regarding individual domains within the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool are summarised below.

### Trends in beverage consumption among high school students-United States, 2007–2015 [^4f6341a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Beverages play an important role in the diets of adolescents because they help to maintain hydration and can provide important nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin C (1). However, some beverages, such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (e.g., soda or pop), provide calories with no beneficial nutrients. Beverage consumption patterns among American youth have changed over time; however, little is known about differences in consumption of various beverages by demographic characteristics such as grade in school, free/reduced price lunch eligibility, and race/ethnicity (2). CDC analyzed data from the 2007–2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) to assess whether the prevalence of drinking non-diet soda or pop (soda), milk, and 100% fruit juice (juice) has significantly changed over time among U.S. high school students. During 2007–2015, daily soda consumption decreased significantly from 33.8% to 20.5%. During 2007–2011, daily milk and juice consumption did not significantly change, but during 2011–2015 daily milk and juice consumption decreased from 44.3% to 37.4% and from 27.2% to 21.6%, respectively. Although a decrease in daily soda consumption is a positive change, soda consumption remains high. Although there is not a specific recommendation for sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020 recommend that U.S. residents reduce sugar-sweetened beverage and sweet consumption to reduce intake of added sugars to less than 10% of calories per day. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015–2020 recommend that persons choose beverages with no added sugars, such as water, in place of sugar-sweetened beverages, as one strategy for achieving the added sugars recommendation. Adolescents might need additional support in choosing more healthful beverages, such as low-fat milk, in place of SSBs.

### Diet soda intake and risk of incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^67fe9ca4]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition as the presence of three or more of the following: 1) waist ≥ 102 (men) or ≥ 88 cm (women), 2) triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl (for millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113), 3) HDL cholesterol ≤ 40 (men) or ≤ 50 mg/dl (women) (for millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), 4) blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg or antihypertensive treatment, and 5) fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl or antihyperglycemic treatment. Participants completed standardized medical history questionnaires ascertaining medication use and previous diagnoses and provided samples for quantification of fasting insulin and lipids. Waist circumference was measured at the umbilicus using a standard tape measure. BMI was calculated from measured weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Resting seated blood pressure was measured three times using a Dinamap model Pro 100 automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Critikon, Tampa, FL). The average of the last two measurements was used in analysis.

Dietary intake

Diet was assessed at the baseline examination via a food frequency questionnaire. Diet soda intake was quantified from an item listing "Diet soft drinks, unsweetened mineral water" (hereafter referred to as diet soda). Sugar-sweetened soda intake was quantified from an item listing "Regular soft drinks, soda, sweetened mineral water (not diet), nonalcoholic beer" (hereafter referred to as sugar-sweetened soda). Frequency response options for these items were the following: rare/never, 1–3/month, 1/week, 2–4/week, 5–6/week, 1/day, 2–3/day, 4–5/day, or 6+/day. Participants reported serving size as small, medium, or large (weighted as intake frequency × 0.5, × 1.0, and × 1.5 for small, medium, and large, respectively). Intake of diet soda or regular soda was characterized as rare/never, > rare/never but < 1 serving/week, > 1 serving/week but < 1 serving/day, and ≥ 1 serving/day. Participants who provided unreliable dietary information were excluded from analyses (n = 630).

### Diet soda intake and risk of incident metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^c7405316]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (PROC tPHREG in SAS 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We assumed the incidence date to be the date of the examination at which type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome was first identified. When estimating HR for incident type 2 diabetes, we excluded participants with prevalent type 2 diabetes (n = 859) and those whose prevalent type 2 diabetes status was unknown or could not be updated over follow-up (n = 328). When estimating HR for incident metabolic syndrome, we excluded individuals with prevalent metabolic syndrome (n = 2,241) and those whose metabolic syndrome status was unknown at baseline or could not be updated over follow-up (n = 226). When estimating HR for a given metabolic syndrome component, we excluded participants meeting the criteria for that component at baseline. Sample sizes for these analyses are shown in.

Model 1 adjusted for baseline age, sex, race/ethnicity, examination site, and energy intake. Model 2 added additional possible socioeconomic or lifestyle confounders: attained education (less than, equal to, or more than high school), time spent in inactive and active pursuits during leisure (MET-minutes per week), smoking status (current, former, or never smoker), pack-years, and regular dietary supplement use (weekly use or more versus nonweekly use). We also explored the impact of adjustment for various dietary factors (specifically, those associated with both diet soda consumption and type 2 diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome in ours or previous studies), such as food intakes (servings per day of whole grain bread/rice/cereal/pasta, nuts/seeds, fruit, vegetables, white potatoes, refined grain bread/rice/cereal/pasta, salty snacks, desserts, red meat, processed meat, high-fat dairy products, low-fat dairy products, sugar-sweetened soda, and coffee) or nutrient intakes (fiber, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and sodium). Finally, to assess the contribution of adiposity, we adjusted for 1) baseline waist circumference (continuous, in centimeters), baseline BMI (continuous), or both (single model); 2) change in waist circumference or body weight (most recent measurement − baseline measurement); and 3) stratification by BMI (< 25 and ≥ 25 kg/m 2).

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^b9b18f00]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Change in the demand if price of SSBs increases (mid-income sample; N = 287 966). High-sugar SSBs include > 8g of sugar per 100mL; medium-sugar SSBs include 5–8g of sugar/100mL and low-sugar SSBs have < 5g of sugar/100mL.

Figure 4
Change in the demand if price of SSBs increases (high-income sample; N = 89 535). High-sugar SSBs include > 8g of sugar per 100mL; medium-sugar SSBs include 5–8g of sugar/100mL and low-sugar SSBs have < 5g of sugar/100mL.

In aggregate across all income groups (figure 1) there are clear differences by category of SSB. Increases in the price of high-sugar SSBs are associated with increased purchases of diet drinks, juice and lager (ie, they act as substitutes), whereas they decrease purchases of medium-sugar SSBs and spirits (ie, they act as complements). Increases in the price of medium-sugar SSBs impacts across a wider range (high-sugar SSBs, juice, water, beer, lager, wines and spirits), although all categories affected witness reduced purchasing (ie, a consistent complementary relationship of ~0·1% for a 1% price increase). Increases in the price of diet/low sugar SSBs increases the purchases for all other categories (with the exception of the two other SSB categories), ranging from 0·1% for juice to 0·7% for milk-based drinks and spirits per 1% price increase.

Abstract

Recently the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine reported a summary of recommendations from high-income countries on what and how to feed infants and children from birth to 2 years of age. The report notes generally consistent recommendations against providing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), juice, and beverages that contain nonnutritive sweeteners to infants and children younger than 2 years. When counselling parents and other caregivers, pediatricians should feel empowered to advise against offering these beverages.

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^230cf212]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Sources of heterogeneity

Differences in intervention costs were one of the major drivers of varying cost effectiveness ratios. The large variation of human resource and mass media costs across countries suggests potential savings from multinational efforts to reduce sodium intake, which could benefit from economies of scale. For instance, the new European Union Salt Reduction Framework, which monitors national sodium reduction initiatives and supports implementation efforts across multiple member nations, could be emulated elsewhere. Consistent with the relevance of scale, the 20 countries with highest per capita intervention costs all had national populations of less than 500 000 adults. The higher cost of mass media, compared with other intervention components, further suggests a need for research on how best to target such resources. The recent findingthat salt reduction in the UK arose largely from product reformulation rather than changes in consumer choice suggests that, in countries where most dietary sodium comes from processed food (eg, 77% in the US), the robustness and compliance with industry targets may be more relevant than mass media components. On the other hand, public awareness of sodium in foods and health effects could be essential for generating sufficient public and policy maker pressure on industry to meet stated targets. In nations with lower proportions of manufactured food, industry focused efforts might lead to smaller absolute reductions in sodium intake. Yet many such countries also have lower baseline levels of sodium consumption, so that proportional reductions might be similar. In comparison, for certain Asian nations such as China, substantial amounts of sodium are added at home, making education and media efforts more relevant. Nevertheless, even with an up to fivefold increase in total costs, our multinational investigation suggests that a government supported program to reduce sodium intake would be highly cost effective for nearly every country in the world.

Our findings were robust to differing thresholds for optimal sodium intake. While the precise optimal level of sodium intake remains uncertain, to our knowledge ours is the first cost effectiveness analysis to evaluate the relevance of this uncertainty to policy. We found that this threshold influences relative cost effectiveness only in countries with the lowest intakes, with little effect in most others. For example, cost effectiveness ratios increase notably in Sub-Saharan Africa when the threshold is raised from 2.0 g/day to 3.0 g/day, but relatively little in most other nations (table 2).

C. Economic tools

We included seven studies on economic tools other than taxation, including studies on:

C.1 Price increases on SSB (Blake 2018; Breeze 2018; Cornelsen 2017);
C.2 Financial incentives to purchase low‐calorie beverages implemented through supermarket loyalty cards (Franckle 2018; Ball 2015; Ni Mhurchu 2010);
C.3 Price discounts on low‐calorie beverages in community stores (Brimblecombe 2017).

C.1 Price increases on SSB

Description of studies contributing data to this comparison

We included three ITS studies on price increases on SSB (Blake 2018; Breeze 2018; Cornelsen 2017).

In Blake 2018, prices of red‐labelled beverages (including SSB and sugar‐sweetened milk, as well as fruit juices larger than 250 mL per unit) sold in a convenience store were raised by 20%, and leaflets explaining the intervention were given to customers inquiring about the price increase. Effects on sales of red‐, amber‐ and green‐labelled beverages, as well as on total beverage revenue were assessed with routinely‐collected sales data during a 122‐week (approx. 28 months) baseline period and a 17‐week intervention phase. The intervention was implemented in one convenience store located on the premises of a public hospital in Melbourne, Australia.

In Breeze 2018, prices of SSB sold in public leisure centres were raised by GBP 0.20 (approximately EUR 0.23 or USD 0.27), equivalent to a price increase of 11% to 25%. Further intervention components included "staff training in order to deliver face to face awareness of the scheme with customers; publicity in local and national media; publicity within venues including posters, billboards and drinks stickers in café and vending areas". Effects on sales of SSB, diet beverages, water and fruit juice, and total cold beverage sales were assessed with routinely‐collected sales data during an 18‐month baseline period and a 12‐month intervention phase. The intervention was implemented in seven public leisure centres in Sheffield, UK.

### Association of a sweetened beverage tax with soda consumption in high school students [^51953922]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Sweetened beverage taxes are one policy approach to reduce intake of added sugars. Soda is the leading source of added sugars in the US diet, but few studies have examined how such taxes influence sweetened beverage intake in youth.

Objective

To estimate the association between the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beverage tax and adolescent soda intake.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation of school district-level Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data from September 2013 to December 2019 compared weekly soda intake in high school students in Philadelphia, a city with a sweetened beverage tax, with that in 7 comparison cities without beverage taxes. Difference-in-differences regression modeling was used to estimate change in soda intake in Philadelphia compared with control cities. Secondary analyses compared 100% juice and milk intake to explore potential substitution associations. Subgroup analyses evaluated differences by race and ethnicity and weight status (obesity and overweight or obesity). Analyses were performed between August 20 and October 20, 2020. School districts that had weighted data and a survey question on weekly soda intake from 2013 to 2019 were included. The study included high school students, grades 9 to 12, in school districts participating in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System from 2013 to 2019.

Exposures

Implementation of a sweetened beverage tax in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in January 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Reported weekly servings of soda, 100% juice, and milk.

Results

A total of 86 928 participants (weighted mean [SD] age, 15.8 [1.3] years; 49% female) from 8 US cities (including Philadelphia) were included. Before the tax, adolescents in the 7 comparison cities had a mean intake of 4 servings of soda per week compared with 5.4 servings per week in Philadelphia. Philadelphia's tax was associated with a reduction of 0.81 servings of soda per week (95% CI, -1.48 to -0.14 servings; P = 0.02) 2 years after tax implementation. There was no significant difference in 100% juice or milk intake, although Philadelphia adolescents consumed more juice than those in nontaxed cities. In subgroup analyses, the tax was associated with a reduction of 1.13 servings per week in Hispanic/Latinx adolescents (95% CI, -2.04 to -0.23 servings; P = 0.01) and 1.2 servings per week in adolescents with obesity (95% CI, -2.33 to -0.13 servings; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation found that a sweetened beverage tax was associated with a reduction in soda intake among adolescents, providing evidence that such taxes can improve dietary behaviors.

### Economic approaches to estimating benefits of regulations affecting addictive goods [^46109b80]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The question of how to evaluate lost consumer surplus in benefit-cost analyses has been contentious. There are clear health benefits of regulations that curb consumption of goods with health risks, such as tobacco products and foods high in fats, calories, sugar, and sodium. Yet, if regulations cause consumers to give up goods they like, the health benefits they experience may be offset by some utility loss, which benefit-cost analyses of regulations need to take into account. This paper lays out the complications of measuring benefits of regulations aiming to curb consumption of addictive and habitual goods, rooted in the fact that consumers' observed demand for such goods may not be in line with their true preferences. Focusing on the important case of tobacco products, the paper describes four possible approaches for estimating benefits when consumers' preferences may not be aligned with their behavior, and identifies one as having the best feasibility for use in applied benefit-cost analyses in the near term.

### Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among adults-18 States, 2012… [^ecbaeacb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Healthy People 2020. † Sugar-sweetened beverages are major sources of added sugars in the diets of U. S. residents. Daily SSB consumption is associated with obesity and other chronic health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. U. S. adults consumed an estimated average of 151 kcal/day of SSB during 2009–2010, with regular soda and fruit drinks representing the leading sources of SSB energy intake. However, there is limited information on state-specific prevalence of SSB consumption. To assess regular soda and fruit drink consumption among adults in 18 states, CDC analyzed data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Among the 18 states surveyed, 26. 3% of adults consumed regular soda or fruit drinks or both ≥ 1 times daily. In 2012, BRFSS included an optional module with questions about SSB consumption: "During the past 30 days, how often did you drink regular soda or pop that contains sugar.

Do not include diet soda or diet pop. " and "During the past 30 days, how often did you drink sweetened fruit drinks, such as Kool-Aid, cranberry juice cocktail, and lemonade. Include fruit drinks you made at home and added sugar to. " Respondents could report monthly, weekly, or daily consumption. All responses were subsequently converted to daily consumption. Daily intake of regular soda, fruit drinks, or both was calculated by summing the daily frequencies for regular soda and fruit drinks. Responses were categorized as none, < 1 time/day, and ≥ 1 times/day. In 2012, 26. 3% of respondents reported consuming regular soda, fruit drinks, or both ≥ 1 times daily. The prevalence among states was highest in Mississippi, followed by Tennessee. The prevalence of regular soda consumption ≥ 1 times daily was highest in Mississippi and Tennessee, and the prevalence of fruit drink consumption was highest in Nevada, Mississippi, and Tennessee. SSB such as regular soda and fruit drinks contain added sugars and are sources of calories but have few, if any, essential nutrients (.

### Evaluation of changes in prices and purchases following implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes across the US [^eb6fcdd0]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

ASC Analyses of SSB Prices and Volume Sold

In the composite treated locality, shelf prices of SSB products increased by an average of 33.1% (95% CI, 14.0%-52.2%; P < .001) in the 2 years following tax implementation, relative to the average percentage change in the composite synthetic locality. This corresponded to an average price increase of 1.3¢ per oz (Figure 2) and a 92% price pass-through rate (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). The volume of SSBs purchased declined by an average of 33.0% (95% CI, −2.2% to −63.8%; P = 0.04) during the same time frame, relative to the average percentage change in the composite synthetic locality. This corresponded to an average monthly change of 18 534 oz/store-month (Figure 2). Together, these estimates yielded a −1.00 price elasticity of demand, suggesting SSB purchasing behavior was responsive to changes in shelf prices (Figure 2). Figure 2 also shows changes in shelf prices and volume purchased for the 5 taxed localities individually. The demand elasticity estimates were relatively consistent across taxed localities, ranging from −0.80 (Philadelphia) to −1.37 (Seattle). Shelf price changes for individual cities were significant at the 10% level, yet null changes in volume purchased could not be rejected for each city at the 10% level.

Figure 2.
Composite and Individual Locality Demand Elasticity Estimates

This plot shows the percentage change in volume sold measured in ounces (orange squares) and the percentage change in shelf prices measured in US dollars (blue circles) for the augmented synthetic control with staggered adoption composite analysis. The plot shows the same information for the augmented synthetic control analyses of the 5 treated localities individually. Price elasticities of demand are provided, and 95% CIs and P values for each percentage change in price or volume are also provided.

Figure 3 A shows time-varying ASC results for SSB shelf prices, and Figure 3 B shows this information for volume sales. The blue line indicates the difference between the composite treated unit and synthetic unit, and the gray lines represent each placebo estimate. In both analyses, a close fit between the composite treated unit and synthetic unit was found in the pretax period. There was a steep, immediate increase in shelf prices and decrease in volume sales following tax implementation, which was sustained in the months thereafter.

### Healthy-lifestyle behaviors associated with overweight and obesity in US rural children [^4eb2bd9a]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, out of a total of 401 children in 1 st through 6 th grade, 49.5% were female; 46.8% were Black; 34.7% were Hispanic; 20% of mothers reported having less than a high school degree and almost 50% reported receiving government assistance (Table 2). Approximately 30% of mothers were not born in the US and 27.2% reported that Spanish was the primary language spoken at home. Forty-five percent of children were overweight and/or obese (defined as BMI z-score above the 85 th percentile for age and sex) and 23% had a BMI z-score above the 97 th percentile for age and sex. Of the 45 participants enrolled from Kentucky almost 60% were overweight or obese, in California, of 152 children, 50% of children were overweight or obese, in South Carolina of the 73 enrolled, 44% were overweight or obese and finally of the 131 enrolled in Mississippi, 37% were overweight or obese. Having more than 4 members in the household (49.7% for healthy weight versus 43.2% and 30.9% for overweight and obese, respectively) differed significantly across weight categories.

### Effect of increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages on alcoholic beverage purchases: an economic analysis of sales data [^2992064e]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2018). Low credibility.

Research suggests that increasing the price of SSBs generates a small, but significant, reduction in their purchase (broadly, a 10% price rise reduces purchase by 6%–8%), with a more pronounced effect in poorer households, and that substitution towards other soft-drink categories only minimally offsets the energy reductions achieved through decreases in SSBs. However, little is known of the potential effects on consumption of alcoholic beverages. Beer and wine provide on average 43 and 85 kcals per 100 mL, respectively, in comparison to 40 kcal in 100 mL of Cola drink. Adults in the UK on average consume 106 kcals per head per day from alcoholic drinks, compared with 98 kcal from SSB. The two studies that have considered both alcohol and SSBs have found no significant associations, but this could be due to modelling alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks separately, where consumers first allocate their expenditure between broad food and beverage categories (ie, between 'non-alcoholic drinks' and 'alcoholic drinks') and then in a second step between more disaggregate groups within these broad categories (eg, among different types of 'non-alcoholic drinks'). This restricts the ability to examine relationships between alcohol and non-alcohol-based drinks directly.

Overall, our understanding of how public policies to increase the price of SSBs may affect the consumption of alcoholic drinks, and hence total energy intake, remains very limited. The research presented here is the first to provide a direct analysis of the relationship between price increases for SSBs and alcohol purchases, across different income groups.

### Opportunities to reduce children's excessive consumption of calories from beverages [^5d087a5c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe children's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and 100% fruit juice (FJ), and identify factors that may reduce excessive consumption.

Design

A total of 830 parents of young children completed a 36-item questionnaire at the pediatricians' office.

Results

Children consumed soda (62.2%), other SSBs (61.6%), and FJ (88.2%): 26.9% exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommended daily FJ intake. 157 (18.9%) children consumed excessive calories (> 200 kcal/d) from beverages (median = 292.2 kcal/d, range 203.8–2177.0 kcal/d). Risk factors for excessive calorie consumption from beverages were exceeding recommendations for FJ (odds ratio [OR] = 119.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 52.2–274.7), being 7 to 12 years old (OR = 4.3, 95%CI = 1.9–9.9), and having Medicaid insurance (OR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.1–6.0). Parents would likely reduce beverage consumption if recommended by the physician (65.6%).

Conclusions

About 1 in 5 children consumes excessive calories from soda, other SSBs and FJ, with FJ the major contributor.

### Evaluation of changes in prices and purchases following implementation of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes across the US [^31f525cb]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes are promoted as key policies to reduce cardiometabolic diseases and other conditions, but comprehensive analyses of SSB taxes in the US have been difficult because of the absence of sufficiently large data samples and methods limitations.

Objective

To estimate changes in SSB prices and purchases following SSB taxes in 5 large US cities.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this cross-sectional study with an augmented synthetic control analysis, changes in prices and purchases of SSBs were estimated following SSB tax implementation in Boulder, Colorado; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco, California. Changes in SSB prices (in US dollars) and purchases (volume in ounces) in these cities in the 2 years following tax implementation were estimated and compared with control groups constructed from other cities. Changes in adjacent, untaxed areas were assessed to detect any increase in cross-border purchases. Data used for this analysis spanned from January 1, 2012, to February 29, 2020, and were analyzed between June 1, 2022, and September 29, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were the changes in SSB prices and volume purchased.

Results

Using nutritional information, 5500 unique universal product codes were classified as SSBs, according to tax designations. The sample included 26 338 stores-496 located in treated localities, 1340 in bordering localities, and 24 502 in the donor pool. Prices of SSBs increased by an average of 33.1% (95% CI, 14.0% to 52.2%; P < .001) during the 2 years following tax implementation, corresponding to an average price increase of 1.3¢ per oz and a 92% tax pass-through rate from distributors to consumers. SSB purchases declined in total volume by an average of 33.0% (95% CI, -2.2% to -63.8%; P = 0.04) following tax implementation, corresponding to a -1.00 price elasticity of demand. The observed price increase and corresponding volume decrease immediately followed tax implementation, and both outcomes were sustained in the months thereafter. No evidence of increased cross-border purchases following tax implementation was found.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, SSB taxes led to substantial, consistent declines in SSB purchases across 5 taxed cities following price increases associated with those taxes. Scaling SSB taxes nationally could yield substantial public health benefits.

### Soft drinks consumption is associated with behavior problems in 5-year-olds [^33f8ffd6]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine soda consumption and aggressive behaviors, attention problems, and withdrawal behavior among 5-year-old children.

Study Design

The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study is a prospective birth cohort study that follows a sample of mother-child pairs from 20 large US cities. Mothers reported children's behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist at age 5 years and were asked to report how many servings of soda the child drinks on a typical day.

Results

In the sample of 2929 children, 52% were boys, 51% were African-American, 43% consumed at least one serving of soda per day, and 4% consumed 4 or more servings per day. In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, consuming one (beta, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.1–1.4), 2 (beta, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.8–2.7), 3 (beta, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.6–3.4), or 4 or more (beta, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.2–6.2) servings was associated with a higher aggressive behavior score compared with consuming no soda. Furthermore, those who consumed 4 or more (beta, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–2.4) soda servings had higher scores on the attention problems subscale. Higher withdrawn behavior scores were noted among those consuming 2 (beta, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–1.8) or 4 or more (beta, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.8–3.1) soda servings compared with those who consumed no soda.

Conclusion

We note an association between soda consumption and negative behavior among very young children; future studies should explore potential mechanisms that could explain this association.

### Development of international criteria for a front of package food labelling system: the international choices programme [^f9a40d0b]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Definition of the actual criteria

For the product group bread, Figure 2 shows the data description and Figure 3 shows the percentage of products that comply (overall and per key-nutrient). The legend in Figure 3 shows examples of indicator foods that do or do not comply with the criteria. Statistics, distributions and plots of the key-nutrient content were used when necessary (data not shown). For all product groups, all of this information is available in Supplementary Appendix 3 'Detailed characteristics per product group'. Table 2 shows the overall criteria for all product groups.

To illustrate the scientific debate, a few examples are addressed below. Supplementary Appendix 4 'Overview of product group descriptions, criteria and rationales' contains all of the debated rationales for the product-group-specific criteria, including an overview of the changes made to the original Netherlands-based criteria.

For example, the rationale for encouraging innovation (Figure 1) was applied to the energy criterion in beverages. Owing to concerns that the consumption of sugar-rich beverages can adversely affect energy intake, weight gain and increase the risk of health problems, beverages should not contribute by more than 10% to daily energy intake. However, people will continue to consume these sugar-sweetened drinks. Therefore, reformulation should be encouraged. Currently, standard energy containing drinks contain 10–12 g of sugar/100 g (40–48 kcal/100 g). As a first step without forcing manufacturers to use artificial sweeteners, the criterion has been set at 20 kcal/100 g or 100 ml, which is the equivalent of 5 g of sugar. This will be progressively lowered over time. It is also important to note that on the one hand a considerable number of consumers do not consume sweeteners, and on the other, there are concerns about the possible effects of excessive sweetness on long-term habituation to sugar and sweet foods. By relying on a gradual sugar reduction approach, it is expected that once consumers have gotten used to a less sweet taste, this will also facilitate the lowering of sugar levels in other product groups such as milk products and breakfast cereals.

### The wrong white crystals: not salt but sugar as aetiological in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease [^df49381a]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Current levels of sugar consumption and dietary guidelines

Approximately 300 years ago humans were only consuming a few pounds of sugar per year. More recent estimates suggest intakes in the US population anywhere from 77 to 152 lbs of sugar per year, with 13% consuming at least 25% of their total caloric intake as added sugars. This level of consumption equates to an approximate average intake of added sugars of 24–47 teaspoons (about 100–200 g) per day, with an average daily fructose consumption of 83.1 g. Table 1 suggests how such large intake may be possible, showing some representative foods and the sugar loads associated with their consumption. In a study of over 1000 American adolescents (aged 14–18) the average daily intake of added sugars was 389 g for boys and 276 g for girls, or up to 52% of total caloric intake. The level of added fructose intake implied by these numbers (at least 138 daily grams) is shocking, especially considering there is no physiological requirement for added sugar, particularly fructose, in the diet so potential harms of ingestion clearly outweigh any potential benefits.

Table 1
Amount of sugar in common food items

The American Heart Association (AHA) makes no specific recommendations about fructose, but recommends no more than six teaspoons of sugar per day for women, and no more than nine teaspoons of sugar per day for men. The WHO likewise makes no specific recommendations about fructose, but recommends that added sugars should make up no more than 10% of our entire daily caloric intake, with a proposal to lower that level even further (to 5% or less) for optimal health. By teaspoons, the WHO advises no more than 6–12 teaspoons per day (based on a 2000 calorie per day diet). Even at the higher end, this is only slightly more than the amount of sugar in a single 12 oz. can of Coca-Cola (around 40 g of sugar/10 teaspoonful). Concerning, is that an entire 1 L bottle of Coca-Cola (at 400 calories) might be okay to drink by more liberal Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations, which allow an intake of added sugars up to 25% of total daily calories. Such allowance is a problem. Added sugar at this level may increase the risk of death due to CVD by almost threefold.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4e104775]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

Recommended dietary interventions — anticipated effects on LDL-C and non-HDL-C include a rule of thumb that each intervention should be expected to reduce LDL-C (and non-HDL-C) by 3–7%, or ~ 5% on average; expected LDL-C lowering is: diet low in saturated and trans fatty acids and cholesterol: 5 to 10%; loss of 5% of body weight: 3 to 5%; 2 g/day PS or 7.5 g/day viscous fiber: 4 to 10%; total: 12 to 25%. Combining any 2 interventions would be expected to reduce LDL-C by 6 to 19%. The portfolio diet approach reduced LDL-C by ~ 30% with controlled feeding, but the reduction was less (~ 15%) in free-living subjects. If maintained over time, each 1% reduction in LDL-C is expected to reduce CHD risk by 2–3%; thus, a 6% LDL-C reduction could reduce CHD risk by 12–18% and a 15% reduction could reduce CHD risk by 30–45%.

### Ingestion of diet soda before a glucose load augments glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion [^a04c9fc3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 concentrations during the OGTTs are shown in Fig. 1. Glucose excursions were nearly superimposable in both experimental settings (AUC with carbonated water 1,123 ± 152 mmol/l per 180 min vs. diet soda 1,112 ± 138 mmol/l per 180 min; P = 0.64). Although insulin responses tended to be more pronounced 20 and 25 min after glucose ingestion in the diet soda condition, these differences did not reach statistical significance (20′ P = 0.20; 25′ P = 0.28). Insulin AUCs were not statistically different (carbonated water 62,540 ± 7,646 pmol/l per 180 min vs. diet soda 62,164 ± 7,688 pmol/l per 180 min; P = 0.75). Peak insulin levels occurred 12.3 min earlier in the diet soda condition; however, again this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12).

Glucose (A), insulin (B), and GLP-1 (C) levels during 75-g OGTTs in 22 healthy subjects. Carbonated water (○) or diet soda sweetened with sucralose and acesulfame-K (■) was given orally at time −10 min, and glucose was given at time 0 min. Data are means ± SEM.

The GLP-1 AUC was significantly higher with diet soda (24.0 ± 15.2 pmol/l per 180 min) than carbonated water (16.2 ± 9.0 pmol/l per 180 min; P = 0.003). In addition, the GLP-1 peak was significantly higher with diet soda versus carbonated water (P = 0.003), whereas the timing of the peak was not altered.

Description of studies

Results of the search

The flow of studies through the systematic review process is shown in Figure 2. Electronic database searches retrieved a total of 76,279 study records, including duplicates. Searches of other resources identified 23 additional study records not retrieved by electronic database searches, comprising 15 records identified by searching reference lists of eligible study reports or forward citation tracking and eight records identified within our preceding, broader scoping review (Hollands 2013a). Automatic and manual de‐duplication identified 24,624 duplicate records, which we discarded. Therefore, 51,655 unique records entered title/abstract screening. Of these, we excluded 51,472 records and obtained corresponding full‐text study reports for the remaining 183 records assessed as potentially eligible.

PRISMA study flow diagram.

We excluded 101 study reports based on full‐text screening. Primary reasons for exclusion are summarised in Figure 2 (PRISMA flow diagram) and in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. A further four full‐text study reports were conference abstracts with insufficient information to enable confident assessment of eligibility (Loney 2010, Martinez 2010, Schmidt 2013, Skov 2013). Brief details of these four studies are provided in Characteristics of studies awaiting classification tables. Therefore, following exclusions, identification and linking of multiple eligible study reports of the same study and identification of study reports comprising multiple eligible studies, we have identified a total of 83 studies as meeting the eligibility criteria for this review (from 78 full‐text study reports). The number of included studies exceeds the number of included study reports due to the comparative incidences of study reports that report multiple studies (i.e. two or more studies reported in the same publication) and studies reported in single or multiple study reports among studies/reports that we identified as meeting eligibility criteria for this review.

### Estimating the health benefits and cost-savings of a cap on the size of single serve sugar-sweetened beverages [^cbe6c536]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake is associated with tooth decay, obesity and diabetes. We aimed to model the health and cost impact of reducing the serving size of all single serve SSB to a maximum of 250 mL in New Zealand. A 250 mL serving size cap was modeled for all instances of single serves (< 600 ml) of sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks, fruit drinks, carbonated energy drinks, and sports drinks in the New Zealand National Nutrition Survey intake data (2008/09). A multi-state life-table model used the change in energy intake and therefore BMI to predict the resulting health gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health system costs over the remaining life course of the New Zealand population alive in 2011 (N = 4.4 million, 3% discounting). The 'base case' model (no compensation for reduced energy intake) resulted in an average reduction in SSB and energy intake of 23 mL and 44 kJ (11 kcal) per day or 0.22 kg of weight modeled over two years. The total health gain and cost-savings were 82,100 QALYs (95% UI: 65100 to 101,000) and NZ$1.65 billion [b] (95% UI: 1.19 b to 2.24 b, (US$1.10 b)) over the lifespan of the cohort. QALY gains increased to 116,000 when the SSB definition was widened to include fruit juices and sweetened milks. A cap on single serve SSB could be an effective part of a suite of obesity prevention and sugar reduction interventions in high income countries.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^37929e49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nutritional labelling is advocated as a means to promote healthier food purchasing and consumption, including lower energy intake. Internationally, many different nutritional labelling schemes have been introduced. There is no consensus on whether such labelling is effective in promoting healthier behaviour.

Objectives

To assess the impact of nutritional labelling for food and non-alcoholic drinks on purchasing and consumption of healthier items. Our secondary objective was to explore possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling on purchasing and consumption.

Search Methods

We searched 13 electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 26 April 2017. We also handsearched references and citations and sought unpublished studies through websites and trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies: were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs/Q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies; compared a labelled product (with information on nutrients or energy) with the same product without a nutritional label; assessed objectively measured purchasing or consumption of foods or non-alcoholic drinks in real-world or laboratory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary.

Main Results

We included 28 studies, comprising 17 RCTs, 5 Q-RCTs and 6 ITS studies. Most (21/28) took place in the USA, and 19 took place in university settings, 14 of which mainly involved university students or staff. Most (20/28) studies assessed the impact of labelling on menus or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent to, a range of foods or drinks from which participants could choose. Eight studies provided participants with only one labelled food or drink option (in which labelling was present on a container or packaging, adjacent to the food or on a display board) and measured the amount consumed. The most frequently assessed labelling type was energy (i.e. calorie) information (12/28). Eleven studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on purchasing food or drink options in real-world settings, including purchases from vending machines (one cluster-RCT), grocery stores (one ITS), or restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops (three RCTs, one Q-RCT and five ITS). Findings on vending machines and grocery stores were not interpretable, and were rated as very low quality. A meta-analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling on menus in restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47 kcal in energy purchased (MD -46.72 kcal, 95% CI -78.35, -15.10, N = 1877). Assuming an average meal of 600 kcal, energy labelling on menus would reduce energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%). The quality of the evidence for these three studies was rated as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Of the remaining six studies, only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels on menus or menus boards in a coffee shop or cafeteria) were at low risk of bias, and their results support the meta-analysis. The results of the other four studies which were conducted in a restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee shop, were not clearly reported and were at high risk of bias. Seventeen studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on consumption in artificial settings or scenarios (henceforth referred to as laboratory studies or settings). Of these, eight (all RCTs) assessed the effect of labels on menus or placed on a range of food options. A meta-analysis of these studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy consumed during a meal (MD -50 kcal, 95% CI -104.41, 3.88, N = 1705). We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (such as chocolate, pasta or soft drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.27, N = 732). However, the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. There was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling single nutrient content (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.14to 0.51, N = 718). The effect was small and the confidence intervals wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as very low, providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings from a small body of low-quality evidence suggest that nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus may reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assessing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus or on a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evidence is less definite and also of low quality. Accordingly, and in the absence of observed harms, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on menus in restaurants could be used as part of a wider set of measures to tackle obesity. Additional high-quality research in real-world settings is needed to enable more certain conclusions. Further high-quality research is also needed to address the dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and to assess potential moderators of the intervention effect, including socioeconomic status.
