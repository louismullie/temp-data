ddx anterior uveitis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of anterior uveitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions, epidemiology, and the classification framework that will anchor the differential. Then, I should distinguish infectious from non-infectious etiologies and include masquerade syndromes. Next, I will characterize patterns by course, granulomatous status, laterality, age, and geography. After that, I should outline a diagnostic algorithm with history, examination, targeted labs, imaging, and intraocular fluid analysis. Finally, I will integrate system-level comanagement considerations and ensure clarity and completeness as I go along, while citing the best available references to support each assertion.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Anterior uveitis, inflammation of the iris and/or ciliary body, is the most common form of non-infectious uveitis in developed countries, with an adult prevalence around 98 per 100,000 and accounting for roughly 80% of non-infectious uveitis cases, and it frequently affects younger individuals under 40 years of age, which frames pre-test probabilities before workup [^112ZSY6s]. I should also ground the nomenclature and clinical dimensions with SUN and IUSG principles to standardize description and guide a Bayesian approach to diagnosis across infectious, non-infectious, and masquerade categories, because disciplined characterization is what narrows the differential efficiently [^114zxtHG] [^116pu3h6].

> Next, I will examine infectious causes, but wait, let me verify which patterns point strongly toward them. Viral anterior uveitis due to HSV, VZV, and CMV is common and heterogeneous; VZV anterior uveitis often shows severe flare and higher aqueous viral load, while CMV tends toward chronicity or recurrent hypertensive iritis with the highest IOP and reduced corneal endothelial cell counts, and definitive differentiation among herpesviruses typically requires anterior chamber fluid PCR or an antibody index when the clinical picture is ambiguous [^111anXu2] [^115fjYtC]. I should confirm bacterial and mycobacterial considerations too: tuberculosis can present with granulomatous anterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis and is notoriously paucibacillary with delayed diagnosis in both endemic and non-endemic settings, and syphilis remains a protean imitator that can cause any uveitis phenotype and must be screened broadly when suspicion exists [^117FQt6W] [^116pu3h6]. Parasitic causes such as toxoplasmosis are often posterior but can overlap with anterior segment inflammation, and toxocariasis is a notable pediatric consideration, so I need to keep epidemiology and age in mind during triage of likelihoods [^1148tCL9] [^116pu3h6].

> I will now consider non-infectious immune-mediated etiologies, and I need to ensure I anchor the high-yield association with HLA-B27 and spondyloarthropathies. HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis typically presents as acute, unilateral or unilateral-alternating, non-granulomatous iridocyclitis, and approximately 50% of all anterior uveitis patients may be HLA-B27 positive overall, with positivity exceeding 80% among ankylosing spondylitis patients who develop anterior uveitis, underlining the diagnostic weight of testing in compatible presentations [^112ZSY6s]. Hold on, I should verify formal classification features: machine-learned criteria emphasize acute or re-acute unilateral anterior uveitis with either spondyloarthritis or HLA-B27 positivity, or a chronic course with a prior classic pattern, which helps codify this phenotype in practice [^113eGbJL]. Because ocular involvement is a key component in SpA phenotyping and may be the sentinel event preceding axial or peripheral manifestations, collaboration with rheumatology improves yield and long-term care planning [^116TTn3x] [^115smt5G].

> Let me think about pediatric non-infectious etiologies next, and I should double-check the dominant entities. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the leading systemic association with pediatric non-infectious uveitis, often producing chronic, bilateral, initially asymptomatic anterior uveitis that risks cataract, glaucoma, and amblyopia if not detected and treated promptly, which justifies regular screening protocols and early anti-inflammatory control to prevent structural damage [^1148tCL9]. I need to ensure management implications are noted even though this is a differential exercise: the SHARE and ACR/AF guidance support systemic immunosuppression when poor prognostic factors exist or when inactivity is not achieved promptly, with methotrexate as first line and escalation to monoclonal antibody TNF inhibitors if refractory, emphasizing a treat-to-target of no cells in the anterior chamber and thoughtful tapering once sustained control is achieved [^1111AqSw] [^112XJfSP] [^111tx8Z2] [^113gWGYA].

> Now, I should review sarcoidosis, but wait, let me verify the typical anterior segment phenotype. Ocular sarcoidosis commonly produces granulomatous anterior uveitis with mutton-fat keratic precipitates and iris nodules, often alongside systemic findings such as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; atypical presentations, including optic neuropathy and choroiditis, occur and complicate diagnosis, which means chest imaging and biomarkers like ACE and lysozyme can be supportive in the right clinical context, while recognizing that tissue diagnosis remains definitive when feasible [^117FQt6W] [^114aBDG2].

> Next, I should review Behçet disease as a cause of acute anterior uveitis with possible hypopyon, and I need to check regional prevalence and systemic clues. Behçet disease is most prevalent along the Silk Route and features recurrent oral and genital ulcers with skin findings; ocular disease may be severe and relapsing, so prompt recognition matters, and EULAR guidance supports systemic immunosuppression including corticosteroids with azathioprine or other agents, and for acute sight-threatening eye disease, high-dose corticosteroids with infliximab or interferon-α may be indicated in collaboration with ophthalmology [^111Q3qCM] [^1119vu87] [^114Csizb] [^112XbtoU].

> I will now examine Fuchs' uveitis, and hold on, I should verify the granulomatous nomenclature here. Fuchs' uveitis typically presents as chronic, low-grade anterior uveitis with diffuse stellate keratic precipitates, iris stromal atrophy with heterochromia, and it is usually unilateral; although often mislabeled non-granulomatous, careful slit-lamp features support that it is a granulomatous entity in many cases, which can prevent misclassification during differential generation [^114aBDG2].

> Before moving on, I need to consider masquerade syndromes to avoid anchoring bias. Intraocular malignancies such as primary vitreoretinal lymphoma and leukemia can mimic uveitis, as can vascular and hereditary ocular conditions, and in suspected malignancy the diagnostic yield is highest with intraocular fluid cytology, while nonmalignant masquerades may benefit from fluorescein angiography for vascular characterization, so I should escalate to fluid analysis when the course is atypical or corticosteroid-unresponsive [^117XfdMP].

> Next, I should review how clinical characterization tightens the differential, but wait, let me be explicit about time course, granulomatous signs, and laterality. Acute presentations under three months, especially unilateral non-granulomatous flares, steer toward HLA-B27-associated disease, herpetic etiologies, or Behçet disease, while chronic anterior uveitis suggests JIA, CMV, Fuchs', or sarcoidosis, and the presence of large keratic precipitates and iris nodules points to granulomatous entities such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or some herpetic cases, whereas fine dust-like keratic precipitates fit non-granulomatous patterns seen in HLA-B27 or drug-induced disease; these morphologic anchors meaningfully re-weight probabilities during evaluation [^116pu3h6] [^114aBDG2] [^111anXu2].

> I should confirm age-stratified considerations to avoid missing high-risk groups. In children, JIA-associated uveitis dominates non-infectious causes and may be asymptomatic, while toxocariasis and post-streptococcal uveitis also enter the differential in appropriate clinical settings; in adults, HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis and viral uveitis are frequent, and in older adults, I need heightened vigilance for masquerade syndromes given the higher proportion of intraocular malignancy in that age group [^1148tCL9] [^117XfdMP].

> Now, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm, and I need to ensure I balance thoroughness with yield. A standardized minimal evaluation with complete blood count, ESR or CRP, syphilis serology, tuberculin testing, and chest radiograph can be efficient when combined with targeted testing based on ocular phenotype and history, and randomized ULISSE data suggest such structured strategies achieve similar etiologic yields with fewer investigations than open-ended testing, while a Bayesian, feature-driven approach avoids low-yield shotgun panels [^115nJXG1] [^116pu3h6]. Hold on, I should verify the pitfalls of indiscriminate testing; reviews note that many routine tests in anterior uveitis suffer from low sensitivity and specificity, arguing for targeted diagnostics tethered to the clinical picture to prevent cost and delay without improving diagnosis [^111FakLa].

> Let me detail targeted laboratory and fluid testing, and I should double-check where they add decisive value. Aqueous humor PCR and, when indicated, intraocular antibody index testing increase accuracy for herpetic viral anterior uveitis and are considered the definitive tests when clinical features overlap or when management hinges on establishing a viral etiology, recognizing that a negative PCR does not exclude infection and that combining modalities improves sensitivity, which justifies sampling in recurrent, atypical, or hypertensive anterior uveitis cases [^111anXu2] [^115fjYtC]. For suspected SpA-associated uveitis, HLA-B27 testing and a rheumatologic review are appropriate, and exploratory data suggest fecal calprotectin may help flag occult gut inflammation in some cases, though this remains investigational and should not replace standard evaluation pathways [^116TTn3x] [^116fMkhR].

> Next, I should review imaging and ancillary ocular assessment, but wait, let me be precise about where imaging changes management. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy remains foundational for cells, flare, keratic precipitate morphology, iris nodules, synechiae, and IOP; posterior segment evaluation for vasculitis or choroiditis reframes the case toward systemic entities or infection, with fluorescein angiography often informative when masquerade or vasculitic processes are suspected, especially if the clinical exam is equivocal or there is a steroid-unresponsive course [^116pu3h6] [^117XfdMP]. In viral hypertensive anterior uveitis, recognizing corneal endothelial cell loss in CMV compared to HSV or VZV can support the differential and prompt aqueous testing to confirm etiology before committing to prolonged antiviral therapy, which is another reason to integrate clinical signs with targeted diagnostics rather than relying on pattern alone [^111anXu2].

> I will now examine when to pursue intraocular fluid cytology and broader malignancy workup, and I should confirm the diagnostic yield. In atypical, refractory, or steroid-dependent courses with incongruent clinical findings, intraocular fluid cytology has the highest yield for diagnosing intraocular malignancies among masquerade syndromes, whereas angiography often clarifies nonmalignant masquerade processes, so a low threshold for fluid analysis is warranted when red flags arise such as vitreous cells out of proportion to anterior inflammation, unexplained retinal infiltrates, or systemic B symptoms [^117XfdMP].

> Finally, I need to ensure systemic comanagement and follow-up pathways are not overlooked. Because anterior uveitis frequently intersects with systemic inflammatory disease, rheumatology collaboration helps detect spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, or TINU and to optimize immunomodulatory strategies when corticosteroid-sparing control is required, while shared care also coordinates monitoring for treatment toxicities and extra-ocular disease activity that may presage ocular relapses [^115smt5G] [^112DcrGn].

> Before closing, I should double-check geographic and demographic modifiers that adjust pre-test probabilities. CMV anterior uveitis is more frequently reported in East Asian cohorts and often presents with episodic hypertensive iritis, suggesting a lower threshold for aqueous PCR in these populations, whereas tuberculosis-related uveitis and retinal vasculitis should be prioritized in endemic regions or at-risk ethnic groups, and Behçet disease prevalence along the Silk Route should heighten suspicion in compatible syndromic presentations; HLA-linked disease burdens, including HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis, also vary by ancestry and should guide testing thresholds [^111anXu2] [^117FQt6W] [^111Q3qCM] [^112ZSY6s].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the prior outline ended abruptly with "HLA", which is incomplete and could mislead; hold on, I should verify and restate the intended point. What I meant is that HLA-B27 positivity is common in anterior uveitis overall and especially in ankylosing spondylitis, and that ethnicity and regional HLA allele distributions influence prevalence and predictive value of testing, so incorporating ancestry and regional epidemiology into the HLA-B27 testing decision improves diagnostic yield rather than applying it indiscriminately to all comers with anterior uveitis [^112ZSY6s] [^113eGbJL].

Anterior uveitis has a **broad differential** [^112ZSY6s] spanning infectious, autoimmune, and masquerade etiologies [^117XfdMP]. The most common are **HLA-B27-associated uveitis** [^112ZSY6s] and **herpetic uveitis** (HSV, VZV, CMV) [^111anXu2]. Other important causes include JIA [^1111AqSw], sarcoidosis [^112QTeN2], Behçet's [^114Csizb], syphilis, tuberculosis [^117FQt6W], and trauma; masquerade syndromes — such as lymphoma or intraocular foreign body — must also be considered [^117XfdMP]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features** [^116pu3h6], with targeted tests (HLA-B27, syphilis serology, chest imaging) [^115nJXG1] and aqueous PCR [^111anXu2] when infection is suspected [^115fjYtC].

### Algorithmic approach in the diagnosis of pediatric uveitis [^114zxtHG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Uveitis is defined as an intraocular inflammation involving the iris, ciliary body, or choroid. It is caused by disorders of diverse etiologies, including a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious causes. These entities can be categorized into three groups based on their etiologies: infectious, non-infectious, and masquerade syndrome.

- **Infectious uveitis**: This includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and mycobacteria. These may directly infect intraocular tissues or trigger a host immune response that leads to ocular inflammation.

- **Non-infectious uveitis**: This refers to uveitis resulting from immune-mediated inflammation, which may be associated with autoimmune diseases or may be a solitary ocular disease. Trauma to the eyeball, intraocular procedures, or medications may also induce uveitis.

- **Masquerade syndrome**: This refers to lymphoma, intraocular foreign bodies, retinal detachment, or other causes that may mimic intraocular inflammation. It should always be considered and ruled out before making the diagnosis.

Uveitis in pediatric patients differs from adult uveitis in that it is commonly asymptomatic but can become chronic and cause damage to ocular structures. The diagnosis may be delayed for many reasons, including difficulties in communicating with and examining young children. Uveitis morbidities in pediatric patients include cataract, glaucoma, and amblyopia.

The International Uveitis Study Group (IUSG) and Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria allow ophthalmologists to classify uveitis for research and clinical purposes. The SUN criteria divide uveitis into categories for better clinical management.

### A large meta-analysis identifies genes associated with anterior uveitis [^112ZSY6s]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Uveitis is an intraocular inflammatory disease that can result in severe visual loss and can be categorized by etiology (infectious or non-infectious) and by affected ocular region (anterior, intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis). Non-infectious uveitis represents the majority of cases in the developed world, with a prevalence of 121 per 100,000 in the US. Anterior uveitis (AU), characterized by inflammation of the iris and/or ciliary body, is the most common type of non-infectious uveitis, with a prevalence of 98 per 100,000 adults in the US, accounting for approximately 80% of all non-infectious uveitis cases. AU predominantly affects younger individuals, with a mean age of onset less than 40 years.

AU is frequently observed as a complication of spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hence, most studies so far have focused on AU in the context of a spondyloarthropathy, mainly AS. Notably, all these inflammatory diseases are strongly associated with HLA haplotypes. Birdshot chorioretinopathy has the strongest known association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A✱29, followed by AS and HLA-B✱27. Such an association was first described for AS and AU 50 years ago and has since been confirmed in several studies. It has previously been estimated that approximately 50% of all patients with AU are HLA-B✱27 positive, increasing to above 80% among AS patients with AU. In addition to HLA-B✱27, associations of smaller effect size were described with other HLA alleles, including HLA-A✱02.

### Uveitis masquerade syndromes [^117XfdMP]. Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

An incorrect diagnosis of uveitic masquerade syndromes (UMS) may have severe consequences. This study describes the frequency, clinical manifestations, and informative diagnostic tests for UMS.

- **Study design**: Retrospective observational case series.

- **Participants**: Forty patients with UMS were identified in a cohort of 828 consecutive patients with uveitis. The mean follow-up was 4.5 years.

- **Methods**: A review of clinical, laboratory, photographic, and angiographic records was performed.

- **Main outcome measures**: Clinical features, associated systemic diseases, diagnostic procedures and their role in the diagnostic process, and systemic and visual outcomes.

- **Results**: Nineteen patients had intraocular malignancy (48% of all with UMS; 2.3% of all with uveitis), mainly intraocular lymphoma (n = 13) and leukemia (n = 3). The ophthalmologist was the first to recognize malignant disease in 11 of 19 patients (58%). Of 21 patients with nonmalignant UMS, 10 had an ocular vascular disease and 5 a hereditary ocular disorder. The patients with malignant UMS were older than those with nonmalignant UMS (average age, 50 vs. 44 years, P < 0.05). During follow-up, 9 of 19 patients with malignant UMS died. The most informative diagnostic procedure for malignant UMS was intraocular fluid analysis; for nonmalignant UMS, fluorescein angiography. The cytologic analysis of intraocular fluids yielded the best results for diagnosing intraocular malignancies (7 of 11 patients, 64%); the association of negative cytologic results with the recent administration of systemic corticosteroids was noted.

### Epidemiology and clinical features of viral anterior uveitis in southern Taiwan-diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction [^111anXu2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpetic anterior uveitis (AU) due to either herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is a relatively common condition and currently accounts for 5 to 10% of all uveitis cases seen at tertiary referral centers. In the last decade, the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in viral detection of many ocular inflammations has identified cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a common cause of AU. However, there is a wide range of clinical presentations of CMV AU. It may present as chronic anterior uveitis or as episodic iritis with raised intraocular pressure (IOP) resembling Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS).

HSV and VZV are considered the most common causes of infectious AU in Western countries, but CMV has been reported to be more predominant among Chinese and Japanese populations. Some studies have presented characteristic clinical findings that may enable physicians to make a clinical diagnosis and differentiate between various viral-induced infections. Of patients with AU caused by HSV, VZV, or CMV, those with VZV AU had severe aqueous flare and the highest viral load in the aqueous humor, while CMV AU patients exhibited the mildest intraocular inflammation, lowest corneal endothelial cell density, and highest IOP. Although AU caused by the three herpetic viruses may have some distinct features, a definitive diagnosis can only be made by anterior chamber fluid analysis at present.

There are relatively few studies on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of viral anterior uveitis in Taiwan, despite this disease potentially causing a devastating loss of quality of life and productivity to those affected. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the percentage of cases associated with different viral causes.

### Measurable outcomes of an ophthalmology and rheumatology coordinated care clinic [^116Ff9h4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

Pediatric noninfectious chronic anterior uveitis (CAU) is an intraocular disease characterized by inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye, also known as anterior uveitis (AU). Uveitis is a comorbid feature of many other autoimmune diseases. Pediatric CAU frequently presents with few symptoms and can be difficult to detect until complications arise. Both CAU and its first-line treatment, topical glucocorticoids, can cause serious complications, including cataracts and elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP), potentially leading to glaucoma and vision loss.

Standard first-line treatment includes topical glucocorticoids and dilating drops to limit synechiae development. It is crucial to diagnose and treat uveitis promptly to prevent permanent damage. Consensus-based guidelines for uveitis treatment suggest that patients resistant to initial treatment should receive systemic immunosuppressive agents, with methotrexate as the first-line agent. In patients with inflammation resistant to methotrexate, subsequent options include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, other biologic agents, and additional conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

### Inflammatory eye disease for rheumatologists [^115smt5G]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

This review provides a framework for understanding inflammatory eye disease diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management for rheumatologists. Uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and orbital inflammation are all discussed. The goal is to facilitate the development of approaches to inflammatory eye diseases that will help rheumatologists co-manage these patients with eye care providers specializing in ocular inflammation.

- **Recent findings**: In recent years, studies have aimed to advance biologic treatments and define standard-of-care therapy. Inflammatory eye diseases are highly heterogeneous and often rare, which poses significant challenges to their research and the interpretation of existing data. At the time of writing, glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, methotrexate, and TNF inhibitors remain the mainstay of treatment options for many of these diseases.

- **Summary**: Patients with inflammatory eye diseases require multidisciplinary care for the best outcomes, frequently including rheumatologists. Understanding differentials, diagnostics, and treatment are essential to preserving vision in these patients. The diverse nature of the disease processes within this field requires focusing on specific disease phenotypes and endotypes in research and clinical practice.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future: a review [^1149qzEj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Intraocular inflammatory eye diseases, though relatively uncommon, remain an important cause of visual impairment. For example, uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness. Broadly, the underlying aetiologies are divided into infective and non-infective (presumed autoimmune or autoinflammatory) causes. Since the late 20th century, advances in molecular techniques have led not only to increasing our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms associated with various forms of non-infectious uveitides but also to improved, refined, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of infectious causes.

Our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways involved in uveitis has led to the adoption of various immunosuppressive agents to overcome the burden of corticosteroid use, which is traditional and entrenched in uveitis practice. In a recent survey of treatment patterns of non-infectious uveitis by ophthalmologists in the United States, it was found that up to 60% of patients were still treated with more than 30 mg of steroids for more than 1.5 years as maintenance therapy to control inflammation. The use of immunosuppressive therapy was only employed in 12% of patients. Furthermore, 75% of physicians were not aware of treatment guidelines for uveitis. Such guidelines are based on data and evidence that include, over time, the iterative bench-to-bedside translation and the delivery of clinical evidence for the use of anti-metabolites and calcineurin inhibitors.

More recently, progress in targeted therapy with biologics, targeted against cytokines (e.g. anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, and anti-TNF-α), has shown promise.

### Calprotectin as a biomarker for diagnosis and severity of acute noninfectious anterior uveitis in Egyptian patients [^116fMkhR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Another study by Gazim et al. concluded that the clinician may be able to categorize the causes of anterior uveitis with the aid of fecal calprotectin levels. Spondylarthritis (SpA)-associated uveitis is difficult to diagnose in some cases because certain rheumatological findings are absent or insufficient. SpA may also present itself initially as uveitis. Finding high fecal calprotectin levels could be another piece of information that contributes to this classification. To fully comprehend the significance of fecal calprotectin levels for the detection of SpA among individuals presenting with anterior uveitis, more research is required.

Even though none of our patients had Behcet's illness, it is important to note that this condition is similarly linked to intestinal inflammation and high amounts of fecal calprotectin. The relevance of calprotectin levels in the differential detection of severity for these two diseases may be clarified by further research comparing the calprotectin levels in uveitis patients with SpA and Behcet's disease.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: the SHARE initiative [^1111AqSw]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, particularly with respect to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the SHARE initiative 2018 guidelines recommend initiating systemic immunosuppression in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated active uveitis when poor prognostic factors are identified either at the first visit or during the disease course.

### Psoriatic uveitis: A distinct clinical entity [^116MEk8r]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of uveitis occurring in patients with psoriasis and to compare them with patients suffering from idiopathic anterior uveitis and HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis.

The study design is a case-control study. For this, the charts of 36 patients diagnosed with uveitis and psoriasis visiting the Immunology and Uveitis Service at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary between January 2000 and December 2001 were reviewed. The clinical characteristics, therapy, and outcomes of uveitis were compared with those of 30 randomly selected patients with either idiopathic anterior uveitis or HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis.

The results indicated that the mean age at presentation for uveitis was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis compared with nonpsoriatic groups (44.6 years in HLA-B27-psoriatic patients versus 35.9 years in HLA-B27-nonpsoriatic patients, P = 0.034; 52.7 years in HLA-B27+ psoriatic patients versus 35.7 years in HLA-B27+ nonpsoriatic patients, P = 0.001). Uveitis in patients with psoriasis also tended to be bilateral (62%) and prolonged, lasting on average 11.2 weeks. HLA-B27+ patients with psoriasis required supplemental therapy with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41 to 5.36, P = 0.003) for anterior uveitis more often than did the HLA-B27+ nonpsoriatic group. Patients with psoriasis and uveitis who were HLA-B27+ required oral NSAIDs (95% CI 1.51 to 9.79, P = 0.001) for anterior uveitis more often than HLA-B27- psoriatic patients.

In conclusion, uveitis in patients with psoriasis may have distinguishing clinical features. Further epidemiological investigation is warranted.

### Minimum imaging sets for diagnosis, activity assessment, and complications in noninfectious posterior uveitis - Multimodal Imaging in Uveitis (MUV) Task Force Report 9 [^115zH6rj]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a minimum imaging set (MIS) to support ophthalmologists in diagnosing, monitoring disease activity, and identifying disease-specific complications for six types of non-infectious posterior uveitides (NIPU).

Visual questionnaires were answered live by an international group of ophthalmologists, which included uveitis experts, medical retina specialists, general ophthalmologists, and ophthalmologists-in-training.

Five groups of uveitis experts were selected by the Multimodal Imaging in Uveitis (MUV) taskforce to create an MIS for each of the following conditions: multiple evanescent white dots syndrome (MEWDS), acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MFCPU), punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), serpiginous choroiditis (SC), and birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR). The MIS were designed to improve ophthalmologists' ability to diagnose and manage these NIPU without the need for a complete multimodal imaging (MMI) approach.

To evaluate the efficacy of the MIS, five visual questionnaires, including color fundus photography (CFP) used as a proxy for funduscopic examination, were constructed. These questionnaires along with the MIS of a series of cases were proposed to the group of ophthalmologists. The number of correct answers achieved by participants reviewing the MIS was compared to those obtained by examining the CFP alone.

The main outcome measures include sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MIS in comparison to CFP alone for diagnosing, assessing activity, and identifying complications in NIPU.

The study reported results from 156 ophthalmologists.

### Why do we treat? Defining disease control in juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis [^113nwAS5]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

In a recent issue of The Journal of Rheumatology, Berard et al. reported on the development of the Canadian recommendations for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The guidance from this national multidisciplinary JIA-associated uveitis working group had a welcome and necessary focus on the importance of disease control but omitted a definition of controlled disease.

### Granulomatous features in juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis is not a rare occurrence [^114aBDG2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Anterior uveitis is classically divided into non-granulomatous and granulomatous entities. This classification is useful as it corresponds to different specific entities and aids in the work-up of uveitis cases. Non-granulomatous uveitis is characterized by fine and diffuse endothelial keratic precipitates (KPs) in the lower half of the cornea, appearing as dust on the endothelium but not visible by slit-lamp photography.

One characteristic feature of granulomatous uveitis is the presence of KPs larger than dust, which can be individually photographed. Granulomatous KPs can vary in size: small as in Fuchs' uveitis, medium-sized as in herpetic kerato-uveitis, or large (mutton-fat KPs) as in tuberculous or sarcoidosis uveitis. Other features of granulomatous uveitis include Koeppe nodules — fluffy small outgrowths on the pupillary edge or on the surface of the iris — and Busacca nodules within the stroma of the iris.

- **Granulomatous uveitis misnomer**: The term granulomatous uveitis is a misnomer, as it uses a histological term applied to a set of clinical signs. Conditions presenting with non-granulomatous uveitis typically comprise HLA-B27 uveitis and Behçet's uveitis. Conditions presenting with granulomatous uveitis typically include uveitis caused by herpes, sarcoidosis, or tuberculosis.

Fuchs' uveitis is often erroneously classified as non-granulomatous, but it is genuinely granulomatous with stellate KPs that are easily identifiable, and in many cases, Koeppe nodules are present.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIA-uveitis) is the most common uveitis condition associated with juvenile arthritis.

Regarding the medical management for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, particularly in the context of managing uveitis, the SHARE initiative 2018 guidelines recommend the addition or switch to biological treatment in cases of methotrexate inefficacy or intolerance. Anti-TNF agents such as adalimumab, infliximab, and golimumab should be initiated in patients with uveitis that is refractory or resistant to DMARD therapy, specifically methotrexate. Switching between different anti-TNF treatments should be considered if uveitis remains refractory to the initial anti-TNF therapy.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown aetiology, with pulmonary involvement in most patients. Uveitis is common and often characteristic. We report a case of ocular sarcoidosis with grossly atypical contiguous optic neuropathy and choroiditis, and we describe the diagnostic challenges in this highly unusual presentation. High-dose systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive treatment was required for sustained control of intraocular inflammation.

### Polymerase chain reaction in unilateral cases of presumed viral anterior uveitis [^115fjYtC]. Clinical ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Effective management of patients with anterior uveitis requires clear differentiation between infectious and noninfectious causes. Every effort should be made to identify the cause of uveitis, which depends mainly on the clinical picture. In cases of uncertainty, laboratory investigations should be considered. For the diagnosis of infectious uveitis, the obtained sample is usually an anterior chamber paracentesis or a vitreous tap. In cases of viral anterior uveitis, two types of tests are most commonly performed to detect the causative viral agent: specific antibody detection and PCR analysis in the ocular tissues or fluids.

Antibodies found in the eye during an attack of uveitis can be derived from the blood due to either disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier or intraocular synthesis by plasma cells. GWC analysis is applied to determine actual intraocular production of antibodies. The second method is to detect the viral genome using qualitative or quantitative PCR.

PCR is a powerful molecular biological tool that involves enzymatic amplification of nucleic acid sequences in repeated cycles of denaturation, oligonucleotide annealing, and DNA polymerase extension. PCR has revolutionized much of molecular biology and has greatly accelerated the development of molecular diagnostics. However, the use of PCR to determine the viral genome in the aqueous can lead to a diagnosis of viral uveitis if it is positive but cannot exclude a viral etiology if it is negative.

Studies have shown that combining these two techniques generally increases diagnostic accuracy, thereby improving patient management.

### Ocular involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis [^116TTn3x]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Ocular inflammatory diseases can present as isolated conditions but can also occur as part of systemic inflammatory diseases. Anterior uveitis is closely related to SpA and shares the common genetic background of HLA-B27. Other ocular manifestations, such as episcleritis and scleritis, may also occur, although less frequently. Therefore, ocular involvement has been included as one of the important clinical features of SpA in the recently published classification criteria for axial and peripheral disease. However, there are a wide variety of aetiologies for ocular diseases, and this must be considered in the assessment of SpA.

### Classification criteria for spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis [^113eGbJL]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine classification criteria for spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis. The design involved machine learning of cases with spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis and eight other anterior uveitides.

Cases of anterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on the diagnosis using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was employed on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among anterior uveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated in the validation set.

A total of 1,083 cases of anterior uveitides, including 184 cases of spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis, were evaluated by machine learning. The overall accuracy for anterior uveitides was 97.5% in the training set and 96.7% in the validation set (95% CI: 92.4–98.6).

Key criteria for spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis included:

- **Acute or reAcute unilateral or unilateral alternating anterior uveitis** with either spondyloarthritis or a positive test result for HLA-B27
- **Chronic anterior uveitis** with a history of the classic course and either spondyloarthritis or HLA-B27
- **Anterior uveitis with both spondyloarthritis and HLA-B27**

The misclassification rates for spondyloarthritis/HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis were evaluated, ensuring the improved criteria accuracy.

- **Diagnosis supporting algorithms**: González-Lõpez et al, in their retrospective review, utilized a dataset of 3,674 individuals from Moorfields Eye Hospital focusing on anterior uveitis. This study proposed a Bayesian Belief Network algorithm for the differential diagnosis of anterior uveitis etiology based on clinical characteristics and incidence. A similar AI model was used by Jamilloux et al, for a dataset of 877 patients from a single university hospital in Lyon with a uveitis diagnosis.

Mutawa and Alzuwawi et al, applied a dataset of 61 online published cases from a center in Kuwait and proposed a Multilayer Rule-based Expert System. This system included components such as long-term memory, short-term memory, an inference engine, and an extra module for explanations, which assisted in diagnosing systemic and non-systemic diseases based on patient history and examination.

Tugal-Tutkun et al, utilized a dataset of 867 patients from multiple centers in Turkey, Israel, the United Kingdom, Tunisia, and India, focusing on Behçet disease uveitis diagnosis based solely on ocular findings characteristics. Classification and Regression Tree Analysis (CART) was used, based on the recursive-partitioning analysis method with prospective data collected, and the high-scoring tree was re-evaluated for clinical relevance.

The strength of these diagnosis-supporting algorithms, such as Bayesian Belief Networks and Multilayer Rule-based Expert Systems, lies in their ability to enhance differential diagnosis accuracy in complex uveitis cases by incorporating diverse datasets and clinical characteristics.

### The eyes have it: A rheumatologist's view of uveitis [^113x4UNf]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Uveitis is defined as intraocular inflammation. It serves as an extraarticular manifestation of various joint diseases, including spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Rheumatologists are often consulted for ophthalmologic care in patients with uveitis to identify any associated systemic illnesses. Diagnoses such as spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial nephritis with uveitis are frequently overlooked by referring ophthalmologists. Additionally, rheumatologists may assist in managing the patient's immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, which may be necessary for treating certain subsets of patients with uveitis. This review aims to equip rheumatologists with the necessary information to facilitate collaboration in the comanagement of patients with uveitis.

### Algorithmic approach in the diagnosis of pediatric uveitis [^1148tCL9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Most cases of pediatric uveitis are non-infectious, accounting for 67.2–93.8%. Most studies report that juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the main underlying systemic disease associated with childhood non-infectious uveitis.

Toxoplasmosis is the most common form of infectious uveitis in most studies, while toxocariasis is the second leading infectious cause. In Europe, poststreptococcal uveitis accounts for 2.5–10.6% of pediatric cases.

Etiological diagnosis of uveitis begins with taking a detailed history followed by systemic and ocular examinations. Subsequently, a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses is used to rule out or rule in the possible etiology. In the absence of an algorithmic approach, laboratory investigations present challenges, and consultation with other subspecialties may be required.

The present figure (Fig. 1) outlines a practical algorithmic approach to diagnosing pediatric uveitis. Algorithms solve problems by demonstrating step-by-step evaluations. Steps in building this algorithm include the following criteria: location (anterior, posterior, or intermediate), unilateral or bilateral findings, and the course of disease (acute or chronic). If patients have anterior uveitis, the characteristics such as chronic or acute form, along with single or bilateral eye involvement, help narrow down the causes. Similar approaches apply to chronic, intermediate, and posterior uveitis.

### Tubercular retinal vasculitis: Diagnostic dilemma and management strategies [^117FQt6W]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Three centuries of familiarity with tubercular uveitis and several clinical, laboratory, and technological innovations later, we still have not unraveled the mystery of diagnosing and treating OTB. This is mainly due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease, the wide range of uveitis presentations, and the variable extent of the immune-mediated response in the eye. It is pertinent to note that OTB is not exclusively a developing world problem; a tertiary clinic in the United States reported an average delay of more than two years in diagnosing OTB, resulting in profound visual loss in about 40% of the patients. TRV remains a particularly elusive subset of OTB with even more disputed management.

A commonsense approach can, however, be distilled from the literature to guide the treating ophthalmologist. Retinal vasculitis conveys different etiopathologic connotations according to geography and ethnicity: TRV should be primarily suspected in areas endemic for latent TB, such as the Indian subcontinent, and in vulnerable ethnic groups like Asians, Middle-Easterners, and Africans. The suspicion is augmented in the presence of classic but not pathognomonic fundus features, which require ruling out other systemic infections and inflammations like sarcoidosis, syphilis, Behçet's disease, etc. by detailed history, systemic examination, and tailored serologic, immunologic, and radiologic investigations. In the presence of a clinical picture suggestive of TRV, detection of latent and healed TB is sufficient to start ATT.

Bilateral acute ocular symptoms may represent the early presenting signs of juvenile Behçet's disease (jBD) and are often the only manifestation of the disease. A careful differential diagnosis with similar acute conditions, such as acute uveitis in HLA-B27+ patients or infections, should be performed. In these cases, the search for HLA-B51 is crucial. Since systemic symptoms correlate with a severe disease course, a second-line therapy with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) or biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and a close rheumatological follow-up are advisable.

- **Patient consent**: Yes, consent was received.

Chronic idiopathic uveitis (CIU) and uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are vision-threatening conditions with similar mechanisms. However, JIA-associated uveitis has multiple treatment options, including biologic and non-biologic DMARDs, in contrast to CIU, which poses a challenge due to a lack of specific treatments.

- **Objectives**: The aim of the study was to compare features and outcomes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis and chronic idiopathic uveitis.

### The management of adult and paediatric uveitis for rheumatologists [^112DcrGn]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Uveitis encompasses multiple different conditions that are all characterized by intraocular inflammation. It occurs in the context of many different rheumatological conditions and carries a substantial risk to vision. Uveitis can develop both at the early stages of rheumatic diseases, sometimes even preceding other clinical features, and at later stages of the disease. It can also occur as either a direct or an indirect complication of therapies used to treat patients with rheumatic disease. Conversely, patients with uveitis of non-rheumatic etiology sometimes require immunosuppression, a treatment option that is not readily accessible to ophthalmologists. Thus, collaborative working between rheumatologists and ophthalmologists is critical for optimal management of patients with uveitis. This review is written with rheumatologists in mind, to assist in the care of patients with uveitis. We collate and summarize the latest evidence and best practice in the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of uveitis, including future trends and research priorities.

### Sympathetic ophthalmia: Where do we currently stand on treatment strategies [^111QwHcj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis involves several conditions:

- **Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome**: This is a bilateral granulomatous panuveitis, most commonly seen between the second and fifth decades of life, with a racial predisposition towards Asians. It often presents with a prodrome of meningeal and auditory symptoms. In both acute and chronic phases, the clinical and histopathologic features are identical to sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), except for the absence of a history of trauma. Certain findings, such as vitiligo, alopecia, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, are more closely associated with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome than with SO. The history of penetrating trauma is helpful in differentiating between SO and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome.

- **Ocular sarcoidosis, tuberculosis (TB), syphilis, multifocal choroiditis, and panuveitis**: Sympathetic ophthalmia must be differentiated from several infectious and non-infectious uveitides, including syphilis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, multifocal choroiditis, and panuveitis. Other bacterial and fungal infections can also produce granulomatous anterior and/or posterior uveitis. They are usually differentiated from each other by history and associated clinical findings. Tuberculosis associated with uveitis is commonly observed in Southeast Asian, Western Pacific, and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Idiopathic multifocal choroiditis is mostly seen in Caucasians during the second and sixth decades of life.

- **Phacoanaphylactic uveitis**: This is the immunological response to lens proteins due to a rupture, either surgical or traumatic, of the lens capsule, leading to severe granulomatous uveitis.

### Randomized controlled trial evaluating a standardized strategy for uveitis etiologic diagnosis (ULISSE) [^115nJXG1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to prospectively assess the efficiency of a standardized diagnostic approach, compared to an open strategy, for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis.

- **Design**: Noninferiority, prospective, multicenter, clustered randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with uveitis, who visited one of the participating departments of ophthalmology, were included in the study. In the standardized group, all patients underwent a minimal evaluation, regardless of the type of uveitis. This evaluation included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, tuberculin skin test, syphilis serology, and chest radiograph, followed by more complex investigations based on ophthalmologic findings. In the open group, the ophthalmologist could order any type of investigation. The main outcome was the percentage of etiologic diagnoses at 6 months.

- **Results**: A total of 903 patients with uveitis were included from January 2010 to May 2013. The per-protocol population comprised 676 patients, with 373 in the open group and 303 in the standardized group. The mean age at diagnosis was 46 years. The anatomic distribution of uveitis was as follows: anterior (60.8% in open vs. 72.3% in standardized, P = 0.0017), intermediate (11.7% in open vs. 12.3% in standardized, P = 0.8028), posterior (17.8% in open vs. 8.2% in standardized, P = 0.0004), and panuveitis (15.3% in open vs. 15.2% in standardized, P = 0.9596). An etiologic diagnosis was established in 54.4% of cases in the open group and 49.5% in the standardized group (P = 0.2029). The difference between both strategies (standardized minus open) was -4.9% (95% CI [-12.5%; 2.6%]). There were more investigations in the open group than in the standardized group (5371 vs. 3759, P < .0001).

### Referral process in patients with uveitis: A challenge in the health system [^113fRnKL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Uveitis comprises a diverse group of intraocular inflammatory conditions, including a variety of disorders that can involve not only the uvea but also the retina, optic nerve, and vitreous. Uveitis can be restricted to the eye or related to systemic diseases. It can be idiopathic, autoimmune, masquerade, or caused by numerous infectious agents. It can vary regarding its clinical course, treatment, and prognosis. Whereas some forms of uveitis have a limited course and a favorable prognosis, requiring short-term treatment, other forms have a prolonged course with severe visual compromise, requiring long-term treatment.

Due to the complexity of uveitis cases, many are not easily recognized, leading to delayed diagnosis and potentially irreversible complications. This is why uveitis must be treated by a specialist.

In the Colombian health system, initial patient attention is performed by a general practice physician who decides if the patient should be evaluated by a specialist, such as an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist then determines if the patient needs to be evaluated by a subspecialist, specifically a uveitis specialist. These evaluations are usually performed in an outpatient setting, with appointments taking up to several months. Additionally, in Colombia, there are few uveitis specialists, located mainly in Bogotá, Cali, Medellín, and Bucaramanga.

We consider it crucial to study the phenomenon of referral to the uveitis specialist and its potential impact on patient outcomes and the healthcare system.

### Approach to the diagnosis of the uveitides [^116pu3h6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe an approach to diagnosing the uveitides, a collection of about 30 separate diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation. The design of the study is perspective.

The methods involve integrating a clinical approach with a more formal, informatics-derived approach to characterization and a Bayesian approach to laboratory testing.

The results show that the patient's uveitis is characterized along several dimensions: course, laterality, anatomic location of the inflammation, morphology, presence of active infection, and the host (age, presence of a systemic disease). Posterior uveitis can be further characterized by whether it is primarily a retinitis, choroiditis, or retinal vasculitis; by whether it is paucifocal or multifocal, and by the morphology of the lesions. This characterization narrows the differential diagnosis to one or, at most, a few diseases. Laboratory screening, i.e. testing all patients, should be reserved for those diseases that can present as any type of uveitis, whereas targeted testing, i.e. testing a subset with specific features, is used selectively. Laboratory testing should be used to identify an infection (which will alter therapy) or a systemic disease that will affect the patient's health. A uveitis that is not one of the established diagnoses is designated as "undifferentiated", with the course, laterality, and anatomic location (e.g. undifferentiated bilateral chronic anterior uveitis). The term "idiopathic" uveitis is avoided as most identified noninfectious uveitic diseases are idiopathic, and most systemic diseases associated with uveitis are also idiopathic.

### Reclassifying idiopathic uveitis: Lessons from a tertiary uveitis center [^112Po2q3]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

Idiopathic uveitis is frequently the most common diagnosis in series from uveitis clinics. This study sought to determine the percentage of patients initially diagnosed as idiopathic, noninfectious uveitis referred to a tertiary uveitis center who were subsequently found to have an identifiable cause of uveitis.

- **Design**: Retrospective case series.

- **Methods**: We performed a computerized database analysis of 179 consecutive patients who were referred to our practice with the diagnosis of idiopathic, noninfectious uveitis between 2008 and 2016. Patients were evaluated by a thorough history and ophthalmic examination with selected laboratory testing targeted by clues from the history and examination. Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria were used to better assess different types of uveitis.

- **Results**: Fifty-two out of 179 (29.0%) patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic uveitis were subsequently diagnosed with an underlying condition. Among patients referred with a diagnosis of idiopathic disease, female patients were most commonly affected (121/179; 67.6%). Among subsequent diagnoses, sarcoidosis was the most common (19/52 or 36.5%), followed by HLA-B27-associated uveitis (11/52, 21.1%), infectious uveitis (6/52, 11.5%), tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (6/52, 11.5%), and juvenile idiopathic uveitis (4/52, 7.7%). Other diagnosable conditions included Behçet disease, multifocal choroiditis, panuveitis, Crohn disease, multiple sclerosis, and relapsing polychondritis. An underlying condition was not found in 127 of 179 (70.9%) patients.

It is the consensus of the medical community that ocular complications associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mild and self-limiting, with no reports at the time of writing of a sight-threatening event. We report a patient with a systemic inflammatory syndrome in the context of COVID-19, presenting with ophthalmological (uveitis), dermatological (erythema and skin nodules), and cardiovascular (edema) manifestations. The anterior uveitis resulted in an increase in intraocular pressure that failed to respond to clinical treatment, necessitating surgical intervention to preserve vision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of COVID-19-related ocular hypertension. Timely surgical intervention was crucial to save the vision in the patient's only eye.

Methotrexate is a safe and effective immunosuppressive agent, and it is the most commonly used in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis and chronic anterior or intermediate uveitis. In the literature on methotrexate for anterior uveitis associated with seronegative spondyloarthropathies and JIA, methotrexate permitted adequate immunosuppression, was steroid sparing, and maintained disease control. In a large series involving 465 patients with ocular sarcoidosis, of which 365 were treated with methotrexate, most cases responded well to immunomodulatory therapy (IMT). The drug was both efficient and well tolerated, with 281 (77%) patients continuing methotrexate therapy, while only 14 (3.8%) had to discontinue due to drug toxicity.

Recently, intravitreal methotrexate has shown success in treating uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME). For the treatment of 15 eyes with uveitic CME, there was statistically significant visual improvement of 4 and 4.5 lines at 3 and 6 months, respectively, with no statistically significant difference in vision compared to previous treatment with corticosteroids or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. A relapse occurred at a median of 4 months, but reinjection demonstrated similar efficacy. Following intravitreal corticosteroids, methotrexate is the most widely used intravitreal immunosuppressive agent. The dose administered is 400 μg/0.1 mL, which is effective in different inflammatory ocular disorders as well as in masquerade syndromes due to intraocular lymphoma.

### Uveitis associated with childhood rheumatic diseases [^115RtTMT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Optimal management of childhood rheumatic diseases requires an appreciation of their multisystem nature. The eye represents an important site of involvement, with inflammation of the uveal tract being a particularly frequent and potentially debilitating extra-articular feature of some childhood rheumatic diseases. Anterior uveitis associated with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an especially distinctive entity. Other disorders in children may also be associated with posterior and intermediate uveal tract inflammation.

The potentially debilitating consequences of uveitis associated with childhood rheumatic diseases, the inadequacies of existing therapies, and the immunopathogenic basis for particular forms of uveitis have prompted the use of immunomodulatory therapy, including new biologic agents, to treat childhood uveitis. This review summarizes recent contributions to the literature that help to clarify the spectrum of conditions associated with uveitis in children, consider evidence for immunopathogenic processes associated with uveitis, and address new approaches to therapy.

### Uveitis for the non-ophthalmologist [^11788j8P]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Uveitis encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation inside the eye. They are classified as either infectious or non-infectious. The non-infectious uveitides, presumed to be immune-mediated, can be further divided into those associated with a known systemic disease and those that are eye-limited — i.e. not associated with a systemic disease. An ophthalmologist identifies the specific uveitic entity through medical history, clinical examination, ocular imaging, and supplemental laboratory testing if indicated.

Treatment for infectious uveitides is tailored to the specific infectious organism and may include regional and/or systemic medication. First-line treatment for non-infectious uveitides involves corticosteroids, which can be administered topically, as regional injections or surgical implants, or systemically. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy is used for patients with severe disease who cannot tolerate corticosteroids, require chronic corticosteroids at doses greater than 7.5 mg/day of prednisone, or in whom the disease is known to respond better to immunosuppression. Management of many of these diseases is optimized through coordination between the ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist or internist.

Regarding medical management for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, specifically with respect to topical corticosteroids, the ACR/AF 2019 guidelines recommend avoiding the immediate switch of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Instead, treatment should begin with topical corticosteroids for pediatric and adolescent patients who have spondyloarthritis that is otherwise well-controlled with systemic immunosuppressive therapy (DMARDs, biologics) and develop acute anterior uveitis.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: Past, present and future: A review [^116tW2tt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

In active endogenous uveitis, elevated immunoglobulins have been detected in both sera and aqueous humor. Elevated levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA have been measured in acute anterior uveitis. Similarly, elevated non-specific IgG and IgA have been detected in the aqueous humor. It has been proposed that the presence of an IgA response suggests an environmental or infectious etiology acting across mucosal tissue. However, the lack of pathogen-specificity does not support an infective pathogenesis. Conversely, the presence of elevated IgG antibodies, particularly the detection of anti-retinal IgG antibodies, reinforces an autoimmune pathogenesis in "idiopathic" and non-infectious posterior uveitides.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, specifically concerning ophthalmic screening, the 2019 ACR/AF guidelines recommend educating pediatric and adolescent patients with spondyloarthritis about the warning signs of acute anterior uveitis. This education aims to reduce delays in treatment, the duration of symptoms, and the risk of complications associated with iritis.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: Diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^117BfXnh]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Intermediate uveitis (IU) accounts for 10%–20% of uveitis cases overall, but 61%–80% of MS-associated uveitis. At present, MS-associated uveitis is not defined separately from undifferentiated (formerly idiopathic) IU, a term normally reserved for anatomically defined IU that is not associated with infection or systemic diseases like sarcoidosis or Behçet disease. This is because a sizable proportion of people first diagnosed with IU might develop MS several years later. Neuroimaging is not currently recommended for patients with IU unless they already have neurologic symptoms or signs or they are being evaluated for certain biologic therapies (see recommendations for management of MS-associated IU). Consequently, there are no known predictive clinical or investigation findings to identify those people with IU at greater risk of developing MS later. Because of the difficulties in defining MS-associated IU in patients who do not already have MS, the most conservative approach is to use the latest 2017 McDonald criteria for MS and the anatomic definition of undifferentiated IU by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Group.

The clinical presentation of IU differs from demyelinating lesions of the afferent and efferent visual pathways. Patients with IU may be asymptomatic for several years or develop symptoms insidiously. The most common symptoms, if they occur, are floaters, blurred vision, pain, photophobia, and red eye. Although symptoms of eye pain, blurred vision, and photophobia are also experienced in other conditions, these are specific to IU in the context discussed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of uveitis [^111gqnLo]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Uveitis is a term used to describe inflammation of the choroid, iris, or ciliary body, which make up the uveal tract. It can be idiopathic or associated with a systemic disease, which may be infectious or noninfectious. With the exception of B-scan ultrasonography, imaging methods for diagnosing and monitoring uveitis are predominantly non-radiologic. Although MRI has been anecdotally shown to detect various inflammatory conditions of the globe, such as posterior scleritis, endophthalmitis, and posterior uveitis secondary to Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, a more comprehensive review of the MRI findings in uveitis of various etiologies is presented here.

- **Methods**: The MRI and CT studies of seven patients with uveitis and the clinical history of three of them (not available in four patients) were reviewed. Etiologies included ankylosing spondylitis, relapsing polychondritis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis.

- **Results**: Increased gadolinium enhancement of the uveal tract, visualized as the enhancing layer immediately deep to the low-signal sclera, was seen on all six MRI studies. Diffusion-weighted imaging of a case with posterior uveitis and subretinal effusions revealed restriction within the uvea and effusions. Two patients had inflammatory nodules adherent to the uvea, two patients had vitreous humor abnormalities, and one patient exhibited proximal perineural and perimuscular spread of enhancement. Uveoscleral thickening and enhancement with a posterior calcification were observed in the patient with chronic uveitis.

### Referral process in patients with uveitis: A challenge in the health system [^116hBxxB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Uvea specialist evaluation**: The time required by the uvea specialist to reach a final diagnosis varied between 0 and 94 weeks, with a mean of 5.27 weeks (0.1 years). In 81.3% of the patients, a final etiological diagnosis was reached, with 72.3% corresponding to non-infectious uveitis and 27.7% to infectious uveitis. Regarding anatomical classification, anterior uveitis was the most common, followed by panuveitis, posterior uveitis, and intermediate uveitis.

When evaluating overall diagnostic coincidence (n = 315), the referral diagnosis was incorrect in 58.7% of the cases. However, diagnostic coincidence was evaluated when the patient was referred with an initial etiological diagnosis and a final etiological diagnosis was reached by the uvea specialist; 177 patients met the criteria. Diagnostic coincidence was not reached in 26.6% of the cases. Non-infectious uveitis diagnosis (63.8%) was easier to reach than infectious uveitis (36.2%).

More detailed information about the uvea specialist evaluation is shown in Table 6.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: The SHARE initiative [^113KQw8M]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, particularly related to DMARDs and biological DMARDs, the SHARE initiative 2018 guidelines recommend adding or switching to biological treatment if methotrexate is ineffective or intolerant.

- **Biological treatments**: Initiate anti-TNF agents (adalimumab > infliximab > golimumab) in patients with uveitis that is refractory or resistant to DMARD therapy, primarily methotrexate.
- **Treatment adjustments**: Consider switching between different anti-TNF treatments if the uveitis remains refractory to the initial anti-TNF therapy.

### A case of herpes zoster uveitis with severe hyphema [^112VoK1H]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

We propose that ZSH is an important differential diagnosis in a case of acute anterior uveitis with severe hyphema. Serial measurements of serum anti-VZV IgG (EIA) and simultaneous measurements of serum and aqueous humor anti-VZV IgG (EIA) led to a diagnosis for VZV reactivation. Especially in rare cases of severe anterior inflammation with marked hyphema, laboratory tests for a diagnosis of VZV activation and prompt systemic administration of corticosteroids and anti-herpes virus medication may improve the outcome.

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: Diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^113NKA82]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Uveitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age adults, accounting for 10% of legal blindness in the United States. Among people with MS, the prevalence of uveitis is 10 times higher than among the general population. MS and uveitis share similar genetic risk factors and immunologic effector pathways, creating uncertainty whether uveitis is a manifestation of MS or a coincident disorder. This uncertainty raises several diagnostic and management issues for clinicians, particularly with regard to recognizing visual symptoms resulting from demyelination, intraocular inflammation, or the visual complications of disease-modifying drugs for MS (e.g. fingolimod).

Likewise, management decisions regarding patients with uveitis are influenced by the risk of precipitating or exacerbating episodes of demyelination, such as after anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic therapy, and other neurologic complications of immunosuppressive treatments for uveitis. In this review, we explore the similarities in the pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment of patients with uveitis and MS. Based on the latest evidence, we provide recommendations to guide neurologists and ophthalmologists in managing patients affected by both conditions.

Uveitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age adults, accounting for 10% of legal blindness in the United States. Among people with MS, the prevalence of uveitis is 10 times higher than among the general population. Because MS and uveitis share similar genetic risk factors and immunologic effector pathways, it is not clear whether uveitis is one of the manifestations of MS or a coincident disorder. This uncertainty raises several diagnostic and management issues for clinicians who look after these patients, particularly with regard to recognizing visual symptoms resulting from demyelination, intraocular inflammation, or the visual complications of disease-modifying drugs for MS, such as fingolimod. Likewise, management decisions regarding patients with uveitis are influenced by the risk of precipitating or exacerbating episodes of demyelination, such as following anti–tumor necrosis factor biologic therapy, and other neurologic complications of immunosuppressive treatments for uveitis.

In this review, we explore the similarities in the pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment of patients with uveitis and MS. Based on the latest evidence, we make a set of recommendations to help guide neurologists and ophthalmologists to best manage patients affected by both conditions.

Regarding medical management for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, particularly in the management of uveitis, the ACR/AF 2019 guidelines recommend tapering topical corticosteroids first in pediatric and adolescent patients with JIA and chronic anterior uveitis. This applies to those controlled on systemic therapy but still using 1–2 drops/day of prednisolone acetate 1% (or equivalent).

### Diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios in HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis [^115U3yhh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Uveitis is a leading cause of ocular morbidity, contributing to 5–10% of global visual impairment. Among its various forms, acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is the most prevalent, accounting for 28–50% of all uveitis cases. HLA-B27-associated AAU is the most frequently identifiable subtype, with approximately 50% of AAU cases positive for HLA-B27. This condition is characterized by intraocular inflammation localized to the anterior segment and may lead to recurrences, complications, and long-term visual impairment. Up to 10% of affected individuals may experience severe vision loss or legal blindness. Beyond its ocular manifestations, HLA-B27-associated AAU is linked to systemic inflammatory diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. While diagnosis primarily relies on clinical presentation, HLA-B27 testing serves as a confirmatory tool, although turnaround times vary depending on laboratory techniques.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) serves as a simple and effective metric for quickly evaluating a subject's inflammatory status, as it closely correlates with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. A complete blood count (CBC) is used to calculate both the NLR and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The NLR is determined by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count, while the PLR is calculated by dividing the platelet count by the lymphocyte count.

Recent studies have explored the role of NLR in various ocular conditions, including thyroid-related orbitopathy (TRO), pterygium, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

### Referral process in patients with uveitis: A challenge in the health system [^113ANoD4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of the first uveitis consultation, 65.1% of patients were referred with an etiological diagnosis; approximately more than half of them had an adequate infectious panel (52.1%) and rheumatological panel (58.1%). The investigation panel varied among anatomical diagnoses: the infectious panel was more frequently requested in cases of posterior uveitis, while the rheumatologic panel was more commonly requested in panuveitis. General lab test requests were most common in posterior uveitis, followed by panuveitis, anterior uveitis, and intermediate uveitis.

Only 69 patients required an aqueous humor Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) study. However, merely 11.6% of these patients had this laboratory test requested. This test was requested by retina specialists, general ophthalmologists, glaucoma specialists, and neuro-ophthalmology specialists.

- **Management approach**: Patients were referred with adequate topical treatment in 65.1% of the cases. Overall, the referral with the correct systemic therapy (n = 315) was 32%. Nonetheless, only 250 patients needed systemic treatment, of whom 59.6% were referred to uveitis specialists without the correct therapy.

Systemic therapies, listed in prescription order, included immunomodulators, antibiotics for antiparasitic use, biologicals, antivirals, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Immunomodulators and biological therapies were mostly prescribed by rheumatologists, while corticosteroids and antibiotics for antiparasitic use were prescribed by retina specialists.

### Differential diagnosis and management of Behçet syndrome [^111Q3qCM]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Behçet syndrome, also known as Behçet disease, is a rare condition associated with considerable morbidity. Although cases have been reported worldwide, the highest prevalence occurs in countries bordering the ancient Silk Route, such as Turkey and Iran. The classic triad of manifestations includes oral ulceration, genital ulceration, and eye disease, but the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems can also be affected. The syndrome is chronic and relapsing; some patients experience benign episodes, while others face serious complications, including blindness or rupture of a pulmonary arterial aneurysm.

Diagnosing Behçet syndrome, particularly outside of endemic regions, often incurs considerable delay due to its rarity. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data from randomized controlled trials on optimal therapeutic approaches, along with a lack of informative laboratory surrogate markers to monitor disease progression. This review discusses issues surrounding the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Behçet syndrome and presents approaches to managing patients with this complex group of disorders.

### Clinical profile of HLA-B27-associated uveitis in an Egyptian cohort [^112wpAZs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Uveitis, or intraocular inflammation, principally affects the working-age population (20 to 50 years of age) and may cause significant morbidity and economic burdens. Anterior uveitis is the most frequent subtype of uveitis, and some studies report it as representing up to 90% of all uveitis cases. The strong association between the genetic marker human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and anterior uveitis has been repeatedly documented, albeit with geographic and ethnic variability in its prevalence. Values as low as 12% and as high as 88% have been reported for the positivity of HLA-B27 among patients with acute anterior uveitis (AAU).

At the time of writing, the pathophysiology of HLA-B27-associated uveitis is still not completely understood. Moreover, patients have shown considerable variability with respect to the ocular features, systemic comorbidities, and responses to different treatment modalities.

The aim of the study is to describe the clinical profile of patients with HLA-B27-associated uveitis at two uveitis referral clinics in Egypt between January 2010 and June 2018.

### Etiology of uveitis in Upper Egypt [^1117Hpin]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

A large number of inflammatory ocular conditions can be grouped under the term "uveitis". The etiologies of ocular inflammation vary to a great extent from one geographic location to another and show a prominent ethnic predisposition. Due to the blinding potential of a significant percentage of ocular inflammatory conditions, it is critically important for ophthalmologists to be well-informed about the pattern of uveitis prevalent in the region they serve, as well as its common causes. This understanding assists them in proceeding more successfully with their differential diagnosis plan and initiating the most appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

In this domain, numerous reports and studies have been published from different countries to report and expose the predominant causes and forms of ocular inflammation in each country. This study aims to report the causes of uveitis among patients referred to a tertiary level hospital in Upper Egypt.

### Intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis in the Mid-Atlantic USA [^115nmweT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Uveitis represents a heterogeneous group of intraocular inflammatory diseases with a diverse set of infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Uveitis epidemiology varies widely with geographic location; however, it remains a significant cause of vision loss throughout the world. Globally, the uveitides account for up to 25% of blindness. In the United States, uveitis causes an estimated 30,000 new cases of legal blindness annually and is responsible for 10%–15% of blindness in the Western world. Complicated uveitis management often requires many clinic visits. This, coupled with the vision loss associated with the uveitides, represents a great burden to patients and society, both financially and in terms of lost productivity and decreased quality of life.

Despite recognition of the risk of blindness with ocular inflammation, reports detailing the incidence, prevalence, and regional patterns of uveitis remain limited in certain areas. There has been increased interest in population-based reports and epidemiological data on uveitis in recent years, which have led to a more comprehensive understanding of ocular inflammation and its etiologies. Because the development of uveitis and the visual outcomes associated with the uveitides are influenced by a combination of genetics, geography, ethnicity, diagnostic factors, and referral patterns, it is essential to report the regional epidemiology of uveitis in order to characterize the regional characteristics of these disorders to allow for prompt diagnosis and initiation of vision-saving treatment.

### Characterisation of delayed severity flares in patients with HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis [^111Y4VHA]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

To explore and characterise the clinical phenotype of acute anterior uveitis flares with delayed severity in patients with human leucocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27)-associated anterior uveitis, a retrospective chart review was conducted.

Demographic and clinical data were recorded, as well as the clinical characteristics of acute anterior uveitis flares. A flare was considered to have delayed severity if any of the following criteria were met within 3 to 21 days of symptomatic onset: a two-step increase in anterior chamber inflammation on consecutive exams, a new development of hypopyon or fibrinoid aqueous reaction on consecutive examinations, or a significant worsening of symptoms.

A total of 371 patient charts were identified, of which 137 were included. Three hundred twenty-one acute anterior uveitis flares were documented, with 36 (11.2%) meeting the criteria for a delayed severity flare. The average time from symptomatic onset was 10.2 days. Patients presented with an average anterior chamber cell grade of 3.5 in delayed severity flares compared with 1.6 in non-delayed severity flares. No significant difference in frequency of delayed severity presentation was noted based on the presence or absence of systemically associated rheumatological disease, papillitis on initial presentation, and retinal vasculitis on initial presentation. The frequency of topical steroid therapy after symptomatic onset was not significantly different between the two flare phenotypes.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^114Vptzr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis cases seen in Western countries are noninfectious and appear to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data supporting emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future: a review [^111FakLa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests in intraocular inflammatory diseases have always been controversial due to historically perceived issues with specificity and sensitivity. The complexity arises from balancing the requirement to identify infectious agents or underlying inflammatory conditions against the cost of these investigations, the available resources at the treating facility, and the utility of tests employed, especially considering potential sensitivity issues. This is particularly challenging in acute circumstances where time is critical for obtaining results. In contrast, tests assessing overall systemic health before starting immunosuppression, which may further compromise health, are performed for broader health evaluations.

Traditionally, a "textbook" list of relatively untailored investigations can be costly and might not contribute significantly to diagnosis or management decisions. A retrospective review of patients with various types of uveitis indicated that abnormal values in complete blood counts, plasma viscosity/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and VDRL/TPHA did not help establish an underlying cause for uveitis. A Canadian survey also revealed that most routine tests conducted for the investigation of anterior uveitis lack sensitivity and specificity, resulting in low diagnostic yields.
