## Question

Are there any reports of hepatic injury associated with ventropiravir?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hepatic injury has been reported with ventropiravir. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming whether ventropiravir appears in the supplied references at all. Then, I should consider plausible synonym or look‑alike drug names that could be confused with ventropiravir and check their hepatic safety signals. Next, I will review major DILI guidelines and large summaries to see if this agent is listed among known culprits. Finally, I should outline a prudent clinical approach if hepatotoxicity is suspected with an agent that lacks published hepatic safety data, while clearly stating the limitations of the evidence base here.

> Let me first confirm the basic point: does "ventropiravir" appear anywhere in the provided material. I carefully scanned the guideline documents, drug labels, reviews, and case reports, and I do not find any instance of "ventropiravir" cited in association with drug-induced liver injury or otherwise, which strongly suggests that within this evidence set there are no direct reports of hepatotoxicity for a drug by that exact name.

> Wait, let me verify whether this could be a misreading or a synonym of another antiviral with known hepatic signals. At first glance I wondered if it might be confused with antivirals used for COVID-19 such as remdesivir or lopinavir/ritonavir, both of which have documented associations with transaminase elevations and DILI in pharmacovigilance and labeling, but on closer inspection those agents are distinctly named and separately described; there is no indication that "ventropiravir" is an alias for them in the supplied sources [^1132uR4n] [^111wLCfH] [^111f3K7k] [^114DK2fY].

> I need to check the broader DILI landscape to be sure I am not missing an uncommon listing. Large guidelines and reviews consistently catalog the most frequent drug classes and exemplars implicated in DILI — antibiotics, HDS products, cardiovascular and CNS agents, antineoplastics, antiretrovirals, and certain antifungals — yet "ventropiravir" does not appear among these enumerations here, which supports the conclusion that this specific name is not captured in these compendia of known hepatotoxins within the provided set; that said, absence in these documents does not prove absence of risk, only that no signal is documented here [^1117szt7] [^113Y8zYq] [^114m9G7Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if a clinician suspects hepatic injury temporally related to an agent that lacks published data in this packet, the management should still follow standard DILI principles. I should confirm that other causes are excluded, including acute viral hepatitis and HEV, obtain appropriate labs and imaging based on the injury pattern, and avoid rechallenge if the initial injury was significant or met Hy's law criteria; these steps align with AASLD, EASL, ACG, and related guidance for suspected DILI of uncertain causality [^112U9Cse] [^111dNEx7] [^116yE78p] [^114fLfLe] [^116N6Cqt].

> In summary, based on the documents provided, I should state clearly that I find no reports of hepatic injury linked to a drug named ventropiravir in this reference set; if the intended agent was a different antiviral with a similar name, I should double-check the exact spelling so I can align the assessment with the correct compound and its known hepatic safety profile; until then, any inference about hepatotoxicity for "ventropiravir" cannot be made from these sources alone and clinical decisions should default to general DILI best practices and vigilant monitoring when risk is uncertain [^1117szt7] [^112U9Cse].

I can't find a drug named "ventropiravir". Please **confirm the exact name** (or provide an alternative or brand name) so I can review hepatic injury reports and provide a precise, evidence-based answer.

If you meant a different antiviral, I can summarize **hepatic safety signals** for:

- **Remdesivir**: hepatobiliary adverse events reported in WHO VigiBase [^1132uR4n]
- **Lopinavir/ritonavir**: liver injury signals in COVID-19 cohorts [^111f3K7k] [^116ge95N]
- **Direct-acting antivirals** (e.g. ZEPATIER [^115bFway], VOSEVI [^112PxTQ8]): hepatic decompensation/failure reported, especially with advanced liver disease [^117S7pX3]

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^1117szt7]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The EASL 2019 guidelines provide important insights on drug-induced liver injury, especially concerning patients with specific phenotypes and immune-related hepatotoxicity. They highlight the significant potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors to cause immune-related hepatotoxicity in a substantial proportion of patients. Among these, CTLA-4 inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, are identified as more hepatotoxic compared to PD-L1 agents like nivolumab. Furthermore, combination treatments are noted to carry an even greater risk.

The following constitutes key background information on drug-induced liver injury:

- **Definition**: DILI is acute or chronic liver injury characterized by abnormalities in liver function.

- **Pathophysiology**: DILI is mostly caused by antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate; 45.4%), herbal and dietary supplements (16.1%), cardiovascular agents (9.8%), CNS agents (9.1%), antineoplastic agents (5.5%), and analgesics (paracetamol overdose; 3.7%).

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of DILI include jaundice, rashes, acute hepatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, AIH, coagulopathies, and hepatic encephalopathy. Progression may lead to chronic liver disease with fibrosis and cirrhosis, necessitating liver transplantation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality rate associated with DILI is 7.6%.

### Drug-induced hepatotoxicity: 2005 [^1143fcdM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The removal from the marketplace of several widely prescribed drugs due to hepatotoxicity has attracted considerable attention. Extensive reviews are now underway to determine methods for better identifying hepatic risk prior to federal approval. Assessing risk-to-benefit ratios for a novel agent with hepatotoxicity concerns, particularly one addressing a life-threatening condition, necessitates significant judgment and education from both prescribers and patients.

The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury is broad, simulating almost all known liver disorders. Drug-induced liver injuries often possess characteristic signatures concerning the type of injury (hepatocellular vs. cholestatic) and time of onset. The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury typically involves exclusion, with initial suspicion based on circumstantial evidence.

Factors affecting susceptibility to drug-induced injury include age, sex, concomitant use of other drugs, and genetic polymorphism in metabolic pathways related to drug activation or disposition. Drug-drug interactions create particular challenges in patients, often elderly, who are taking multiple medications simultaneously. The mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury are diverse. For many drugs, intermediary products produced during metabolism are highly reactive and toxic. In these situations, the balance between the rate of metabolite production and drug effectiveness may determine the occurrence of hepatic injury.

We report a case of a man with COVID-19 who developed acute hepatotoxicity related to remdesivir, with probable interaction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. Until further details on this interaction become available, we recommend physicians exercise caution when prescribing P-gp inhibitors to patients undergoing remdesivir therapy.

### Drug-induced liver injury associated with savolitinib: a novel case report and causality assessment [^11696XWj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The study encounters several constraints. Diagnosing drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains challenging due to the absence of pathological examination and serological tests for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and reconfirmed HEV infection. Without genetic testing, the complete investigation of the connection between the genotype of drug metabolism and liver injury has not been conducted. Consequently, the precise cause of savolitinib-induced liver injury remains unknown. Additionally, the study did not measure the blood concentration of savolitinib, as a method for measuring this concentration has not been established.

For cases of drug-induced liver injury, particularly concerning patients with specific phenotypes experiencing immune-related hepatotoxicity, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend discontinuing immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is advised to obtain an urgent gastrointestinal/liver consultation and initiate corticosteroids at 1–2 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent in patients with grade 3 hepatitis (AST/ALT levels at > 5–20× the upper limit of normal or TBIL levels at > 3–10× the upper limit of normal). If there is no clinical improvement in hepatitis within 3–5 days, consider starting second-line immunomodulators, such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^117DGo5u]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, specifically concerning patients with certain phenotypes and immune-related hepatotoxicity, the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend that a multidisciplinary team, including hepatologists, should decide on corticosteroid treatment for patients with immune-mediated hepatitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This decision should be based on clinical and histological assessments if the drug-induced liver injury is considered sufficiently severe.

### Cipro [^1146Czkn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with Cipro. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset, ranging from 1 to 39 days, and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis, such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or a tender abdomen, treatment should be discontinued immediately.

	- There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage who are treated with Cipro [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)].

- **Risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection**: Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following the use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients. The cause of the increased risk has not been identified. In patients with a known aortic aneurysm or who are at greater risk for aortic aneurysms, reserve Cipro for use only when there are no alternative antibacterial treatments available.

- **Serious adverse reactions with concomitant theophylline**: Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving the administration of Cipro and theophylline. These reactions have included cardiac arrest, seizure, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. Instances of nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation have also occurred.

### Metabolic and hepatobiliary side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [^113txpen]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been in use since 1987, the initiation of highly active ART has produced an increase in adverse drug reactions. This presents a new challenge as many of the adverse drug reactions attributable to ART may be indistinguishable from non-drug-related illnesses. The emergency physician must be aware of the potential complications of ART, as affected patients may present with nonspecific symptoms. The focus of this article is the metabolic and hepatobiliary adverse effects of ART.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, and more specifically concerning patients with herbal and dietary supplements (HDS)-induced liver injury, the ACG 2021 guidelines recommend discontinuing all herbal and dietary supplements in patients with suspected hepatotoxicity. It is advised to continue monitoring these patients for the resolution of liver injury.

### Entyvio [^1121CrFZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving intravenous Entyvio [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, three patients reported serious adverse reactions of hepatitis, manifested as elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin and symptoms consistent with hepatitis (e.g. malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia). These adverse reactions occurred following two to five intravenous Entyvio doses. However, based on case report information, it is unclear if the reactions indicated drug-induced or autoimmune etiology. All patients recovered following discontinuation of therapy, with some requiring corticosteroid treatment. In controlled trials, the incidence of ALT and AST elevations ≥ 3× ULN was < 2% in patients treated with intravenous Entyvio and in patients treated with placebo. In the open-label trial, one additional case of serious hepatitis was observed.

- **Malignancies**: In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) were reported in six of 1,434 (0.4%) patients treated with intravenous Entyvio, including colon cancer (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), breast cancer (n = 1), carcinoid tumor of the appendix (n = 1), and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). Malignancy was reported in one of 297 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo (squamous cell carcinoma). Malignancies (excluding dysplasia and basal cell carcinoma) observed during the ongoing open-label long-term extension trial included B-c.

### Acute liver failure associated with antiretroviral treatment for HIV: A report of six cases [^111UzRmy]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Severe hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially fatal side effect of all antiretrovirals. We report a series of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients admitted with acute liver failure (ALF) over a 25-month period, of whom five died. All had been treated with a range of antiretroviral therapy, and only two had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining illnesses.

- **Results**: Median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.5 months (range 1–23). Median time from the introduction of new antiretroviral therapy to the onset of ALF was 8 weeks (range 2–12). The development of ALF was unrelated to the duration of HIV treatment or type of antiretroviral therapy, and was not predicted by close outpatient supervision and monitoring of liver function. Biochemical investigations were variable but revealed a predominantly hepatocellular pattern. Liver biopsy showed typical features of mitochondrial toxicity in only one case, with confluent hepatocellular necrosis, inflammation, and cholestasis seen in the others.

- **Conclusions**: There is a need to increase awareness of the potential hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral therapy and to develop means of predicting its development. With increasing usage of antiretroviral therapy, severe hepatotoxicity and ALF may arise more frequently, and the outcome is poor despite intensive supportive therapy.

### Drug-induced liver injury associated with antiretroviral therapy that includes HIV-1 protease inhibitors [^116rg7UY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Since their introduction, hepatotoxicity has been associated with the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). However, the complexity of the HIV-infected patient and the combinations of medications used to treat HIV complicate the understanding of the independent effects of PIs in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Understanding PI-associated hepatotoxicity is essential. Of the PI regimens studied, the greatest risk of DILI has been observed among patients receiving full-dose ritonavir. Similarly, hepatitis B and/or C virus coinfection has been associated with a greater risk of DILI compared to those with no hepatitis. Although the specific mechanism by which viral hepatitis increases this risk is not known, patients with cirrhosis may have decreased cytochrome P450 activity, leading to increased PI exposure. Clearly, further research is needed to define the interaction of PIs and chronic viral hepatitis in the development of DILI.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: A systematic review [^114DK2fY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Liver functions should be monitored in COVID-19 patients at admission and during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests is not a contraindication for investigational or off-label treatment of COVID-19; however, such patients should be closely monitored while receiving any antivirals and off-label agents with potential liver toxicity. Known liver-toxic medications such as lopinavir-ritonavir and tocilizumab should be withheld if there is moderate to severe liver injury.

If systemic immunosuppression such as corticosteroids and tocilizumab is administered for more than seven days, screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended, especially in regions where this infection is prevalent. Drug interactions need to be considered when prescribing for COVID-19 patients with chronic liver disease.

Paracetamol (doses greater than 2 g per day) should be avoided in patients with chronic liver disease, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution. The use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 may increase the risk of hepatitis in chronic HBV patients. Thus, one should be cautious with its use and, if used, ensure close monitoring.

Certain combinations of drugs are best avoided in patients with preexisting liver disease. For example, concomitant administration of tenofovir derivatives with lopinavir–ritonavir is relatively contraindicated as the concentration of tenofovir may be increased due to a drug interaction. In such cases, suitable alternatives should be used.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^1113hAC7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patients with HDS-induced liver injury, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend encouraging patients to report the use of herbal and dietary supplements to their healthcare providers. This acknowledgment is based on the fact that supplements are not subjected to the same rigorous testing for safety and efficacy as prescription medications.

### Hepatitis E virus infection in a patient with suspected drug-induced liver injury [^1174gyjK]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman with a known case of multiple sclerosis was referred to the acute medical assessment unit for worsening liver function. She had recently started on a new drug, fingolimod, for multiple sclerosis. After excluding common causes of acute hepatitis within the community, a working diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury was made. However, as liver enzyme levels continued to rise, further investigations revealed an acute hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. This finding was unexpected, as the patient had no risk factors for acquiring an HEV infection, and there had not been a single case of HEV diagnosed in our hospital for a long time.

This case report highlights key issues: considering rare diagnoses in such clinical cases, concerns over infections once thought confined to developing countries, and the importance of including HEV workup when the baseline assessment for acute hepatitis is inconclusive.

### Liver transplantation for fulminant hepatitis related to nevirapine therapy [^113P7po8]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause of hepatocellular injury. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are known to cause hepatotoxicity. We describe a detailed case of fulminant hepatitis induced by nevirapine (Viramune) and treated by liver transplantation.

### Tremfya [^1117Ymbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: A serious adverse reaction of drug-induced liver injury was reported in a clinical trial subject with Crohn's disease following three doses of a higher than the recommended induction regimen. This subject had peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 18× the upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 11× ULN, and total bilirubin of 2.4× ULN. Tremfya was subsequently discontinued, and the liver test abnormalities resolved following administration of corticosteroids. In patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, evaluate liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline, for at least 16 weeks of treatment, and periodically thereafter according to routine patient management. Consider other treatment options in patients with evidence of acute liver disease or cirrhosis. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. Interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, until this diagnosis is excluded. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction.

- **Immunizations**: Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with Tremfya. Medications that interact with the immune system may increase the risk of infection following administration of live vaccines. Prior to initiating therapy with Tremfya, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to immunization guidelines. No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: Where do we stand [^116ge95N]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Cai et al. recently evaluated the clinical characteristics of 417 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with abnormal liver tests. Liver test abnormality was defined by the elevation of ALT > 40 U/L, AST > 40 U/L, ALT and total bilirubin > 1 mg/dL, while patients with ALT and/or AST > 3× ULN were classified as having hepatocyte-type liver injury. The authors compared liver function tests on admission and during hospitalization concerning COVID-19 severity.

On admission, 170 (41%) patients had abnormal liver test results, while 33 (5%) had signs of hepatocyte-type liver injury. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, while 26.7% of the patients progressed to severe pneumonia. Moreover, patients with hepatocyte-type injury or mixed-type injury (the combination of both ALT/AST > 3× ULN and GGT/ALP > 2× ULN) at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe pneumonia (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.19–6.3, and OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.93–10.23, respectively). However, during hospitalization, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir was correlated with liver injury (OR 4.44 to 5.03, both P < 0.01), indicating possible DILI as a cofactor. Moreover, a liver biopsy from one patient who died showed that liver function impairment during hospitalization could be partly due to the drugs used for treatment, or due to sepsis and shock. The authors concluded that patients with abnormal liver tests had higher risks of progressing to severe disease, but the detrimental effects on the liver were mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization.

### Frequency and pathological characteristics of drug-induced liver injury in a tertiary medical center [^111aLoDY]. Human Pathology (2017).

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) accounts for approximately 10% of acute hepatitis cases. DILI can arise as idiosyncratic or intrinsic injury from hundreds of drugs, herbals, and nutritional supplements and is essential to recognize as one of the differential diagnoses of hepatitis in a liver biopsy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency and pathological characteristics of DILI related to the variety of hepatotoxic agents.

We searched our pathology database for all patients with hepatitis diagnosed on liver biopsy from January 2012 to May 2016 and selected patients with a diagnosis of DILI. Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient medication lists, history of herbal medicine or supplement use, and pre-biopsy liver function test (LFT) results. Clinical and pathologic correlation was used to determine the causative or related agents for DILI. We then assessed histopathologic features of liver injury and categorized biopsy findings as primarily bile duct injury, lobular/portal hepatitis, or mixed changes.

Six hundred four total liver biopsies for hepatitis or liver injury were identified, of which 70 cases (11.6%) carried the diagnosis of DILI confirmed by clinical correlation. The most common etiologies associated with DILI were supplements and herbal products (31.4%), antimicrobials (14.3%), chemotherapeutics (11.4%), antilipidemics (7.1%), and immunomodulatory agents (7.1%). LFT results positively correlated with histological findings. Nutritional/herbal supplements have emerged as one of the major hepatotoxicity agents.

### Sporanox [^112HUp8T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sporanox has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases involved neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition and developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, treatment should be discontinued, and liver function testing should be performed. Continuation or reinstitution of treatment with Sporanox is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. See precautions: information for patients and adverse reactions.

- **Cardiac dysrhythmias**: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with Sporanox and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with Sporanox is contraindicated. See boxed warning, contraindications, and precautions: drug interactions.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^113wGnS3]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The EASL 2019 guidelines recommend that in specific circumstances of drug-induced liver injury, especially in patients with certain phenotypes like liver tumors, it is advisable to consider withdrawing medications where possible. Continued monitoring should be obtained until there is regression of the adenoma or until definitive treatment is achieved.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^116JDrgz]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patterns of injury, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend the recognition that:

- **Antimicrobials, CNS agents, and anti-inflammatory agents**: These are the most commonly implicated agents in the drug-induced liver injury (DILI) series worldwide.

- **Herbal and dietary supplements**: These are most commonly implicated in some Asian countries and are increasingly implicated in Western countries as well.

### Drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [^113MSo6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients frequently present with elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). This has often been attributed to the hepatic effects of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, including nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). A review of cohort studies investigating the incidence of hepatotoxicity among patients receiving ARV therapy suggests that the overall rate of ALT and/or AST elevations is similar among all ARVs.

The rate of severe hepatotoxicity, expressed as ALT and/or AST levels greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN), is relatively low during therapy with NNRTIs but may be significantly higher in patients with concurrent chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B or C). A comprehensive analysis of 17 randomized clinical trials of nevirapine demonstrated that 10% of all nevirapine-treated patients developed elevated levels of ALT and/or AST greater than five times the ULN. However, almost two-thirds (6.3% of nevirapine-treated patients) of these elevations were asymptomatic. Symptomatic hepatic events were observed in 4.9% (3.2%-8.9%) of nevirapine-treated patients.

### Imbruvica [^111rTAps]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity, including drug-induced liver injury
Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including Imbruvica. Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with Imbruvica. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after Imbruvica, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold Imbruvica. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue Imbruvica.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with Imbruvica [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Assess the baseline risk (e.g. high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings in animals, Imbruvica can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 3–20 times higher than those reported in patients with hematologic malignancies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Imbruvica and for 1 month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Alyftrek [^114SqEaD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury and liver failure can be serious conditions associated with the use of ALYFTREK. Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with ALYFTREK [Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases of serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury and liver failure have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease who were taking a fixed-dose combination drug containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), which contains the same or similar active ingredients as ALYFTREK. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating ALYFTREK. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ, and/or IVA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Kaletra [^111wLCfH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminase prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation with the use of Kaletra. There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications in the setting of underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. A causal relationship with Kaletra therapy has not been established. Elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV-1 mono-infected and uninfected patients as early as 7 days after initiating Kaletra in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. In some cases, the hepatic dysfunction was serious; however, a definitive causal relationship with Kaletra therapy has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with Kaletra, and patients should be monitored closely during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially during the first several months of Kaletra treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **QT interval prolongation**: Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported although causality with Kaletra could not be established. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with hypokalemia, and with other drugs that…

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend excluding alternative causes of liver injury in all patients with DILI. This includes testing for viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and pancreaticobiliary disease.

### Drug-induced liver disease [^117ByF2G]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using the diet agent Lipokinetix, highlighting several new agents as potential hepatotoxins. Numerous reports confirmed the hepatotoxicity of several previously described agents.

- **Causality assessment**: Refinements in assessing causality remain crucial for defining drug-induced liver disease. Proposed new upper limits of normal for alanine aminotransferase are lower than most current laboratory reports and may require rethinking the definition of "normal liver function tests".

- **Chronic viral hepatitis**: Hepatitis B and C are significant risk factors for antiretroviral-induced liver injury in patients co-infected with HIV and in those receiving antituberculosis therapy.

- **Acetaminophen**: This drug is the most common cause of acute drug-induced liver failure in the United States and many other countries. Several papers discussed the distinctions between accidental and intentional overdoses, the impact of alcohol consumption as a risk factor, and newer methods of treating and preventing acetaminophen-related liver injury.

Finally, the use of potentially hepatotoxic medications in patients with underlying liver diseases remains controversial, and a rational approach to using such drugs in this setting is provided.

### Vosevi [^112PxTQ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Risk of hepatic decompensation/failure in patients with evidence of advanced liver disease: Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including treatment with Vosevi. Reported cases occurred in patients with baseline cirrhosis with and without moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease such as portal hypertension, perform hepatic laboratory testing as clinically indicated, and monitor for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation, such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue Vosevi in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure.

Vosevi is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A case of hepatotoxicity associated with vismodegib [^112i4bmz]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatotoxicity associated with vismodegib is a rare but serious side effect. In a postmarketing surveillance study conducted by Edwards et al, 94 cases associated with at least one adverse event of liver dysfunction were reported between 2009 and 2015 in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. Of these cases, 34 had severe hepatotoxicity with 20 cases resulting in hospitalization or death.

An explanation for the cause of hepatotoxicity in patients taking vismodegib has yet to be established. Only a few published case reports offer potential explanations. One case of severe hepatic injury was reported in an 83-year-old woman with a history of moderate daily alcohol use. This patient experienced nausea and vomiting after one week of treatment and was hospitalized three weeks later. Liver function tests found a cholestatic pattern of hepatotoxicity, and liver biopsy found nonspecific cholestasis with portal fibrosis. Chronic alcohol use was suggested to have been a predisposing risk factor for the hepatic injury.

Ash and Jolly reported a case of a 72-year-old man who had hepatotoxicity while also taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including naproxen to treat his myalgias caused by vismodegib. Although uncommon, direct hepatic injury from aspirin and naproxen has been reported. Naproxen is not known to independently increase aminotransferase enzymes; thus, the hepatotoxicity in this case was attributed to the combination of vismodegib and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Finally, Vestita et al. reported on a 71-year-old man with a history of a [text ends abruptly].

### Managing symptomatic drug-induced liver injury in HIV-hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients: A role for interferon [^115KPx5K]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection are at increased risk for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) compared with patients with HIV infection alone. The mechanism underlying this observation is unknown. We hypothesized that interferon (IFN) would induce biochemical improvement through its anti-inflammatory properties and thereby facilitate the reintroduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with DILI.

Methods: Patients with symptomatic DILI were referred for evaluation. A biopsy of a liver sample was performed for all patients except one with clinical cirrhosis.

Results: Twelve patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and symptomatic grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity received treatment with IFN and ribavirin (RBV). Seven of these patients had a history of recurrent DILI. The mean baseline CD4(+) T cell counts and HIV RNA levels were 124 cells/mm³ and 115,369 copies/mL, respectively. Biopsies of liver samples demonstrated significant necroinflammation (mean grade, 10.3) and fibrosis (mean stage, 2.9). Three patients continued to receive ART when they began treatment with IFN-RBV; nine reinitiated ART within an average of 12 weeks (range, 4–20 weeks) of HCV treatment initiation. All patients attained marked improvement in aminotransferases and continued to receive ART treatment during a mean follow-up regimen of 26.5 months, with subsequent virologic suppression and immunologic reconstitution (mean CD4(+) cell count increase, 251/mm³). However, only one patient maintained HCV suppression after completion.

### Hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs is reduced after successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected patients [^113kLUtX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The risk of liver toxicity during antiretroviral drug use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients increases in the presence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is unknown whether sustained HCV clearance after interferon (IFN)-based therapy might reduce this complication.

- **Methods**: The incidence of severe elevations in liver enzyme levels during antiretroviral therapy was retrospectively analyzed in a group of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients after completion of a full course of IFN-based therapy. Hepatic events were recorded according to the achievement of a sustained virological response (SVR), and the presence of advanced liver fibrosis was assessed by transient elastometry.

- **Results**: A total of 132 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were analyzed (66% men; mean age, 38 years). Overall, 33% achieved an SVR and 40% had advanced liver fibrosis after IFN therapy. A total of 49 episodes of liver toxicity occurred during a mean of 35 months of follow-up (9.7% per year) after IFN therapy. The yearly incidence of hepatic events was greater in patients who did not achieve an SVR than in those who did (12.9% vs. 3.1%; p < 0.001) and in patients with advanced liver fibrosis than in those without it (14.4% vs. 7.6%; p = 0.003). Drugs involved in hepatic events were dydeoxynucleoside analogues (namely, didanosine and stavudine; 40%), nevirapine (30%), efavirenz (11%), and protease inhibitors (PIs; 8%). In logistic regression analysis, lack of an SVR (odds ratio [OR], 6.13 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.83–37.45]; p = 0.003) and the use of dydeoxynucleosides (OR…

### Liver injury after beginning antiretroviral therapy in HIV/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients is not related to immune reconstitution [^113iYeC6]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Transaminase elevations occur more frequently after beginning antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The mechanism of liver injury in these individuals is unknown, although immune reconstitution phenomena have been postulated. In 42 HIV/HCV co-infected individuals followed after beginning potent antiretroviral therapy, the development of liver injury was not associated with significant changes in serum HCV-RNA levels nor with greater CD4 cell increases. Underlying chronic hepatitis may thus increase the risk of liver toxicity by other mechanisms.

### Global adverse events reported for direct-acting antiviral therapies for the treatment of hepatitis C: An analysis of the World Health Organization VigiBase [^116fuPSe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The proportion of adverse events by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen is presented below. Expected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among these were fatigue (19.7%), malaise (1.1%), nausea (8.2%), diarrhea (4.7%), vomiting (2.8%), sepsis (0.3%), and hepatic/renal events such as acute kidney injury (0.7%) and renal failure (0.3%). Unexpected ADRs included pulmonary events, such as dyspnea (1.5%), pneumonia (0.9%), and respiratory failure (0.1%), and cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction (0.3%) and cardiac arrest (0.1%) or cardiorespiratory arrest (0.1%). The proportion of these serious ADRs among all reported events differed between regimens.

- **Cardiovascular events**: Medications with the highest proportion of cardiovascular events were ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (0.7%) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (0.6%).

- **Pulmonary events**: The highest proportion of pulmonary events was reported for daclatasvir/sofosbuvir (3.3%) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (3.2%). However, some variation was observed between medications in the type of events within these categories. For example, the highest proportion of reports for dyspnea was for ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (2.3%), pneumonia for daclatasvir/sofosbuvir (1.5%), and myocardial infarction for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (0.4%).

Finally, the proportion of reports with death recorded ranged between 2.0% for elbasvir/grazoprevir and 5.4% for valpatasvir/sofosbuvir. The secondary analysis of 60,307 reports, including sofosbuvir or daclatasvir alone, showed similar results.

### Nomenclature, diagnosis and management of drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH): An expert opinion meeting report [^114aoE6W]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Drugs, herbals, and dietary supplements can cause a variety of acute and chronic liver injuries in susceptible individuals, resulting in a variety of phenotypes that mimic almost all liver disorders. One of the phenotypes increasingly ascribed to drugs was hitherto frequently referred to as "drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis" in the literature and will be termed "drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH)" in this article. ALH events are characterized by histological features highly overlapping with 'idiopathic' (classical) AIH and often associated with the presence of serum liver autoantibodies and elevated IgG levels. Currently, there are no specific pathognomonic findings or individual biomarkers that can be used to establish a diagnosis of idiopathic AIH. Diagnosis of AIH is based on clinical, biochemical, serological, and histological features. These are often overlapping with those identified in patients with drug-induced ALH. – Whether a given case of acute liver injury with an autoimmune phenotype is the drug-induced unmasking of subclinical AIH or de novo drug-induced liver injury (DILI) accompanied by autoimmune features may be difficult to distinguish [Box 1]. It is notable that several drugs and vaccines — including COVID-19 vaccines more recently — have been identified as triggers for the onset of AIH.

In contrast to a recognized high potential for chronicity or recurrence of hepatitis in AIH that requires long-term immunosuppressive therapy, ALH often resolves or improves upon withdrawal of the offending drug. Nonetheless, some patients with…

### Hepatic histological findings in suspected drug-induced liver injury: Systematic evaluation and clinical associations [^116sserg]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

We and others have argued that when pathologists review and report on drug-induced liver injury (DILI), they should classify the changes as a particular pattern of pathological injury. Pattern classification is critical for defining the pathological differential diagnosis, which can be used in conjunction with the clinical evaluation to establish the etiology of the injury.

For the purposes of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), we predefined 18 histological patterns that were likely to be encountered given the kinds of patients and drug etiologies we expected to accrue. We did not include tumors in the classification, despite well-described associations between drugs and tumors. Although the clinical cases of DILI in this cohort had a great diversity of findings, nearly 83% of our 249 cases could be classified into one of five patterns: acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, acute cholestasis, chronic cholestasis, and cholestatic hepatitis.

This distribution reflects both the character of our patient population and the injury patterns associated with the most commonly implicated drugs, particularly antibiotics, psychoactive agents, and drugs used to treat musculoskeletal disorders. Other populations with different types of drug injury may display different frequencies of the various injury patterns, so we recommend that pathologists use the full spectrum of possible patterns when reporting on DILI. Despite the variety of injury patterns observed, there was a good correlation between biochemical tests at the time of biopsy and individual histological findings. These associations serve to validate the use of systematized histological classification in DILI assessment.

### Liver injury during highly active antiretroviral therapy: The effect of hepatitis C coinfection [^116eHonL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is characterized by the elevation of liver enzyme and/or bilirubin levels caused by the use of medication or drugs. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some of these events may not be directly caused by medication. Factors such as acute viral hepatitis, reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and alcohol use may play roles. Elevated transaminase levels are indicative of liver injury, but most cases improve despite the continuation of drug therapy.

Approximately 33% of patients with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. Patients with HIV or HCV infection are more prone to DILI, possibly due to impaired hepatocyte defense mechanisms. HCV coinfection is associated with a 2- to 10-fold increased risk of developing elevated transaminase levels during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Importantly, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should not be denied HAART. Instead, they should undergo monthly liver function tests, and if grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations occur, they should be referred to specialists for further evaluation.

### Impact and management of COVID-19 in liver transplant candidates and recipients [^115Hk6KG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

When evaluating SARS-CoV-2-induced liver injury, drug-mediated hepatotoxicity must be considered. Of the antiviral drugs used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, remdesivir and tocilizumab are associated with elevated liver enzymes. Although their contribution to liver injury has not been substantiated in studies, it is reasonable to avoid these medications in liver transplant (LT) recipients with laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction and ALT > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Other drugs, such as antibiotics, used either to treat infections or prophylactically in the post-LT setting, may also cause liver injury. Overall, liver damage, which may present with variable patterns of liver injury, is an independent risk factor for increased mortality in LT recipients and may represent either a direct effect of the virus on hepatocytes and cholangiocytes or a consequence of other variables, namely hepatotoxic medications and infection.

### Drug-induced liver injury [^114m9G7Y]. Yeungnam University Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury can be associated with a variety of factors including malnutrition, niacin, acetaminophen, and herbal supplements. It may result in symptoms such as loss of appetite, generalized pruritus, jaundice, and skin rash. Laboratory findings often show increased serum AST, ALP, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin levels.

The condition can also be linked to the use of specific medications, risk factors, related conditions, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings.

- **Medications**: Nitrofurantoin, anti-tuberculosis drugs, antifungals, phenytoin, isoniazid, phenobarbital, aspirin, rifampin, NSAIDs, amiodarone, halothane, antibiotics
- **Antibiotic categories**: Minocycline, fluoroquinolones, dapsone, macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
- **Other medications**: Statins, amoxicillin-clavulanate

- **Risk factors**: Female sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, obesity, elderly age, alcohol consumption, malnutrition

- **Related conditions**: Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, MASLD, RUQ pain, peripheral edema, ascites, abdominal distension

- **Clinical manifestations**: Fatigue, fever, pale stools, dark urine, abdominal pain, RUQ pain

- **Laboratory findings**:
	- **Decreased levels**: Blood glucose, serum albumin
	- **Increased levels**: WBC count, INR, serum phosphate, creatinine levels

### Jaypirca [^111W6ZTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity, including drug-induced liver injury**: Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including Jaypirca. Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with Jaypirca. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after treatment, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold Jaypirca. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue Jaypirca.

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on findings in animals, Jaypirca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations, at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately three times the recommended dose of 200 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Jaypirca and for one week after the last dose.

### Protease inhibitor-based direct-acting antivirals are associated with increased risk of aminotransferase elevations but not hepatic dysfunction or decompensation [^11443Cf3]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Cases of acute liver injury (ALI) have been reported among chronic HCV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, but no analyses have compared the risk of ALI in patients receiving PI- vs. non-PI-based DAAs. Thus, we compared the risk of three ALI outcomes between patients (by baseline Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] group) receiving PI-based or non-PI-based DAAs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study of 18,498 patients receiving PI-based DAA therapy (paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir ± dasabuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) matched 1:1 on propensity score to those receiving non-PI-based DAAs (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) in the 1945–1965 Veterans Birth Cohort (2014–2019). During exposure to DAA therapy, we determined development of: i) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 200 U/L, ii) severe hepatic dysfunction (coagulopathy with hyperbilirubinemia), and iii) hepatic decompensation. We used Cox regression to determine hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for each ALI outcome within groups defined by baseline FIB-4 (≤ 3.25; > 3.25).

- **Results**: Among patients with baseline FIB-4 ≤ 3.25, those receiving PIs had a higher risk of ALT > 200 U/L (HR 3.98; 95% CI 2.37–6.68) but not severe hepatic dysfunction (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.19–2.39) or hepatic decompensation (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.29–3.49), compared to those receiving non-PI-based regimens. For those with baseline FIB-4 > 3.25, those receiving PIs had a higher risk of ALT > 200 U/L (HR 2.15; 95% CI 1.09–4.26) but not severe hepatic dysfunction (HR 1.2).

### Zipsor [^117J9oh7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, during the first 2 months of NSAID therapy, though they can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has documented cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these cases resulted in fatalities or required liver transplantation.

In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, the use of diclofenac was associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury compared with non-use. Specifically, the study found that the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female sex, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.

Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with Zipsor, as severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. However, based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. Severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during diclofenac therapy.

If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, physicians should re-evaluate the patient's treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^116N6Cqt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

In relation to classification and risk stratification for drug-induced liver injury (DILI), particularly regarding risks of rechallenge, the ACG 2021 guidelines advise against re-exposing patients with DILI to a drug likely responsible for hepatotoxicity. This is particularly emphasized if the initial liver injury involved significant aminotransferase elevation, such as levels exceeding five times the upper limit of normal (ULN), in accordance with Hy's law, or jaundice. However, an exception to this recommendation applies in life-threatening situations where no suitable alternative exists.

### Dovato [^117VJArZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with the use of Dovato [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In some cases, the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or HBV reactivation, particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Cases of hepatic toxicity, including elevated serum liver biochemistries, hepatitis, and acute liver failure, have also been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Drug-induced liver injury leading to liver transplant has been reported with Triumeq (abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine). Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended.

- **Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis**: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine (a component of Dovato). A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Monitor closely when administering Dovato to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease. Treatment with Dovato should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical symptoms suggestive of these conditions.

### Covid-19 and liver injury: Where do we stand [^111a94mn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The exact underlying pathophysiology and the clinical implication of COVID-19-associated liver injury have not yet been fully determined, although much research regarding this issue is ongoing. Based on previous experience, the role of coronaviruses in generating liver injury has been documented in patients infected by the SARS-CoV coronavirus, which was described as an acute respiratory syndrome back in 2003. While the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in liver tissue, it is unclear whether the liver injury can be caused directly by the coronavirus itself. Interestingly, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the target cell. However, while it has been demonstrated that the ACE2 receptor is expressed in the biliary epithelial liver cells, liver injury in COVID-19 patients is mainly revealed as hepatocyte injury, evidenced by ALT and AST elevation. Thus, an alternative pathophysiology of liver injury may be present in these patients.

One hypothesis is that liver injury may be a result of the characteristic immune-mediated damage and systemic inflammation caused by a hyper-activated response to COVID-19, as seen in patients with severe clinical manifestations. Other possible explanations and alternative mechanisms include drug-induced liver damage (DILI) associated with paracetamol, antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir), antimicrobials (macrolides, quinolones, beta-lactams, chloroquine), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as hypoxic hepatitis due to respiratory or cardiac failure in severe cases.

### Global adverse events reported for direct-acting antiviral therapies for the treatment of hepatitis C: an analysis of the World Health Organization VigiBase [^112vRCDK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

We first described the frequency and proportion of patient characteristics, report characteristics, and adverse drug reaction (ADR) serious criteria overall and by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen. From all reports associated with DAAs combined that were flagged with the seriousness criteria 'death' or 'life-threatening', we identified the 25 most frequently reported events, which were recorded as MedDRA Preferred Terms (MedDRA). We then identified the frequency and proportion of these adverse events among reports associated with DAA therapy, overall and stratified by DAA regimen. Adverse events were described as expected or unexpected based on whether they were previously reported in trials. Multiple outcomes could be associated with each report, and therefore, ADRs were not mutually exclusive. We performed all analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The data used only contained anonymized and aggregated clinical information, and thus this project was determined to be exempt from research ethics board approval.

### Zepatier [^115bFway]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Risk of hepatic decompensation/failure in patients with evidence of advanced liver disease:

Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including Zepatier.

Reported cases occurred in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens with baseline cirrhosis, with and without moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), as well as in some patients without cirrhosis. Since these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Hepatic laboratory testing**: Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed in all patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease, such as portal hypertension, more frequent hepatic laboratory testing may be warranted. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation, such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue Zepatier in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure.

Zepatier is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.9), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During the administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy.

Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia.

Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be carefully considered based on the clinical context.

### Trikafta [^114gkrKD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

TRIKAFTA can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation and death have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease taking TRIKAFTA, in both clinical trials and the postmarketing setting. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of TRIKAFTA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating TRIKAFTA. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline.

Interrupt TRIKAFTA in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g. ALT or AST > 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with bilirubin > 2 × ULN) and clinical symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g. jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites).

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume TRIKAFTA treatment.

### Efavirenz induced acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation in a slow drug metaboliser [^111SVQmK]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has revolutionized HIV management; however, many of these drugs are potentially hepatotoxic. Here, we report the first adult case of efavirenz-induced acute liver failure successfully treated by liver transplantation. Furthermore, genetic analysis revealed our patient to be a slow efavirenz metabolizer, contributing to the severity of the clinical presentation.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^116yE78p]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, specifically with respect to viral and serological hepatitis panels, the ACG 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining anti-HEV IgM in selected patients with suspected hepatocellular or mixed DILI if there is heightened clinical suspicion, such as:

- **Recent travel in an endemic area**: Indicates potential exposure to HEV.

- **Atypical DILI phenotype**: Presents in a manner not typical for drug-induced liver injury.

- **No readily identifiable culprit agent**: When there is no obvious drug causing the liver injury.

### Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir [^114gKHfL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: No specific antidote is available for overdose with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment consists of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. Hemodialysis is unlikely to significantly remove ledipasvir, as it is highly bound to plasma protein. However, hemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%.

### Subfulminant liver failure associated with quetiapine [^112gLSFt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

We report the clinical history of a patient with drug-induced liver injury due to quetiapine, who ultimately developed subfulminant hepatic failure and died. The clinical presentation, laboratory data, and liver histopathology supported the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the important association between quetiapine and drug-induced liver injury.

### Actos [^11477LE7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking Actos, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the Actos-controlled clinical trial database at the time of writing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities. They may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Actos therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Actos should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range) Actos treatment should be interrupted, and investigation should be done to establish the probable cause. Actos should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.

### Caution with the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in severely ill patients for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2: A report of severe jaundice [^111f3K7k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

We investigated the potential hepatotoxicity of lopinavir/ritonavir recently used in the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective cohort of critical patients in a teaching hospital: 12 treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and 30 in the standard-of-care group.

- **Results**: Elevation occurred more frequently in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (33% vs 6.7%).

- **Discussion**: Caution is advised regarding the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the most severe cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

### Sporanox [^1155N5sy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic effects

Sporanox® has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, treatment should be discontinued, and liver function testing should be performed. Continued use of Sporanox® or reinstitution of treatment is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS.)

- **Cardiac dysrhythmias**: Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as cisapride, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with Sporanox® and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with Sporanox® is contraindicated. (See BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions.)

### Identification of a novel and severe pattern of efavirenz drug-induced liver injury in South Africa [^116g7jvs]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Efavirenz now forms part of many antiretroviral regimens in low and middle-income countries. Efavirenz-related drug-induced liver injury is not well characterized but is thought to occur less frequently than with nevirapine. We describe our observation of three defined clinicopathological patterns of injury, one of which, submassive necrosis, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high baseline CD4, younger age, and possibly female gender predict the injury.

### Hepatobiliary adverse drug reactions associated with remdesivir: The WHO international pharmacovigilance study [^1132uR4n]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Remdesivir has demonstrated clinical benefits in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and was first approved for COVID-19 patients. However, whether remdesivir causes gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (GI-ADRs), including hepatotoxicity, is less clear. Therefore, we aimed to detect a diverse spectrum of GI-ADRs associated with remdesivir using VigiBase, the World Health Organization's international pharmacovigilance database of individual case safety reports.
