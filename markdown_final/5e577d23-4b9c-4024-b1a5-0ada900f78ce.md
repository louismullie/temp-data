## Question

Do we need to wait 3 weeks before cardioversion when switching between NOAK?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether switching from one NOAC to another NOAC requires a 3-week waiting period before cardioversion, and how to manage anticoagulation around the switch and the procedure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core cardioversion principle of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about switching between anticoagulants and whether any mandate a 3-week delay. Next, I will examine the pharmacokinetics of NOACs to see if a gap in coverage is expected. After that, I should review cardioversion-specific trial data that included NOAC switching or early initiation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach and confirm post-cardioversion management requirements [^115ATHHg] [^111mABJ7].

> Let me first confirm the core principle: for AF of 48 hours or longer or unknown duration, elective cardioversion should be preceded by at least 3 weeks of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or by preprocedural imaging to exclude left atrial thrombus, and anticoagulation should continue for at least 4 weeks afterward, regardless of apparent rhythm success, to mitigate thromboembolism risk during atrial mechanical recovery [^115ATHHg] [^116vKSco] [^114a2Nao] [^114JeqJh].

> Wait, let me verify whether switching anticoagulants resets that 3-week clock; I initially thought it might, but that would be a misinterpretation. The 3-week requirement applies to the duration of therapeutic anticoagulation, not to continuous exposure to a single agent, so an appropriately managed switch should not force a new 3-week wait if therapeutic anticoagulation is maintained without interruption [^notfound].

> I need to check guideline statements on switching. The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline explicitly supports uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion and does not require restarting the 3-week clock when switching agents; it also advises that if cardioversion is deferred due to LAA thrombus, anticoagulation should continue for 3–6 weeks with repeat imaging before proceeding, which again underscores continuity rather than agent-specific delays [^114a2Nao] [^113iTqJz]. The ESC/EACTS guidance similarly emphasizes uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation and does not mandate a new 3-week period after switching within the NOAC class, aligning with the principle of continuity [^115ATHHg].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for uninterrupted switching. NOACs achieve therapeutic anticoagulation rapidly: rivaroxaban within 2–4 hours, apixaban in 3–4 hours, edoxaban in 1–2 hours, and dabigatran in 1–3 hours, with steady state in 2–3 days; importantly, there is no pharmacokinetic requirement for a washout or bridging period when switching from one NOAC to another if the last dose of the outgoing NOAC is timed to end as the first dose of the incoming NOAC begins, maintaining continuous anticoagulation [^1163KYwY] [^1116RaR2].

> Next, I should review cardioversion-specific evidence. In X-VeRT, patients randomized to rivaroxaban could undergo cardioversion as early as 1–5 days, with many receiving only 1 dose before TEE-guided early cardioversion, and event rates were low and comparable to VKA; this supports the concept that uninterrupted NOAC therapy, including early initiation, is acceptable when combined with appropriate imaging or timing strategies [^1138KnHA] [^113QHuBp]. In EMANATE, apixaban was initiated and cardioversion could occur on the same day, with low thromboembolic rates, again reinforcing that continuity, rather than prolonged precardioversion therapy with a single agent, is the key safety determinant [^117Mened] [^113DpSgx]. ENSURE-AF likewise allowed edoxaban initiation with early cardioversion under TEE guidance, with outcomes comparable to enoxaparin–warfarin, supporting early NOAC initiation strategies when imaging excludes thrombus [^116KeCGu].

> Let me consider practical switching logistics to avoid a gap. A common approach is to take the final dose of the outgoing NOAC on the morning it is due, then start the new NOAC that same evening at the labeled starting dose; for example, stop apixaban in the morning and start rivaroxaban that evening, or stop rivaroxaban in the morning and start apixaban that evening, which avoids any clinically meaningful interruption in anticoagulation given the rapid onset of NOACs and their predictable pharmacokinetics [^notfound].

> I should confirm post-cardioversion management. Regardless of switching, therapeutic anticoagulation should continue for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion in all patients, and long-term anticoagulation should be guided by stroke risk factors and guideline-directed risk scores, independent of the specific agent used for the switch [^116vKSco] [^113MueRZ] [^114JeqJh].

> But wait, what if the patient has been therapeutically anticoagulated for less than 3 weeks at the time of the switch? In that scenario, the 3-week clock does not reset, but the total duration of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation must still meet the minimum 3 weeks before elective cardioversion unless a TEE-guided strategy is used to exclude thrombus; if a thrombus is found, cardioversion should be deferred and anticoagulation continued for 3–6 weeks with repeat imaging before proceeding [^115ATHHg] [^111mABJ7] [^113iTqJz].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the bottom line: switching from one NOAC to another does not require a new 3-week waiting period before cardioversion if therapeutic anticoagulation is maintained without interruption; the 3-week requirement pertains to the cumulative duration of therapeutic anticoagulation, not to continuous use of a single agent, and can be shortened to as little as 1–2 doses if a TEE-guided strategy is employed to exclude thrombus, with post-cardioversion anticoagulation continued for at least 4 weeks and long-term therapy dictated by stroke risk [^1138KnHA] [^117Mened] [^116KeCGu].

---

No, you do not need to wait 3 weeks before cardioversion when switching between NOACs if **therapeutic anticoagulation is uninterrupted** [^notfound]. The 3-week rule applies to **AF duration ≥ 48 hours or unknown**, not to switching anticoagulants [^114a2Nao]. If anticoagulation is continuous, proceed with cardioversion; if there is a gap, **use TEE to exclude thrombus** or restart the 3-week clock [^115zqwaZ] [^111XyJA1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation** before cardioversion for AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration [^114a2Nao]. The 3-week requirement refers to the duration of therapeutic anticoagulation, not to a specific agent [^111tGoXH]. Switching between NOACs does not reset the clock if anticoagulation remains uninterrupted [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting uninterrupted anticoagulation during NOAC switching

NOACs have rapid onset/offset and predictable PK, allowing **safe switching without a gap** [^112rtM8j]. Key trials and reviews show that uninterrupted NOAC anticoagulation around cardioversion is safe and effective:

- **X-VeRT trial**: Rivaroxaban was noninferior to VKA for early cardioversion, with low thromboembolic events and no excess bleeding [^1138KnHA].
- **EMANATE trial**: Apixaban enabled same-day cardioversion with low thromboembolism and bleeding rates [^113DpSgx].
- **ENSURE-AF trial**: Edoxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin–warfarin for cardioversion, supporting early NOAC use [^116KeCGu].

These data support **uninterrupted NOAC therapy** — including switching — without a mandatory 3-week delay before cardioversion [^115dzTYB].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Uninterrupted switching between NOACs | Proceed with cardioversion without delay if therapeutic anticoagulation is maintained [^111XyJA1] |
| Interruption of anticoagulation (≥ 48 hours) | - Use TEE to exclude thrombus before cardioversion [^115zqwaZ] <br/> - Or restart 3-week anticoagulation before cardioversion [^114a2Nao] |
| AF duration < 48 hours | Cardioversion can proceed without prolonged anticoagulation, but anticoagulation should be initiated and continued for at least 4 weeks post-cardioversion [^115L62nX] |

---

## Risks associated with interrupting anticoagulation

Interrupting anticoagulation increases **thromboembolic risk**, especially around cardioversion [^112Ts2sA]. Even brief gaps can allow thrombus formation and embolization; therefore, maintain uninterrupted anticoagulation whenever possible [^114JeqJh].

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

- **NOAC switching**: Plan the switch to avoid any gap in anticoagulation; start the new NOAC when the next dose of the old NOAC is due [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Ensure adherence and appropriate dosing during the switch to minimize thromboembolic risk [^112FikNY].
- **Post-cardioversion care**: Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion, regardless of rhythm outcome [^116vKSco].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uninterrupted anticoagulation**: No need to wait 3 weeks if switching NOACs without interruption [^notfound].
- **Interrupted anticoagulation**: Use TEE or restart 3-week anticoagulation before cardioversion [^115zqwaZ].
- **Post-cardioversion**: Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion [^116vKSco].

---

Switching between NOACs does not require a 3-week wait before cardioversion if **anticoagulation is uninterrupted**; the key is continuous therapeutic anticoagulation and guideline-concordant periprocedural management [^notfound].

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Both physicians and patients will have to learn how to use these drugs effectively and safely in specific clinical situations. This text is an executive summary of a practical guide that the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) has assembled to help physicians in the use of the different NOACs. The full text is being published in EP Europace. Practical answers have been formulated for 15 concrete clinical scenarios: (i) practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (ii) how to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (iii) drug-drug interactions and pharmacokinetics of NOACs; (iv) switching between anticoagulant regimens; (v) ensuring compliance of NOAC intake; (vi) how to deal with dosing errors; (vii) patients with chronic kidney disease; (viii) what to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a risk of bleeding?; (ix) management of bleeding complications; (x) patients undergoing a planned surgical intervention or ablation; (xi) patients undergoing an urgent surgical intervention; (xii) patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (xiii) cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (xiv) patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (xv) NOACs vs. VKAs in AF patients with a malignancy.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

### Oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status, special situations, and unmet needs [^112rtM8j]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk of stroke by more than 60%. But vitamin K antagonists have limitations, including causing serious bleeding such as intracranial haemorrhage and the need for anticoagulation monitoring. In part related to these limitations, they are used in only about half of patients who should be treated according to guideline recommendations. In the past decade, oral agents have been developed that directly block the activity of thrombin (factor IIa), as well as drugs that directly inhibit activated factor X (Xa), which is the first protein in the final common pathway to the activation of thrombin. These novel non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been shown to be at least as good as warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and they have proved to have better safety profiles. Their net advantage is underscored by significantly lower all-cause mortality compared with warfarin in large clinical trials. Because of these features and their ease of use, they are recommended for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. They have also a fast onset and offset of action, but they currently lack specific antidotes. This paper addresses the role of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the era of NOACs, with a focus on special situations including management in the event of bleeding and around the time of procedures including cardioversion, catheter ablation, and device implantation. Also their use in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, with advanced age, with chronic kidney disease, or with valvular heart disease will be discussed as well as the interaction of NOACs with other cardiac medication, and switching between anticoagulants.

Atrial fibrillation — intracardiac thrombus and cardioversion management: In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), detection of intracardiac thrombus should prompt cancellation of planned cardioversion and institution of therapeutic anticoagulation in anticoagulant-naive patients, and in patients already on anticoagulation it should prompt assessment of compliance, dosing appropriateness, drug absorption, and drug interactions. Switching to an alternate anticoagulant can be considered, although the benefit is uncertain. In anticoagulant-naïve patients, 61.2% had resolution of thrombus on follow-up transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed 3 to 12 weeks after initiation of VKA in CLOT-AF, and 41.5% had resolution on follow-up TEE performed 6 weeks after therapy with rivaroxaban in X-TRA. Repeat imaging (TEE or computed tomography) is generally pursued after at least 3 to 6 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation to assess for resolution of intracardiac thrombus before reconsidering cardioversion.

### Apixaban compared to heparin / vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: the EMANATE trial [^117Mened]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Local investigators determined the timing and type of cardioversion (pharmacological, electrical, or both). Patients could be randomized and cardioverted on the same day. Cardioversion could be performed up to a maximum of 90 days after randomization (Figure 1). All cardioverted patients continued anticoagulation and were to be followed for 30 ± 7 days to complete the study. Follow-up for those not cardioverted was completed at 90 ± 7 days (Figure 1). At the end of the study, or upon early withdrawal, the patient's subsequent management and treatment was the decision of the treating physician. Transition procedures followed the apixaban label.

Patients could withdraw from the study at any time of their own volition, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioural reasons, or due to the inability of the patient to comply with the required schedule of visits or procedures. Patients had the right to withdraw and refuse further contact, but every effort was made to ensure follow-up for outcomes relevant to the study objectives.

Imaging

Transoesophageal echocardiographic or CT imaging was performed at the direction of the investigator and interpreted locally. When left atrial thrombus was identified, investigators were instructed to defer cardioversion, continue the randomized anticoagulant, and repeat imaging after ∼3 weeks before proceeding to cardioversion.

Management of bleeding

In the event of clinically significant bleeding, anticoagulation was interrupted and managed according to local practice with surgical haemostasis, volume repletion, and transfusion of blood products and for patients in the heparin/VKA arm, administration of protamine, supplemental vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation [^112Rt6WG]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

For more than 50 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the standard of care for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the numerous limitations of VKAs have led to the development of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs). There are 4 NOACs currently approved for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. This article provides an overview of AF, summarizes basic properties of NOACs, and reviews the landmark trials. Current data on use of NOACs in special populations and specific clinical scenarios are also presented. Lastly, recommendations from experts on controversial topics of bleeding management and reversal are described.

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (> 48 h or unknown duration) — elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion: we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation (adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist [VKA] therapy, target INR range 2.0–3.0, low-molecular-weight heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion, rather than no anticoagulation (Grade 1B). We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B), and decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants after cardioversion for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^113UjXPs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are proven alternatives to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, there are few data on the efficacy and safety of NOAC therapy after cardioversion, where the risk of thromboembolic events is heightened.

Methods

We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of patients who underwent both electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion for atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, and X-VeRT trials. We assessed Mantel-Haenszel pooled estimates of risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding at ≤ 42 days of follow-up.

Results

The analysis pooled 3949 patients in whom a total of 4900 cardioversions for atrial fibrillation were performed. Compared with VKAs, NOAC therapy was associated with a similar risk of stroke/systemic embolism (RR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.34–2.04) and major bleeding (RR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.52–2.42); no significant statistical heterogeneity was found among studies (Cochrane Q P = 0.59, I(2) = 0% for stroke/systemic embolism; p = 0.47; I(2) = 0% for major bleeding).

Conclusions

The short-term incidences of thromboembolic and major hemorrhagic events after cardioversion on NOACs were low and comparable to those observed on dose-adjusted VKA therapy. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are a reasonable alternative to VKAs in patients undergoing cardioversion.

Cardioversion in AF — therapeutic anticoagulation "(eg, with adjusted-dose oral VKAs; INR 2.0–3.0) conventionally is recommended for a minimum of 3 weeks before, during, and for a minimum of 4 weeks after the procedure". For documented short-duration AF "(eg, ≤ 48 h), a common practice is to cardiovert without prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation", whereas for AF " > 48 h or unknown duration, a TEE-guided approach is an alternative strategy that can simplify anticoagulation management before cardioversion".

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: does low time in therapeutic range affect persistence? [^1178vEJQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

NVAF patients who switched to DOACs from VKAs due to a low TTR were at higher risk of being non‐persistent to DOACs compared to those switchers with a high TTR. Our results suggest that considerations about switching patients with a low TTR on VKA therapy to DOACs must be made carefully and that for some patients more extensive guidance while using DOACs could be beneficial.

Atrial fibrillation — elective cardioversion with documented duration of 48 h or less: For patients with AF of documented duration of 48 h or less undergoing elective cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 1B).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111tGoXH]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale — early experience and trial data support timing and modality: "This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE… study of patients with > 2 days' duration of AF". "Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs", and "Cardiac computed tomography… has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus". Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued "for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion", with risks driven by "elevated thromboembolic risks… high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days". Risks are "elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion", with recovery of atrial systole "over the ensuing 1 month".

### Apixaban compared to heparin / vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: the EMANATE trial [^111rfHqX]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Managing patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) involves controlling rate, finding reversible causes, preventing stroke, and often restoring sinus rhythm by electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. The risk of periprocedural thromboembolism in patients undergoing cardioversion may exceed 5% when anticoagulation is inadequate. Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for at least 3 weeks prior to cardioversion, during the procedure, and for a minimum of 4 weeks afterwards to allow restoration of atrial mechanical function reduces the risk to less than 1%. In post hoc analyses of cardioversions in the trials that led to regulatory approval of the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, event rates were low. A limitation of translating these data to clinical practice was the prolonged period of anticoagulation preceding cardioversion.

To accelerate cardioversion in clinical practice, a strategy of imaging by computerized tomography (CT) or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may be used to exclude left atrial thrombus. Randomized open-label trials comparing rivaroxaban and edoxaban to heparin/VKA in patients undergoing elective cardioversion found stroke and major bleeding rates at or below 1% in patients randomized to the factor Xa inhibitors. Apixaban, an orally active, reversible, direct inhibitor of factor Xa, reduced stroke and systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding, and death in patients with AF compared to warfarin in a large randomized double-blind trial, but has not been evaluated prospectively in patients undergoing cardioversion.

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (documented duration 48 h or less) — elective cardioversion: we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Safety of switching from a vitamin K antagonist to a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant in frail older patients with atrial fibrillation: results of the FRAIL-AF randomized controlled trial [^1179VocP]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is ambiguity whether frail patients with atrial fibrillation managed with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be switched to a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC).

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled superiority trial. Older patients with atrial fibrillation living with frailty (≥ 75 years of age plus a Groningen Frailty Indicator score ≥ 3) were randomly assigned to switch from international normalized ratio-guided VKA treatment to an NOAC or to continued VKA treatment. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 or with valvular atrial fibrillation were excluded. Follow-up was 12 months. The cause-specific hazard ratio was calculated for occurrence of the primary outcome that was a major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding complication, whichever came first, accounting for death as a competing risk. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic events.

Results

Between January 2018 and June 2022, a total of 2621 patients were screened for eligibility and 1330 patients were randomly assigned (mean age 83 years, median Groningen Frailty Indicator score 4). After randomization, 6 patients in the switch-to-NOAC arm and 1 patient in the continue-with-VKA arm were excluded due to the presence of exclusion criteria, leaving 662 patients switched from a VKA to an NOAC and 661 patients continued VKAs in the intention-to-treat population. After 163 primary outcome events (101 in the switch arm, 62 in the continue arm), the trial was stopped for futility according to a prespecified futility analysis. The hazard ratio for our primary outcome was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.23–2.32). The hazard ratio for thromboembolic events was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.60–2.61).

Conclusions

Switching international normalized ratio-guided VKA treatment to an NOAC in frail older patients with atrial fibrillation was associated with more bleeding complications compared with continuing VKA treatment, without an associated reduction in thromboembolic complications.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^117HLHLm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications

When used as pretreatment for a minimum of 3 weeks before cardioversion — the conventional or delayed cardioversion strategy — DTI and FXa inhibitors are noninferior VKA therapy in NAVF. When initiated acutely among anticoagulation‐naïve patients (with or without TEE depending on duration of AF), pharmacologic data and some outcome data provide guidance for safe use. Dabigatran, which displays the greatest accumulation over time and has the least amount of data to support an early cardioversion strategy, should be administered for at least 48 to 72 hours, achieving steady‐state concentrations before cardioversion. Rivaroxaban, which displays little to no accumulation over time and has the widest breadth of data to support an early cardioversion strategy, can have cardioversion performed at least 4 hours after the initial dose. Apixaban, which displays modest accumulation over time that appears to be overcome by giving a loading dose, has the most recent data and largest cohort to support an early cardioversion strategy. Apixaban should be administered for at least 48 to 72 hours, achieving steady‐state concentrations if the standard dose is utilized before cardioversion or if cardioversion is performed at least 2 hours after a loading dose (10 or 5 mg for those meeting standard requirements for dose adjustment). Finally, edoxaban, which displays little to no accumulation over time and has the largest, randomized, prospective trial to date, can have cardioversion performed at least 2 hours after the initial dose.

Atrial fibrillation — elective cardioversion with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration: For patients with AF of greater than 48 h or unknown duration undergoing elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation (adjusted-dose VKA therapy, target INR range 2.0–3.0, low-molecular-weight heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion rather than no anticoagulation (Grade 1B). We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B). Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Practical considerations for using novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116Vbbk6]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, represent new options for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, as shown by the results from large, randomized phase III trials. Because of their greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, the novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) address several limitations of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists in day-to-day clinical practice. However, a range of practical questions relating to the novel oral anticoagulants has emerged, including topics such as patient selection, treatment of patients with renal impairment, risk of myocardial infarction, drug interactions, switching between anticoagulants, and management of bleeding, in addition to use of these agents in patients requiring antiplatelet drug treatment or undergoing cardioversion or percutaneous interventions (eg, ablation). In this review, practical aspects of the use of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation are discussed, with reference to available data and guidance from prescribing information.

Outcome Data

Dabigatran

The only randomized prospective trial evaluating cardioversion in patients treated with dabigatran is a post hoc analysis of the RE‐LY (Randomized evaluation of long‐term anticoagulant therapy: dabigatran vs. warfarin) trial, which evaluated 1270 patients (7% of the 18 113 patients enrolled) allocated to dabigatran versus warfarin for NVAF and found no difference in 30‐day outcomes. 39 For dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, 150 mg twice daily, and dose‐adjusted warfarin, SSE were 0.8%, 0.3%, and 0.6%, respectively; dabigatran 110 mg versus warfarin, P = 0.71; dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin, P = 0.40. Major bleeding occurred in 1.7%, 0.6%, and 0.6%, respectively; dabigatran 110 mg versus warfarin, P = 0.06; dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin, P = 0.99. Most patients were anticoagulated for 3 weeks before cardioversion, with ≈7% anticoagulated < 3 weeks. No data were provided on outcomes pertaining to time from anticoagulation to cardioversion (Table 3).

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation: an updated meta-analysis [^115dzTYB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are now proven alternatives to vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. However, there are few data on the efficacy and safety of their use for cardioversion, in which the risk of thromboembolic events is heightened.

Methods

We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of patients undergoing both electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion for atrial fibrillation in the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, X-VeRT, and ENSURE-AF trials. We assessed Mantel-Haenszel pooled estimates of risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding at ≤ 42 days of follow-up.

Results

The analysis pooled 6148 patients in whom 6854 cardioversions for atrial fibrillation were performed. Compared with vitamin K antagonists, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy was associated with a similar risk of stroke/systemic embolism (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.38–1.75) and major bleeding (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51–1.87). We found no significant statistical heterogeneity among studies (Cochrane Q P = 0.75, I² = 0% for stroke/systemic embolism; p = 0.54; I² = 0% for major bleeding).

Conclusions

The short-term incidence of thromboembolism and major bleeding after cardioversion on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants was comparable to the incidence observed on dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist therapy. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are a reasonable alternative to vitamin K antagonists in patients undergoing cardioversion.

Current Guideline Recommendations

Current AF guidelines all recommend 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation with oral anticoagulation therapy (VKA, DTI, or FXa inhibitors) before cardioversion. 5, 20, 24, 25, 26 When early cardioversion is required, all guidelines recommend TEE to exclude the presence of left atrial thrombus. However, when addressing how soon after initiation of anticoagulation cardioversion is safe, ambiguity emerges among the guidelines. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS), and CHEST guidelines recommend attainment of "therapeutic" parenteral anticoagulation before cardioversion. 5, 20 The CHEST guidelines suggest that oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors may be suitable for cardioversion with no recommendation on timing of doses precardioversion other than to state that dabigatran achieves steady state in 2 to 3 days. 5 It is important to note that only dabigatran and rivaroxaban were FDA‐approved therapies at the time the CHEST guidelines were constructed and these agents were not well studied in the setting of cardioversion. The European Heart Rhythm Association guideline states "anticoagulation with heparin or oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitors should be initiated as soon as possible" without giving a minimum time frame before cardioversion. 24 Similarly, the AHA Scientific Statement on Management of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors in the Acute Care and Periprocedural Setting do not provide a minimum time frame or number of doses of anticoagulant before cardioversion. 27 Finally, the European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors and Canadian guidelines both recommend a single dose of either a parenteral anticoagulant or oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitor anticoagulant before cardioversion. 25, 26 The European Heart Rhythm Association recommends the oral DTI/oral FXa inhibitor anticoagulant be administered at least 4 hours before cardioversion, whereas the Canadian guidelines do not specify timeline between administration and cardioversion (Table 1).

### Rivaroxaban vs. vitamin K antagonists for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation [^1138KnHA]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

X-VeRT is the first prospective randomized trial of a novel oral anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective cardioversion.

Methods and Results

We assigned 1504 patients to rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily, 15 mg if creatinine clearance was between 30 and 49 mL/min) or dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in a 2:1 ratio. Investigators selected either an early (target period of 1–5 days after randomization) or delayed (3–8 weeks) cardioversion strategy. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, peripheral embolism, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 5 (two strokes) of 978 patients (0.51%) in the rivaroxaban group and in 5 (two strokes) of 492 patients (1.02%) in the VKA group [risk ratio 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15–1.73]. In the rivaroxaban group, four patients experienced primary efficacy events following early cardioversion (0.71%) and one following delayed cardioversion (0.24%). In the VKA group, three patients had primary efficacy events following early cardioversion (1.08%) and two following delayed cardioversion (0.93%). Rivaroxaban was associated with a significantly shorter time to cardioversion compared with VKAs (P < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred in six patients (0.6%) in the rivaroxaban group and four patients (0.8%) in the VKA group (risk ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.21–2.67).

Conclusion

Oral rivaroxaban appears to be an effective and safe alternative to VKAs and may allow prompt cardioversion.

### Rationale and design of the eXplore the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral riVaroxaban for the prEvention of caRdiovascular events in patients with nonvalvular aTrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion trial: a comparison of oral rivaroxaban once daily with dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation undergoing elective cardioversion [^115ZdsBA]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulation before, during, and after cardioversion is effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Objective

The objective of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (15 mg if creatinine clearance is 30–49 mL/min) compared with dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; international normalized ratio 2.0–3.0) in patients scheduled for elective cardioversion.

Methods

This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel group comparison of approximately 1,500 patients from 17 countries with hemodynamically stable nonvalvular atrial fibrillation of > 48 hours or unknown duration. Patients will be randomized 2:1 (rivaroxaban:VKA) using 2 cardioversion strategies: the first approach is early cardioversion with the precardioversion anticoagulation goal of 1 to 5 days using rivaroxaban or usual therapy (heparin + VKA). In these patients, transesophageal echocardiography will be encouraged to exclude atrial thrombi. The alternative approach is delayed cardioversion. Rivaroxaban or VKA will be administered for 21 to 56 days before cardioversion. All patients will receive study treatment for 6 weeks postcardioversion. The primary efficacy end point is a composite of all strokes, transient ischemic attacks, noncentral nervous system systemic emboli, myocardial infarctions, and cardiovascular deaths. Each primary end point component will be evaluated separately, and additional composites will be investigated. The principal safety end point is major bleeding.

Clinical Context

This will be the first prospective study of a novel oral anticoagulant in the setting of cardioversion. It will provide important information regarding the use of rivaroxaban in the periods preceding and after cardioversion in a broad patient population.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in cardioversion: a review of current evidence [^112gh2Lh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are recommended for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban represent possible alternatives to warfarin in the setting of cardioversion. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOAC use pericardioversion.

Data Sources

A PubMed and MEDLINE search through August 2017 was conducted using the following search terms alone or in various combinations: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, DOAC, NOAC, TSOAC, cardioversion.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, human studies comparing the safety and efficacy of DOACs with that of other anticoagulants in the setting of cardioversion were eligible for inclusion. References from published articles were reviewed for additional relevant citations for study inclusion. Four retrospective and 2 prospective trials comparing DOACs with warfarin were identified.

Data Synthesis

The majority of studies included patients undergoing electric cardioversion. Based on current evidence, the DOACs perform similarly to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, and bleeding rates are comparable.

Conclusions

DOACs may be an attractive alternative to warfarin because of fast onset of action, potentially reducing delay to cardioversion. More robust studies are needed in patients with renal dysfunction and patients undergoing pharmacological cardioversion.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^112Ts2sA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardioversion, whether pharmacological or electrical, is associated with a risk of thromboembolic events on the order of 5% to 7% within 30 days in nonanticoagulated patients. 1, 2 The risk of thromboembolism is at its highest within the first 7 days after cardioversion (> 80% of events), with the greatest risk within the first 2 days (≈70% of events). 3 Thus, the incidence of thromboembolic events within the first week is analogous to the yearly incidence in moderate‐risk nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients who have not undergone cardioversion. This risk can be mitigated to < 1% within 30 days with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation before, during, and after cardioversion. 3 Thromboembolic risk is not negated by a low CHADS 2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack), or CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc (adding vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) score or by a negative transthoracic esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) because of thrombus formation after cardioversion because of left atrial stunning. 3, 4 The single biggest risk factor for thrombus formation is inadequate anticoagulation. 4

The conventional approach is to anticoagulate, most commonly with an oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA), for a minimum of 3 weeks before, during, and for a minimum of 4 weeks postcardioversion. The recommendation to anticoagulate for 3 weeks before cardioversion is based on pathophysiologic and observational data, but has not been confirmed by randomized controlled trials. 5, 6 In addition, the retrospective analysis by Gallagher et al demonstrated that thromboembolic events were significantly more common at international normalized ratio (INR) 1.5 to 2.4 versus ≥ 2.5 (0.93% versus 0%, P = 0.012), reinforcing the importance of establishing therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion. 7 Prior studies evaluating parenteral anticoagulation as a means to expedite time to cardioversion over conventional oral VKA therapy have all ensured "therapeutic anticoagulation" at the time of cardioversion. These studies have shown noninferiority between parenteral anticoagulation and conventional therapy, with cardioversion time ranging from 1 to 3 days versus 21 to 30 days, respectively. 8, 9

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: does low time in therapeutic range affect persistence? [^1148WxhL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

To ensure a reliable calculation of the TTR, we only included patients with a history of VKA use for at least 6 months and with at least six INR measurements within 6 months before the index date. To ensure that the included patients had used VKA shortly before DOAC was initiated (i.e. the patient was a true switcher), patients without VKA treatment within 2 months before the index date were excluded from the study population. In addition, if the previous VKA treatment did not stop within 2 months after the index date (according to the recorded end date of VKA treatment), the patients were also excluded. Patients with a DOAC and VKA prescription on the same date were excluded from the study. Detailed selection of the study population is presented in Figure 1.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — preablation anticoagulation: For patients therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin or dabigatran, performance of the ablation procedure without interruption of warfarin or dabigatran is recommended, and for those on rivaroxaban, performance without interruption of rivaroxaban is recommended; for novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) other than dabigatran or rivaroxaban, performance without withholding a NOAC dose is reasonable. Anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF should be adhered to in patients who present for an AF catheter ablation procedure. For patients anticoagulated with a NOAC prior to AF catheter ablation, it is reasonable to hold one to two doses of the NOAC prior to AF ablation with reinstitution postablation. Performance of a TEE is reasonable in patients who are in AF on presentation and have been receiving anticoagulation therapeutically for 3 weeks or longer, and is also reasonable in those who present in sinus rhythm and have not been anticoagulated prior to catheter ablation.

### Changes in anticoagulation treatment and associated resolution or persistence of left atrial thrombus: insights from LATTEE registry [^115ehNQt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines highlight limited evidence on optimal anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFl) patients with left atrial thrombus (LAT). This study aimed to assess changes in anticoagulation and their association with LAT resolution in AF/AFl patients. Consecutive patients with AF/AFl undergoing transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before direct current cardioversion or ablation at 13 cardiology centres were included. Of 3109 patients enrolled, 8.0% (n = 250) had LAT on TEE, with 46% (n = 116) undergoing follow-up TEE, among whom LAT resolved in 55% (n = 64). No statistically significant predictors of LAT resolution were identified. Baseline characteristics were similar across anticoagulation groups, except for higher prevalence of heart failure in dabigatran users. Switching from vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) was associated with lower LAT prevalence (15%) compared to remaining on VKA (50%) or switching to low-molecular-weight heparin (75%, p = 0.022). All patients who continued apixaban had persistent LAT at follow-up, while none who switched from apixaban to another NOAC showed LAT (p = 0.033). Other switching strategies showed no statistically significant differences in LAT prevalence during follow-up. In conclusion, LAT resolved in over half of patients who underwent follow-up. LAT resolution may be associated with changes in anticoagulation, but confirmation in randomized trials is needed.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, pericardioversion, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to administer a 3-week uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or obtain imaging evaluation to exclude intracardiac thrombus before elective cardioversion in patients with AF duration of ≥ 48 hours.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Prevention of thromboembolism during cardioversion in atrial fibrillation — For atrial fibrillation (AF) of 48-h duration or longer or unknown duration, anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion. For AF of more than 48-h duration with hemodynamic instability requiring immediate cardioversion, heparin should be administered concurrently by an initial intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value; thereafter, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) should be provided for at least 4 wk, and limited data support subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in this indication. For AF of less than 48-h duration associated with hemodynamic instability, cardioversion should be performed immediately without delay for prior initiation of anticoagulation. During the first 48 h after onset of AF, the need for anticoagulation before and after cardioversion may be based on the patient's risk of thromboembolism. As an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to search for thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA); if no thrombus is identified, cardioversion is reasonable immediately after unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2 times the control value until a vitamin K antagonist achieves an INR equal to or greater than 2.0, followed by oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for at least 4 wk. For patients with thrombus identified by TEE, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is reasonable for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after restoration of sinus rhythm.

### Apixaban compared to heparin / vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: the EMANATE trial [^113DpSgx]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Results

The study was conducted between 14 July 2014 and 08 February 2017 at 134 centres in 12 countries. Enrolled patients were required to have ≤ 48 h of anticoagulation prior to randomization, and 930 (62%) had none. Atrial fibrillation was first detected within 3 months before entry in 1170 (78%; Table 1). Among 1500 randomized patients, 753 were assigned to apixaban and 747 to heparin/VKA (Table 1, Figure 2). Of these, 98% completed follow-up; one patient assigned to heparin/VKA was lost to follow-up 1 day after randomization. Among patients randomized to heparin/VKA the INR was ≥ 2.0 for 65% of the time beyond the first two weeks of treatment. In the apixaban group, 91% of patients had compliance estimated by pill count of > 80%.

Three patients died during the study. Twenty-eight patients withdrew and refused further follow-up. Among these, 9 were randomized (3 to apixaban vs. 6 to heparin/VKA), but not dosed or cardioverted, 16 (8 in each group) were followed for a mean of 31.7 days without undergoing cardioversion or developing outcome events, and 3 (2 randomized to apixaban and 1 to heparin/VKA) were actively cardioverted and followed for a mean of 9.7 days after cardioversion without outcome events.

Of all patients randomized, 300 converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously (Tables 1 and 2), and 925 were cardioverted electrically, including 4 who spontaneously cardioverted, then reverted to AF and underwent electrical cardioversion. Sixty-five patients were cardioverted pharmacologically and 52 both pharmacologically and electrically. One patient was actively cardioverted, reverted to AF, then spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm, and is not included among the 300 spontaneous initial cardioversions (see Table 1).

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^116KeCGu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The ENSURE‐AF (Edoxaban versus enoxaparin‐warfarin in patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation) trial published in October 2016 was the first multinational, randomized, open‐label, prospective trial of an oral FXa inhibitor versus conventional therapy of enoxaparin‐warfarin in patients who were undergoing electrical cardioversion. 47 The study population comprised patients with NVAF, the duration of which was no shorter than 48 hours and no longer than 12 months, in whom an electrical cardioversion was planned. A total of 2199 patients were enrolled, the largest published, prospective, randomized trial to date. Patients were stratified into 2 cardioversion approaches — a TEE‐guided stratum (1192 patients, 589 on edoxaban) and a non‐TEE‐guided stratum (1016 patients). Within each stratum patients were randomly assigned to either edoxaban 60 mg daily (30 mg for CrCl 15–50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concurrent use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors) or enoxaparin‐dose‐adjusted warfarin with warfarin dose adjusted to maintain an INR of 2 to 3. In the TEE‐guided stratum, a TEE and electrical cardioversion had to be performed within 3 days of randomization; patients with an INR < 2 were given a minimum of 1 dose of enoxaparin and warfarin before cardioversion and patients assigned to edoxaban were given a minimum of 1 dose at least 2 hours before cardioversion. In both groups, anticoagulation was continued for 28 days postcardioversion. Of note, 100% of patients in the early cardioversion group had TEE performed. In the non‐TEE‐guided stratum, patients were anticoagulated with warfarin (with the addition of enoxaparin for patients with an INR < 2 until INR was therapeutic) or edoxaban for a minimum of 21 days before electrical cardioversion. Median time to cardioversion was 2 days in the TEE stratum and 23 days in the non‐TEE stratum. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite end point of SSE, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and the primary safety outcome was the composite end point of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding — both assessed 30 days after cardioversion. The combined primary efficacy end point in the overall population (TEE guided and non‐TEE guided groups) was not different between the edoxaban group and the enoxaparin‐warfarin group (0.46% versus 1%, odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.12–1.43). The combined primary safety end point in the overall population was not different between the edoxaban group and the enoxaparin‐warfarin group (1.5% versus 1.02%, odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 0.64–3.55). End points were evenly distributed in the TEE‐guided stratum and non‐TEE‐guided stratum groups. Unlike trials of oral DTI and other oral FXa inhibitors, the ENSURE‐AF did not reduce time to cardioversion compared with warfarin. Similar to other prospective trials, the ENSURE‐AF was limited by an open‐label design (Table 3).

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^117Dn74B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Comparison With Prior Knowledge

Phase III NAVF trials comparing oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors to VKA therapy have consistently shown either superiority or noninferiority in reducing the risk of SSE with similar or reduced major bleeding. 16, 17, 18, 19 Post hoc analyses of these trials in cardioverted patients found no difference in efficacy or safety outcomes, but the number of patients evaluated was small (1.7–7% of the total trial populations). In addition, these studies were conducted primarily in patients on long‐term anticoagulation with limited data for patients on < 3 weeks' anticoagulation. 39, 40, 43, 46

Real‐world observation cohort studies of oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors were affected by similar shortcomings as the post hoc analyses — small sample populations and mainly an evaluation of chronic anticoagulation. These studies also introduced additional confounders in the form of varied patient populations, study design, comparator agents, and outcomes. However, similar SSE and/or major bleeding outcomes were seen in comparison to VKA therapy, and a faster time to cardioversion was also consistently noted.

Though the post hoc analyses and the observational cohort studies seemed to convey efficacy and safety of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors in cardioverted patients, it left many clinicians uncertain about the minimum number of doses required for effective anticoagulation — a concern well validated because inadequate anticoagulation has been reported as the single biggest risk factor for thromboembolism. 4

Table 4
Comparison of Conventional or Delayed Versus Early Cardioversion Trials

In the study by Enomoto et al, 91 Japanese subjects with NVAF > 48 hours were consecutively allocated to rivaroxaban at least 2 hours before cardioversion (group 1), or rivaroxaban 3 weeks before cardioversion (group 2). 42 Dose was determined by CrCl: 15 mg daily if CrCl > 50 mL/min; and 10 mg daily for CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min. No thromboembolic or major bleeding events were reported among the study groups at 30 days of follow‐up. Time to cardioversion was shorter for group 1 compared with group 2, 3.6 days versus 22.4 days, respectively (no statistical analysis provided). This trial was the smallest of the early cardioversion trials, enrolling a total of 91 patients. Other issues included the nonrandomized nature, use of non‐FDA‐approved doses, conducted outside of the United States, and the longest time to cardioversion in the early group at an average of 3.6 days, (Table 3).

Several retrospective cohort studies have evaluated rivaroxaban at FDA‐approved doses for cardioversion (Table S1). The majority of patients received anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion. 49, 51, 54, 57, 58 The requirements for anticoagulation before cardioversion ranged from at least 24 hours to 10 days in 3 studies 55, 59, 60 with no discussion of requirements in 2 studies. 56, 61 The studies comparing rivaroxaban and dabigatran to warfarin found similar SSE and/or major bleeding outcomes. 50, 54, 55 Rivaroxaban was compared with dabigatran and apixaban in 2 studies and indicated similar SSE outcome. 58, 60 Of note, 1 study had only 1 patient on apixaban, 58 and the other study included 159 patients on apixaban. 60 Two studies evaluated rivaroxaban without a comparator arm. 59, 61 The SEE outcome reported was similar to warfarin‐treated patients reported in the literature. 41 A 2015 case report investigated left atrial appendage that occurred after 6 weeks of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban. Of note, this patient was concurrently taking oxcarbazepine, which can decrease the effectiveness of rivaroxaban. 62

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

Table 3
Randomized Clinical Trials DOAC in Cardioversion

Several retrospective observational studies have been conducted with the majority of patients receiving at least 3 weeks anticoagulation (at FDA‐approved dosages) before cardioversion 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 (Table S1). One study required a minimum of 24 hours of anticoagulation before cardioversion 55 and 1 study did not comment on timeline between dose and cardioversion. 56 Three of the studies evaluated dabigatran and FXa inhibitors. 49, 54, 55 The majority of studies indicated similar SSE and/or major bleeding outcomes between dabigatran compared with warfarin 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 or rivaroxaban 49 in cardioverted patients. One study did not report on outcomes 48 and another only evaluated dabigatran without a comparator arm, though event rates were similar to those for warfarin‐treated patients documented in the literature. 6 Femia et al evaluated 284 patients: 109 patients anticoagulated with warfarin and 175 with dabigatran, apixaban, or rivaroxaban. 55 Of those in the oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitor groups, 54% underwent short‐duration anticoagulation, receiving cardioversion within 5 days of initiating anticoagulation (no further information reported on this subset of patients). At 8 weeks of follow‐up, the short‐duration anticoagulation group demonstrated similar rates of ischemic stroke (0% versus 1.3%, P = 0.46) and major bleeding (1.1% versus 2.5%, P = 0.59) end points compared with patients anticoagulated > 5 days before cardioversion (mean duration not reported). A consistent finding among the studies was a faster time to cardioversion (24%–48% reduction in the number of days) with dabigatran use versus warfarin. This is of clinical importance because shorter duration between the onset of AF and cardioversion is associated with improved success of cardioversion. 48

Dabigatran has not yet been evaluated in a randomized trial of early versus delayed time to cardioversion.

Atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability — urgent cardioversion anticoagulation: For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible (Grade 2C), but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy.

### Choosing a particular oral anticoagulant and dose for stroke prevention in individual patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: part 1 [^115BeCrr]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a high risk of stroke and mortality, which can be considerably reduced by oral anticoagulants (OAC). Recently, four non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were compared with warfarin in large randomized trials for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. Today's clinician is faced with the difficult task of selecting a suitable OAC for a patient with a particular clinical profile or a particular pattern of risk factors and concomitant diseases. We reviewed analyses of subgroups of patients from trials of vitamin K antagonists vs. NOACs for stroke prevention in AF with the aim to identify patient groups who might benefit from a particular OAC more than from another. In the first of a two-part review, we discuss the choice of NOAC for stroke prevention in the following subgroups of patients with AF: (i) stable coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, including percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting and triple therapy; (ii) cardioversion, ablation and anti-arrhythmic drug therapy; (iii) mechanical valves and rheumatic valve disease, (iv) patients with time in therapeutic range of > 70% on warfarin; (v) patients with a single stroke risk factor (CHA2DS2VASc score of 1 in males, 2 in females); and (vi) patients with a single first episode of paroxysmal AF. Although there are no major differences in terms of efficacy and safety between the NOACs for some clinical scenarios, in others we are able to suggest that particular drugs and/or doses be prioritized for anticoagulation.

### Comparison of anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation-novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists [^111dpnoT]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), oral anticoagulation is important for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SE). While Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have historically been the standard of care, these medications are limited by numerous food and drug interactions with onerous requirements for frequent monitoring and dose adjustments. Over the past decade, several novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed to directly inhibit factor IIa/thrombin (dabigatran) or activated factor X (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban). These medications have been shown to be at least as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention in NVAF with more favorable safety profiles. However, their advantages are underscored by a lack of specific antidotes and assays quantifying their anticoagulant effects. This paper addresses the use of NOACs compared to VKAs in patients with NVAF, with a special focus on high-risk populations, including the elderly, those with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and previous stroke. The current literature surrounding special clinical scenarios including the treatment of bleeding, perioperative management, and the use of NOACs in cardioversion and catheter ablation will be also discussed.

### Updated European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin-K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary [^116boLpC]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In 2013, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published a Practical Guide on the use of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, European Heart Rhythm A. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P. EHRA practical guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary. Eur Heart J 2013;34:2094–2106). The document received widespread interest, not only from cardiologists but also from neurologists, geriatricians, and general practitioners, as became evident from the distribution of > 350 000 copies of its pocket version (the EHRA Key Message Booklet) world-wide. Since 2013, numerous new studies have appeared on different aspects of NOAC therapy in AF patients. Therefore, EHRA updated the Practical Guide, including new information but also providing balanced guiding in the many areas where prospective data are still lacking. The outline of the original guide that addressed 15 clinical scenarios has been preserved, but all chapters have been rewritten. Main changes in the Update comprise a discussion on the definition of 'non-valvular AF' and eligibility for NOAC therapy, inclusion of finalized information on the recently approved edoxaban, tailored dosing information dependent on concomitant drugs, and/or clinical characteristics, an expanded chapter on neurologic scenarios (ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage under NOAC), an updated anticoagulation card and more specifics on start-up and follow-up issues. There are also many new flow charts, like on appropriate switching between anticoagulants (VKA to NOAC or vice versa), default scenarios for acute management of coronary interventions, step-down schemes for long-term combined antiplatelet-anticoagulant management in coronary heart disease, management of bleeding, and cardioversion under NOAC therapy.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^113QHuBp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The use of rivaroxaban in cardioversion was further evaluated in the X‐VeRT (explore the efficacy and safety of once‐daily oral rivaroxaban for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion) trial. 41 In this randomized, prospective, open‐label trial, which is the first randomized trial utilizing any of the oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitors in patients undergoing cardioversion, 1504 subjects who had NVAF > 48 hours were assigned to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily (15 mg daily with CrCl 30–49 mL/min) or dose‐adjusted VKA with or without parenteral anticoagulation before cardioversion until INR goal (2–3) was achieved. Of note, 66.5% of the early cardioversion group received TEE before cardioversion. Parenteral anticoagulation was used for bridging while the INR was subtherapeutic. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral embolism, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Patients underwent either early (1–5 days, 58% of patients) or delayed cardioversion (3–8 weeks, 42% of patients). In the early group, the median time to cardioversion was 1 day (interquartile range 1–2 days). Rivaroxaban was initiated at least 4 hours before cardioversion. At 30‐day follow‐up, the primary efficacy end point occurred in 0.51% of subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 1.02% in the VKA group (risk ratio 0.50; 95% confidence interval 0.15–1.73). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 0.8% of patients in the VKA group (risk ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval 0.21–2.67). In the early cardioversion group, 4 patients experienced primary outcome in the rivaroxaban group (0.71%) versus 2 patients in the VKA group (1.08%). In the delayed cardioversion group, 1 primary outcome event occurred in the rivaroxaban group (0.24%) versus 2 events in the VKA group (0.93%). Time to cardioversion was shorter for the rivaroxaban group compared with the VKA group: 22 days versus 30 days, respectively, P < 0.001. Though no statistical differences were noted in outcomes, there were more thromboembolic events in early versus delayed rivaroxaban groups: 0.71% versus 0.24%, and a lower risk of bleeding: 0.52% versus 0.73% (possibly because of less time on anticoagulation) (Table 3). The small sample size (1504 patients) was underpowered to detect a statistical difference, a theme common among most of these trials, and should be considered with caution because the wide confidence intervals do not eliminate a risk for increased events. It has been estimated that > 40 000 patients would be required to achieve adequate power in detecting differences in thromboembolic events — a trial that is unlikely to be conducted. 41, 44 Regardless, both early and delayed strategies reported thromboembolic event rates (0.24%–1.08%) 41 similar to prior trials of conventional anticoagulation (0–1.88%) 39, 40, 43, 46 and an order of magnitude lower than historical trials without the use of anticoagulation (5%–7%) (Table 4). 1, 2

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^113D8utH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors in patients requiring cardioversion. Oral DTI and FXa inhibitors offer potential advantages over traditional VKA and parenteral heparins. With standard dosing, it is reasonable to give dabigatran and apixaban for at least 48 to 72 hours before cardioversion, edoxaban at least 2 hours before cardioversion, and rivaroxaban at least 4 hours before cardioversion. With a loading dose, apixaban may be administered at least 2 hours before cardioversion.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^111iewh1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long-standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist. DOACs are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, DOACs have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role of DOACs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview of DOACs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimize DOAC use among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

### The periprocedural management of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: rationale and a summary of the available evidence from phase 3 clinical trials [^115poxqg]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have rapidly emerged as an alternative therapy to warfarin. Several recent phase 3 randomized control trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the NOACs in the treatment for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As the NOACs are incorporated in clinical practice, questions have begun to arise concerning their optimal use in commonly encountered situations. In this review, we provide a summary of the available evidence from the phase 3 randomized control trials specifically with regard to 1 such scenario, the periprocedural management of NOACs, with a goal of providing guidance for practicing clinicians.

### Management of intraprocedural anticoagulation in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: understanding the gaps in evidence [^114oatBy]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Catheter ablation has gained a prominent role in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), with recent data providing positive evidence on hard outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality. Ablation, however, exposes the patient to a rather unique situation, combining risks for both major bleeding and thromboembolic events. In this setting, the critical importance of rigorous anticoagulation during the procedure has been underlined, and the latest international guidelines now recommend performing AF catheter ablation with uninterrupted non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and concomitant administration of unfractionated heparin adjusted to achieve and maintain a target activated clotting time of ≥ 300 seconds. Whereas observational studies and randomized controlled trials support the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted NOAC strategy for AF catheter ablation, recent experiences have questioned this point, showing a greater unfractionated heparin requirement in NOAC-treated patients compared with vitamin K antagonists-treated patients to achieve the target activated clotting time. Important gaps in evidence regarding optimal intraprocedural anticoagulation management need to be acknowledged. A thorough appreciation of the physiology of anticoagulation during AF catheter ablation and the relevant differences between vitamin K antagonists and NOACs is required, while also understanding the limitations of activated clotting time measurement with regard to accurate intraprocedural anticogulation monitoring. This review aims to provide a critical look at this relatively ignored aspect of AF catheter ablation, especially pitfalls in NOAC monitoring, and to identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in the near future.

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: does low time in therapeutic range affect persistence? [^113zMK83]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients are advised to switch from a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) when time in therapeutic range (TTR) is low.

Objective

To examine if pre-switch TTR determines persistence patterns in NVAF patients who are switched from a VKA to DOAC.

Patients/Methods

Adult NVAF patients from three Dutch anticoagulation clinics who were newly switched from a VKA to DOAC between July 1, 2013 and September 30, 2018 were stratified by pre-switch TTR levels. DOAC prescription records were examined to determine persistence patterns according to a 100-day prescription gap. Cumulative incidences of non-persistence to DOAC were estimated using the cumulative incidence competing risk method. The association of pre-switch TTR levels with DOAC non-persistence was evaluated by Cox regression models.

Results

A total of 3696 NVAF patients were included, of whom 690 (18.7%) had a pre-switch TTR ≤ 45%. After switching from VKA to DOAC, 14.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.3–17.0%) of the patients with a pre-switch TTR ≤ 45% became non-persistent to DOAC within 1 year, while 9.8% (95% CI 8.7–11.0%) did in those with a pre-switch TTR > 45%. In a multivariable model, a pre-switch TTR ≤ 45% was associated with a higher risk of non-persistence to DOAC (adjusted hazard ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.22–1.97). Results were similar when using other cut-off points (60% or 70%) to define a low TTR.

Conclusion

NVAF patients switching from VKA to DOAC due to a low pre-switch TTR saw a worse persistence pattern to DOAC after the switch compared to patients with a high pre-switch TTR.

### Early risk of stroke in patients undergoing acute versus elective cardioversion for atrial fibrillation [^113pbLAm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Many patients with AF experience disabling symptoms and AF is associated with significant health care consumption including frequent emergency department (ED) visits. Rhythm control therapies like antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation are associated with substantial recurrence rates and not suitable in all patients. Therefore, cardioversion remains an essential tool to restore sinus rhythm in routine AF management.

Electrical cardioversion (ECV) is known to be more effective than medical cardioversion for symptomatic AF. Irrespective of the mode, cardioversion is complicated by thromboembolic complications. Thromboembolic risk can be reduced by adequate anticoagulation treatmentor transesophageal ultrasound guided exclusion of left atrial thrombus transesophageal echocardiogram before conversion and by continued anticoagulation 4 weeks afterwards. Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have replaced warfarin to a large extent in clinical practice.NOACs have a rapid onset of anticoagulation effect, fewer drug and food interactionsand facilitate shorter waiting times to cardioversion than warfarin.

In some situations, an emergency cardioversion must be performed in patients with AF who are hemodynamically unstable regardless of prior oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment. However, in the past decade there has been a shift in the European guidelines on acute ECV for hemodynamically stable AF. In 2010, acute ECV for rhythm control was indicated without prior OAC even in the presence of risk factors for stroke if the onset was < 48 hours or after a transesophageal echocardiography without a sign of thrombus in the patient with an onset of ≥ 48 hours. According to the more cautious current European Society of Cardiology guidelines, acute ECV can be considered in patients without prior OAC treatment in AF if the onset was < 12 hours and the patient has no history of thromboembolism or within 48 hours if the patient has a low risk for stroke according to CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc (≤ 1 for men and ≤ 2 for women).

Interestingly, the risk of thromboembolic complications associated with acute versus elective conversion of AF has not been studied in greater detail and current data to inform decisions on acute or elective cardioversion from the NOAC era is lacking. We sought to investigate the incidence of ischemic or unspecified stroke and to compare the risk of stroke during the first 30 days in patients who underwent acute ECV compared with elective ECV.

### New avenues for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^112iAzci]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were, until recently, the only option for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Three new oral anticoagulants have been tested for this indication in recent randomized trials: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. They offer the promise of consistent effect without the need for monitoring drug levels. Overall, efficacy and safety appear to be noninferior, and in some instances superior, to warfarin. However, the new drugs have their downsides, and switching from warfarin is not recommended for all patients. This review focuses on the available evidence and attempts to provide guidance to clinicians in the field.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^1116RaR2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Summary of Findings

Limited and heterogeneous data exist evaluating the optimal timing of oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors pre‐cardioversion. In the absence of high‐quality data, a critical appraisal of the pharmacological properties of a medication can lend important clinical insight. It is commonly accepted that at least 5 half‐lives of a medication are required to obtain steady full‐state plasma concentrations. However, certain pharmacokinetic properties (ie, more complete absorption, faster time to onset, etc), as well as dosing schemes (ie, loading doses) can decrease the time needed for achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation. The oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors have similar yet subtle differences in how quickly they reach maximal concentrations postdose (1–4 hours), half‐lives (5–17 hours), time to steady state (48–72 hours), and accumulation over time. Based on pharmacokinetic (Cmax, AUC) and pharmacodynamic properties (aPTT, PT, INR, etc) it appears that dabigatran displays the greatest degree of time‐dependent accumulation, followed by apixaban and no suggestion of accumulation with rivaroxaban and edoxaban.

Recently, a growing number of prospective, randomized trials have expanded our knowledge on this clinical quandary among AF patients undergoing cardioversion. The results from these trials advocate for the application of early cardioversion with the initiation of oral FXa inhibitors (from single‐dose 2–4 hours precardioversion to multidose 48–72 hours of therapy precardioversion) compared with delayed cardioversion (at least 3 weeks of anticoagulation therapy precardioversion) without a difference in efficacy or safety outcomes. No trials have prospectively evaluated dabigatran in this regard. Within the early cardioversion treatment regimen, the minimum number of doses with oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitors before cardioversion remains unanswered. The concept of early cardioversion is of significant interest to optimize maintenance of sinus rhythm, and to reduce hospitalization rates and costs.

In a post hoc analysis of the ROCKET‐AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, 364 out of the 14 264 patients enrolled in the main trial underwent cardioversion or ablation without a difference in the incidence of SSE at a mean follow‐up of 2.1 years (1.88% in rivaroxaban versus 1.86% in the warfarin arm). 40 Rivaroxaban was dosed at 20 or 15 mg daily in those with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30 to 49 mL/min versus dose‐adjusted warfarin. The incidence of major bleeding or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding was also similar between the 2 groups (18.75% in rivaroxaban versus 13.04% in the warfarin group), though no statistical analysis was performed given the small number of events. This study investigated outcomes in subjects who went through cardioversion (n = 285) and ablation (n = 79). Time from first anticoagulation dose to cardioversion was not reported (Table 3).

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided cardioversion process — A TEE-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion is an alternative to the conventional approach of using a minimum of 3 weeks therapeutic precardioversion anticoagulation. Under a TEE-guided strategy, patients receive anticoagulation and once therapeutic, undergo screening TEE; if thrombus is seen in either atrial appendage or atrium at the time of TEE, cardioversion is postponed, and if no thrombus is seen, the patient proceeds immediately to cardioversion; a TEE-guided strategy requires an experienced echocardiographer because accurate visualization of thrombus may be operator dependent.

### Uninterrupted anticoagulation with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation catheter ablation: lessons learned from randomized trials [^111EEAGL]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation has been established as a rhythm control strategy in selected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have failed or wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drugs. Uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) peri-ablation is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications as compared to interrupted oral anticoagulation and bridging heparin. However, a substantial portion of patients with AF are treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Herein, we perform an in-depth review and comparison of three recent randomized trials of uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with NOACs vs VKAs in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation. Furthermore, we report pooled results of these randomized trials. The pooled incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower with NOACs as compared to VKAs (2% vs 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.16–0.99). Similarly, cardiac tamponade was also reduced in the NOAC group (0.4% vs 1.5%; OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07–0.97). Thromboembolic complications were not significantly different between groups. Overall, these findings support the 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement's class I recommendation for uninterrupted NOAC use in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation.

### Novel anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: a primer for the primary physician [^112FgEox]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. The prevalence increases with age. A devastating complication of atrial fibrillation is cardioembolic stroke with central nervous system sequelae. Based on stroke risk scores (CHADS and CHA2DS2VASc) and bleeding risk (HAS-BLED), the optimal use of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation is feasible. Warfarin is a proven medication for this specific indication but requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustments, and it has multiple food, drug, and disease-state interactions. In addition, management of anticoagulation during the perioperative period may be challenging. In this regard, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have shown promise in the shift toward the "ideal" anticoagulant therapy, in that fixed dosing is the norm, drug interactions are few, food interactions are absent, onset is fairly immediate and offset predictable, and, in the majority of patients, therapeutic monitoring is not required. This article provides a review of recent published trials of the use of NOACs in atrial fibrillation. Practical points on indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, interactions, and perioperative management tips are discussed with a view toward the safe and effective use of these new medications. When patients are transitioned between different anticoagulant medications, the risks of thrombosis and bleeding need to be considered. When switching from warfarin to a NOAC, the NOAC can be started once the international normalized ratio is ≤ 2.0.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion — effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

### Effectiveness and safety of vitamin K antagonists and new anticoagulants in the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation in older adults-a systematic review of reviews and the development of recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescribing [^111fsEjb]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Recommendations

For older patients with AF, we found a considerable advantage for NOACs compared to VKAs regarding haemorrhagic strokes/intracranial haemorrhages and a small benefit regarding mortality. From these results we were able to develop a weak recommendation to switch from a VKA to a NOAC in older patients with atrial fibrillation (see Additional file 7: Table S7). We restricted the recommendation to patients with a low time in therapeutic range (TTR) below 55% because this was the lower limit of TTR in the approval studies of NOACs and it remains unclear to what extent the advantages apply to patients with high time in therapeutic range. The quality of evidence for this recommendation is moderate. The quality of the evidence was downgraded because of indirectness of the results as there is no trial that evaluated the effect of switching from vitamin K antagonists to a novel oral anticoagulant. We considered three guidelines as additional articles of interest. They recommend a conventional VKA for patients with severe renal impairment and therefore we excluded patients with severe renal impairment from our recommendation.

The recommendation was developed according to our methods for the compilation of SRs. Meetings with the team of researchers were held to discuss and agree on the recommendation reflecting the strength and quality of evidence according to the results of our SR. The recommendation was subsequently reviewed and confirmed by the Evidence based Medicine Guidelines Editorial board of Duodecim Medical Publication Ltd. (Finland) and will be implemented in the electronic decision support tool PRIMA-eDS.

### Switching from vitamin K antagonists to direct oral anticoagulants in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: does low time in therapeutic range affect persistence? [^112hgTew]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), which is associated with a 5‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke, is a prevalent burden of disease worldwide. To prevent ischemic stroke, the use of a long‐term oral anticoagulant (OAC) is recommended for patients with a high ischemic stroke risk. For many years, a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was the main oral therapeutic option for long‐term anticoagulant treatment. Patients using VKAs require regular laboratory monitoring and subsequent dose adjustments based on the international normalized ratio (INR), due to a small therapeutic window and frequent interactions between VKAs and co‐medication or diet. The quality of VKA therapy can be evaluated by calculating the time in therapeutic range (TTR) using the Rosendaal method, of which a TTR > 70% is considered a good quality of VKA therapy. A low TTR is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the following interventions for patients with a low TTR are recommended: (a) more frequent INR monitoring and patient education or, (b) switching to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). From 2011 onward, DOACs were introduced for NVAF and were found non‐inferior to VKAs in several large randomized clinical trials. As opposed to VKAs, DOACs do not require frequent laboratory monitoring. The lack of monitoring, however, may contribute to suboptimal treatment persistence to DOACs, which was identified by several observational studies.,

Although NVAF patients who receive VKAs but with a low TTR are suggested to switch to a DOAC, it is unknown whether the switch improves the persistence to oral anticoagulation. This question is relevant because non‐persistence to OAC was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in DOAC users. For this reason, we conducted a cohort study that included NVAF patients from three Dutch anticoagulation clinics who were newly switched from a VKA to a DOAC between 2013 and 2018, and examined persistence patterns to the DOAC between those with a low and a high pre‐switch TTR level.

Apixaban

Evidence of chronic apixaban use before cardioversion is limited to a post hoc analysis of the major atrial fibrillation trial (ARISTOTLE [Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation]) which studied apixaban 5 mg twice daily (unless ≥ 2 of the following were met: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) versus dose‐adjusted warfarin in patients with NVAF. 43 Out of a total of 18 201 patients enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial, 743 cardioversions were performed in 540 patients. The minimum duration of therapy before cardioversion (percentages not available) was 4 days for warfarin and 1 day for apixaban. However, the vast majority of patients in the trial had been chronically anticoagulated with a mean time from study entry to first cardioversion of 243 ± 231 days for warfarin and 251 ± 248 days for the apixaban group. At 30 days postcardioversion, no SSE occurred in either treatment group, though the overall event rate in ARISTOTLE was low. Rates of other outcomes comparing warfarin versus apixaban were low and similar among groups: myocardial infarction (0.3% versus 0.35%), major bleeding (0.3% versus 0.35%), and death (0.3% versus 0.35%). No statistical analysis was performed given the small number of events (Table 3).

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^113y1CQm]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

Objective

To characterise the rate, causes and predictors of cessation of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

Patients and Methods

Consecutive patients with AF with a long-term anticoagulation indication treated with NOACs (dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban) in our centre from September 2010 through December 2016 were included. Prospectively collected data with baseline characteristics, causes of cessation, mean duration-to-cessation and predictors of cessation were analysed.

Results

The study comprised 1415 consecutive patients with AF, of whom 439 had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 1and were on a NOAC. Mean age was 71.9 ± 8.7 years and 37% were females. Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years (IQR = 2.7–5.3), 147 (33.5%) patients ceased their index-NOAC (113 switched to a different form of OAC), at a rate of 8.8 per 100 patient-years. Serious adverse events warranting NOAC cessation occurred in 28 patients (6.4%) at a rate of 1.6 events per 100 patient-years. The mean duration-to-cessation was 4.9 years (95% CI 4.6 to 5.1) and apixaban had the longest duration-to-cessation with (5.1, 95% CI 4.8 to 5.4) years, compared with dabigatran (4.6, 95% CI 4.2 to 4.9) and rivaroxaban (4.5, 95% CI 3.9 to 5.1), pairwise log-rank p = 0.002and 0.025, respectively. In multivariable analyses, age was an independent predictor of index-NOAC cessation (HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.05; p = 0.006). Female gender (HR 2.2, 95%CI 1.04 to 4.64; p = 0.04) independently predicted serious adverse events.

Conclusion

In this 'real world' cohort, NOAC use is safe and well-tolerated when prescribed in an integrated care clinic. Whether apixaban is better tolerated compared with other NOACs warrants further study.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^112wASgw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Though the benefits of oral VKAs have long been established in NVAF with respect to stroke reduction, VKAs have the disadvantages of required monitoring and follow‐up, complex drug and food interactions, a narrow therapeutic range, and slow onset of action. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Since 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) dabigatran (Pradaxa) and 3 oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and edoxaban (Savaysa) for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SSE) in patients with NVAF. 15 These agents have all shown either superiority or noninferiority to warfarin in reducing the risk of SSE in this patient population with similar or reduced major bleeding. 16, 17, 18, 19 In these clinical trials, all of these agents have shown a reduction in the risk of intracranial hemorrhage as compared with warfarin.

Oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors have the potential advantages of a rapid onset, fixed dosing, no required routine monitoring, and fewer drug/food interactions as compared with VKAs. Of particular interest is the rapid onset of action and the potential to avoid parenteral anticoagulation and the delay in action of VKAs, culminating in faster time to cardioversion, improved maintenance of sinus rhythm, and potentially reduced hospitalization days and health‐system costs. 20, 21, 22, 23 As such, these agents offer a potential alternative to conventional anticoagulation strategies for cardioversion. However, there is discordance between the major guidelines pertaining to how best to utilize these agents pericardioversion. 5, 20, 24, 25, 26

Given the lack of data, inconsistencies among the guidelines, and the expanding role of oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitor anticoagulants, we reviewed the literature evaluating dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in patients requiring cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF). Furthermore, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for each agent to determine the optimal timing of administration to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation and thus be safely eligible for early cardioversion.

Pharmacokinetic Properties

All 4 anticoagulants share similarities, yet subtle differences among their respective pharmacological properties can have important implications for dosing pericardioversion (Table 2).

Table 2
Clinical Comparison of FXa Inhibitors and DTI

Dabigatran

Dabigatran is the only FDA‐approved oral DTI currently in use. The time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax) postdose is 2 hours but can be prolonged until 4 hours if co‐administered with food. 28 On average, the half‐life is 12 to 17 hours but can be substantially prolonged (upwards of 27 hours) depending on the degree of renal impairment. 29, 30 Steady state is typically obtained in 2 to 3 days. 30 When evaluating accumulation over time (single dose versus multidose studies), both the peak concentrations (Cmax) and total concentrations (AUC) are increased. Day 7 compared with a single dose displays a 2‐ to 2.3‐fold higher Cmax and a 1.4‐ to 1.6‐fold higher AUC. 28, 29 No statistical analyses were provided for these comparisons.

Rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban was the first FDA‐approved oral FXa inhibitor. The Tmax is 2 to 4 hours after ingestion. The half‐life is 5 to 9 hours in younger patients and 11 to 13 hours in elderly patients (≥ 75 years), with attainment of steady‐state concentrations in ≈48 hours. 31, 32, 33 In single‐ versus multidose pharmacokinetic studies, rivaroxaban demonstrated no relevant time‐dependent accumulation in either AUC (0.85‐ to 1.13‐fold) or estimated Cmax (0.92‐ to 1.25‐fold) from day 1 to day 7. 33 No statistical analyses were provided for these comparisons.

Apixaban

Apixaban has a Tmax of 3 to 4 hours, a half‐life of ≈12 hours (range 8–15 hours), and a time to steady state of ≈48 to 72 hours. 34, 35 In single‐ versus multidose pharmacokinetic studies, apixaban demonstrated time‐dependent accumulation with both AUC and Cmax increasing by 1.3‐ to 1.8‐ and 1.3‐ to 1.5‐fold from day 1 to day 7, respectively. 35

Of note, the Cmax and AUC for 10 mg once daily on day 1 were both higher than the corresponding values for the 5 mg twice daily on day 1 and day 7. No statistical analyses were provided for these comparisons.

Edoxaban

In 2016, Plitt et al published a post hoc analysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) trial, looking specifically at differences in SSE events between edoxaban and warfarin in NVAF patients undergoing first electrical cardioversion. 46 There were a total of 632 electrical cardioversion attempts in 365 patients (1.7% of the 21 105 patients enrolled in the overall trial). Patients were chronically anticoagulated with a median time from randomized to first cardioversion of 348 days (interquartile range 86–526 days). In the 30 days postcardioversion, SSE occurred in 2 patients (1.81%) on the lower‐dose edoxaban (30 or 15 mg daily). No SEE occurred in patients on warfarin or higher‐dose edoxaban (60 or 30 mg daily — FDA‐approved dosing regimen for NVAF). Edoxaban dose was reduced by 50% (60 to 30 or 30 to 15 mg) if CrCl was 15 to 50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concurrent use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors. There were no major bleeding events in either group and there was 1 death (0.71%) in the 60‐mg edoxaban group. There were no significant differences in the primary efficacy and safety end points among the treatment groups (Table 3).

Edoxaban

In single‐ versus multidose pharmacodynamic studies, aPTT, PT, and anti‐Xa levels failed to reveal a time‐dependent accumulation. There was no statistically significant difference in maximal aPTT (0.96‐fold change), 1.27‐fold increases for maximal PT and 0.84‐ to 1.08‐fold change for maximal anti‐Xa levels (no statistics provided for the latter 2 values) between day 1 and 10 for single daily doses. 37 Similar to apixaban, anti‐Xa is considered a quantitative measure, but both aPTT and PT are unreliable markers for assessing edoxaban activity. 38

The concern with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies surrounds the testing of non‐FDA‐approved dosing regimens. When comparing these nonstandard doses, regimens displaying total daily doses similar to the FDA‐approved doses were selected (ie, dabigatran 100 mg three times daily, total daily dose of 300 mg daily, analogous to 150 mg twice daily). Also, the pharmacokinetic data utilized 24‐hour concentrations of BID dosing for apixaban but single‐dose values for dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. Thus we are left attempting to interpret imperfect comparisons.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism [^1121KkJJ]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with a risk of recurrence that depends on factors specific to index event and patient. A first unprovoked VTE increases the risk of a recurrent event, particularly during the first year after anticoagulation cessation. Determining a strategy for the long-term prevention of recurrent VTE poses challenges that stem from a lack of agreement on recommended therapy duration and varying treatment burden for the patient. Oral anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are the main treatment options for the long-term prevention of recurrent VTE. However, the risk of VTE recurrence must be balanced against the risk of bleeding in each patient. Phase III clinical trials have evaluated rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran for extended treatment and prevention of VTE versus placebo, and versus warfarin in the case of dabigatran. Compared with placebo treatment, each NOAC showed superior efficacy together with an acceptable safety profile during extended treatment periods of 6–18months. Patients receiving long-term NOAC therapy will still require regular risk factor assessment, but these agents may permit longer treatment duration with an improved benefit-risk profile.

Choice of anticoagulant

Oral anticoagulation to prevent strokes in patients with AF can be achieved with vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate or severe mitral stenosis should be treated with vitamin K antagonists. Considering their superior safety compared with warfarin (10% lower mortality, approximately 50% lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage or haemorrhagic stroke), patients who are eligible for therapy with the NOACs apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban (in alphabetical order) should preferentially be treated with a NOAC.

Thromboprophylaxis recommendations — adult congenital heart disease (CHD) with intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) or atrial fibrillation (AF): Class I — For adults with simple CHD and hemodynamically stable IART or AF of unknown or ≥ 48-hours' duration, therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for at least 3 weeks prior to cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiogram may be performed to rule out intracardiac thrombus (Level of evidence: B); adults with complex CHD and sustained or recurrent IART or AF should receive long-term oral anticoagulation for prevention of thromboembolic complications (Level of evidence: B). Class IIa — For adults with moderate or complex CHD and hemodynamically stable IART or AF, it is reasonable to pursue therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 weeks prior to cardioversion or perform transesophageal echocardiography to rule out thrombus, regardless of arrhythmia duration (Level of evidence: B); long-term oral anticoagulation therapy is reasonable in adults with CHD of moderate complexity and sustained or recurrent IART or AF (Level of evidence: C); vitamin K antagonists can reasonably be considered agent of choice in adults with moderate or complex CHD, pending safety and efficacy data on newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs; direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors) (Level of evidence: B). Class IIb — It may be reasonable for adults with IART or AF and simple nonvalvular CHD to receive either an oral anticoagulant, aspirin, or no therapy for prevention of thromboembolic complications based on established stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED) scores (Level of evidence: B); in adults with simple CHD and no prosthetic heart valve or hemodynamically significant valve disease, a NOAC may be a reasonable alternative to a vitamin K antagonist when anticoagulation is indicated (Level of evidence: C). Class III — Pending future studies, there are currently insufficient pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data to endorse use of NOACs in adults with Fontan surgery (Level of evidence: C); anticoagulation is not indicated for prevention of thromboembolic complications in adults with CHD and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or accessory pathway–mediated tachycardia (Level of evidence: C).

### Comparison of patient outcomes before and after switching from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant based on time in therapeutic range guideline recommendations [^117K3Hht]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, are recommended instead of warfarin in patients newly diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, it is less clear which established patients taking warfarin should switch to a DOAC. Medical societies have provided some guidance when considering switching to a DOAC based on time in therapeutic range (TTR): the European Society of Cardiology (TTR < 70%), the American College of Chest Physicians (TTR < 65%), and the American College of Cardiology (TTR < 58%). Our objective was to use the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative clinical registry to evaluate stroke and major bleeding rates before and after switching from warfarin to a DOAC in patients grouped by pre-switch TTR guideline thresholds.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) on oral anticoagulant (OAC) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — post-procedure OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor: In general, if the patient was on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) before PCI, the same DOAC would be continued afterwards with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor, and clopidogrel is generally preferred; if previously on a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), the VKA could be reinitiated post-PCI, although the preferred option in eligible patients would be to substitute a DOAC instead, with the type and dose based on clinical trial results; if a patient on a DOAC develops a specific allergy or significant renal dysfunction that precludes further DOAC use, this warrants transition to a VKA or switching to another DOAC.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — periprocedural anticoagulation evidence includes uninterrupted vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) strategies. An initial large study found uninterrupted VKA anticoagulation "did not result in a higher incidence of tamponade compared with interrupted VKA anticoagulation therapy with bridging heparin". Another study "compared the outcomes of 23 patients who developed pericardial tamponade with an INR < 2 to 17 patients on warfarin with an INR > 2" and reported "No difference was observed in the initial pericardial drainage, or the duration of drainage; no patients required surgery". A "more recent shift" is performing ablation on uninterrupted NOAC therapy; the RE-CIRCUIT trial "was a head-to-head comparison of performing AF ablation on uninterrupted dabigatran vs uninterrupted warfarin", and "randomized 704 patients across 104 sites to these two anticoagulation strategies".

### The duration of anticoagulation after electrical cardioversion… [^114N8Qhe]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend four weeks of anticoagulation after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. Berger and Schweitzer pooled the data from 32 studies to assess the timing of embolic complications following cardioversion and to examine whether four weeks of anticoagulation are warranted after electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Studies were included if they contained at least 10 patients who underwent electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter and if the interval between electrical cardioversion and the occurrence of embolic events was clearly stated. An embolic event occurred after cardioversion in 92 of the 4, 621 patients.

The underlying cardiovascular or systemic disorder that predisposed to atrial fibrillation or flutter included rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, alcohol abuse, aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse and thyrotoxicosis. Seventeen patients had no underlying heart disease and were classified as having lone atrial fibrillation. The embolic event occurred in three patients who had atrial fibrillation for no longer than two days before cardioversion. The interval between cardioversion and the thromboembolic event ranged from less than one day to 18 days.

Of the 92 events, 75 occurred within three days of cardioversion, 88 within one week and 90 within 10 days of cardioversion. In the two remaining patients, embolic episodes occurred on the 15th day and the 18th day after cardioversion. The authors conclude that since embolic episodes rarely occurred more than 10 days after electrical cardioversion, two weeks of anticoagulant therapy might be sufficient in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter. They also suggest that even shorter periods of anticoagulation might be a consideration in patients at high risk of bleeding complications.

### Time to cardioversion for acute atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic complications… [^1135AUNG]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Nuotio I, Hartikainen JEK, Grönberg T, Biancari F, Airaksinen KEJ. Time to Cardioversion for Acute Atrial Fibrillation and Thromboembolic Complications. JAMA. 2014; 312: 647–649. doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.3824 In 1995, practice guidelines recommended a limit of 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation for cardioversion without anticoagulation. 1–3 Whether the risk of thromboembolic complications is increased when cardioversion without anticoagulation is performed in less than 48 hours is unknown. In the retrospective Finnish CardioVersion study, 4 all patients with a primary diagnosis of AF, aged 18 years or older, with successful cardioversion in the emergency department within the first 48 hours of AF, and residence in the catchment areas of Turku and Kuopio university hospitals from 2003 to 2010 and Pori central hospital during 2010 were included.

Clinical details and the occurrence of thromboembolic complications within 30 days after cardioversion were retrospectively collected from medical reports. The primary outcome, a thromboembolic event, was defined as a clinical stroke or systemic embolism confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, surgery, or autopsy. Time to cardioversion was determined as the difference between the beginning of arrhythmic symptoms to the exact time of cardioversion. If the duration of arrhythmia was uncertain, the cardioversion was excluded. Procedures were divided into groups according to the time to cardioversion: less than 12 hours, 12 hours to less than 24 hours, and 24 hours to less than 48 hours. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the National Institute for Health and Welfare, with a waiver of informed consent.

Bivariable comparisons between groups were performed with the χ2 test, the Fisher exact test, or the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a repeated-measures model was conducted to evaluate risk factors for thromboembolic complications, including comparisons between groups 2 and 1 and between groups 3 and 1. Clinical features with independent predictive value for thromboembolic complications were used as covariates in the multivariate analysis based on our previous work. 4 Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.
3. Two-sided differences at P <. 05 were considered significant. Of 2481 patients with acute AF, 5116 successful cardioversions were performed without anticoagulation. The mean age was 61. 0 years, 1638 were female, and 2434 had more than 1 risk factor for stroke. Thirty-eight thromboembolic events occurred in 38 patients; 31 were strokes. The incidence of thromboembolic complications increased from 0. 3% in group 1 to

1. 1% in group 3. The incidence of thromboembolic complications according to the time to cardioversion in subgroups is presented in Table
2. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, time to cardioversion longer than 12 hours was an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications. Stroke is the most serious complication of AF. After the recommended 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation, the stroke risk in elective cardioversion of AF ranges from 0. 3% to
0. 8%. 1 In our study, the risk of thromboembolic complications was 0. 7% when cardioversion was performed without anticoagulation within 48 hours of AF onset.

### Cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation… [^114fyyWg]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation include palpitations and poor cardiac performance, with resultant worsening of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and possible sudden death. Patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are usually admitted to the hospital for evaluation of cardiac pathology and to monitor for complications. Anti-arrhythmic therapy may require extended cardiac monitoring because of proarrhythmic complications. Cardioversion is generally safe if patients present within 48 hours of the start of atrial fibrillation. With a longer duration of symptoms, patients should undergo three weeks of anticoagulation therapy before cardioversion is attempted. Recently, the need for hospitalization in low-risk patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation has been questioned. Michael and associates reviewed the postcardioversion management of low-risk patients who presented with symptoms of atrial fibrillation lasting for less than 48 hours.

During the 18-month study period, 168 low-risk patients made 289 visits to the emergency department. Atrial fibrillation was one of the discharge diagnoses in all of the study subjects. The average age of the participants was 64 years. Seventy-two percent had a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Seventy-five percent of the patients who received medication to control heart rate had a rate reduction to less than 120 beats per minute, with diltiazem providing the highest rate of success and adenosine and digoxin being least helpful. Ninety of 180 attempts at chemical cardioversion were successful. Intravenous procainamide was used in 98 percent of these cases. Ninety-nine percent of the patients who had a successful chemical cardioversion were discharged home from the emergency department. Eighty patients underwent electric cardioversion; in most of these patients, chemical cardioversion had failed. Patients who were successfully converted were discharged home.

Ten percent of patients unexpectedly returned to the emergency department within seven days, although none of the patients had complications associated with cardioversion. The authors conclude that, assuming patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are at low risk, most patients treated in the emergency department with either heart rate control, chemical cardioversion or electric cardioversion do not require hospitalization. Rates of short-term complications appear to be very low, but long-term complications require further study.

### Cardioversion… [^115w36wA]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

These are connected by cables to a machine which has the combined functions of an ECG display screen and the electrical function of a defibrillator. A synchronizing function allows the cardioverter to deliver a reversion shock, by way of the pads, of a selected amount of electric current over a predefined number of milliseconds at the optimal moment in the cardiac cycle which corresponds to the R wave of the QRS complex on the ECG. Timing the shock to the R wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle, which could induce ventricular fibrillation. If the patient is conscious, various drugs are often used to help sedate the patient and make the procedure more tolerable. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or unconscious, the shock is given immediately upon confirmation of the arrhythmia.

When synchronized electrical cardioversion is performed as an elective procedure, the shocks can be performed in conjunction with drug therapy until sinus rhythm is attained. After the procedure, the patient is monitored to ensure stability of the sinus rhythm. Synchronized electrical cardioversion is used to treat hemodynamically unstable supraventricular tachycardias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It is also used in the emergent treatment of wide complex tachycardias, including ventricular tachycardia, when a pulse is present. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are treated with unsynchronized shocks referred to as defibrillation. Electrical therapy is inappropriate for sinus tachycardia, which should always be a part of the differential diagnosis. Medication Various antiarrhythmic agents can be used to return the heart to normal sinus rhythm.

Pharmacological cardioversion is an especially good option in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset. Drugs that are effective at maintaining normal rhythm after electric cardioversion can also be used for pharmacological cardioversion. Drugs like amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil and metoprolol are frequently given before electrical cardioversion to decrease the heart rate, stabilize the patient and increase the chance that cardioversion is successful. There are various classes of agents that are most effective for pharmacological cardioversion. Class I agents are sodium channel blockers and are divided into 3 subclasses a, b and c. Class Ia slows phase 0 depolarization in the ventricles and increases the absolute refractory period. Procainamide, quinidine and disopyramide are Class Ia agents. Class III agents: amiodarone and sotalol are effective class III agents.

Ibutilide is another Class III agent but has a different mechanism of action. It has been shown to be effective in acute cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Procedure Preparation Cardioversion for restoration of sinus rhythm from an atrial rhythm is largely a scheduled procedure. In addition to cardiology, anesthesiology is also usually involved to ensure comfort of the patient for the duration of the shock therapy. The presence of registered nurses, physician associates, or other medical personnel may also be helpful during the procedure. Before starting the procedure, the patient's chest and back will be prepped for electrode placement. The skin should be free of any oily substances and hair which may otherwise interfere with adhesion of the pads.

### Early cardioversion No better than delayed… [^113h4KVn]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is it necessary to immediately restore sinus rhythm by early cardioversion in patients who present to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Bottom Line For patients presenting to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation, early cardioversion is no better than delayed cardioversion in achieving sinus rhythm within four weeks. The delayed approach results in more spontaneous conversions to sinus rhythm, avoiding cardioversion altogether, without increasing the rate of cardiovascular complications. Synopsis Atrial fibrillation can often terminate spontaneously without the need for pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. In this study, investigators included adults who presented to the emergency department with new or recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation of recent onset.

The patients were randomized into a delayed cardioversion group or a standard early cardioversion group. In the early group, patients received immediate pharmacologic cardioversion with flecainide and were discharged when stable. In the delayed group, patients received rate-controlling medications, were discharged when clinically stable, and were given outpatient follow-up the next day. If they remained in atrial fibrillation, they were then referred back to the emergency department for delayed cardioversion. The two groups were balanced at baseline: mean age was 65 years, approximately 40% were taking anticoagulants, and two-thirds had a CHA. 2DS 2-VASc score of 2 or higher. Only three patients in the delayed group and five in the early group required hospitalization; all others were discharged from the emergency department.

The median duration of the index emergency department visit was 158 minutes in the early group and 120 minutes in the delayed group. The primary outcome of the presence of sinus rhythm on an electrocardiogram at a four-week outpatient visit occurred in 91% of the delayed group and 94% of the early group, meeting noninferiority criteria for the delayed approach. In the delayed group, 69% converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously within 48 hours after rate-control medication and only 28% required delayed cardioversion. The number of cardiovascular complications were infrequent and did not differ between the two groups.

### Off-label use of direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin for left ventricular thrombi… [^1151JrVV]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A total of 514 patients with LV thrombi were identified, including 300 who received warfarin and 185 who received a DOAC. The median follow-up across the patient cohort was 351 days. In this modification of standard Kaplan-Meier curves, the cohorts are continually updated such that a patient who takes both a DOAC and warfarin during different time intervals contributes to the DOAC cohort for only the period that a DOAC is taken and contributes to the warfarin cohort for only the period that warfarin is being taken. Three hundred patients were treated with warfarin, and 185 patients were treated with a DOAC.

These groups included a mixed cohort of 64 patients who switched treatment, such that there were 236 patients treated exclusively with warfarin and 121 patients treated exclusively with a DOAC. There was a total of 52 changes from warfarin to a DOAC and a total of 19 changes from a DOAC to warfarin. The most common cause of switching therapy from warfarin to a DOAC was convenience, whereas the most common cause of switching therapy from a DOAC to warfarin was cost. The median follow-up across the patient cohort was 351 days. Additional data on follow-up, including follow-up period and treatment duration, are included in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement. There was a total of 54 SSE events, consisting of 36 ischemic strokes and 18 systemic emboli.

On univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, a higher risk of SSE was significantly associated with DOAC treatment vs warfarin. Prior SSE was also significantly associated with SSE. Imaging surveillance was variable, with 356 patients having at least 1 follow-up echocardiogram; the median time to first study was 81 days. A second follow-up echocardiogram was taken for 320 patients. The median time to the second study was 328 days. A total of 231 patients had echocardiographically confirmed resolution of their thrombus, including 56 while being treated with a DOAC, 131 while being treated with warfarin, 21 during treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, and 23 without any anticoagulation.

To evaluate for the possibility of an uneven distribution of LV thrombi of such high risk that they would undergo rapid embolization regardless of anticoagulation strategy, we performed a landmark analysis with exclusion of events within the first 10 days after the index echocardiogram. This exclusion resulted in the removal of 14 events, leaving 40 total SSE events for analysis. After this adjustment, anticoagulation with DOAC vs warfarin remained significantly associated with SSE on univariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Given the delayed divergence of survival curves and the potential for increased problems with confounding, we performed landmark analyses at 3 and 6 months, in accordance with the US and European guidelines.
