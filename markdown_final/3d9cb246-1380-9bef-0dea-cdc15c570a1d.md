## Question

5. Place 7 goldfish of different colors into 3 glass fish tanks numbered 1, 2, 3. If the number of fish in each tank must be no less than its number, then the number of different ways to place the fish is ____ kinds.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many ways to distribute 7 distinct goldfish into 3 distinct tanks numbered 1, 2, 3, such that tank 1 has at least 1 fish, tank 2 has at least 2 fish, and tank 3 has at least 3 fish. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the constraint translation and pre-allocation. Then, I should verify the reduced problem and whether it becomes a stars-and-bars problem or still involves distinct objects. Next, I will enumerate valid integer partitions and map them to multinomial coefficients. Finally, I will sum the possibilities and double-check the arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the constraints and the pre-allocation step. The requirement is that tank 1 has at least 1 fish, tank 2 has at least 2 fish, and tank 3 has at least 3 fish, so I should pre-assign 1 fish to tank 1, 2 fish to tank 2, and 3 fish to tank 3, which uses up 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 fish and leaves 1 fish to distribute freely among the 3 tanks. Wait, let me verify that subtraction: 7 total minus 6 pre-assigned equals 1 remaining fish, so yes, only 1 fish remains to be placed.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distribution of that remaining fish. Because all 7 goldfish are distinct, the pre-allocation is conceptual; I still need to choose which specific fish go into which tank, and the remaining fish can go to any of the three tanks, so the combinatorics will involve multinomial coefficients rather than a simple stars-and-bars count of indistinguishable items. I should confirm that the final count will be a sum over valid tank-size tuples, weighted by multinomial coefficients for assigning distinct fish to those sizes.

> Next, I should review the valid integer partitions of 7 into 3 parts that satisfy the minimums. Let me think about the possible tank counts (x₁, x₂, x₃) where x₁ ≥ 1, x₂ ≥ 2, x₃ ≥ 3 and x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 7. Given the pre-allocation, this is equivalent to distributing 1 extra fish, so the reduced counts (y₁, y₂, y₃) with y₁ = x₁ − 1, y₂ = x₂ − 2, y₃ = x₃ − 3 must satisfy y₁ + y₂ + y₃ = 1 with y₁, y₂, y₃ ≥ 0. The non-negative integer solutions are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1), which correspond to original tank sizes (2, 2, 3), (1, 3, 3), and (1, 2, 4), respectively. I should double-check that these are the only possibilities; yes, with only 1 extra fish, these are the only three cases.

> Now I will compute the multinomial coefficients for each valid partition. For (2, 2, 3), the number of ways to assign 7 distinct fish is 7! / (2! 2! 3!) = 5040 / (2 × 2 × 6) = 5040 / 24 = 210. For (1, 3, 3), it is 7! / (1! 3! 3!) = 5040 / (1 × 6 × 6) = 5040 / 36 = 140. For (1, 2, 4), it is 7! / (1! 2! 4!) = 5040 / (1 × 2 × 24) = 5040 / 48 = 105. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: 5040 divided by 48 is indeed 105, so these individual counts are correct.

> I will now examine the total number of ways by summing the cases. Total = 210 + 140 + 105 = 455. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the answer might be 3 because there are 3 places the extra fish can go, but that would be true if the fish were indistinguishable; because the fish are distinct, I must sum the multinomial coefficients, which gives 455 distinct arrangements. I should confirm there are no other valid partitions; with only 1 extra fish, I have exhausted all possibilities, so the total is 455.

---

The number of ways to place 7 distinct goldfish into tanks 1, 2, and 3, with at least 1, 2, and 3 fish respectively, is **455**. This is found by first placing the minimum required fish (1 in tank 1, 2 in tank 2, 3 in tank 3), leaving 1 fish to distribute freely. The remaining fish can go into any of the 3 tanks, giving 3 cases: (2,2,3), (1,3,3), or (1,2,4). The multinomial coefficients for these distributions are 210, 140, and 105, respectively, summing to 455.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: understand the constraints

We must place 7 distinct goldfish into tanks 1, 2, and 3 such that:

- Tank 1 has at least 1 fish.
- Tank 2 has at least 2 fish.
- Tank 3 has at least 3 fish.

---

### Step 2: initial placement of minimum required fish

First, place the minimum required fish in each tank:

- **Tank 1**: 1 fish
- **Tank 2**: 2 fish
- **Tank 3**: 3 fish

This uses 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 fish, leaving 1 fish to place.

---

### Step 3: distribute the remaining fish

The remaining 1 fish can be placed in any of the 3 tanks, leading to three cases:

| **Case** | **Tank 1** | **Tank 2** | **Tank 3** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 |

---

### Step 4: calculate the number of ways for each case

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to assign 7 distinct fish using the multinomial coefficient:

Number of ways = [7!/(n₁! × n₂! × n₃!)]

where (n₁, n₂, n₃) are the numbers of fish in tanks 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

- **Case 1**: (2, 2, 3)

[7!/(2! × 2! × 3!)] = [5040/(2 × 2 × 6)] = [5040/24] = 210

- **Case 2**: (1, 3, 3)

[7!/(1! × 3! × 3!)] = [5040/(1 × 6 × 6)] = [5040/36] = 140

- **Case 3**: (1, 2, 4)

[7!/(1! × 2! × 4!)] = [5040/(1 × 2 × 24)] = [5040/48] = 105

---

### Step 5: sum the results

Total number of ways = 210 + 140 + 105 = **455**.

---

The number of different ways to place the 7 goldfish is **455**.

Data acquisition

Experiments were performed in a 700 mm × 700 mm × 135 mm live-in filming tank in a separate 800 l system with its own water exchange, filtration and environmental enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). At least 2 days before experiments, animals were moved from their home aquarium into the filming tank for acclimatization; they remained there throughout the days or weeks of filming. During experiments, a black frame was placed into the middle of the arena, restricting animals to a 400 mm × 400 mm area, keeping tank enrichment temporarily out of sight. During filming, an acrylic lid was placed onto the water surface to remove optical distortions caused by water ripples, and the arena was lit by four LED strip lights with diffusers, mounted 15 cm above the acrylic lid (SAW4 white, 698 cm length, Polytec), providing an illuminance of 3,400 lx measured at the lid centre). Background images were presented to the animal as prints on a 400-mm-wide fabric roll (210 g m −2, 75 d.p.i.), moved over the arena floor gently with a manual crank. For experiments with natural backgrounds, a 2-mm-thick transparent acrylic sheet was placed on top of the fabric to provide extra stability for some of the animals. This increased the chance of capturing in-focus high-resolution frames during pattern transition.

We presented a set of 30 natural images with diverse visual statistics in at least five random orders (private collection; Extended Data Fig. 2a). Three background images were selected for further experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2b) on the basis of reliably eliciting distinct camouflage patterns in multiple animals. Checkerboard backgrounds were logarithmic series in three ranges of square sizes, one coarsely sampled from 0.04 to 20 cm, and two with denser sampling, from 0.63 to 2.5 cm and from 0.18 to 0.63 cm (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The coarse series was repeatedly presented in two random orders, and the finer series in one random order each. In three animals, these frozen random sequences were additionally broken in a portion of the trials by skipping through the fabric roll. The four sets of frozen random series (and their respective reverses) were not presented in a defined order. The evoked behaviours were comparable, and therefore combined for analysis.

### Selective fishing induces density-dependent growth [^61b6f200]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Here we show that the strive for the theoretically highest yieldsby increasing selectivity is a risk-prone strategy; as density-dependent growth is induced, stock productivity and population structure may go astray. In search for more robust fisheries management strategies, we argue that catch rates should be prioritized over yield, as it will stabilize yield levels and reduce the need of fishing effort, which will be beneficial for higher ecosystem functionality.

A number @f military inspectors had approved purchases of salmon of lower value and passed it off @ssalmon. very pow&l position. As I remember, if you wanted to get a new pen at that he — you know, things were very tight moneywise; the agency was very frugal — you had to turn in your pen to get a new one. Old batteries you turned in to get some new batteridis, and the supply room was certainly kept locked. FDA also at that time owned its own automobiles, and kept them fbr a good number of years.

### Fisheries: deep-sea fishes qualify as endangered [^2bd3638b]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Criteria from the World Conservation Union (IUCN) have been used to classify marine fish species as endangered since 1996, but deep-sea fish have not so far been evaluated — despite their vulnerability to aggressive deepwater fishing as a result of certain life-history traits. Here we use research-survey data to show that five species of deep-sea fish have declined over a 17-year period in the Canadian waters of the northwest Atlantic to such an extent that they meet the IUCN criteria for being critically endangered. Our results indicate that urgent action is needed for the sustainable management of deep-sea fisheries.

Farmed salmon production and feed reliance — historically, farmed salmon have used fishmeal, requiring "1.5 to 3 lb of feed for every pound of salmon". Some operations now approximate "1:1 fish-in to fish-out ratios (ie, 1 lb of wild fish in salmon feed produces 1 lb of farmed salmon)", with facilities that "scarcely use chemicals, and have greatly reduced disease spread and escapes through better monitoring and lower-density farming". Although alternatives are being explored, "Experiments with vegetarian feeds and other fishmeal and oil substitutes have shown promise at further reducing reliance on wild fish stocks for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids", yet "Most salmon farms do not yet meet cutting-edge standards for production that limit undesirable environmental and health impacts".

Table 1 — sustainability considerations for seafood: Approximately 30% of global fish stocks are overexploited and a further 60% are harvested at or near their maximum sustainable yield, and medical and governmental organizations have encouraged greater seafood consumption for Americans, which may add pressure to declining wild fisheries and promote unsustainable aquaculture practice. Shrimp is the most commonly consumed seafood in the United States; much of the shrimp comes from highly unsustainable overseas fisheries with heavy environmental and human tolls. US fisheries, wild or farmed, are some of the best managed in the world, even if not all are sustainably harvested, and compared with conventional red meat production in the United States, most wild catch fisheries and best practice aquaculture have favorable water, greenhouse gas, and pollution footprints.

### Fish can infer social rank by observation alone [^4d1d6047]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Transitive inference (TI) involves using known relationships to deduce unknown ones (for example, using A > B and B > C to infer A > C), and is thus essential to logical reasoning. First described as a developmental milestone in children, TI has since been reported in nonhuman primates, rats and birds. Still, how animals acquire and represent transitive relationships and why such abilities might have evolved remain open problems. Here we show that male fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) can successfully make inferences on a hierarchy implied by pairwise fights between rival males. These fish learned the implied hierarchy vicariously (as 'bystanders'), by watching fights between rivals arranged around them in separate tank units. Our findings show that fish use TI when trained on socially relevant stimuli, and that they can make such inferences by using indirect information alone. Further, these bystanders seem to have both spatial and featural representations related to rival abilities, which they can use to make correct inferences depending on what kind of information is available to them. Beyond extending TI to fish and experimentally demonstrating indirect TI learning in animals, these results indicate that a universal mechanism underlying TI is unlikely. Rather, animals probably use multiple domain-specific representations adapted to different social and ecological pressures that they encounter during the course of their natural lives.

### Temperature, species identity and morphological traits predict carbonate excretion and mineralogy in tropical reef fishes [^ef1ec03c]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sample collection

We collected fish carbonate samples at four study locations across three tropical and subtropical regions: Eleuthera (24°50'N, 76°20'W), The Bahamas, between 2009 and 2011; Heron Reef (23°27'S, 151°55'E) and Moreton Bay (27°29'S, 153°24'E) in Queensland, Australia, in 2014 and 2015; and Koror (7°20'N, 134°28'E), Palau, during November and December 2019. These are located within four distinct marine biogeographic provinces and three realms (Tropical Atlantic, Central Indo-Pacific, and Temperate Australasia). At each location fish were collected using barrier nets, dip nets, clove oil or hook and line, and immediately transferred to aquaria facilities at the Cape Eleuthera Institute, Heron Island and Moreton Bay Research Stations, and the Palau International Coral Reef Center. Fish were held in a range of tanks (60, 400, or 1400 L in the Bahamas, 10, 60, 100, 120, or 400 L in Heron Island and Moreton Bay, and 8, 80, 280, or 400 L in Palau) of suitable dimensions for different fish sizes (< 1 g to 11 kg), either individually or, for particularly social species, in small groups of similar sized individuals of the same species. All tanks were supplied with flow-through locally-drawn filtered (1–5 µm) natural seawater, except in Moreton Bay where we used locally-drawn filtered natural seawater in a recirculation system, and maintained at ambient conditions. Food was withheld throughout the sampling period (typically three days but sometimes shorter or longer) and for at least 48 h prior to ensure that sample material comprised only carbonate precipitated within the intestine from imbibed seawater calcium, rather than from dietary sources. Additionally, each tank was fitted with a false mesh bottom to prevent further disturbance of excreted carbonate pellets or potential ingestion by fish. Carbonate pellets were collected from the bottom of the tanks using a siphon or disposable Pasteur pipette at 24 h intervals in The Bahamas and Australia (except a few non-scarine Labridae that were sampled at 4 h intervals — see ref.), and at 8 h intervals in Palau. Samples were rinsed three times with deionised water (centrifuging each time for 3 min at 2655 x g) to remove saltwater and excess salts and soaked in sodium hypochlorite (commercial bleach; < 4% available chlorine) for 6–12 h to disaggregate organic material. All traces of bleach were removed with further rinses with deionised water before drying the samples for 24 h at 50 ˚C. Full details of carbonate collection in The Bahamas and Australia are described in refs.

### Contrasting signatures of genomic divergence during sympatric speciation [^d2e7928c]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

In both experiments, we tested whether mating departed from random expectations using a two-sided χ²-test with 1 degree of freedom. Two caveats should be noted for these experiments: (a) most fish of each of the species came from a single brood of a wild-caught couple, and (b) we could not attempt to replicate these experiments. These two caveats arise from the same issue: Midas cichlids require a lot of tank space to grow to maturity (> 24 months old). They also reach a very large size at maturity compared to most other cichlid fishes: experimental females weighted 111.5 ± 27.4 g (mean ± s.d.) and their standard length was 135.6 ± 12.5 mm. Experimental males weighted 355.4 ± 62.9 g and their standard length was on average 196.5 ± 15.5 mm. They are extremely aggressive and would potentially kill each other under space restriction. Their large size and aggressive behaviour have two consequences. First, we were constrained in the number of fish that could be simultaneously reared to maturity. For the mate choice experiments described above we needed a large number of mature, but previously unmated (that is, naive), adult fish from four different species, all of which had to be of approximately the same size at the time of the experiments to render comparable results. Several large tanks were therefore necessary to rear all these fish at the same time. The immediate consequence of this is that we were limited to rearing one family per species. Second, because of the spatial needs of these fish and their aggressive behaviour during mating, the experiments had to be conducted in a large arena (340 × 160 × 80 cm). Only one such arena was available, and the different experiments and trials had to be conducted sequentially. This space limitation, in addition to the limited number of unmated fish, restricted our ability to replicate these experiments. Hence, interpretations based on the results of these experiments should be taken with caution. However, because the findings of these experiments are in agreement with other mate choice experiments conducted in Midas cichlids (Extended Data Table 2; Supplementary Notes), we are confident about the general robustness of these findings. Fish used in the experiments were between two and three years old. The order of trials was randomized, but only one arena was available for the experiment. Data were collected without knowledge of fish identity as the fish were individually tagged with transponders (blinding). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Mate choice experiments were approved by the German authorities (permit number G-15/89, Regierungspräsidium Freiburg, Abteilung 3, Referat 35, Veterinärwesen & Lebensmittelüberwachung, Germany).

### Highly efficient and robust π-FISH rainbow for multiplexed in situ detection of diverse biomolecules [^a43bb114]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Design and validation of π-FISH rainbow

To increase FISH efficiency, stability, sensitivity, and specificity, we developed the π-FISH rainbow method, in which the primary π-FISH target probes contain 2–4 complementary base pairs in the middle region (step i) (Fig. 1a). This design is favorable for split probes to form a π-shaped bond to increase stability during hybridization and washing, which can ultimately improve efficiency and specificity. Next, secondary U-shaped (step ii) and tertiary (step iii) U-shaped amplification probes were utilized to amplify the signal. Finally, a fluorescence signal probe was used to visualize the signal (step iv). Details of the π-FISH rainbow workflow and the probe sequences are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1, respectively. Notably, by combining different fluorescence signal probes (π-FISH rainbow), we could realize multiplexed target detection in one round.

### Illuminating the multidimensional contributions of small-scale fisheries [^2604c199]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sustainable development aspires to "leave no one behind" 1. Even so, limited attention has been paid to small-scale fisheries (SSF) and their importance in eradicating poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Through a collaborative and multidimensional data-driven approach, we have estimated that SSF provide at least 40% (37.3 million tonnes) of global fisheries catches and 2.3 billion people with, on average, 20% of their dietary intake across six key micronutrients essential for human health. Globally, the livelihood of 1 in every 12 people, nearly half of them women, depends at least partly on small-scale fishing, in total generating 44% (US$77.2 billion) of the economic value of all fisheries landed. Regionally, Asian SSF provide fish, support livelihoods and supply nutrition to the largest number of people. Relative to the total capture of the fisheries sector (comprising large-scale and small-scale fisheries), across all regions, African SSF supply the most catch and nutrition, and SSF in Oceania improve the most livelihoods. Maintaining and increasing these multidimensional SSF contributions to sustainable development requires targeted and effective actions, especially increasing the engagement of fisherfolk in shared management and governance. Without management and governance focused on the multidimensional contributions of SSF, the marginalization of millions of fishers and fishworkers will worsen.

### Fishing elevates variability in the abundance of exploited species [^49083b25]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The separation of the effects of environmental variability from the impacts of fishing has been elusive, but is essential for sound fisheries management. We distinguish environmental effects from fishing effects by comparing the temporal variability of exploited versus unexploited fish stocks living in the same environments. Using the unique suite of 50-year-long larval fish surveys from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations we analyse fishing as a treatment effect in a long-term ecological experiment. Here we present evidence from the marine environment that exploited species exhibit higher temporal variability in abundance than unexploited species. This remains true after accounting for life-history effects, abundance, ecological traits and phylogeny. The increased variability of exploited populations is probably caused by fishery-induced truncation of the age structure, which reduces the capacity of populations to buffer environmental events. Therefore, to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain the total viable biomass but also to prevent the significant truncation of age structure. The double jeopardy of fishing to potentially deplete stock sizes and, more immediately, to amplify the peaks and valleys of population variability, calls for a precautionary management approach.

### Zebrafish as tools for drug discovery [^5d19d9b8]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

The zebrafish has become a prominent vertebrate model for disease and has already contributed to several examples of successful phenotype-based drug discovery. For the zebrafish to become useful in drug development more broadly, key hurdles must be overcome, including a more comprehensive elucidation of the similarities and differences between human and zebrafish biology. Recent studies have begun to establish the capabilities and limitations of zebrafish for disease modelling, drug screening, target identification, pharmacology, and toxicology. As our understanding increases and as the technologies for manipulating zebrafish improve, it is hoped that the zebrafish will have a key role in accelerating the emergence of precision medicine.

### Sustainable reference points for multispecies coral reef fisheries [^91bf34f1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sustainably managing fisheries requires regular and reliable evaluation of stock status. However, most multispecies reef fisheries around the globe tend to lack research and monitoring capacity, preventing the estimation of sustainable reference points against which stocks can be assessed. Here, combining fish biomass data for > 2000 coral reefs, we estimate site-specific sustainable reference points for coral reef fisheries and use these and available catch estimates to assess the status of global coral reef fish stocks. We reveal that > 50% of sites and jurisdictions with available information have stocks of conservation concern, having failed at least one fisheries sustainability benchmark. We quantify the trade-offs between biodiversity, fish length, and ecosystem functions relative to key benchmarks and highlight the ecological benefits of increasing sustainability. Our approach yields multispecies sustainable reference points for coral reef fisheries using environmental conditions, a promising means for enhancing the sustainability of the world's coral reef fisheries.

### Dynamic plasticity in phototransduction regulates seasonal changes in color perception [^c3e7b76e]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Seasonal changes in behavioral traits

We observed seasonal differences in behaviors in a medaka population maintained in outdoor enclosures for several years. To confirm this observation in a controlled environment, we tracked the spatial usage of two fish (male and female) in a home tank using a three-dimensional (3D) tracking system. Similar to their activity when reared outdoors, fish kept under long-day (LD), warm-temperature conditions (LW: 14 h light/10 h dark; 26 °C) swam all over the tank, whereas fish kept under short-day (SD) and cool-temperature conditions (SC: 10 h light/14 h dark; 8 °C) stayed at the bottom of the tank (Fig. 1a). In general, fish swim much faster and further in LW compared with SC conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Fish normally swim toward a weak light stimulus (positive phototaxis), but avoid strong light signals (negative phototaxis). They also exhibit a transient period of hyperactivity upon loss of illumination, known as darkness-induced light-seeking behavior. In this study, we observed negative phototaxis and darkness-induced light-seeking behavior in medaka kept under LW conditions. When LW medaka were introduced into a novel tank (see Methods section), they avoided white light (23.1 μmol m −2 s −1; 70 Lux) (Supplementary Fig. 2a), but immediately moved to the opposite side of the tank just after lights out (Fig. 1b). By contrast, SC fish swam randomly before and after lights-out and failed to exhibit either negative phototaxis or darkness-induced light-seeking behavior (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy that although overall activity is decreased under winter conditions in the home tank (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a), these fish have the capacity to move when transferred to new environmental conditions (e.g. test tank) (Supplementary Fig. 1b)

### Environmental performance of blue foods [^242d9db6]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Fish and other aquatic foods (blue foods) present an opportunity for more sustainable diets 1,2. Yet comprehensive comparison has been limited due to sparse inclusion of blue foods in environmental impact studies 3,4 relative to the vast diversity of production 5. Here we provide standardized estimates of greenhouse gas, nitrogen, phosphorus, freshwater and land stressors for species groups covering nearly three quarters of global production. We find that across all blue foods, farmed bivalves and seaweeds generate the lowest stressors. Capture fisheries predominantly generate greenhouse gas emissions, with small pelagic fishes generating lower emissions than all fed aquaculture, but flatfish and crustaceans generating the highest. Among farmed finfish and crustaceans, silver and bighead carps have the lowest greenhouse gas, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions, but highest water use, while farmed salmon and trout use the least land and water. Finally, we model intervention scenarios and find improving feed conversion ratios reduces stressors across all fed groups, increasing fish yield reduces land and water use by up to half, and optimizing gears reduces capture fishery emissions by more than half for some groups. Collectively, our analysis identifies high-performing blue foods, highlights opportunities to improve environmental performance, advances data-poor environmental assessments, and informs sustainable diets.

Mercury content and variability in tuna — Mercury levels in fish depend on age, size, trophic level, and water contamination, and vary notably across tuna types. The median concentration of mercury in canned light tuna is 0.128 ppm (μg/g), with a range from 0 to 0.889 ppm; the concentration in canned albacore tuna is 0.338 ppm, ranging from 0 to 0.853 ppm. For exposure estimation, a 25-kg child consuming 4 oz (113 g) of canned light tuna (a whole can is 5 oz) would, on average, consume 0.08 μg of mercury/kg of body weight (approximately 80% of the RfD) but could get none or as much as 0.57 μg/kg (> 5 times RfD) depending on the specific fish included.

Results

Phenotypic Distribution

To maximize power to detect possible QTLs associated with resistance to the PMCV virus, we sampled approximately equal numbers of dead and surviving fish from population 1, however, after genotype quality checks, the percentage of dead fish was slightly higher (55.7%) than the surviving fish that were sampled (44.3%, Figure 1A). For population 2 (an informant population which encountered a natural outbreak of the PMCV virus), only 402 fish (9.3%) out of 4312 died from the CMS outbreak, the rest of the population (90.7%, Figure 1B) were considered as survivors and used in the analysis. Since the PMCV challenge test model did not result in mortalities, we performed histology of the heart (atrium) for all the challenge tested fish. The mean histology score was 1.750 (SD = 0.680), however, 86.2% of all fish had either a score of 1 (22.3% with no histopathological findings) or a score of 2 (63.9% with few (< 7) focal lesions, Figure 1C).

In conclusion, ongoing climate change challenges traditional assumptions about the future stability and predictability of fisheries production from the oceans. Our global meta-analysis of non-stationary production dynamics in depleted fish stocks tracks patterns of productivity variation in global fishery time series and provides a framework to incorporate biological uncertainty into stock-rebuilding plans and wildlife management more broadly. As ocean conditions continue to change, our results help provide an empirical basis for adaptive fishery management that should aid in sustainably harvesting fish populations, rebuilding depleted stocks, and meeting international biodiversity targets.

### Illuminating the multidimensional contributions of small-scale fisheries [^4a4a75bd]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To calculate the potential contribution of SSF to local diets in Fig. 1a, fish catch data for the 58 country case studies were supplemented with extrapolated global catch data for all 186 countries, resolved to functional group level. Second, existing databases were used to extract fin-fish and invertebrate (INFOODS) nutrient concentrations, for six micronutrients (calcium, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin A and omega 3). Although fatty acids are not defined as micronutrients, because the recommended intake for omega 3 fatty acids that are concentrated in aquatic foods (EPA and DHA) is within the micronutrient range, we refer collectively to all six nutrients as micronutrients important to human health, often lacking in diets but found in aquatic foods. These concentrations were assigned to each species, genera, family, order and class in the reported catch, in order of descending priority, to estimate the catch-weighted average micronutrient concentration (for each of the six nutrients) of each functional group in each country, for the marine and inland sub-sectors. Third, catch-weighted average micronutrient concentration of each country's functional group were multiplied by the annual catch (in tonnes) and the edible portion, before summing across functional groups, to calculate, for each of the six nutrients, each country's micronutrient supply from SSF. Each country's daily micronutrient supply from SSF (average annual edible catch × nutrient concentration of catch/365) was used to calculate the per capita supply of micronutrients from SSF (daily micronutrient supply/coastal population), based on the population living within 20 km of a marine coastline or inland body of water (lakes with an area of more than 50 km 2 and reservoirs with a storage capacity of 0.5 km 3 or more). The sensitivity of these results to coastal population size was tested by estimating micronutrient intake for populations within buffers of 10 km, 20 km and 30 km. The per capita supply of micronutrients from SSF relative to each country's per capita nutrient supply was estimated from all foods using dietary intake data from the Global Dietary Database. These contributions were then averaged across the six nutrients to give the average contribution of SSF catch to per capita dietary micronutrient intake. Finally, the contribution of SSF to micronutrient supply from all fisheries (Fig. 1b) was estimated relative to the total supply from global fisheries.

LTMP CoTS and coral cover data

LTMP CoTS and coral cover data are available from 1983 to 2020. Both observed CoTS and coral cover data are based on field observations that employ manta tow surveys around the perimeter of each reef following AIMS' Standard Operational Procedure. Within this period, manta tows were conducted once per year but not all reefs were sampled every year. Briefly, manta tow surveys are a broad-scale technique that covers large areas of reef quickly and provides an assessment of broad changes in the distribution and abundance of corals and CoTS. During surveys, two boats each tow an observer clockwise and anti-clockwise around reef perimeters in a series of 2-min tows until they meet at the other end of the reef. Each observer records categorical coral cover (Supplementary Table 8) and the number and size of any CoTS observed (Supplementary Table 9) at the end of each 2-min tow. Manta tow surveys are a non-targeting, rapid assessment method, and therefore it under-samples CoTS individuals that are < 15 cm in total body diameter and also under-estimates true population numbers. CoTS density at the individual manta tow level is measured as total number of individuals per 2-min tow. Coral cover at the individual manta tow level is measured as percentage coral cover category per 2-min tow. Categories (in quotes) were converted to proportions, using the mid-points of each category, for subsequent analyses as follows: "0" = 0, "1" = 0.05, "1L" = 0.025, "1U" = 0.075, "2" = 0.2, "2L" = 0.15, "2U" = 0.25, "3" = 0.4, "3L" = 0.35, "3U" = 0.45, "4" = 0.625, "4L" = 0.5625, "4U" = 0.6875, "5" = 0.875, "5L" = 0.8125, and "5U" = 0.9375. In our statistical analyses, we use both CoTS density and coral cover proportion at the individual manta tow level for a given reef–year combination, as well as averaged across manta tows for a given reef–year combination (please see statistical modelling below).

### Estimation of effective population size for the long-lived darkblotched rockfish sebastes crameri [^d736c723]. The Journal of Heredity (2006). Low credibility.

We report the variance effective population size (Ne) in darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri) utilizing the temporal method for overlapping generations, which requires a combination of age-specific demography and genetic information from cohorts. Following calculations of age-specific survival and reproductive success from fishery data, we genotyped a sample (n = 1087) comprised by 6 cohorts (from 1995 to 2000) across 7 microsatellite loci. Our Ne estimate (Ne) plus 95% confidence interval was (Ne) = 9157 [6495–12 215], showing that the breeding population number could be 3–4 orders of magnitude smaller than the census population size (N) = 24 376 210). Our estimates resemble closely those found for fishes with similar life history, suggesting that the small (Ne)/(N) ratio for S. crameri is most likely explained by a combination of high variance in reproductive success among individuals, genetic structure, and demographic perturbations such as historical fishing. Because small (Ne)/(N) ratios have been commonly associated with potential loss of genetic variation, our estimates need careful consideration in rockfish management and conservation.

### Designing flows to resolve human and environmental water needs in a dam-regulated river [^f2812e6d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Despite mounting pleas and accumulating science to define environmental flows for freshwater ecosystems, previous efforts have overwhelmingly focused on single species or ecosystem surrogates for river restoration –, with little consideration of explicit targets for biological communities. By incorporating multiple species associations with the entire hydrologic regime, we suggest that designer flows may be engineered to meet human water demands and take advantage of mismatches between native and nonnative species responses to flow. These mismatches create small, but powerful, windows of opportunity to allocate water for dam releases that deliver multiple ecological outcomes; in this case, supporting native species conservation and nonnative species control. Capitalizing on such opportunities are admittedly challenging and require interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers, engineers, watershed planners, and policy makers, just to name a few.

The sheer prevalence of nonnative fishes in dam-impacted rivers and the considerable similarities in life histories exhibited by native and nonnative fishesnecessitate a multi-species approach to water management. Native and nonnative fishes did not always demonstrate contrasting responses to high flows (Figs. 3 and 4), which is indicative of ecological and flow-preference similarities. Flow responses varied within nativity groupings, as seen with the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which responded to flow designs more similarly to native species compared to other nonnative species. The fact that flow designs may have a net negative effect on nonnative fish communities, but that a spectrum of species-specific responses are possible, reinforces multi-faceted strategies to nonnative species management. For example, while populations of small-bodied fish species are infeasible to control physically in river systems, opportunities for active mechanical removal efforts for larger species exist. Given that predation and competition from introduced species are major threats to native biodiversity and are exacerbated by human alteration of rivers, it is critical to quantify the trade-offs inherent in environmental flow prescriptions that seek to disfavor multiple nonnative species.

Shellfish poisoning — sources, risk to travelers, and clinical presentation: shellfish (crustaceans, filter-feeding bivalve mollusks, and gastropod mollusks) can harbor toxins that result in several different poisoning syndromes, with toxins originating in small marine organisms ingested and concentrated by shellfish. Contaminated shellfish can be found in temperate and tropical waters, typically during or after phytoplankton blooms (harmful algal blooms), and one example is the Florida red tide caused by Karenia brevis. Poisoning results in gastrointestinal and neurologic illness of varying severity, with symptoms typically appearing 30–60 minutes after ingestion but possibly delayed for several hours; diagnosis is usually made by exclusion and typically is made clinically in patients with a history of having recently eaten shellfish.

### Asymmetric impacts of climate change on thermal habitat suitability for inland lake fishes [^1f65a59a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Climate change is altering the thermal habitats of freshwater fish species. We analyze modeled daily temperature profiles from 12,688 lakes in the US to track changes in thermal habitat of 60 lake fish species from different thermal guilds during 1980–2021. We quantify changes in each species' preferred days, defined as the number of days per year when a lake contains the species' preferred temperature. We find that cooler-water species are losing preferred days more rapidly than warmer-water species are gaining them. This asymmetric impact cannot be attributed to differences in geographic distribution among species; instead, it is linked to the seasonal dynamics of lake temperatures and increased thermal homogenization of the water column. The potential advantages of an increase in warmer-water species may not fully compensate for the losses in cooler-water species as warming continues, emphasizing the importance of mitigating climate change to support effective freshwater fisheries management.

### Indigenous oyster fisheries persisted for millennia and should inform future management [^e4e9afba]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Secondary data collection

In each region, we collected data on oyster-bearing sites from primary literature and the authors' research (Table S1). We included data about (1) site location, (2) site chronology, (3) site type, use, and size, (4) original excavation methods, and (5) oyster abundance within the site. Because methods of analysis differ among different regions and even among sites within the same region, we focused on two measurements: the frequency of oyster bearing sites (Fig. 1) and the relative abundance of oysters within sites (Fig. 3). Researchers collected abundance measurements as the percent of oyster relative to other shellfish measured as either minimum number of individuals (MNI) or weight of shell. Because the two valves of an oyster shell are distinctive (Fig. 1), the MNI can be determined by counting the total number of right and left valves within an analytical unit and using the highest number. Alternatively, some researchers measure shell by weight, and many use both measurements. Although not directly comparable, either is considered an acceptable measurement of relative abundance in zooarchaeological analysis with various strengths and limitations –.

We also estimated the total number of oysters present for sites where researchers had reported all relevant data — the total site volume, the volume of excavated samples, and the total MNI within those excavated samples. Volume was generally estimated by approximating the site volume based on excavation data and the documented area of sites. In a few cases in the southern Atlantic, LIDAR was used to produce more precise estimates. Finally, for comparative purposes we targeted sites with the same quantitative data across all of the regions. These estimates allow for quantification of the scale and intensity of harvest that can be extrapolated for entire regions. Our data draw on published analyses and reports, gray literature from regional repositories, and personal files, with data sources noted in Table S1. We note, however, that more sites have been excavated and reported on with oysters in each of the regions than we were able to include based on the required data described above.

We surveyed published and unpublished literature for ethnohistoric accounts of oysters among Indigenous communities. To explore relationships between archaeological site function and human activities, we also gathered as much information as possible about archaeological sites. These findings form the basis for interpretations of the cultural, social, and ritual significance of oysters.
