## Question

A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, and fever. He has had a cough productive of foul-smelling sputum for 4 weeks. He was hospitalized for alcohol intoxication twice over the past 6 months. He has hypertension and depression. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 6 alcoholic beverages daily. Current medications include ramipril and fluoxetine. He appears malnourished. He is 185 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 65.7 kg (145 lb); BMI is 19.1 kg/m². His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 147/96 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Examination of the chest shows dullness to percussion over the right upper lung field. An x-ray of the chest shows a lung cavity with an air-fluid level and surrounding infiltrate in the right upper lobe of the lung. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Bronchoscopy and drainage of the lesion
B. Sputum cultures
C. Metronidazole therapy
D. Clindamycin therapy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate for a 40-year-old man with a lung abscess, specifically choosing between bronchoscopy with drainage, sputum cultures, metronidazole, or clindamycin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and the likely microbiology. Then, I should verify what guideline-based sources say about empiric therapy and when to obtain cultures. Next, I will examine the role and timing of bronchoscopy and drainage. After that, I need to check the antibiotic choices, especially anaerobic coverage and the limitations of metronidazole. Finally, I will integrate the patient's risk factors and outline a practical, evidence-aligned next step with rationale and alternatives if cultures are unobtainable.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and likely pathogens. The clinical picture of fever, productive cough with foul-smelling sputum, and a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level on chest radiograph is classic for a lung abscess, and aspiration-related anaerobes are common in this setting, particularly with alcohol use and poor dentition, which fits this patient profile [^113bnrMH] [^112rJj8h].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on empiric therapy and cultures. The IDSA/ATS guidance advises that when lung abscess or empyema is suspected in the context of aspiration pneumonia, anaerobic coverage should be added, whereas routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia without abscess or empyema, underscoring the need to tailor therapy when cavitation is present [^111TRU1E] [^111Vs8ak]. I should also confirm that obtaining cultures before starting antibiotics is standard to guide therapy and de-escalation; this is consistent with best practices for severe respiratory infections and is reinforced by contemporary cohort data emphasizing polymicrobial infections and the value of microbiologic direction in lung abscess care [^113bnrMH] [^112QwZKu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bronchoscopy. My first instinct is to consider immediate bronchoscopic drainage, but I need to check whether that is indicated now or only if medical therapy fails. The evidence base shows that most lung abscesses drain via the bronchus and heal with antibiotics alone, reserving percutaneous or bronchoscopic drainage for large, multiloculated, or refractory lesions after a trial of appropriate therapy, typically around 72 hours, or when complications arise; thus, upfront bronchoscopic drainage is not the first step here [^113bnrMH] [^112Q9Ffo]. But wait, what if the lesion is actually an empyema masquerading as an abscess? Differentiating abscess from empyema is crucial because empyema requires prompt pleural drainage; if there is diagnostic uncertainty, cross-sectional imaging and procedural planning would follow, but that still does not make immediate bronchoscopic drainage the correct first move in this scenario [^115ptM79].

> I will now examine the antibiotic options against guideline principles. Clindamycin is a reasonable empiric choice for aspiration-related lung abscess because it provides reliable anaerobic coverage and has historical support in this setting, whereas metronidazole monotherapy is inadequate because it lacks activity against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci that commonly contribute to these infections; thus, metronidazole alone would be inappropriate empiric therapy here [^113bnrMH]. Let me reconsider whether a broader regimen is needed; contemporary ICU cohorts show polymicrobial flora including Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus in a meaningful subset, so if the patient deteriorates or is high risk, expanding to a beta-lactam with anaerobic coverage or adding an agent like piperacillin-tazobactam may be justified, but empirically starting with clindamycin is acceptable and guideline-concordant for suspected anaerobic lung abscess in an outpatient-capable patient [^112QwZKu] [^111TRU1E].

> Next, I should review the role of sputum cultures. Obtaining sputum for Gram stain and culture before antibiotics, if feasible, helps identify alternative pathogens and supports de-escalation; this aligns with stewardship principles and is particularly relevant when the presentation is atypical or the patient is high risk for resistant organisms, even though anaerobes are often under-recovered from routine sputum cultures [^113bnrMH] [^112QwZKu]. I should double-check that this does not delay necessary therapy; in a clinically stable patient, a brief delay to collect a good-quality expectorated sample is reasonable, whereas in instability, empiric therapy should proceed concurrently with cultures when possible [^113bnrMH].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to obtain sputum cultures and then start empiric antibiotic therapy with anaerobic coverage, with clindamycin being a suitable first-line choice given the classic aspiration-lung abscess phenotype and the inadequacy of metronidazole monotherapy; bronchoscopy and drainage are reserved for nonresponse or complications, not as the initial maneuver [^111TRU1E] [^111Vs8ak] [^113bnrMH]. Therefore, the correct answer is B, sputum cultures, with the understanding that empiric therapy should follow promptly, ideally with clindamycin rather than metronidazole, and that bronchoscopic or percutaneous drainage would be considered if there is no improvement within about 72 hours or if the abscess is large, multiloculated, or complicated [^111TRU1E] [^112Q9Ffo].

---

The most appropriate next step is **sputum cultures** to identify the causative organism(s) and guide targeted antibiotic therapy [^113bnrMH]. Empiric antibiotics should cover anaerobes (e.g. clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^113bnrMH], but **metronidazole monotherapy is inadequate** because it lacks activity against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci [^113bnrMH]. Bronchoscopy is not first-line unless there is diagnostic uncertainty, obstruction, or poor response to therapy [^113bnrMH]. Early drainage is not indicated unless the abscess is large, refractory, or complicated [^112Q9Ffo].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Sputum cultures

- **Indication**: Essential to identify causative organisms, especially anaerobes, and guide targeted therapy [^notfound].
- **Rationale**: Anaerobes are common in lung abscesses, particularly in patients with alcohol use disorder and aspiration risk [^notfound].
- **Limitation**: Anaerobes are difficult to culture; however, cultures can still identify other pathogens and help tailor therapy [^notfound].

---

### Bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is **not first-line** unless there is diagnostic uncertainty, suspected obstruction, or poor response to initial therapy [^notfound]. It may be considered if sputum cultures are negative and the diagnosis remains unclear, or if there is suspicion of malignancy or foreign body [^notfound].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should **cover anaerobes** and common aerobic pathogens [^notfound]. Clindamycin is a **first-line option** because it provides effective anaerobic coverage and penetrates lung tissue well [^notfound]. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is an **alternative** that also covers anaerobes and common respiratory pathogens [^notfound]. Metronidazole monotherapy is **inadequate** because it lacks activity against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, which are common in lung abscesses [^notfound].

---

## Indications for drainage

Drainage is **not routinely indicated** initially, as most abscesses resolve with antibiotics alone [^notfound]. Consider percutaneous or surgical drainage only if:

- The abscess is large (> 6 cm) or multiloculated [^112Q9Ffo].
- There is no clinical improvement after 7–10 days of appropriate antibiotics [^notfound].
- Complications such as empyema or bronchopleural fistula occur [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Sputum cultures | Identify causative organisms and guide therapy [^notfound] |
| 2 | Empiric antibiotics (clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) | Cover anaerobes and common pathogens [^notfound] |
| 3 | Avoid metronidazole monotherapy | Inadequate coverage [^notfound] |
| 4 | Reserve bronchoscopy for diagnostic uncertainty or poor response | Not first-line [^notfound] |
| 5 | Consider drainage only if large, refractory, or complicated | Most abscesses resolve with antibiotics alone [^notfound] |

---

The most appropriate next step is to obtain **sputum cultures** and start empiric antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^notfound]. Metronidazole monotherapy is inadequate, and bronchoscopy or drainage is reserved for specific indications [^notfound].

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 57-year-old man presented to the ED with altered mental status and severe shortness of breath. He was found to be in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and required admission to the ICU. He reported the following: a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath; left-sided chest pain; cough productive of brown, foul-smelling sputum; and weight loss. He had an extensive smoking history but had quit 1 year prior. The patient was born in Ethiopia but had been living in the United States for the last 20 years. His last visit to Ethiopia was in 2009, and he denied any other recent travel or exposure to TB. There was no history to suggest immune compromise. He had not seen a physician in many years and never established medical care in the United States.

A collection of pus in the pleural space (empyema) is a dangerous condition that is usually a complication of pneumonia. Empyema can be associated with a delayed response of pneumonia to antibacterial treatment. It can lead to septicaemia, disseminated abscesses and prolonged hospitalisation. Reported mortality rates are typically 7–33%, but may exceed 50% in elderly patients or those with significant comorbidity, such as malignancy, diabetes mellitus or alcohol abuse. Here we review the management of adults with empyema.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia basics… [^116humRx]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Pneumocystispneumonia is a serious lung infection that affects people with weakened immune systems.
- PCP is airborne, spreading person-to-person, and can cause symptoms, like fever, cough, and chest pain.
- Treatment for PCP must include prescription medication.
- PCP can cause death without treatment. Overview Pneumocystis pneumonia is a rare, serious lung infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. Most people with PCP have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition, like HIV, or from medication, like corticosteroids. Symptoms The symptoms of PCP can develop over several days or weeks and include:

- Fever
- Cough
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Chills
- Fatigue. Risk factors Most people who get PCP have weakened immune systems.

Some diseases and conditions that increase risk of PCP include:

- HIV/AIDS
- Chronic lung diseases
- Cancer
- Inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases
- Solid organ or stem cell transplant The other people who get PCP are usually taking medicine that lowers the body's ability to fight germs or sickness. How it spreads PCP spreads from person to person through the air. Some healthy adults can carry the Pneumocystis fungus in their lungs without having symptoms. They can spread it to other people, including those with weakened immune systems. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent PCP. Medicine to prevent PCP are recommended for people living with HIV, stem cell transplant patients, and some solid organ transplant patients.

Healthcare providers might also prescribe medicine to prevent PCP in other patients, such as people who are taking long-term, high-dose corticosteroids. The medicine most commonly used to prevent PCP is called trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other medicines are available for people who cannot take TMP/SMX. Testing Healthcare providers test for PCP by taking a sample of mucus from the patient's lungs. Sometimes, a small sample of lung tissue is used to diagnose PCP or take a blood sample. Samples are analyzed in clinical laboratories. One method that can be used is polymerase chain reaction which detects PCP DNA. A blood test to detect β-D-glucan can also help diagnose PCP. Treatment and recovery PCP is treated with prescription medication.

The most common treatment is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a medication also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, i.e. Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. This medicine is given by mouth or through a vein for 3 weeks. TMP/SMX can cause side effects such as rash and fever. Other medications are available for patients who cannot take TMP/SMX. Note: Most fungal diseases are treated with antifungal medications. Antibiotics typically are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Unlike other fungal diseases PCP is treated with an antibiotic and antifungal medications do not work to treat it. Research There is no national surveillance for PCP in the United States. There were 10, 590 estimated U. S. hospitalizations due to Pneumocystis pneumonia in 2017. History of HIV and PCP During the 1980s, clusters of PCP were one of the first signs of the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerging in the United States.

Case Presentation

A 63-year-old man presented with a 12-month history of recurrent dyspnea, dry cough, fatigue, and weight loss. He denied chest pain, fever, or chills. Chest radiographs during those months revealed bilateral pleural effusions, and he was subjected to serial thoracenteses. Pleural fluid analyses suggested invariably a transudate, and he had received an empirical antiheart failure regimen for several months. However, his symptoms did not improve. He reported no smoking or alcohol use and his medical history was unremarkable.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1139jciq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Which factors are important to determine non-response?

The speed at which pneumonia signs and symptoms resolve is primarily influenced by host-intrinsic factors, particularly frailty. Conditions such as diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression, and end-organ disease often impair neutrophil function, as well as cell-mediated and humoral immunity, which in turn affect the rate of symptom recovery. Other factors, such as impaired cough and mucociliary clearance in COPD, malnutrition, chronic aspiration, impaired airway clearance in chronic alcoholism, certain neurological disorders, and impaired lung lymphatic drainage and pulmonary edema in heart failure, have all been associated with delayed resolution of pneumonia. Typically, patients show clinical improvement within 48-72h of therapy, but cough and fatigue can persist for up to two weeks in patients who are otherwise improving/responding (Table 1).

Other factors influencing the resolution time of pneumonia include the severity at presentation and the suspected pathogen. Severe cases, such as those with septic shock, multilobar or necrotizing pneumonia, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, generally have longer recovery times. Certain pathogens are associated with slower rates of clinical improvement. Pneumonia caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for example, responds more slowly to appropriate treatment compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Bacterial load and the presence of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and Legionella infections often have slower resolution rates compared to non-bacteremic infections.

### Lung abscess: an update on the current knowledge and call for future investigations [^113bnrMH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lung abscess is a severe and complex respiratory infection. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent publications on lung abscess, covering topics such as epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment and prevention.

Recent Findings

Risk factors associated with lung abscess include structural lung disease, poor dental hygiene, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, while concerns are now raised regarding the potential of electronic cigarettes use as a risk factor. The complexity of lung abscess is reflected by the relative high number of case reports describing rare and complex cases. Early transthoracic drainage could improve in-hospital outcomes, while next-generation sequencing could become an important tool in diagnostics and future clinical studies.

Summary

High-quality evidence and guidelines to support treatment of lung abscess are lacking. Despite advancements, we call for prospective studies to evaluate the use of invasive procedures and antibiotic treatment regimens.

Box 3
Examples to illustrate nature of deaths judged to be preventable

A female patient in her early 80s presenting with watery diarrhoea where the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease took 18 days despite a past history of the disease. The patient had deteriorated significantly before appropriate treatment was commenced and failed to respond.

A middle aged male patient who developed infection at the site of a pharyngeal pouch excision. Antibiotic treatment was continued despite a failure to improve and subsequent open drainage proved too late.

A male patient in his 60s with previous history of ischaemic heart disease and treated carcinoma of the bladder (with no evidence of progression/ recurrence) underwent an unnecessary therapeutic ascitic tap when misdiagnosed as recurrent cancer when the actual diagnosis was congestive cardiac failure. He suffered a myocardial infarction after the procedure and went into multi-organ failure.

An obese woman in her 40s who presented with malaise, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, early saity and night sweats. The diagnosis of ovarian malignancy took 21 days to confirm. On day 19 the patient's breathlessness and tachycardia were treated as a chest infection. Two days later she collapsed and subsequently died from pulmonary embolism. No risk assessment undertaken or thromboprophylaxis prescribed during stay.

A 30 year old man with a history of drug and alcohol use admitted with worsening shortness of breath and green sputum. Initially condition treated as a community acquired pneumonia until CT scan showed possible lung abscess or empyema. Patient developed clostridium difficile diarrhoea which delayed chest drainage and then went on to have a cardiac arrest when an attempt at drain insertion was subsequently made on the ward. Following transfer to the intensive care unit and drain insertion he continued to deteriorate and died.

A female patient in her 80s on warfarin for atrial fibrillation and admitted with an infected finger which had been treated with a combination of antibiotics by her general practitioner. Despite daily warfarin at a dose of 1mg being continued, the international normalised ratio (INR) was not checked until day 3, 1-day after blood was first noted in her stools. When the INR was found to be well above therapeutic levels at 10, vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma were administered with the clinical team commenting that a preferred treatment was not available at the time. Despite ongoing resuscitation she continued to deteriorate and died.

### Chronic empyema: importance of preventing complications in the management of pleural effusions [^116RquYt]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We report a case of chronic empyema in a 63-year-old man with a history of asbestos exposure and alcohol overconsumption. In 2009, he presented with dyspnoea, exudative pleurisy on the right side with no symptoms of infection or malignancy. In 2013, the patient presented with increased dyspnoea and a massive chronic empyema had evolved. Culture of the pleural fluid was positive for Escherichia coli and anaerobic bacteria, and he was treated with antibiotics, chest drainage as well as surgical evacuation. After surgery, as the lung failed to expand, growth of opportunistic bacteria and rising C reactive protein obliged long-time treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as chest drainage with daily saline flushes. The patient still suffers from fatigue, poor nutritional status and anaemia, and further treatment with chest drainage and antibiotics is planned. Advanced chronic empyema is a difficult condition with poor response to treatment, and diagnostic delay is the main cause of complications.

### Prognostic factors of lung abscess: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^116fdDKB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abscess size and multiloculation were identified as potential prognostic factors of lung abscesses. Evaluating these factors at diagnosis may enable the early identification of high-risk cases and formulation of appropriate treatment strategies. Further multicenter and prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and enhance risk stratification in lung abscess management.

### A practical guide to the diagnosis and management of suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in the United Kingdom [^116TxYuq]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

In addition to the risk factors and patient characteristics outlined above, those active in primary and secondary care settings should be aware of the symptoms associated with NTM infection. Symptoms of NTM-PD are frequently respiratory but usually non-specific and shared by patients with co-morbid conditions such as COPD and bronchiectasis, especially with increasing age and advanced disease. Chronic cough, usually productive of sputum (occurring almost every day in 25% and 44% of patients respectively in one study), and shortness of breath are the commonest symptoms, with non-respiratory symptoms including lethargy, fatigue, anorexia, and malaise. Additional symptoms may include weight loss, haemoptysis, chest pains, sweats, and fever.

It is particularly important to consider NTM in patients with systemic symptoms and pre-existing lung disease. Radiological features in CT scans may suggest NTM infection and typically include cavities, nodules, and 'tree-in-bud' appearances reflecting small airway involvement through 'exudative bronchiolitis'. However, these changes are not diagnostic or specific, and NTM-related imaging is a complex area with significant variation in interpretation. In a cohort of patients with bronchiectasis and NTM-PD, there was a higher prevalence of bronchiectasis in the middle lobes, and CT patterns differed from those patients with only bronchiectasis. Older female patients with higher Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scores and bilateral lingula and middle lobe involvement are more likely to have bronchiectasis and NTM-PD. Plain chest x-rays are unlikely to be diagnostic in themselves with only non-specific features visible, if at all. However, they may detect cavities which should raise suspicion of NTM and prompt urgent onward referral. Given their value, chest x-rays would always be recommended in patients with suspected NTM infection.

### Epidemiology and clinical patterns of lung abscesses in ICU: a French multicenter retrospective study [^112QwZKu]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Data are scarce regarding epidemiology and management of critically ill patients with lung abscesses.

Research Question

What are the clinical and microbiological characteristics of critically ill patients with lung abscesses, how are they managed in the ICU, and what are the risk factors of in-ICU mortality?

Study Design and Methods

This was a retrospective observational multicenter study, based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes, between 2015 and 2022 in France. In-ICU mortality-associated factors were determined by multivariate logistic regression.

Results

We analyzed 171 ICU patients with pulmonary abscesses. Seventy-eight percent were male, with a mean age of 56.5 ± 16.4 years; 20.4% misused alcohol, 25.2% had a chronic lung disease (14% COPD), and 20.5% had a history of cancer. Overall, 40.9% were immunocompromised and 38% qualified for nosocomial infection. Presenting symptoms included fatigue or weight loss in 62%, fever (50.3%), and dyspnea (47.4%). Hemoptysis was reported in 21.7%. A polymicrobial infection was present in 35.6%. The most frequent pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae in 31%, Staphylococcus aureus in 22%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 19.3%. Fungal infections were found in 10.5%. Several clusters of clinicoradiologic patterns were associated with specific microbiological documentation and could guide empiric antibiotic regimen. Percutaneous abscess drainage was performed in 11.7%; surgery was performed in 12.7%, and 12% required bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis. In-ICU mortality was 21.5%, and age (OR: 1.05 [1.02–1.91], P = 0.007], renal replacement therapy during ICU stay (OR, 3.56 [1.24–10.57], P = 0.019), and fungal infection (OR, 9.12 [2.69–34.5], P = 0.0006) were independent predictors of mortality after multivariate logistic regression, and drainage or surgery were not.

Interpretation

Pulmonary abscesses in the ICU are a rare but severe disease often resulting from a polymicrobial infection, with a high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae, S aureus, and P aeruginosa. Percutaneous drainage, surgery, or arterial embolization was required in more than one-third of cases. Further prospective studies focusing on first-line antimicrobial therapy and source control procedure are warranted to improve and standardize patient management.

### Pharyngitis in an immunocompetent 40-year-old man [^113qdYs8]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 40-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with a constellation of systemic symptoms and new biofilm forming along his upper airway. He had brought home a deer 10 days prior from a day of hunting, and discovered green purulent material oozing from the entrance/exit wounds. The patient smokes cigarettes and did not use any protective equipment or wash his hands between dressing the deer and smoking. Several days following exposure, he became increasingly short of breath, fatigued, constipated and developed a cough productive of orange sputum. Speaking with state wildlife biologists led to the diagnosis of a zoonotic Trueperella pyogenes infection. Initial treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics was ineffective in resolving the infection. An infectious disease appointment was made, but the patient's infection resolved with the use of a veterinarian antibiotic taken under physician's supervision.

Summary of recommendations and good practice points

Section 4: What is the evidence for transmission of NTM between individuals?

Recommendation

Adequate infection control policies need to be implemented in both inpatient and outpatient settings to minimise risks of person-to-person transmission of Mycobacterium abscessus in individuals with cystic fibrosis (grade B).

Section 5: How should the lung disease attributable to NTM infection be defined?

Recommendation

In the absence of robust evidence to support an alternative definition and due to the clinical and research benefits of having a uniform definition, use of the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) 2007 definition of NTM-PD is recommended (box 1) (grade D).

Box 1
Clinical and microbiological criteria for diagnosing non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (modified with permission from reference)

Good practice point

The management of coexisting lung conditions/infections should be optimised before ascribing clinical decline to NTM-PD.

Section 6: What samples should be used to detect pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection?

Recommendations

Sputum, induced sputum, bronchial washings, bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy samples can be used to evaluate individuals suspected to have NTM-PD (grade D).
Whenever possible, less invasive sampling should be attempted first to minimise procedural risks (grade D).
Respiratory samples should be processed within 24 hours of collection (or refrigerated at 4°C if delays are anticipated) (grade D).
Oropharyngeal swab culture or serology testing should not be used to diagnose NTM-PD (grade D).

Good practice points

Respiratory specimens should be collected with appropriate infection control precautions, including personal protective equipment, given the frequent differential diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
If sputum cultures are negative but clinical suspicion of NTM infection is high, consider performing CT-directed bronchial washings to obtain targeted samples.
If individuals undergoing diagnostic evaluation for NTM infection are taking antibiotics that may impair NTM growth (such as aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, cotrimoxazole, linezolid), consider discontinuing these antibiotics 2 weeks prior to collecting samples.

Section 16: What is the role of surgery in the treatment of NTM-PD?

Recommendations

The role of lung resection surgery in the management of NTM-PD should be considered at the time of diagnosis and revisited in individuals who develop refractory disease (grade D).
Lung resection surgery for NTM-PD may be indicated in individuals with localised areas of severe disease (grade D).
Lung resection surgery for NTM-PD should only be performed following expert multidisciplinary assessment in a centre experienced in managing individuals with NTM-PD (grade D).
Individuals with NTM-PD should be established on antibiotic treatment prior to lung resection surgery and should continue treatment for 12 months after culture conversion (grade D).
Following resection of a solitary NTM nodule in an individual with no other features of NTM-PD, antibiotic treatment is not usually required (grade D).

Good practice points

Individuals with NTM-PD in whom lung resection surgery is being considered should have a comprehensive assessment of cardiopulmonary status in line with current guidance for lung cancer resection.
Nutritional status should be optimised prior to lung resection surgery.

Section 17: Does NTM infection affect an individual's suitability for lung transplantation?

Recommendations

Individuals being considered for lung transplantation referral should be assessed for evidence of NTM-PD(grade D).
Isolation of NTM organisms including M. abscessus in potential lung transplant candidates should not preclude referral and assessment for lung transplantation (grade D).
Potential lung transplant candidates with evidence of NTM-PD should be treated whenever possible prior to listing to either eradicate the organism or lower bacterial load (grade D).
Individuals with previous or current M. abscessus infection or disease who are listed for lung transplantation should be counselled about the high postoperative risk of developing invasive and disseminated NTM disease which causes significant morbidity and necessitates prolonged treatment with a multidrug antibiotic regimen (grade D).

Good practice points

Individuals with NTM-PD should demonstrate an ability to tolerate optimal antibiotic therapy before listing for lung transplantation.
Progressive NTM-PD despite optimal antibiotic therapy is likely to be a contraindication to listing for lung transplantation.

### Lung abscess: clinical characteristics of 222 Danish patients diagnosed from 2016 to 2021 [^112rJj8h]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung abscess (LA) is a serious respiratory infection often followed by several weeks of antibiotic treatment. This study described the clinical presentation of LA, treatment duration and mortality in a contemporary Danish population.

Methods

In a retrospective multicenter cohort study at four Danish hospitals, patients diagnosed with LA were identified using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision (ICD-10) between 2016 and 2021. A predefined data collection tool was used to extract data on demographics, symptoms, clinical findings and treatment.

Results

Of 302 patients, 222 with LA were included after review of patient records (76%). Mean age was 65 years (54–74), 62.9% was male and 74.9% were ever-smokers. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (35.1%), use of sedatives (29.3%) and alcohol abuse (21.8%) were common risk factors. Dental status was reported in 51.4%, whereof 41.6% had poor dental status. Patients presented with cough (78.8%), malaise (61.3%) and fever (56.8%) Patients were hospitalized for a median of 14 days (interquartile ranges, IQR 7–21) and median duration of antibiotic treatment was 38 days (IQR 30–51). All-cause mortality after 1, 3 and 12 months was 2.7%, 7.7% and 15.8%, respectively.

Conclusion

Risk factors for LA include COPD and use of sedatives, alcohol abuse, and poor dental status. Despite long-term antibiotic treatment, long-term mortality is markedly high.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^116PyQWB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation — when to suspect bronchiectasis

A 66-year-old lady presents with a chest infection associated with cough productive of green sputum and increasing shortness of breath. She had never smoked and has no relevant past medical history. Chest x-ray shows no abnormality. She is treated with antibiotic therapy by her primary care physician and improves. She attends again a few months later with worsening productive cough. Her primary care physician notes that she has had several courses of antibiotics for chest infections over the previous 3 winters and has reported a chronic productive cough on a daily basis for the past 3 years.

In new patients or those that do not have an established diagnosis, one of the most common core symptoms is a persistent cough (> 90% of patients), often producing large quantities of mucoid (white or clear) or purulent (dark yellow, green or brown) sputum(Table 2). Adults may have a history of symptoms over many years. Recurrent respiratory tract infections also raise the possibility of bronchiectasis, and patients may take a long time to recover from chest infections or require multiple courses of antibiotics before symptoms fully resolve. Dyspnoea is present in a high proportion of cases, with frequent haemoptysis in severe disease. These symptoms can be variable across patients, with some having symptoms daily and others only having symptoms during exacerbations. The longstanding textbook teaching of bronchiectasis patients with widespread crackles, digital clubbing and cachexia is now rarely seen.

### Unusual case of a giant lung abscess initially misdiagnosed and treated as an empyema [^114pB9ZV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We report the case of a 66-year-old man with dental infection who presented to our emergency department complaining of a 3-month medical history of chest pain and productive cough, in association with malaise, fever, weight loss and anaemia. His chest radiograph showed a nearly total opacification of the right hemithorax and chest ultrasound findings were suggestive of empyema, subsequently confirmed by a chest CT. The patient started appropriate treatment. A follow-up chest CT performed to rule out bronchopleural fistula revealed a large lung abscess. The patient had the final diagnosis of a giant lung abscess, which was initially thought to be an empyema because of the clinical and radiologic similarities with this entity. The initial misdiagnosis led to prompt percutaneous drainage of the lung abscess in addition to antibiotherapy and respiratory physiotherapy with a good final outcome, which suggests the efficacy of this approach in similar cases.

Immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP) — diagnostic criteria and imaging: Clinical signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, and hypoxemia should prompt evaluation with chest imaging, but these signs are not always present in immunocompromised hosts. Radiographic abnormalities are required for a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia, and given multiple nonpulmonary causes in this population, findings consistent with an infection on imaging must be present for ICHP diagnosis. In immunocompromised hosts, lung infiltrates may not be evident by chest X-ray and may require a computed tomography scan for detection, and noninfectious pulmonary conditions must be distinguished from infection; immunocompromised hosts may have concurrent infectious and noninfectious etiologies of lung infiltrates.

### Chronic lung sepsis: lung abscess, bronchiectasis, and empyema [^1112K7hy]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic lung infections including lung abscess, bronchiectasis, and empyema remain serious medical diseases despite the availability of antimicrobial agents. Recent publications contribute to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and management of these entities. The microbial pathogen of lung abscess may be different comparing immunocompetent with immunocompromised patients, supporting a concept for aggressive diagnostic investigations and targeting of specific potential pathogens. The use of surgery in bronchiectasis may be declining, but surgical intervention remains an important strategy with favorable outcomes, especially in cases of focal bronchiectasis. For empyema, maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion may allow for diagnostic thoracentesis in patients with pleural effusions and allow initiation of appropriate tube thoracotomy drainage and use of fibrinolytics. With appropriate management, morbidity and mortality may be limited and outcomes generally favorable.

CHEST grading system — strong recommendations (1A–1C) define benefit–risk balance, evidence quality, and implications as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) has "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B) uses the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C) retains the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances.

A 25-year-old black man presented with left-sided chest pain and cough for 3 days. His pain was pressure-like and nonradiating and was aggravated with movement and relieved when the patient lay at a 45° angle. The patient denied fevers, chills, night sweats, and swelling but reported gaining 4 to 6 kg (10 to 15 lbs) in the past few months. His cough had started 2 weeks prior with yellow mucus production but he denied facial swelling or tenderness. He had no chronic medical conditions and was not taking medications.

### Lung abscess due to aspiration of seawater during recreational free diving [^112zcoNi]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough persisting for 5 wk, low-grade fever, and thick, pinkish to reddish, foul-tasting sputum made the doctors seeing this patient think of tuberculosis at first. However, a history of aspirating seawater during recreational free diving gave a clearer picture of how this patient got sick. Investigations later revealed a cavitary lesion in the right lung, and sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in a diagnosis of lung abscess. This case is being reported to show this peculiar way that a bacterial pathogen entered the respiratory tree and that recreational free diving poses a health risk if done in a marine environment where this "survivor bacteria" thrives.

### Surgical management of a COVID-19-associated necrotic pneumonia [^111EwTaP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 47-year-old man presented to hospital with symptoms typical of COVID-19 infection. Symptoms were ongoing for 2 days (fever, sweats, cough and shortness of breath). Nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray (CXR) demonstrated right basal atelectasis (figure 1). Inpatient duration was 3 weeks during which time 2 days of ventilatory support were required in the form of continuous positive airway pressure. Cardiovascular inotropic support was not required. The patient was treated with dexamethasone as part of the recovery trial (study ID 50189673) and discharged after a 3-week period.

Figure 1
CXR at index admission. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Chest radiograph demonstrated right basal atelectasis. CXR, chest X-ray.

Two weeks following his original admission, he represented with chest pain and shortness of breath at which point his COVID-19 tests were negative. CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed a large left hydropneumothorax. Air fluid levels were seen in the collection which comprised the entirety of the left lower pleural cavity. The imaging did not clearly delineate between the left lower lobe/fluid collection and so the differential between parenchymal abscess, necrotic lung and empyema was unclear. The right lung demonstrated patchy basal consolidation and a small air fluid collection consistent with COVID-19 infection (figure 2). Empirical antimicrobial therapy in the form of clarithromycin and piperacillin/tazobactam was commenced at the referring hospital. Antibiotics were escalated to meropenem on transfer to the regional thoracic centre. An intercostal drain was inserted with an anterior approach, using Seldinger principles. Pleural fluid sampling demonstrated a pH of 7.1 indicative of infection. Microbiology cultures were reported negative but the patient was on broad spectrum antibiotics prior to sampling. However, this intervention failed to drain the pleural cavity (online supplemental figure 1).

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114rmk98]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Cough guideline methodology — PICO refinement, literature searches, and quality assessments are outlined as follows: Each topic-specific committee drafted key clinical questions that a frontline clinician and consumer representative agreed would provide important guidance, and with a methodologist these key questions were formulated to examine descriptors of the relevant PICO; these PICO elements then informed the search strategies, including synonyms, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for study screening and acceptance. Searches were conducted in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network Library, with additional searches for published systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library; when no reasonable quality systematic reviews were identified, primary literature searches were conducted in at least two databases using the predefined search strategies, and Medline and the Cochrane Library were always searched for relevant English language studies and, depending on the topic, other databases (eg, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Identified English-language articles were initially screened by title and abstract, using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by full-text screening of qualified articles; search strategies are available upon request at science@chestnet.org, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferentially assessed using DART, which was adopted in 2011 for CHEST guidelines and consensus statements; quality was assessed for individual studies and the body of relevant evidence, with randomized controlled trials primarily indicating benefits and observational studies helpful in identifying harms and examined when RCTs were not available.

### Lung abscess following a foreign body extraction [^112Q9Ffo]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Lung abscesses are uncommon in the paediatric population, often manifesting with cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and fever. A high index of suspicion is imperative to prevent delays in treatment. This is a case report of a previously healthy child in early childhood with a 5-month history of recurrent left upper lobe (LUL) pneumonia. A foreign body was identified in the LUL and removed via flexible bronchoscopy. Following the foreign body removal, the patient developed a 9cm lung abscess. A high index of suspicion for a lung abscess post-foreign body removal is important for early diagnosis and ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage in patients with persistent fever. Intravenous antibiotics are essential in the management of lung abscesses. Consideration should be given to percutaneous drainage in situations where there is minimal improvement after 72 hours of suitable antimicrobial therapy or when the abscess exceeds 6cm in size.

### Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: patients, principles, and prospects [^1125pGiW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) is increasing in incidence globally and challenging to manage. The 2020 multisociety treatment guideline and the 2022 consensus recommendations provide comprehensive evidence-based guides to manage pulmonary diseases caused by the most common NTM. However, with > 190 different NTM species that may require different multidrug regimens for treatment, the breadth and complexity of NTM-PD remain daunting for both patients and clinicians. In this narrative review, we aim to distill this broad, complex field into principles applicable to most NTM species and highlight important nuances, specifically elaborating on the presentation, diagnosis, principles of patient-centered care, principles of pathogen-directed therapy, and prospects of NTM-PD.

PRESENTING FEATURES: A 53-year-old man who had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a 3-month history of increasing dysphagia, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and an episode of syncope. His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 × 10³/µL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/µL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD₄ count of 8 cells/mm³ and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO₂ of 33 mm Hg, and a PO₂ of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Induced sputum was negative for Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, or acid-fast bacilli. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. What is the diagnosis?

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112cKeqV]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus infection [^114JLSi5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium abscessus infections are challenging to treat because multidrug resistance necessitates prolonged intravenous (IV) therapy and side effects are perceived to be common. For the best chance of pulmonary disease cure, guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) recommend multidrug macrolide-based therapy based on susceptibility testing results and surgical resection. However, these guidelines also state that there are no drug combinations with proven efficacy. Similarly for extrapulmonary disease, macrolide-based treatment regimens based on susceptibility testing results are recommended. Inducible macrolide resistance in many strains of M. abscessus further complicates treatment. Given the lack of evidence-based therapies, we hypothesized that treatment regimens have no clear pattern and that medication changes and toxicities occur frequently.

CHEST/ACCP cough guideline methodology — consensus thresholds, review, dissemination, and updating are described: Up to three rounds were permitted for each suggestion until consensus was achieved, with the 80% threshold for "agree" or "strongly agree" prevailing and at least 75% of the panel required to vote; suggestions not obtaining consensus, even after three rounds were not published. Members from the CHEST Board of Regents and GOC reviewed content and methods, the CHEST journal peer review process overlapped with these reviews, and modification requests were tracked; the CHEST Presidential line of succession provided the final approval allowing submission to the journal. After publication, the guidelines were promoted to a wide audience through multiple avenues. CHEST guidelines and consensus statements are living documents with annual reviews beginning 1 year after publication, and the long-term goal is to maintain the currency of the guidance documents; unless otherwise stated, these guidance documents meet all of the standards of the Institute of Medicine for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111XZfkL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida isolated from the respiratory tract — antifungal treatment guidance and diagnostic notes: Growth of Candida from respiratory secretions usually indicates colonization and rarely requires treatment with antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Isolation from the respiratory tract is commonly encountered in ICU or tracheostomy patients and almost always reflects colonization of the airways and not infection. Candida pneumonia and lung abscess are very uncommon, and only rarely after aspiration of oropharyngeal material has primary Candida pneumonia or abscess been documented. When Candida is isolated from respiratory samples in a severely immunosuppressed patient, this should trigger a search for evidence of invasive candidiasis. Although isolation from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen can support the diagnosis, a firm diagnosis requires histopathological evidence of invasive disease.

### Modern history of surgical management of lung abscess: from harold neuhof to current concepts [^114T3byR]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Harold Neuhof was one of the pioneers of thoracic surgery in the early decades of the last century. Inspired by his preceptor Howard Lilienthal he proposed an entirely new concept for surgery on acute lung abscess. The aim of his one-stage procedure was adequate drainage of the abscess cavity. His approach proved to be the first major breakthrough in the treatment of acute lung abscess. Therapy of pulmonary abscess was again radically changed by the advent of antibiotics in the late 1940s. However, the basic principles of Neuhof's concept still influence modern-day management of putrid lung abscess.

### Coinfection of COVID-19 and tuberculosis in Uganda [^114a1sSj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

As of June 2022, 37 patients with pulmonary TB confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) had been enrolled, and out of these 11 (29.7%) had a positive test for COVID-19. Two of the COVID-19-positive individuals were also HIV infected. Only three patients of the 11 were hospitalized whereas the remaining eight were managed with home-based care. The main symptoms and laboratory values are shown in Table 1. Those admitted had unstable vital signs, and their chest X-rays are shown in Figure 1. One of the admitted patients, an 18-year-old male, was transferred from the COVID-19 treatment center to the TB unit. Having spent 10 days in the COVID-19 treatment center, the diagnosis of TB was suspected based on persistent fevers, cough, and worsening difficulty in breathing on a background of advanced HIV disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was identified in his sputum using Xpert Ultra. This patient died after 2 days of admission to the TB unit. Due to the nature and clinical presentation of the disease, COVID-19 was diagnosed first in this patient and TB was diagnosed later through radiography and Xpert Ultra due to persistent symptoms. The second admitted patient, a 40-year-old male who was HIV negative, developed difficulty in breathing but died shortly after being initiated with a high flow of oxygen. The circumstances surrounding his death were not clear and no autopsy studies were done. The third admitted patient, a 28-year-old male of Asian descent, presented with fevers, weight loss, and difficulty in breathing. He improved on antibiotics and oxygen and was still in the hospital after 14 days of admission. None of the three critically ill patients had any other chronic medical conditions apart from the patient who had advanced HIV disease. Overall, four patients had a history of smoking and only two of the 11 had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48-72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.
