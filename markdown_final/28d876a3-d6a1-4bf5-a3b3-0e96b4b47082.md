## Question

what is percentage of weight lost with orlistat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of weight loss can be achieved with orlistat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether to report absolute weight loss versus placebo-subtracted net effect. Then, I should verify the best quality evidence and extract percent changes at one year and longer. Next, I will check dose-response and translate kilogram differences into percentages when needed. Finally, I should synthesize a clinically useful range and sanity-check it against guidelines and real-world data [^112SPp4Y] [^111UtTtJ].

> Let me first confirm the outcome metric so I do not mix definitions. The question is about "percentage of weight lost", which could refer to absolute percent loss from baseline or placebo-subtracted percent loss that isolates the drug's effect beyond lifestyle therapy. Hold on, I should verify what is most clinically informative. For medication effects, clinicians often communicate placebo-subtracted loss at one year, while noting that 5% total loss is typically regarded as the threshold for clinical benefit in obesity treatment programs, so I will emphasize the net placebo-subtracted effect and also provide the absolute total expected loss with lifestyle plus orlistat for context [^113eN4oS].

> Next, I should review the highest quality evidence. I need to check meta-analyses and large randomized controlled trials with one-year data and beyond. The BMJ 2014 meta-analysis of pharmacologic maintenance trials, the XENDOS four-year RCT, and the Lancet 2022 network meta-analysis provide robust anchors. I will also examine a representative one-year diabetes trial that reports percentage changes directly to minimize assumptions during conversion from kilograms to percentage [^112SPp4Y] [^1134tCF5] [^111UtTtJ] [^116ie8Ao].

> I will now examine direct percentage data where available to avoid unnecessary conversions. In a 48-week randomized trial in type 2 diabetes, orlistat 120 mg three times daily produced −5.4% weight change versus −3.6% on placebo, which is a placebo-subtracted net effect of about 1.8%. Wait, let me verify that I am quoting percent of initial body weight, not BMI. Yes, these are percentages of baseline body weight, so the additional drug effect is approximately 2% at one year in that diabetic cohort. A general clinical review has also summarized that orlistat yields approximately 3% of initial weight loss versus placebo at one year, which aligns with the 2–3% pattern I expect in mixed populations [^116ie8Ao] [^113wHne6].

> Where only kilogram differences are reported, I need to convert to percent carefully. The BMJ 2014 meta-analysis found a mean difference at 12 months of −2.34 kg for the 120 mg dose versus placebo in maintenance settings, which corresponds to roughly a 2% net effect if baseline weight is around 100–110 kg. Hold on, let me double-check plausibility. If baseline is near 100 kg, 2.34 kg is 2.3%. If baseline is 107 kg, it is about 2.2%. That is consistent with the 2–3% net effect range. The older BMJ 2007 meta-analysis found a −2.9 kg placebo-subtracted difference, which similarly maps to about 2–3% depending on baseline weight distribution across trials [^112SPp4Y] [^112DExf6].

> I should confirm the long-term anchor in XENDOS and make sure I do not over-generalize. At one year in XENDOS, orlistat achieved 10.6 kg loss vs 6.2 kg with placebo, which is a 4.4 kg net difference. Initially, I thought that implied a routine 4–5% net effect. Hmm, wait a minute, that may be trial-specific. If baseline was about 105–110 kg, the net effect would be around 4%. At four years the net difference was 2.8 kg, which is about 2–3% on typical baselines, showing attenuation over time. So, the 1-year XENDOS result is on the higher end and the multi-year effect settles nearer 2–3% net, consistent with meta-analytic estimates. I should not let the intensive lifestyle run-in of XENDOS bias my overall estimate upward [^1134tCF5].

> Next, I should review dose-response because the effective dose matters. Wait, let me verify the subgroup results. The BMJ 2014 analysis shows a clear dose-response, with the 120 mg three times daily dose producing a significant mean difference of −2.34 kg versus placebo and lower doses showing a smaller, non-significant effect. That supports using 120 mg three times daily as the standard dose when estimating expected percent weight loss due to the drug [^112SPp4Y].

> I need to synthesize across sources and make sure the message is consistent. Conventional orlistat at 120 mg three times daily produces a placebo-subtracted weight loss of about 2–3% of initial body weight at one year across meta-analyses and large RCTs. Absolute total loss with lifestyle plus orlistat is often in the 5–8% range at one year, recognizing that the lifestyle component accounts for much of the absolute loss and the drug adds roughly 2–3% on top. Over several years the net effect tends to attenuate toward the 2% range. Let me double-check congruence with contemporary summaries. Modern obesity trials and network meta-analyses consistently place orlistat's relative efficacy in this modest band, and recent trials of modified-release combinations explicitly cite 2–3% as the conventional orlistat benchmark, which triangulates well with these estimates [^112SPp4Y] [^112DExf6] [^116VhGW2] [^111UtTtJ].

> To make this concrete, I should provide an example and sanity-check the math. For a typical 100 kg adult starting orlistat 120 mg three times daily with diet and activity counseling, the expected additional placebo-subtracted loss is about 2–3 kg at one year. Total loss including lifestyle is commonly around 5–8 kg. If I express uncertainty using meta-analytic bounds, a reasonable range for the net effect is roughly 2% with a plausible interval of about 1.8–3.2% depending on baseline weight, adherence, and analytic approach. That remains consistent with the cited pooled kilogram differences and percent differences across trials [^112SPp4Y] [^112DExf6].

> But wait, what about real-world effectiveness and guidance that might temper expectations. I need to check observational data and guidelines. Real-world primary care cohorts often show lower effectiveness and poorer persistence with orlistat compared with GLP-1 agents, which means the practical percentage may be smaller outside trials. In addition, contemporary guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association recommend avoiding orlistat in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications, largely due to modest efficacy and tolerability concerns, including gastrointestinal side effects and fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption risk, which I should acknowledge when counseling patients about expected weight loss percentages [^116ryJMH] [^114X9pnc] [^115M8PZ9].

> Bottom line, after reconciling randomized trials and meta-analyses and correcting my initial inclination to over-weight the higher one-year XENDOS estimate, orlistat 120 mg three times daily yields a placebo-subtracted weight loss of approximately 2–3% of initial body weight at one year, with total absolute loss including lifestyle typically around 5–8% at one year and attenuation of the net drug effect toward about 2% over multi-year follow-up [^112SPp4Y] [^1134tCF5] [^116VhGW2] [^112DExf6] [^116ie8Ao] [^113wHne6].

Orlistat produces a modest weight loss of **about 3% of initial body weight** [^113wHne6] over 1 year [^1118GtMZ], with 35–73% of patients achieving ≥ 5% weight loss and 16–36% achieving ≥ 10% [^112DExf6]. The placebo-subtracted weight loss is 2.3–2.9 kg [^112DExf6] [^1118GtMZ], and long-term maintenance is limited by gastrointestinal side effects [^113c5PTP] and adherence [^112SPp4Y].

## Percentage of weight loss with orlistat

- **Mean percentage weight loss**: Orlistat produces a mean weight loss of approximately 3% of initial body weight [^113wHne6] over 1 year [^1118GtMZ].

- **Placebo-subtracted weight loss**: The placebo-subtracted weight loss with orlistat is approximately 2.3–2.9 kg [^112DExf6] over 1 year [^111TGBSw].

- **Clinically significant weight loss**: Orlistat increases the likelihood of achieving clinically significant weight loss (≥ 5% of initial body weight) [^112DExf6] compared to placebo [^113c5PTP].

---

## Proportion of patients achieving clinically significant weight loss

Approximately 35–73% of patients treated with orlistat achieve **≥ 5% weight loss** over 1 year [^113wHne6]. Additionally, **16–36%** achieve ≥ 10% weight loss over 1 year [^113wHne6] [^112DExf6].

---

## Long-term weight loss maintenance

Long-term weight loss maintenance with orlistat is limited [^112SPp4Y], with **significant weight regain** observed after therapy is discontinued [^116DT5e3]. Adherence is often limited by **gastrointestinal side effects** [^112SPp4Y], which can impact long-term maintenance [^113c5PTP].

### Long term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight: Updated meta-analysis [^112DExf6]. BMJ (2007). Low credibility.

This study aims to summarize the long-term efficacy of anti-obesity drugs in reducing weight and improving health status. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials was conducted. The data sources included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane controlled trials register, the Science meta-register of controlled trials, and reference lists of identified articles. Searches were performed from December 2002, the end date of the last search, to December 2006.

The review focused on double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of approved anti-obesity drugs used in adults (over 18 years old) for one year or longer. A total of 30 trials, each lasting between one to four years, met the inclusion criteria. These included 16 trials on orlistat (n = 10,631 participants), 10 on sibutramine (n = 2,623), and four on rimonabant (n = 6,365). Of these, 14 trials were new, while 16 had previously been identified. Attrition rates averaged between 30–40%.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval 2.5 kg to 3.2 kg), sibutramine by 4.2 kg (3.6 kg to 4.7 kg), and rimonabant by 4.7 kg (4.1 kg to 5.3 kg). Patients receiving active drug treatment were significantly more likely to achieve 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds. Orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes. However, it increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered concentrations of high-density lipoprotein. Sibutramine improved concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides.

Pharmacological interventions

At 12 months, four pharmacological intervention studies including eight comparisons examined the effects of orlistat combined with lifestyle change compared with placebo and lifestyle change. The overall mean difference was −1.80 kg (95% confidence interval −2.54 to −1.06 kg; I² = 34%) [fig 4]. Subgroup analyses by dose of orlistat (120 mg vs. 60/30 mg three times daily) showed a dose-response relation, with studies that used 120 mg of orlistat displaying a mean difference of −2.34 kg (−3.03 to −1.65 kg, I² = 0%) compared with −0.70 kg (−1.92 to 0.52 kg; I² = 13%) in studies that used a 60/30 mg dose. The treatment effect was significantly greater in the subgroup of studies that used a 120 mg dose of orlistat (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.02; I² = 81%).

- **Figure 4 description**: Mean difference in weight change at 12 months after initial weight loss in pharmacological intervention studies. O120 = orlistat 120 mg 3 times daily; O60 = orlistat 60 mg 3 times daily; O30 = orlistat 30 mg 3 times daily; OO v OP = comparison between groups who lost weight using orlistat 120 mg and low energy diet for 1 year followed by randomization to continued orlistat 120 mg treatment or placebo condition; PO v PP = comparison between groups who lost weight using placebo and low energy diet for 1 year followed by randomization to continued orlistat 120 mg treatment or placebo condition.

One study testing the 120 mg dose provided long-term follow-up at 18 and 36 months, with mean differences of −2.10 kg (95% confidence interval −4.09 to −0.11 kg) and −2.20 kg (−4.01 to −0.39 kg), respectively.

### Long-term drug treatment for obesity: A systematic and clinical review [^113wHne6]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Thirty-six percent of US adults are obese, and many cannot lose sufficient weight to improve health with lifestyle interventions alone. This research aims to conduct a systematic review of medications currently approved in the United States for obesity treatment in adults. It also discusses the off-label use of medications studied for obesity and provides considerations for obesity medication use in clinical practice.

A PubMed search from inception through September 2013 was performed to find meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials for currently approved obesity medications lasting at least one year. The studies focused on those with a primary or secondary outcome of body weight change, included at least 50 participants per group, reported at least 50% retention, and presented results on an intention-to-treat basis. Studies of medications approved for other purposes but tested for obesity treatment were also reviewed.

Findings reveal that obesity medications approved for long-term use, when prescribed with lifestyle interventions, lead to additional weight loss relative to placebo, ranging from approximately 3% of initial weight for orlistat and lorcaserin to 9% for top-dose (15/92 mg) phentermine plus topiramate-extended release at one year. The proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful (at least 5%) weight loss ranges from 37% to 47% for lorcaserin, 35% to 73% for orlistat, and 67% to 70% for top-dose phentermine plus topiramate-extended release. All three medications produce greater improvements in many cardiometabolic risk factors than placebo.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: Moving towards efficacy improvement [^115X4Ebb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

The SCALE (Satiety and Clinical Adiposity — Liraglutide Evidence) program comprises four phase 3a clinical trials that evaluated the use of liraglutide and weight loss in individuals with and without diabetes. A double-blind RCT evaluated liraglutide 3.0 mg in the treatment of obesity for 20 weeks (n = 564), with a two-year extension open-label period (n = 268). Liraglutide showed superior weight loss over orlistat and placebo, decreasing body fat by 15.4% and lean mass by 2% after 20 weeks of treatment. Moreover, it resulted in sustained weight loss, as > 85% of the patients with > 5% body-weight loss in the first year maintained that loss in the second year. The mean weight loss with liraglutide was 10.3 ± 7.1 kg over the two-year follow-up.

Another RCT (n = 3,731) with 56 weeks of treatment showed similar results, with liraglutide being superior to placebo in achieving 5% and 10% weight loss. In patients with obesity and T2DM (n = 846), the use of liraglutide 3.0 mg for 56 weeks, combined with a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and increased physical activity, yielded a mean weight loss of 6.0% versus 2.0% for those using a placebo. To evaluate the efficacy of liraglutide after weight loss, 422 patients randomly received either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo for 54 weeks after losing ≥ 5% body weight with a low-calorie diet (1200–1400 kcal/day) and regular physical exercise. The additional mean weight loss with liraglutide was 6.2% versus 0.2% with placebo (p < 0.0001). None of the trials reported weight loss greater than 20%.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113XkuhC]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel, oral, modified-release formulation of the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the glucosidase/amylase inhibitor acarbose (denoted EMP16) on relative body weight after 26 weeks compared with placebo.

- **Methods**: The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had a 26-week treatment period, with dose escalation up to 6 weeks. Participants, adults between ages 18 and 75 years, with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 28 kg/m² with risk factors, were randomly assigned to EMP16 120-mg orlistat/40-mg acarbose (EMP16–120/40), EMP16–150/50, or placebo. The primary endpoint was relative weight loss from baseline to week 26, assessed in participants with at least one post-baseline weight measurement.

- **Results**: Of 156 randomized participants, 149 constituted the intention-to-treat population. The mean (95% CI) estimated treatment difference to placebo in relative weight loss after 26 weeks in the intention-to-treat population was −4.70% (−6.16% to −3.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–120/40 and −5.42% (−6.60% to −4.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–150/50.

- **Conclusions**: This trial indicates that orlistat and acarbose can be successfully combined in a modified-release formulation to provide efficacious weight loss with no unexpected safety issues. EMP16 may be a promising candidate among other medications for improved weight management.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolism [^113eN4oS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Weight change from baseline is the primary efficacy endpoint in placebo-controlled trials for obesity drugs, and the guidance specifies that weight loss should be demonstrated over the course of at least one-year duration. The goals of weight loss in obesity management are to prevent or slow the progression of obesity-related health outcomes and improve quality of life. Weight loss of 5 percent — evaluated as mean change from baseline and in a categorical analysis of the proportion of patients losing 5 percent body weight — is generally considered clinically meaningful in patients with obesity, as it has been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic biomarkers such as blood pressure, lipids, and fasting glucose.

There are currently five drugs that are FDA-approved for chronic weight management in patients with obesity: orlistat (gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor), lorcaserin (serotonin 2C receptor agonist), phentermine/topiramate (combination of a sympathomimetic anorectic and an antiepileptic drug), bupropion/naltrexone (combination of an aminoketone antidepressant and an opioid antagonist), and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist). One-year placebo-subtracted weight loss from baseline body weight, as described in the prescribing information, ranges from 3% to 9% and depends to a large extent on the patient population, background lifestyle intervention, treatment adherence, study discontinuation rate, and the statistical methods used to address missing data. The labeled prescribing information for these drugs includes changes in weight-related secondary endpoints.

### Orlistat 120 mg improves glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients with or without concurrent weight loss [^1134Zwqj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Published data suggest that orlistat 120 mg, a lipase inhibitor used to treat obesity, may improve glycaemic parameters through weight loss-independent effects.

- **Aim**: To investigate the effect of orlistat 120 mg on weight loss, and assess whether changes in glycaemic parameters [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] are independent of weight loss.

- **Methods**: This retrospective analysis of pooled data from seven multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involved overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (aged 18–70 years). Patients were required to have a body mass index of 27–43 kg/m², HbA1c of at least 6.5 for, or equal to 3 months. Subjects received orlistat 120 mg tid or placebo for 6 or 12 months.

- **Results**: A total of 2,550 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled and randomized to treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid (n = 1,279) or placebo (n = 1,271). For the whole population, patients treated with orlistat 120 mg had significantly greater mean decreases in FPG compared with placebo-treated patients (-1.39 mmol/l vs. -0.47 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). Additionally, orlistat 120 mg provided significantly larger mean decreases in HbA1c compared with placebo (-0.74% vs. -0.31%; p < 0.0001). For patients with minimal weight loss (≤ 1% of baseline body weight), orlistat 120 mg still provided a significantly greater decrease in the least squares mean value for both FPG (-0.83 mmol/l vs. ± 0.02 mmol/l; p = 0.0052).

### Changes in body weight and serum lipid profile in obese patients treated with orlistat in addition to a hypocaloric diet: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^113c5PTP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). High credibility.

Obesity is a growing health concern in Canada and the United States, and pharmacologic therapies such as orlistat are being more commonly prescribed to assist with weight loss.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to assess the efficacy and safety of orlistat compared with either placebo or an active control with regard to weight loss and serum lipid changes in overweight patients.

- **Design**: We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1966 through December 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Relevant trials and reviews were searched by hand. Randomized trials comparing orlistat and a control and reporting changes in weight loss, serum lipids (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL:HDL, and triacylglycerols), or both in overweight and obese patients [body mass index (in kg/m²) ≥ 25] were included.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight randomized trials met our inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies including 10,041 patients compared 3 x 120 mg orlistat/d with placebo or an inactive control along with a hypocaloric diet over a 1-year period. Relative risks (RRs) associated with clinically significant weight losses of 5% and 10% were 1.74 (95% CI: 1.57, 1.91) and 1.96 (1.74, 2.21), both favoring orlistat. Improvement in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL:HDL were also greater with orlistat. Gastrointestinal events were more common with orlistat than with placebo [RR: 1.46 (1.37, 1.55)].

- **Conclusion**: Our findings suggest that 3 x 120 mg orlistat/d is effective for improving both weight loss and serum lipid profile.

### Latin-American trial of orlistat for weight loss and improvement in glycaemic profile in obese diabetic patients [^1114zM5o]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

To determine if obese non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients lose more weight when treated for 24 weeks (6 months) with orlistat (120 mg t.i.d.), in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet plus behavioural counselling, than when treated by placebo (t.i.d.) plus similar instructions. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects on glucose profile and to determine the tolerability and safety of orlistat.

- **Design**: Double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study.

- **Subjects**: Obese, non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, aged 18–70 years old, with BMI > 27 kg/m^2, evaluated at 10 Latin-American centres, in five countries.

- **Efficacy and tolerability measurements**: After screening, eligible patients underwent a 2-week placebo run-in period receiving a hypocaloric diet. On day 0, patients were randomized to orlistat or placebo for 24 weeks. At each visit, body weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference were measured. At the screening visit, baseline visit (week 0), and at weeks 8, 16, and 24, a central laboratory measured fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1c, postprandial glucose and insulin, fasting total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and postprandial triglycerides. Other safety laboratory assessments were conducted locally at the screening visit, baseline visit, and at the end of the study. Adverse events were assessed at each visit from baseline.

- **Results**: After 24 weeks of treatment, the orlistat group lost an average of 4.7% of initial body weight vs. 3.0% in the placebo group (p = 0.0003).

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112qGYEd]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

Participants were recruited between May and August 2020, and the final participant visit was in March 2021. Of the 156 randomized participants, 149 constituted the modified ITT population and were assessed for the primary endpoint, and 135 completed the 28-week trial period. The PP population was composed of 122 participants across treatment groups. In total, 111 women and 45 men were randomized in the trial. There were no important differences between the three groups at baseline.

- **Primary outcomes**: As illustrated in Figure 2A, participants treated with both doses of EMP16 for 26 weeks lost more weight than those treated with placebo (p < 0.0001). Mean relative weight loss in the ITT population was -5.53% and -6.25% after 26 weeks of treatment with both EMP16–120/40 and EMP16–150/50, respectively, compared with -0.83% in the placebo group at week 26. More participants in the active treatment groups lost at least 5% and 10% of their baseline body weight at week 26. Similar weight losses were seen in the PP population or using the more conservative imputation method.

### Improvement of glycaemic control with rebound following orlistat initiation and cessation associated with minimal weight change [^115cyCub]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old Caucasian woman with type 2 diabetes, treated for seven years with diet and oral combination hypoglycaemic therapy, was referred due to the progressive deterioration of glycaemic control. She was obese (77 kg, BMI = 39.9), hypertensive, and hypercholesterolaemic with marked osmotic symptoms (HbA1c 12.2%). Therefore, she was started on insulin (Human Mixtard 30 b.d.) with metformin therapy. Dietary counselling, recommendations to increase physical activity, and supervised self-injection technique with titration of her insulin were also provided. She was routinely followed up to assess her progress.

Two years later, her glycaemic control remained suboptimal. The average HbA1c was 10.4% despite an increasingly high dose of insulin (94 units/day), although it improved when metformin was increased to 1 g t.d.s. (HbA1c = 9.3%). Her BMI progressively rose from 39.9 to 42.1 (77 to 82.5 kg) despite dietary advice. A trial of orlistat (three months) was commenced, after intensive dietary counselling, that reduced her body weight by 1.5 kg (2% reduction, BMI 41.3). However, her HbA1c improved by 0.5% (from 9.3 to 8.8%).

Six months after orlistat was stopped, her HbA1c rose to 10.5% and weight increased to 81.8 kg (BMI 41.8). Despite the orlistat treatment broaching NICE guidelines, should it have been continued?

### Selection of antiobesity medications based on phenotypes enhances weight loss: A pragmatic trial in an obesity clinic [^114vMHkr]. Obesity (2021). High credibility.

The study compared the efficacy of two treatment strategies. Mean weight loss (SEM) at 6 months of treatment, with more than 93% retention in both groups, was −10.5% (0.8%) in the phenotype-guided group and −6.3% (0.4%) in the non-phenotype-guided group (mean difference −4.1% [95% CI −5.9% to −2.5%], P < 0.001).

- **Percentage of patients achieving weight loss**: In the phenotype-guided group, 87%, 58%, and 38% of patients achieved > 10%, > 15%, and > 20% total body weight loss (TBWL) at 1 year, respectively, compared with 35%, 17%, and 8% of patients in the non-phenotype approach (P < 0.001).
- **Failure rate**: The failure rate, defined as less than 5% TBWL, was 2% in the phenotype-guided group compared with 26% in the non-phenotype-guided group (P < 0.001).

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112M6RVY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Orlistat is both a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces the absorption of prandial dietary fat by minimizing the hydrolysis of triglyceride. Orlistat is recognized in obesity treatment with proven, though low, efficacy. A study evaluated and compared the effect of treatment with orlistat versus metformin on the biochemical and hormonal factors in women with PCOS. Treatment with orlistat showed a significant reduction in weight as well as androgen level compared with metformin.

A randomized open-labeled parallel study compared the change in insulin resistance (IR) and its biological variability after treatment with orlistat, metformin, and pioglitazone in obese patients with PCOS. Orlistat significantly reduced both IR and its biological variability compared with metformin and pioglitazone. In a study, women with PCOS treated with orlistat were compared with metformin and lifestyle intervention, and there was an improvement in lipid profiles, weight, BMI, and waist circumference. Also, orlistat reduced androgen levels, parameters of IR, and total cholesterol.

Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure and plays a role in the prevention of T2DM in this high-risk population, possibly by its effect on weight reduction. However, orlistat at the recommended dose of 120 mg, up to three times a day taken with food, has significant side effects, including fatty stool, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence. It may also cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. While orlistat might have desirable effects in the management of obesity, its relevance in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome remains significant but limited due to these side effects.

### Orlistat in the treatment of NASH: A case series [^115pwA3k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now recognized as a common chronic liver disorder. Up to 16% of affected patients may progress to cirrhosis. The incidence and prevalence of this disease are noted to be increasing, in parallel with the nationwide increase in obesity and diabetes. Treatment options for these patients remain quite limited, however. Weight reduction has been advocated, but there are little data to support this practice, as most patients are unable to comply with the proper dietary modifications. We report three obese patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treated for 6–12 months with a weight reduction medication, orlistat, who lost between 22–42 lb and had significant clinical and histopathological improvement on follow-up.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113doStU]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

The study on the novel weight-loss combination product comprising orlistat and acarbose aimed at evaluating its efficacy in treating obesity has been conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The clinical trial was registered under the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), with the reference number 2019‐004545‐32.

- **Study design**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the combination product or a placebo over a specified period.
- **Objective**: To measure the impact of the combination on weight loss compared to the placebo.
- **Results**: The findings indicated that participants receiving the combination product observed statistically significant weight loss compared to those in the placebo group.

Such evidence supports the potential use of the combination product as an effective strategy for managing obesity.

### Comparative efficiency and safety of pharmacological approaches to the management of obesity [^111TGBSw]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Currently, only two drugs, sibutramine and orlistat, are prescribed for long-term administration. The most important trial evaluating the long-term efficacy of sibutramine was the Sibutramine Trial of Obesity Reduction and Maintenance (STORM), which lasted 2 years, while the XENical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects (XENDOS) study assessed orlistat's efficacy in preventing type 2 diabetes in obese subjects over a 4-year period. Meta-analyses of randomized trials revealed that sibutramine led to a weight reduction of 4.2 kg and orlistat to 2.9 kg in comparison with placebo.

- **Comparative efficacy**: Four of the seven studies comparing sibutramine and orlistat monotherapy showed that sibutramine was significantly more efficacious for weight loss, while the remaining three studies showed equivalent effects. Modest weight loss (5–10%) achieved with antiobesity drug treatment was associated with an improvement in lipid and glycemic profiles. Sibutramine improved concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, whereas orlistat reduced the incidence of diabetes and improved concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Norris et al. conducted a meta-analysis on the efficacy of orlistat and sibutramine in obese adults with type 2 diabetes and found only modest reductions in glycated hemoglobin (0.4% with orlistat, 0.7% with sibutramine). The improvement in lipid profiles in response to sibutramine and orlistat is greater than can be expected from weight loss alone.

### Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to influence adipose tissue function [^114xNZTP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor that decreases intestinal fat absorption after meals. Therefore, successful treatment with orlistat should be seen as a combined treatment of orlistat and a low-fat diet. In a recent meta-analysis of 16 studies, including 10,631 patients with a follow-up of 1–4 years, orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% CI 2.5–3.2 kg) and increased the absolute percentages of participants achieving 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds by 21% and 12%, respectively. A decrease in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus from 9.0% to 6.2% (Hazard Ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.46–0.86) was reported.

Together with a dietary intervention, orlistat (120 mg tid) was not associated with a change in plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations, although resistin levels decreased by 36% after 6 months of treatment. When orlistat was combined with a hypocaloric diet with a 600 kcal restriction, body weight decreased by 14–24%, and percentage body fat by 21%. Plasma concentrations of leptin, CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and resistin decreased, while adiponectin increased, indicating an improvement in adipose tissue function.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113nnZHc]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

Despite the weight loss achieved with EMP16, there were positive albeit limited effects on blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and blood lipids. The decrease in HDL is typically seen initially during weight loss but is not of clinical concern. However, as evident from the baseline characteristics, this was a fairly healthy population of individuals with obesity. The prevalence of hypertension at baseline was approximately 30%, whereas a prevalence of about 60% has been observed in patients with obesity in other studies. Furthermore, baseline blood lipid levels were generally low in the study, with a small proportion of individuals (7%) on blood lipid medication, and most participants having a baseline HbA1c value below 40 mmol/mol. The observed lack of clinically relevant changes in metabolic risk markers is in line with similar weight‐loss studies in patients with obesity without diabetes using liraglutide or semaglutide.

Patient‐reported quality of life was clearly improved in the intervention groups, especially in the EMP16‐150/50 group, with distinct clinically relevant differences in several of the RAND‐36 domains. The differences recorded were larger than seen in other weight‐loss studies using orlistat in its conventional dosage form or liraglutide.

The larger increase in rated quality of life was somewhat unexpected, and in an exploratory post hoc analysis, relative weight loss was plotted against health transition. The explained variance was low; additional factors apart from weight loss seem to have been involved in the increased quality of life ratings.

For patients with obesity, particularly those with metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the 2016 guidelines from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) recommend a 7–10% weight loss as the target of most lifestyle interventions. Achieving this weight loss can improve liver enzymes and histology.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111WSSmS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

As of the second quarter of 2015, the pharmacological options for overweight and obesity treatment approved in the United States include phentermine, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate extended release (ER) combination therapy, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and the recently approved liraglutide 3.0 mg.

Currently, orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide 3.0 mg are approved in Europe. Sibutramine was withdrawn from the United States and Europe due to concerns regarding cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the marketing approval for rimonabant in Europe was withdrawn because of concerns regarding depression and suicidality. The European marketing authorization application for phentermine/topiramate ER has been rejected twice, and the corresponding application for lorcaserin was withdrawn.

The 1-year weight loss efficacy and maintenance data for medications approved in the United States are described in the medication's US Prescribing Information or individual trials, with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) if available.

### Orlistat 60 mg reduces visceral adipose tissue: a 24-week randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^111Djh2Q]. Obesity (2011). High credibility.

It is well established that abdominal obesity or upper body fat distribution is associated with increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the present study was to determine if a 24-week weight loss program with orlistat 60 mg in overweight subjects would produce a greater change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, compared to placebo. The effects of orlistat 60 mg on changes in total fat mass (EchoMRI-AH and BIA), ectopic fat (CT), and glycemic variables were assessed.

One hundred thirty-one subjects were randomized into a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 123 subjects received at least one post-baseline efficacy measurement (intent-to-treat population). Both orlistat- and placebo-treated subjects significantly decreased their VAT at 24 weeks, with a significantly greater loss of VAT in orlistat-treated subjects (-15.7% vs. -9.4%, P < 0.05). In addition, orlistat-treated subjects had significantly greater weight loss (-5.93 kg vs. -3.94 kg, P < 0.05), total fat mass loss (-4.65 kg vs. -3.01 kg, P < 0.05), and trended to a greater loss of intermuscular adipose tissue and content of liver fat compared with placebo-treated subjects.

This is the first study to demonstrate that orlistat 60 mg significantly reduces VAT, in addition to total body fat, compared to placebo-treated subjects following a 24-week weight loss program. These results suggest that orlistat 60 mg may be an effective weight loss tool to reduce metabolic risk factors associated with abdominal obesity.

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: Moving towards efficacy improvement [^115M8PZ9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

A pooled analysis from two RCTs (n = 909) showed that the relative risk of failure to maintain at least a 10% weight loss after two years of treatment was 0.88 (95% CI 0.83, 0.93) for participants using 120 mg of orlistat three times a day versus those using a placebo (p = 0.00002), and it was 0.90 (95% CI 0.85, 0.95) for participants using 60 mg versus those using a placebo (p = 0.0002).

- **Concerning safety**: Orlistat is generally considered safe, with most concerns regarding its safety being related to tolerability. Mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events were the most frequent adverse events associated with orlistat treatment, occurring in up to 91% of patients in the first year of treatment and 36% after four years of treatment. Fecal incontinence, flatulence, and steatorrhea usually improved with a low-fat diet. No data are available on the long-term cardiovascular safety of orlistat, and no trial was designed to evaluate those variables. However, no deaths were related to the use of orlistat during the four-year study. Nephrolithiasis and liposoluble vitamin malabsorption may occur rarely; hepatotoxicity has been described, but doubts remain on whether there is a causal relationship.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: An update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^115dCjyM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Orlistat (Xenical, Alli)

The XENical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects (XENDOS) study enrolled men and women with obesity who did not have type 2 diabetes. Participants were either assigned to take Orlistat 120 mg ter in die (TID) or a placebo TID for a 4-year period. All patients were prescribed a reduced-calorie diet (−800 calories/day) with 30% of calories from fat and no more than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. They were also advised to walk 1 km per day. The range of mean age for all participants was 43.0–43.7 years, with 55% being women. The baseline mean BMI was 37 kg/m². At 1 year, the mean total body weight loss was 10.6 kg in the intervention group (n = 1487) and 6.2 kg for the placebo group (n = 1295), but the standard deviation was not available.

At 4 years, the mean total body weight loss, compared to baseline, was 5.8 kg for the intervention group (n = 851) and 3.0 kg for the placebo group (n = 567) (standard deviation not available). Compliance with drug administration from the first dose until treatment dissolution was 93% for both Orlistat and placebo patients, and the overall dropout rate was 8%. The XENDOS trial did not include patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, several trials investigated the efficacy of Orlistat, alone or in combination with Metformin or insulin treatment, in patients with overweight or obesity and DM with suboptimal control. In these studies, participants taking Orlistat achieved a significantly greater percentage in total body weight loss (range of mean percent weight loss 3.9–6.2), compared to patients on placebo (mean percent weight loss 1.3–4.3).

### X-PERT: Weight reduction with orlistat in obese subjects receiving a mildly or moderately reduced-energy diet: Early response to treatment predicts weight maintenance [^111S9F2R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of two different levels of energy deficit on weight loss in obese patients treated with orlistat.

Patients (n = 430) were randomized in a 1-year, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study conducted at 23 hospital centers and university medical departments worldwide. Obese outpatients with a body mass index of 30 to 43 kg/m², aged 18 to 70 years, with a body weight of ≥ 90 kg and a waist circumference of ≥ 88 cm (women) or ≥ 102 cm (men) were treated with orlistat 120 mg three times daily. This treatment was accompanied by a diet providing an energy deficit of either 500 or 1,000 kcal/day for 1 year. Orlistat treatment was discontinued in patients who did not achieve ≥ 5% weight loss after assessment at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the change in body weight from baseline at week 52.

The reported mean difference in energy intake between the two groups (500–1,000 kcal/day deficit) at weeks 24 and 52 was 111 and 95 kcal/day, respectively. Of the 430 patients involved in the study, 295 achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at both 3 and 6 months. At week 52, weight loss from baseline was similar for patients randomized to either the 500 or the 1,000 kcal/day deficit diet (-11.4 kg vs. -11.8 kg, respectively; p = 0.778). After 12 months of treatment with orlistat, 84% (n = 118/141) and 85% (n = 131/154) of patients in the 500 and 1,000 kcal/day deficit groups, respectively, achieved ≥ 5% weight loss, while 50% (n = 70/141) and 53% (n = 82/154) of patients, respectively, achieved ≥ 10% weight loss.

### The supportive effect of acarbose to orlistat in weight management-a randomized, double-blind, multiarm phase 2 trial [^114zZW9i]. Obesity (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the added effect of acarbose on orlistat for relative weight loss in the novel antiobesity medication EMP16.

In this 6-month double-blind trial, 240 individuals with obesity or overweight and comorbidities were randomized equally into three groups:

1. EMP16 (120 mg modified release orlistat/40 mg modified release acarbose)
2. MR-O (120 mg modified release orlistat)
3. Conv-O (120 mg conventional orlistat)

The primary outcomes were relative and categorical weight loss after 6 months. Mean relative weight loss was -7.73% for the EMP16 group, compared to -5.78% for the MR-O group and -5.13% for the Conv-O group (p < 0.05 for ≥ 10%). All groups showed small improvements in glucose and lipid markers, with EMP16 demonstrating greater improvement in fatty liver index and quality of life compared to Conv-O (p < 0.01). No serious adverse events occurred; most adverse events were mild and transient.

Acarbose enhances the weight loss efficacy of EMP16, supporting its potential as a safe and effective treatment for long-term obesity management.

### Effects of moderate weight loss and orlistat on insulin resistance, regional adiposity, and fatty acids in type 2 diabetes [^1129T8b7]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Moderate weight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes, and the conjunctive use of weight loss medication has been advocated. The study examined the weight loss-dependent and -independent effects of the intestinal lipase inhibitor orlistat over a 6-month treatment period, using behavioral intervention (Int) combined with randomized, double-blinded, placebo (P)-controlled treatment with orlistat (O).

Metabolic control, insulin sensitivity (IS), regional fat distribution, and fat content in the liver and muscle were measured in 39 volunteers with type 2 diabetes, from whom all antidiabetic medication was withdrawn 1 month preceding randomization. Weight loss was equivalent in the Int+O and Int+P groups, respectively (-10.3 ± 1.3% vs. -8.9 ± 1.1%), and there were identical decreases in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), fat mass (FM), thigh adiposity, and hepatic steatosis.

Weight loss resulted in substantial improvement (P < 0.001) in HbA(1c) (-1.6 ± 0.3% vs. -1.0 ± 0.4%; NS between groups). Insulin sensitivity improved significantly more with orlistat (Delta2.2 ± 0.4 vs. Delta1.2 ± 0.4 mg. min(-1). kg(-1) fat-free mass [FFM]; P < 0.05), and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were strongly correlated with IS (r = 0.56; P < 0.001). Orlistat caused greater reductions in fasting plasma FFA (Delta-154 ± 22 vs. Delta-51 ± 33 micromol/l; P < 0.05), insulin-suppressed FFA (Delta-119 ± 23 vs. Delta-87 ± 34 micromol/l; P < 0.05), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG; -62 ± 9 vs. -32 ± 8 mg/dl; P = 0.02).

### Xenical in the prevention of diabetes in obese subjects (XENDOS) study: A randomized study of orlistat as an adjunct to lifestyle changes for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in obese patients [^1134tCF5]. Diabetes Care (2004). High credibility.

It is well established that the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is closely linked to the presence and duration of overweight and obesity. A reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes has previously been demonstrated. We hypothesized that adding a weight-reducing agent to lifestyle changes may lead to an even greater decrease in body weight, and thus the incidence of type 2 diabetes, in obese patients.

- **Research design and methods**: In a 4-year, double-blind, prospective study, we randomized 3,305 patients to lifestyle changes plus either orlistat 120 mg or placebo, three times daily. Participants had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² and normal (79%) or impaired (21%) glucose tolerance (IGT). Primary endpoints were time to onset of type 2 diabetes and change in body weight. Analyses were by intention to treat.

- **Results**: Of orlistat-treated patients, 52% completed treatment compared with 34% of placebo recipients (P < 0.0001). After 4 years of treatment, the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 9.0% with placebo and 6.2% with orlistat, corresponding to a risk reduction of 37.3% (P = 0.0032). Exploratory analyses indicated that the preventive effect was explained by the difference in subjects with IGT. Mean weight loss after 4 years was significantly greater with orlistat (5.8 kg vs. 3.0 kg with placebo; P < 0.001) and similar between orlistat recipients with impaired glucose tolerance (5.7 kg) or normal glucose tolerance (5.8 kg) at baseline. A second analysis in which the baseline weights of subjects who dropped out of the study was carried forward also demonstrated…

### Weight loss as a treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112USeYM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver condition that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD has been associated with obesity and other features of metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia. Consequently, due to a lack of other effective treatments, weight loss achieved through lifestyle modifications (such as diet and exercise) is promoted as the standard treatment. However, there is very little empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of weight loss for NAFLD.

This article reviews the literature on the effects of weight loss achieved through lifestyle modifications or medications on NAFLD. At the time of writing, there have been no randomized controlled trials of weight loss interventions on hepatic pathology. Only three published trials (N = 89 subjects) that include a comparison group have been conducted. These studies suggest an improvement in liver enzymes and/or hepatic pathology; however, direct between-group comparisons are lacking. Four small, nonrandomized studies (N = 59 subjects) have evaluated the effect of weight loss achieved with medications (four of orlistat, one of sibutramine) on NAFLD. These suggest some improvement in liver enzymes and histopathology.

Finally, a brief review of observational studies on the association between NAFLD pathology or liver enzymes and diet composition suggests a possible role for the manipulation of macronutrients and/or micronutrients in NAFLD treatment. In summary, there is little empirical evidence to support the role of weight loss.

### The burden of obesity in the current world and the new treatments available: Focus on liraglutide 3.0 mg [^116m5oeJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

- **Change in body weight**: After treatment of obese individuals with four liraglutide doses (1.2, 1.8, 2.4, or 3.0 mg) or placebo administered once a day subcutaneously, or orlistat (120 mg) three times a day orally. Data are mean (95% CI) for the ITT population with the last observation carried forward (LOCF). Adapted from Astrup et al.

- **Proportion of individuals with prediabetes**: In the ITT population at randomization and week 20. Individuals included are those with valid assessment at the start and the end of the 20-week trial period. ✱ p = 0.007 vs. placebo. † P = 0.008 vs. orlistat. ‡ P ≤ 0.0001 vs. placebo or orlistat. Adapted from Astrup et al.

In the phase 3 Scale Maintenance Study, obese/overweight individuals (≥ 18 years, BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities) who lost greater than or equal to 5% of initial weight during a low-calorie diet in a 14-week run-in were randomly assigned to liraglutide 3.0 mg per day or placebo for 56 weeks. Diet and exercise counselling were provided throughout the trial. Co-primary endpoints were the percentage of weight change from randomization, the proportion of participants that maintained the initial weight loss greater than or equal to 5%, and the proportion that lost ≥ 5% of randomization weight. In addition to the mean weight loss of 6.0 ± 0.9% achieved by the 422 participants during the run-in period, from randomization to week 56, weight decreased an additional mean of 6.2 ± 7.3% with liraglutide and 0.2 ± 7.0% with placebo (P < 0.0001). More participants in the liraglutide group (81.4%) maintained the proposed run-in weight loss compared to the placebo group.

### Clinical efficacy of orlistat therapy in overweight and obese patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: A 1-year randomized controlled trial [^116c8YEd]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Weight loss improves glycemic control, lipid profiles, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, successful long-term weight loss is difficult for these patients, particularly those treated with insulin. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of orlistat, a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor, on weight loss, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight or obese insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients.

- **Research design and methods**: This study was a 1-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of orlistat (120 mg three times a day) or placebo combined with a reduced-calorie diet in overweight or obese adults (BMI 28–40 kg/m²) with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin alone or combined with oral agents, but with suboptimal metabolic control (HbA₁c 7.5–12.0%). Outcome measurements included changes in body weight, glycemic control, blood pressure, and serum lipids.

- **Results**: After 1 year, the orlistat group lost significantly more weight (-3.89 ± 0.3% of baseline body weight, means ± SE) than the placebo group (-1.27 ± 0.3%, P < 0.001). Orlistat treatment, compared with placebo, produced greater decreases in HbA₁c (-0.62 ± 0.08 vs. -0.27 ± 0.08%, P = 0.002), fasting serum glucose (-1.63 ± 0.3 vs. -1.08 ± 0.3 mmol/l, P = 0.02), and the required doses of insulin and other diabetic medications. Orlistat also produced greater improvements than placebo in serum total cholesterol (P = 0.0002), LDL cholesterol concentrations (P = 0.001), and LDL/HDL ratio (P = 0.01).

### Effect of orlistat added to diet (30% of calories from fat) on plasma lipids, glucose, and insulin in obese patients with hypercholesterolemia [^113zPnki]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of orlistat plus a reduced-calorie diet on decreasing cardiovascular disease risk in obese individuals with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. The study also aimed to compare the beneficial effects in patients with hypercholesterolemia only (type IIA) with those in subjects with combined dyslipidemia (type IIB).

Hypercholesterolemic patients treated with orlistat lost more weight (mean ± SEM 9.9 ± 0.4 vs. 6.1 ± 0.5 kg, p = 0.0001) and had greater decreases in plasma cholesterol (p = 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.0001), triglycerides (p = 0.06), glucose (p = 0.07), and insulin (p = 0.02) concentrations compared with the diet-only treated patients. The greater degree of weight loss in orlistat-treated subjects was similar irrespective of the form of dyslipidemia. Plasma total and LDL cholesterol and insulin levels decreased to a significantly greater degree (p < 0.05) in those patients who received orlistat and who had either type IIA or IIB dyslipidemia.

However, triglyceride and insulin concentrations decreased and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased to a significantly greater degree following orlistat-assisted weight loss in patients with type IIB compared with type IIA subjects. This was associated with a significantly greater decrease in the ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol. Thus, weight loss in response to a reduced-calorie diet in obese hypercholesterolemic patients was associated with a significant decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol levels.

### Toxicity of weight loss agents [^113soRC2]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

With the rise of the obesity epidemic in the United States over the last several decades and the medical complications associated with it, weight loss and dieting have become national public health concerns.

- **Discussion**: Because of their increased use and availability through internet sales, several different dieting agents were reviewed for potential toxicity. These included syrup of ipecac, cathartics, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, 2,4 Dinitrophenol, guar gum, phenylpropanolamine, ma huang/ephedra, caffeine, clenbuterol, fenfluramine, sibutramine, thyroid hormone, orlistat, and cannabinoid antagonists.

- **Conclusions**: With the internet making even banned products readily accessible, healthcare providers need to be aware of the potential toxicities of a wide range of weight loss agents.

### Do we need anti-obesity drugs [^116DPy9a]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of obesity urgently requires the implementation of efficient preventive and therapeutic measures. Weight loss and its maintenance should be considered one of the most important strategies to reduce the incidence of obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modification focused on diet and physical activity represents the essential component of any kind of weight management. However, only an intensive lifestyle intervention can be efficient for long-term weight loss.

Anti-obesity drugs target different areas in the central nervous system or peripheral tissues, aiming to improve regulatory and metabolic disturbances that contribute to the development of obesity. These medications provide modest additional fat loss beyond what is achieved by lifestyle modification alone. They also reduce visceral fat stores, improve program adherence and weight loss maintenance, diminish obesity-related health risks, and enhance quality of life. Anti-obesity drugs do play a role in weight management, as their replacement with a placebo often leads to weight regain.

Due to adverse events, several anti-obesity drugs were withdrawn from the market over the past few years, and currently, only orlistat remains available for long-term obesity management. Drug withdrawals, the failure of clinical trials with several new anti-obesity compounds, and inappropriate demands from drug-regulating agencies concerning study protocols have led to skepticism about the future of obesity pharmacotherapy. However, recently developed anti-obesity strategies continue to evolve.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115bawmL]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

The trial was funded by Empros Pharma AB, which also provided the clinical research organization (CRO) with the trial synopsis. The design of the trial was discussed between the funder and the CRO. The CRO was responsible for writing the protocol and the statistical analysis plan, as well as collecting the data and performing the statistical analyses. After the database lock, the funder had access to the data. Both the funder and the authors collaboratively interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript, with everyone involved having access to the data.

### Effect of orlistat on weight and body composition in obese adolescents: a randomized controlled trial [^116rMrXq]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing rapidly. In this population, behavioral therapy alone has had limited success in providing meaningful, sustained weight reduction, and pharmacological treatment has not been extensively studied.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and safety of orlistat in weight management of adolescents.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This was a multicenter, 54-week (August 2000-October 2002), randomized, double-blind study of 539 obese adolescents (aged 12–16 years; body mass index [BMI] ≥ 2 units above the 95th percentile) conducted at 32 centers in the United States and Canada.

- **Interventions**: Participants received a 120-mg dose of orlistat (n = 357) or placebo (n = 182) 3 times daily for 1 year, in addition to a mildly hypocaloric diet (30% fat calories), exercise, and behavioral therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary measure was the change in BMI. Secondary measures included changes in waist and hip circumference, weight loss, lipid measurements, and glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.

- **Results**: There was a decrease in BMI in both treatment groups up to week 12, after which BMI stabilized with orlistat but increased beyond baseline with placebo. At the end of the study, BMI had decreased by 0.55 with orlistat but increased by 0.31 with placebo (P = .001). Compared with 15.7% of the placebo group, 26.5% of participants taking orlistat had a 5% or higher decrease in BMI (P = .005); 4.5% and 13.3%, respectively, had a 10% or higher decrease in BMI (P = .002). At study end, weight had increased 0.53 kg with orlistat compared to 3.14 kg with placebo (P < .001).

### Safety and effects of anti-obesity medications on weight loss, cardiometabolic, and psychological outcomes in people living with overweight or obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XWd63]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Since 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested the withdrawal of the weight-loss medication lorcaserin owing to its increased risk of cancer. Recently, the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved five categories of weight-loss medications, including tirzepatide (a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor co-agonist), semaglutide and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonists), and orlistat, and two combination therapies (naltrexone/bupropion and phentermine/topiramate). These pharmacotherapeutic agents operate via distinct mechanisms.

Following the recent FDA approval of the novel weight-loss medication tirzepatide in December 2023, interest in comparing the effects and safety profiles of these medications has rapidly increased. Currently, a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the effects of the five categories of weight-loss medications is lacking.

This study investigated the effects of these medications across four dimensions: weight loss, cardiometabolic health, psychological outcomes, and adverse events in different individuals living with overweight or obesity. This study aimed to provide evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment and enhance personalized weight management in clinical practice.

### Anti-obesity therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention: Potential expected roles of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^111vwzPo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-obesity medications such as orlistat, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion have induced a weight loss of no more than 10%, which is insufficient to prevent the risk of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases (ORCVDs). None of these drugs have demonstrated a clear effect in improving cardiovascular outcomes and reducing mortality risk, partly because they only have an anorexic effect.

To compensate for their moderate weight loss effect, anti-obesity drugs used to prevent ORCVDs are also expected to benefit the cardiovascular system through non-anorexic mechanisms. Additionally, the duration of the weight loss effect is an important issue. With lifestyle modification alone, the weight loss effect is limited to approximately one year, after which weight increases due to endocrine mechanisms involved in body weight regulation.

Taken together, the possible requisites of anti-obesity drugs for ORCVDs prevention are the degree of weight loss, the effect of maintaining body weight, and the unique effect of cardiovascular protection.

### Weight loss, HbA1c reduction, and tolerability of cetilistat in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in obese diabetics: comparison with orlistat (Xenical) [^115PJ4ek]. Obesity (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was to determine the efficacy and safety of cetilistat and orlistat relative to a placebo in obese patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin. Following a 2-week run-in, patients were randomized to receive either a placebo, cetilistat (40, 80, or 120 mg three times daily), or orlistat 120 mg three times daily, for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in body weight from baseline. Secondary endpoints included other measures of obesity and glycemic control.

Similar reductions in body weight were observed in patients receiving cetilistat 80 or 120 mg three times daily or orlistat 120 mg three times daily; these reductions were significant compared to the placebo (3.85 kg, P = 0.01; 4.32 kg, P = 0.0002; 3.78 kg, P = 0.008). In the 40 mg three times daily and placebo groups, reductions were 2.94 kg, P = 0.958 and 2.86 kg, respectively. Statistically significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were noted. Cetilistat was well tolerated and showed fewer discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) than in the placebo and orlistat groups. Discontinuation in the orlistat group was significantly worse than in the 120 mg cetilistat and placebo groups and was entirely due to gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Treatment with cetilistat 80 or 120 mg three times daily, or with orlistat 120 mg three times daily, significantly reduced body weight and improved glycemic control relative to placebo in obese diabetic patients. Cetilistat was well tolerated, with the number of discontinuations due to AEs being similar to placebo.

### Effects of orlistat on obesity-related diseases - a six-month randomized trial [^114j7o2i]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the effect of orlistat on body weight and concomitant diseases in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of > 28 kg/m² and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, this trial was conducted as a six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants received orlistat 120 mg three times daily, along with a mildly reduced-calorie diet. A total of 1004 obese patients (BMI 28–40 kg/m²) participated, recruited by 253 private endocrinologists, and were assigned to receive either orlistat (n = 499) or placebo (n = 505). Patients were stratified based on their concomitant disorder: type 2 diabetes (n = 193), hypertension (n = 614), or hypercholesterolemia (n = 197). Body weight, anthropometry, lipid and glycemic control parameters, and blood pressure were assessed.

After six months, orlistat produced significantly greater weight loss than placebo in the groups with type 2 diabetes (-4.2% vs. -1.4%), hypertension (-6.2% vs. -1.9%), and hypercholesterolemia (-5.5% vs. -2.3%). Weight reduction of ≥ 5% at 12 weeks was associated with the highest weight loss in each group, and significant reductions in HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure were observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, respectively, at six months. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the orlistat and placebo groups, except for certain well-tolerated side effects.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of orlistat for weight loss in adolescents [^113z7sWa]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of orlistat to enhance weight loss in obese adolescents, a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study compared the effects of orlistat (120 mg orally, three times a day) and placebo on the reduction of body mass index (BMI). Forty adolescents aged 14 to 18, with a mean BMI of 40 kg/m², participated between December 2002 and February 2003. Participants stayed overnight in the General Clinical Research Center, where dietary records were reviewed, and lifestyle recommendations were provided. They received either orlistat or placebo and were assessed monthly for six months. Fasting laboratory tests were performed at 0, 3, and 6 months. The primary endpoint was the change in BMI from baseline to 6 months, while secondary outcomes included changes in weight, lean body mass, and blood chemistry results.

No statistically significant difference was noted between the two study groups for the decrease in BMI from baseline to 6 months (P = 0.39). However, the decrease in BMI within the orlistat group (-1.3 ± 1.6 kg/m²; P = 0.04) and the placebo group (-0.8 ± 3.0 kg/m²; P = 0.02) was statistically significant. Laboratory measurements did not differ between the two groups. Compared to the placebo group, the orlistat group experienced increased adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal symptoms and findings.

In conclusion, in this study of obese adolescents, orlistat did not significantly reduce BMI in comparison with placebo.

### The relationship between early weight loss and weight loss maintenance with naltrexone-bupropion therapy [^114wPCZn]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

The weight loss effects of orlistat, a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor, were also evaluated over the long term. The 4-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled XENDOS trial randomized 3,304 subjects with obesity to receive orlistat or placebo (each in addition to lifestyle changes). After 4 years, the mean weight loss was 5.8 kg with orlistat and 3.0 kg with placebo (P < 0.001).

The strengths of our analysis are the large number of patients included and the well-defined and diverse methodologies and populations of the component studies. The limitations include the inherent drawbacks of post-hoc studies, missing data from the subsequent time points of the analysis, and the relatively low number of individuals who had ≥ 10% weight loss at week 16, which limited the statistical power of our analysis to detect differences between naltrexone-bupropion and placebo in the comparisons of ≥ 10% weight loss maintenance. This refers to the power of detecting group differences in some of the studies because of the small sample size. For example, the COR-DM study has only 29 subjects in the treatment group and 4 in the placebo group. With this sample size, the power of detecting an 8.3% difference between these two groups is less than 50%. Another limitation of this study is that the population analyzed consisted predominantly of Caucasians, with a limited representation of Black/African American patients and patients of other or unknown races. Racial disparities in obesity and obesity treatment outcomes have been identified and reviewed extensively; therefore, this racial imbalance in the analyzed population is a significant concern.

### Effectiveness and persistence of anti-obesity medications (liraglutide 3 mg, lorcaserin, and orlistat) in a real-world primary care setting [^116ryJMH]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease with rising prevalence. Guidelines suggest using medications for obesity management when lifestyle interventions do not lead to substantial weight loss. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-obesity medications in inducing weight loss, but real-world data are lacking. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-obesity medications in reducing weight, improving cardiometabolic parameters, and assessing their persistence in a real-world setting.

- **Methods**: A historical cohort study was conducted using routinely collected data from Clalit Health Services (CHS). We retrieved data on all CHS members aged ≥ 20 years who initiated anti-obesity medication (orlistat, liraglutide 3 mg, and lorcaserin) between 2018 and 2020. We assessed average weight loss and the percentage of patients that had lost ≥ 5% and ≥ 10% of their body weight at 3, 6, and 9 months, comparing the effectiveness of these three medications.

- **Results**: We included 5,306 CHS members in our study; most (77.8%) were female, aged 40–59 years (52.4%). Treatment with liraglutide 3 mg and lorcaserin was associated with subsequent weight reduction. The average weight loss at 6 months was 5.6 kg (4.95–6.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]) with liraglutide 3 mg and 1.7 kg (1.2–2.2, 95% CI) with lorcaserin. There was no evidence that treatment with orlistat was associated with subsequent weight loss (-0.18 kg [-0.8 to 0.4, 95% CI]). At 6 months, 38% of the patients with orlistat, 43% with lorcaserin, and 51% with liraglutide 3 mg persisted with their treatments (P < 0.001).

### The effects of orlistat on body weight and glycaemic control in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116ie8Ao]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effects of orlistat on body weight, glycaemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study with a 4-week placebo plus diet lead-in period and a 48-week, double-blind treatment period. Overweight or obese adults [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m2] with HbA1c of 6.5–11% and clinical type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive orlistat (120 mg t.i.d., n = 189) or placebo (n = 180) in conjunction with a low-calorie diet. Participants had either received sulphonylurea therapy for at least 2 months before the study or were not receiving any antidiabetic medication (most of whom were drug-naïve).

- **Results**: After 1 year, patients in the orlistat group lost significantly more weight than those in the placebo group (-5.4% vs. -3.6%; p = 0.006). Moreover, significantly more patients achieved a weight loss of ≥ 5% with orlistat compared to placebo (51.3% vs. 31.6%; p = 0.0001). Orlistat-treated patients also exhibited significantly greater improvements than placebo-treated patients in HbA1c (-0.9% vs. -0.4%; p < 0.001), fasting glucose (-1.6 vs. -0.7 mmol/l; p = 0.004), and postprandial glucose (-1.8 vs. -0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.003). Additionally, orlistat-treated patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol compared with placebo. Overall, orlistat had a safety profile similar to placebo, except for a higher incidence of generally mild and transient gastrointestinal events known to be associated with its mode of action.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111UtTtJ]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy provides an option for adults with overweight and obesity to reduce their body weight if lifestyle modifications fail. We summarized the latest evidence for the benefits and harms of weight-lowering drugs.

- **Methods**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to March 23, 2021, for randomized controlled trials of weight-lowering drugs in adults with overweight and obesity. We performed frequentist random-effect network meta-analyses to summarize the evidence and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation frameworks to rate the certainty of evidence, calculate the absolute effects, categorize interventions, and present the findings. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD 42021245678.

- **Findings**: 14,605 citations were identified by our search, of which 143 eligible trials enrolled 49,810 participants. Except for levocarnitine, all drugs lowered body weight compared with lifestyle modification alone; all subsequent numbers refer to comparisons with lifestyle modification. High to moderate certainty evidence established phentermine-topiramate as the most effective in lowering weight (odds ratio [OR] of ≥ 5% weight reduction 8.02, 95% CI 5.24 to 12.27; mean difference [MD] of percentage body weight change -7.97, 95% CI -9.28 to -6.66), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (OR 6.33, 95% CI 5.00 to 8.00; MD -5.76, 95% CI -6.30 to -5.21). Naltrexone-bupropion (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.11 to 3.43), phentermine-topiramate (2.40, 1.69 to 3.42).

### Does weight loss lead to improvement of dermatological conditions: What is the evidence [^115GFmqz]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Obese and overweight individuals may exhibit a wide spectrum of cutaneous features and can experience more severe manifestations of multiple dermatological conditions. There have been multiple expert opinions on the role of weight loss in improving skin conditions. Over the past decade, few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise and other modes of weight reduction on various dermatoses, such as psoriasis, acne vulgaris, hidradenitis suppurativa, and acanthosis nigricans. In this review, we have attempted to provide a summary of the beneficial effects of weight loss on various dermatological conditions.

### Long term maintenance of weight loss with non-surgical interventions in obese adults: Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^116DT5e3]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

This comprehensive systematic review of interventions for the maintenance of non-surgical weight loss suggests that it is possible to reduce weight regain through behavioral and pharmacological means. Lifestyle interventions targeting both dietary intake and physical activity are effective in reducing weight regain after initial weight loss in obese adults within 12 months of weight loss. There is some evidence that these effects can be further sustained at 24 months and limited evidence beyond 24 months. The strength of the evidence, however, is limited; there was moderate heterogeneity and some evidence for potential risk of bias in terms of allocation concealment and outcome assessment as well as publication bias. All but 23 trials reported results only for those participants who completed the interventions, so results should be interpreted with caution.

Orlistat added to a lifestyle intervention seemed to be more effective than placebo and lifestyle intervention. Heterogeneity of effects was explained by a dose-response effect, with a dose of 120 mg three times a day reaching an effect estimate of −2.34 kg and treatment with lower doses a non-significant effect estimate of −0.70 kg. There was also evidence for sustainable effectiveness with orlistat 120 mg three times daily over 36 months. All orlistat studies reported significant increases in adverse effects in the form of an increased number of gastrointestinal events in participants taking orlistat compared with placebo, with some studies also reporting slight decreases in vitamin concentrations.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116VhGW2]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

In this trial, treatment with EMP16 for 26 weeks led to a continuous and clinically relevant weight loss. More than 50% of the participants in both active treatment groups lost at least 5% of their baseline weight, and more than 20% lost at least 10%, compared with 14% and 2% of participants, respectively, in the placebo group. Other anthropometric measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, and percentage of body fat showed similar treatment effects, albeit with larger effects for the higher EMP16–150/50 dose. Patient-reported quality of life showed improvements in both intervention groups, notably in physical functioning, general health, and the overall health transition score. Blood pressure, glucose metabolism markers, and blood lipids were not notably affected, and no treatment differences were observed in the ratings of satiety and craving, although minor improvements in meal patterns in relation to sweet food and breakfast were seen in the EMP16–150/50 intervention group. EMP16 was generally well tolerated, and no safety concerns were noted.

This trial corroborates the findings from the previous pilot trial with EMP16, which demonstrated that both the efficacy and tolerability of orlistat and acarbose were increased by employing a modified-release intervention. Orlistat and acarbose treatment in their conventional dosage forms typically provide an approximate relative weight loss of 2% to 3% and less than 0.5%, respectively. In contrast, the observed mean placebo-adjusted weight losses in the EMP16 arms were approximately 5%.

### Treatment effects on measures of body composition in the TODAY clinical trial [^116uDcvK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment effects on indices of adiposity: Table 1 includes data on changes from baseline by treatment group assignment, and Figure 1 shows trends for BMI and percent fat graphically. All changes in measures of adiposity with treatment and all differences between treatment groups, even when statistically significant, were small. During the first 6 months of treatment, all measures of adiposity declined in the M+L group but increased slightly in other groups. The change in the M+L group was significantly lower than in the M+R group for four of the five measures (BMI, percent fat mass, abdominal height, and absolute fat mass) and lower than in the M group for three measures (BMI, percent fat mass, and absolute fat mass). The M group was not significantly different from M+R. By 24 months, all measures of adiposity had increased relative to baseline in all treatment groups, except for percent fat mass in M+L. All changes were significantly greater in M+R than in either M or M+L, with no statistically significant differences between M and M+L.

- **Table 1: Body composition model-adjusted mean** (SE) change from baseline and significant treatment group comparisons.

- **Figure 1: LSmean change from baseline** for BMI (A) and percent fat mass (B) at 6 and 24 months, by treatment. Treatment groups are denoted by M for metformin alone, M+R for metformin + rosiglitazone, and M+L for metformin + intensive lifestyle intervention. LSmeans and P values are derived from an analysis modeling BMI and percent fat mass change from baseline (6−0 months and 24−0 months) as a function of baseline value, treatment, and period (0–6 or 0–24 months).

### Orlistat maintains biliary lipid composition and hepatobiliary function in obese subjects undergoing moderate weight loss [^117Rp4in]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Orlistat, an intestinal lipase inhibitor, has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. The effects of orlistat on hepatobiliary function have not been previously defined. A 4-week study was performed involving modest weight loss in obese subjects to observe any short-term hepatobiliary responses that occur after initiating treatment with orlistat and a hypocaloric diet.

A total of 23 obese subjects (BMI 30–41 kg/m²) were randomized to a double-blind, t.i.d. treatment with 120 mg of orlistat or a placebo, in conjunction with a hypocaloric diet (1200–1500 kcal/day). The study was designed to achieve similar modest weight loss in both groups to assess the direct effects of orlistat. Cholesterol saturation, bile composition, and gallbladder motility were measured.

At the end of the treatment period, a mean weight loss of 3.8 kg was achieved in the orlistat group (versus 2.3 kg with placebo, p = NS). Total bile acid concentration decreased significantly with placebo (-18.57 ± 6.99 mmol/L; 95% CI = -32.26 to -4.87) but not with orlistat. Biliary phospholipid concentration also decreased significantly with placebo (-4.38 ± 1.91 mmol/L; 95% CI = -8.13 to -0.64) but not with orlistat. Mean changes from the baseline in cholesterol saturation index and gallbladder motility were similar in both groups. Microscopy of bile failed to reveal cholesterol microcrystals before or after treatment in either group.

Our findings indicate a primary initial effect of weight loss is a reduction in…

### Meta-analysis: pharmacologic treatment of obesity [^1118GtMZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In response to the increase in obesity, pharmacologic treatments for weight loss have become more numerous and more commonly used.

- **Purpose**: To assess the efficacy and safety of weight loss medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other medications that have been used for weight loss.

- **Data sources**: Electronic databases, experts in the field, and unpublished information.

- **Study selection**: Up-to-date meta-analyses of sibutramine, phentermine, and diethylpropion were identified. The authors assessed in detail 50 studies of orlistat, 13 studies of fluoxetine, 5 studies of bupropion, 9 studies of topiramate, and 1 study each of sertraline and zonisamide. Meta-analysis was performed for all medications except sertraline, zonisamide, and fluoxetine, which are summarized narratively.

- **Data extraction**: The authors abstracted information about study design, intervention, co-interventions, population, outcomes, and methodological quality, as well as weight loss and adverse events from controlled trials of medication.

- **Data synthesis**: All pooled weight loss values are reported relative to placebo. A meta-analysis of sibutramine reported a mean difference in weight loss of 4.45 kg (95% CI, 3.62 to 5.29 kg) at 12 months. In the meta-analysis of orlistat, the estimate of the mean weight loss for orlistat-treated patients was 2.89 kg (CI, 2.27 to 3.51 kg) at 12 months. A recent meta-analysis of phentermine and diethylpropion reported pooled mean differences in weight loss at 6 months of 3.6 kg (CI, 0.6 to 6.0 kg) for phentermine-treated patients and 3.0 kg for diethylpropion-treated patients.

### Effects of orlistat on body mass index and serum lipids in overweight and obese adolescents: a meta-analysis [^112QczWF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effects of orlistat on body mass index and serum lipids in overweight and obese adolescents.

- **Methods**: The meta-analysis was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 1 August 2024. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. The outcome measures included body mass index (BMI) and serum lipids, such as total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The review of publications was conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Project for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).

- **Results**: This study has been registered with INPLASY (number INPLASY202480052). A total of 696 patients were included in five randomized controlled trials. The orlistat group reduced BMI compared to placebo in the short term (MD = -0.73, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.02, p = 0.04, I² = 73%) but appeared to have little effect in the long term (MD = -1.72, 95% CI: -3.55 to 0.12, p = 0.07, I² = 84%). Notably, orlistat can significantly improve blood lipid levels in children, as indicated by reductions in TC (MD = -8.11, 95% CI: -10.88 to -5.33, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), TG (MD = -3.22, 95% CI: -5.58 to -0.86, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), LDL (MD = -6.06, 95% CI: -8.75 to -3.37, p < 0.05, I² = 0%), and an increase in HDL (MD = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.13–1.61, p < 0.05, I² = 31%).

- **Conclusions**: Orlistat has been linked to alterations in lipid levels in obese or overweight children. However, the evidence regarding its efficacy in reducing BMI is inconclusive.

### Effects of a novel weight-loss combination product containing orlistat and acarbose on obesity: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112s4vg9]. Obesity (2022). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel, oral, modified-release formulation of the lipase inhibitor orlistat and the glucosidase/amylase inhibitor acarbose (denoted EMP16) on relative body weight after 26 weeks compared with placebo.

- **Methods**: The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had a 26-week treatment period, with dose escalation up to 6 weeks. Participants, adults between ages 18 and 75 years with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², or ≥ 28 kg/m² with risk factors, were randomly assigned to EMP16 120-mg orlistat/40-mg acarbose (EMP16–120/40), EMP16–150/50, or placebo. The primary end point was relative weight loss from baseline to week 26, assessed in participants with at least one post-baseline weight measurement.

- **Results**: Of 156 randomized participants, 149 constituted the intention-to-treat population. The mean (95% CI) estimated treatment difference to placebo in relative weight loss after 26 weeks in the intention-to-treat population was -4.70% (-6.16% to -3.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–120/40 and -5.42% (-6.60% to -4.24%; p < 0.0001) with EMP16–150/50.

This trial indicates that orlistat and acarbose can be successfully combined in a modified-release formulation to provide efficacious weight loss with no unexpected safety issues. EMP16 may be a promising candidate among other medications for improved weight management.
