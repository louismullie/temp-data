## Question

Mycoplasma testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Mycoplasma testing, specifically regarding M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae, and wants clear, stepwise thinking and self-verification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two distinct clinical entities and their epidemiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic challenges and why current tests fall short. Next, I will review available diagnostic methods and their performance, followed by guideline-based indications for testing. After that, I need to examine resistance testing and resistance-guided therapy. I will then consider specimen collection nuances and test selection. Finally, I should synthesize practical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and their epidemiology so I don't conflate syndromes. Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis in men and cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women, with asymptomatic carriage in a substantial minority, which complicates screening decisions and test interpretation [^116Gwzym] [^1179kzeg]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen causing community-acquired pneumonia, especially in school-aged children and adolescents, with carriage in the upper respiratory tract that can confound PCR-based diagnosis and lead to overcalling infection in some contexts [^115Tq2Qo] [^1128fm9A].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic challenges before proposing tests. For M. genitalium, culture is impractical due to fastidious growth, so diagnosis relies on NAATs, but macrolide resistance is common and rising, and U.S. commercial assays for resistance are limited, which undermines empiric therapy and stewardship [^116Gwzym] [^1179kzeg]. For M. pneumoniae, carriage in healthy children is high, IgM persists for months, and no single test reliably distinguishes infection from colonization, so misclassification is frequent and complicates both clinical management and research conclusions [^115Tq2Qo] [^1128fm9A].

> I will now examine diagnostic methods for M. genitalium and double-check performance claims. NAATs are the diagnostic mainstay. In the U.S., two FDA-cleared assays are available, enabling broader access beyond reference labs, though resistance testing remains largely unavailable commercially, which limits resistance-guided therapy adoption [^116Gwzym] [^111He9WZ]. Hold on, I should verify resistance testing status. While some assays detect macrolide resistance mutations, they are not broadly available in the U.S., so clinicians often must treat empirically and adjust based on response or send to specialized labs when available [^116Gwzym] [^113QHDVm].

> Next, I should review diagnostic methods for M. pneumoniae and be careful not to overstate any single modality. PCR is preferred for acute detection because of higher sensitivity and timeliness than culture, but it cannot distinguish carriage from infection, and sensitivity varies by age and timing; serology requires paired samples and is not timely for acute decisions, and culture is too slow for clinical use [^116vHL55] [^115Tq2Qo]. Let me consider emerging approaches; IgM antibody-secreting cell assays and host transcriptomic signatures show promise for differentiating infection from carriage, but they are not yet widely available for routine care, so clinical judgment remains essential [^112vKZFp] [^111juJYS].

> I need to ensure I align testing indications with guidelines before recommending who to test. For M. genitalium, routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals; testing is indicated in persistent or recurrent nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease, and partner testing is advised to support public health control and reduce reinfection risk [^116Gwzym] [^116XBZMd]. For M. pneumoniae, testing is reasonable in children with compatible CAP when results will influence management, particularly in school-aged patients or during outbreaks, recognizing that many will be managed empirically if testing is not available in a clinically relevant timeframe [^111sa4KA] [^113SzQnx].

> Hold on, I should verify resistance testing and treatment implications so I don't miss a key stewardship step. For M. genitalium, resistance-guided therapy is recommended where feasible, typically doxycycline followed by azithromycin if macrolide-susceptible or moxifloxacin if macrolide-resistant, but access to resistance assays is limited in the U.S., complicating implementation and risking treatment failure and resistance amplification [^1179kzeg] [^116Gwzym]. For M. pneumoniae, macrolide resistance is rising globally, with hotspots in East Asia, and although phenotypic testing is impractical, molecular detection of 23S rRNA mutations can guide alternative therapy in refractory cases, though availability varies by setting [^114hQSdz] [^111RLApX].

> Let me think about specimen selection and collection technique because preanalytical factors can materially affect results. For M. genitalium, first-void urine and vaginal or endocervical swabs are appropriate; self-collected vaginal swabs are acceptable and facilitate testing access, while rectal swabs are indicated when proctitis is suspected [^116Gwzym] [^114fYNBZ]. For M. pneumoniae, I initially thought nasopharyngeal swabs were uniformly preferred, but wait, newer data suggest oropharyngeal swabs may yield higher PCR sensitivity than nasopharyngeal swabs in some contexts, so I should recommend collecting both or prioritizing oropharyngeal sampling when feasible, using flocked swabs and avoiding wooden shafts or calcium alginate that may inhibit assays [^115WNgJg] [^116vHL55].

> I should double-check the synthesis to ensure internal consistency with the evidence. M. genitalium testing should be symptom-driven, leveraging NAATs where available and pursuing resistance testing when accessible to enable resistance-guided therapy, while avoiding screening asymptomatic individuals given uncertain benefit and potential harms from overtreatment and resistance selection [^116Gwzym] [^1179kzeg]. M. pneumoniae testing should be considered when results will change management, recognizing that no current test reliably separates carriage from infection; combining PCR with serology or using research-grade assays like IgM ASC ELISpot can improve diagnostic confidence in select settings, but routine care often defaults to empiric macrolide therapy with close follow-up for nonresponse [^115Tq2Qo] [^111sa4KA].

> But wait, what about knowledge gaps and future directions; I need to ensure I flag them clearly. For M. genitalium, randomized trials are needed to determine whether screening and treatment reduce reproductive sequelae in women, and broader access to validated resistance assays is essential to operationalize stewardship [^112LpwQY] [^116Gwzym]. For M. pneumoniae, better point-of-care diagnostics that distinguish infection from carriage, standardized resistance testing, and clearer criteria for when to escalate or add immunomodulatory therapy in severe or refractory disease remain priorities [^116Ce4fD] [^1133Xjmq].

> Finally, I should confirm practical takeaways and make sure they are actionable. For suspected M. genitalium in symptomatic patients, order a validated NAAT and, if positive and resistance testing is available, pursue macrolide resistance mutation analysis to guide therapy; if resistance testing is unavailable, treat per guideline-based resistance-guided algorithms and arrange partner testing and treatment to prevent reinfection [^116Gwzym] [^116XBZMd]. For suspected M. pneumoniae CAP in children, obtain respiratory PCR when feasible, consider oropharyngeal plus nasopharyngeal swabs for optimal yield, and treat empirically with a macrolide if clinically indicated, reassessing for macrolide resistance if there is clinical nonresponse or epidemiologic risk, adjusting therapy accordingly [^116khQHa] [^111sa4KA].

---

Mycoplasma testing relies on **NAATs as the gold standard** for both M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae due to superior sensitivity and specificity [^116Gwzym] [^116khQHa]. For M. genitalium, test symptomatic patients with urethritis, cervicitis, or PID, and **add resistance testing** when available to guide therapy [^116Gwzym] [^112FSVGe]. For M. pneumoniae, use NAATs in school-aged children with CAP or during outbreaks; serology is adjunctive and culture is not routine [^116khQHa] [^113SzQnx]. Avoid screening asymptomatic individuals for either pathogen, and ensure proper specimen collection and timely processing to optimize accuracy [^116Gwzym] [^116vHL55].

- **Culture**: Not recommended due to slow growth and low clinical utility [^116khQHa].

---

## Interpretation of test results

### Mycoplasma genitalium

A **positive NAAT** indicates active infection requiring treatment, whereas a **negative NAAT** in a symptomatic patient suggests alternative etiologies or low bacterial load. Resistance testing results guide **macrolide versus fluoroquinolone therapy** [^1179kzeg].

---

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae

A **positive NAAT** indicates active infection, particularly in symptomatic patients, whereas a **negative NAAT** with positive serology suggests recent or past infection. Clinical correlation is essential due to **carriage in asymptomatic individuals** [^116khQHa] [^115Tq2Qo].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Asymptomatic carriage**: Both pathogens can be detected in asymptomatic individuals, complicating interpretation [^1173hMPr] [^1128fm9A].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: High macrolide resistance in M. genitalium and emerging resistance in M. pneumoniae limit treatment options [^1179kzeg] [^114hQSdz].

- **Specimen quality**: Improper collection or delayed processing can reduce test sensitivity [^116vHL55].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **CDC 2024**: NAATs are the preferred method for both pathogens; routine screening is not recommended [^116Gwzym] [^116khQHa].

- **BASHH 2018**: Test for M. genitalium in persistent NGU, cervicitis, or PID; perform resistance testing when available [^112CowZm] [^112FSVGe].

- **IDSA/ASM 2024**: Use NAATs for M. pneumoniae in pediatric CAP or outbreaks; serology as adjunctive [^113SzQnx] [^116khQHa].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

- **Rapid point-of-care tests**: Development of rapid NAATs for M. pneumoniae and resistance testing for M. genitalium [^111RLApX] [^117BWv3J].

- **Transcriptomics**: Host gene expression signatures to differentiate infection from carriage in M. pneumoniae [^notfound].

- **Improved resistance assays**: Expanded availability of macrolide resistance testing for M. genitalium [^notfound].

---

Mycoplasma testing should be guided by clinical context, with **NAATs as the preferred method** for both M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae. Resistance testing for M. genitalium and careful specimen collection improve diagnostic accuracy and guide therapy.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is notably prevalent in paediatric wards, accounting for approximately 10–40% of paediatric community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. This condition can cause not only respiratory tract infections but also lead to extrapulmonary manifestations, such as myocardial damage, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, encephalitis, and liver damage. More concerning is that mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) can result in refractory mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP).

Patients treated for MPP who exhibit persistent fever, worsening clinical signs, and deteriorating pulmonary imaging findings, as well as extrapulmonary complications, are diagnosed with RMPP. The early administration of appropriate anti-mycoplasma drugs is vital. Although macrolides are the standard treatment for mycoplasma infections, the incidence of macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children is increasing. Glucocorticoids have been shown to alleviate excessive immune response and aid lung recovery in RMPP. However, numerous RMPP cases do not respond to glucocorticoid treatment. Some researchers believe that the formation of sputum emboli is a key pathological manifestation of this poor therapeutic response. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures have shown substantial efficacy in treating pneumonia, particularly in cases involving sputum thrombi. Early intervention and assessment are crucial for improving MPP outcomes, making it essential to identify more efficient assessment indicators for RMPP. Current predictors mainly rely on symptoms and laboratory tests. Mycoplasma pneumonia often presents with mild symptoms and severe pulmonary imaging changes, which can lead to delayed or missed diagnoses if based solely on clinical information and serum characteristics. Therefore, establishing more intuitive lung data, such as through FOB and computed tomography (CT) examinations, is necessary for an effective early assessment of pulmonary severity. However, these methods have their limitations: a bronchoscope can only observe lesions in the bronchus or trachea, while CT scans identify inflammation outside the bronchus but do not reveal the tracheal interior. Employing both methods simultaneously enables a more comprehensive lung assessment, compensating for their respective limitations.

### Diagnostic efficacy of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody and procalcitonin in children with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^113p9m1n]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher PCT levels in the observation group suggest a stronger inflammatory response associated with MPP, which may be indicative of more severe or systemic infection. Elevated PCT is often associated with bacterial infections and can be a useful marker for distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, particularly in the context of pneumonia. But some patients with negative PCR results have higher PCT levels, it is important to note several potential explanations: Firstly, 23 S PCR is mainly used to detect specific types of bacteria or their subspecies (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae). If the patient's infection is caused by other types of bacteria, then even if the 23 S PCR result is negative, the PCT level may increase due to the presence of these bacteria. PCT is a biomarker more broadly related to bacterial infections; Secondly, for patients who have undergone surgery or suffered trauma, even if the 23 S PCR is negative, it can still lead to an increase in PCT.

### Developing a public health response to Mycoplasma genitalium [^112CowZm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although Mycoplasma genitalium is increasingly recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen, at present there is no defined public health response to this relatively newly identified sexually transmitted infection. Currently available data are insufficient to justify routinely screening any defined population for M. genitalium infection. More effective therapies, data on acceptability of screening and its impact on clinical outcomes, and better information on the natural history of infection will likely be required before the value of potential screening programs can be adequately assessed. Insofar as diagnostic tests are available or become available in the near future, clinicians and public health agencies should consider integrating M. genitalium testing into the management of persons with sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromes associated with the infection (ie urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease) and their sex partners. Antimicrobial-resistant M. genitalium is a significant problem and may require clinicians and public health authorities to reconsider the management of STI syndromes in an effort to prevent the emergence of ever more resistant M. genitalium infections.

### Guidelines for the use of cell lines in biomedical research [^1176xqFg]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

4.2.4. Detection

There are four basic steps to any successful and reliable mycoplasma testing and detection programme.
Test all actively growing cell lines at regular intervals.
Only cell lines previously tested and confirmed as mycoplasma negative should be used in your clean cell culture lab. All non-tested cell lines must be quarantined until they are tested negative for mycoplasma.
Test all continuously maintained cell cultures at defined regular intervals (typically monthly to quarterly, depending on individual risk assessment). Maintain these cultures, where possible, on a short-term basis (2–3 months only) before discarding them and replacing with fresh vials from the same tested working stocks. This strategy not only reduces the amount of testing required but also reduces the problem of culture evolution and genetic drift.
Make sure all cell lines are mycoplasma tested before use in a clean cell culture room.

A large number of simple, reliable, sensitive and specific tests are now available to detect mycoplasma contamination in cell culture (see Table 3). When choosing a test method or a test kit, consider the sensitivity of the assay (usually recorded as colony-forming units per ml, or ng mL −1 for PCR-based kits). The number of species detected is also important. Positive control samples may be kept where the appropriate microbiological expertise and proper quarantine facilities are available; otherwise it is better to avoid keeping infected material. For those laboratories not able or not wishing to perform their own mycoplasma testing there are commercial companies and organisations that offer a comprehensive mycoplasma-testing service including Mycoplasma Experience Ltd. and the HPA Culture Collections – ECACC.

4.2.5. Eradication

The first step is to autoclave, or disinfect, the contaminated culture and associated media and dispose of them. Next thoroughly clean and disinfect (Table 4) all hoods, incubators, centrifuges, refrigerators, microscope stages and any other equipment, including pipettors, that may have been in contact with the contaminated cultures. It is recommended that potentially contaminated MSCs are sterilised using a suitable chemical fumigant. Using a liquid disinfectant alone may not be sufficient as it is difficult to reach all internal surfaces of an MSC with disinfectant. All media, media components and other reagents used for the contaminated cell lines must be discarded and all other cell lines in use within the laboratory should be quarantined and tested for mycoplasma to detect any spread of contamination.

### Comparison of different detection methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^112j4JiN]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

At present, there are many methods for the laboratory diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, including culture, serological detection and molecular assays. Culture is often used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing or typing due to its high specificity. However, due to the complicated procedure, prolonged turnaround time and low sensitivity, culture is not recommended for routine testing. Serological tests are currently the most widely used detection methods of M. pneumoniae in clinical practice and are more sensitive than culture. Diagnostic sensitivity for serological tests of M. pneumoniae is determined by both the collection time of specimens and the performance characteristics of the methods. In our study, the positive rate of MP-IgM (PA) was 40%, which was higher than that of the others, which may have been attributed to the average time being 10 days before admission to our department. Although MP-IgM is the earliest antibody produced after M. pneumoniae infection, it still takes a certain period of time before it can be detected. In general, MP-IgM can be detected within approximately 1 week after infection, reaching a peak after 3 to 4 weeks, resulting in possible false negatives in the early stage. It has been reported that the most accurate diagnosis of serology is obtained when paired sera collected at least 2 weeks apart are tested for both IgM and IgG at the same time, resulting in a 4-fold increase in titre. However, in paediatrics, it is simply impossible to perform repeated blood sampling in a short time. MP-IgM (GICT), a rapid test kit based on immunochromatography, is a relatively new serological test. One study from Wei Li found that the specificity and sensitivity of MP-IgM (GICT) were 100 and 97.4%, respectively, compared with real-time PCR, which was not in line with our results. It might be that the dilution of the sample to only 100 μl caused false negatives. Due to the easy and rapid procedure (15 min), MP-IgM (GICT) is suitable for the identification of M. pneumoniae infections in paediatric outpatient departments. However, MP-IgM (PA) is still recommended for inpatients to reduce the false-negative rate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Comparison of different detection methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^112HrMaW]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we assessed the detection rate of different methods for M. pneumoniae pneumonia in different age groups and compared the value of these diagnostic methods.

M. pneumoniae is a major cause of infectious diseases worldwide. M. pneumoniae affects different tissues and organs, especially the respiratory tracts, of children in all age groups, and it has become the second leading pathogen after Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with community-acquired pneumonia. The occurrence of CAP caused by M. pneumoniae varies with age. A previous study has reported that M. pneumoniae pneumonia is uncommon in children under 5 years of age but has a higher incidence among school-age children. However, M. pneumoniae infections may occur in people from infancy through old age. From 2010 to 2012, 2638 children with pneumonia requiring hospitalization in three hospitals in the United States were enrolled in a study. Respiratory specimens were systematically collected and detected using real-time PCR, and M. pneumoniae was found to be more common in children ≥ 5 years (19% vs. 3%). In accordance with our data, the detection rates of M. pneumoniae by different methods in the three age groups were different, but the distributions were the same. School-aged children and adolescents were the most common ages affected, and there was rarely a significant infection before 3 years old, which was consistent with the epidemiological characteristics of M. pneumoniae.

### Laboratory diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection [^113Fx7xc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is challenging due to the fastidious nature of the pathogen, the considerable seroprevalence, and the possibility of transient asymptomatic carriage. During recent years, various new techniques have been adapted for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, notably in the field of molecular biology. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently the method of choice for direct pathogen detection, but several PCR-related methods provide enhanced sensitivity or more convenient handling procedures, and have been successfully applied for research purposes. Among these techniques are real-time PCR, nested PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR. Generally, amplification-based methods have replaced hybridization assays and direct antigen detection. Serology, which is the basic strategy for mycoplasma diagnosis in routine clinical practice, has been improved by the widespread availability of sensitive assays for separate detection of different antibody classes. For the diagnosis of mycoplasma pneumonia, serology and direct pathogen detection should be combined. Extrapulmonary diseases may be diagnosed by direct pathogen detection alone, but the value of this diagnostic approach is limited by the probably immunologically mediated pathogenesis of some manifestations. This review summarizes the current state of Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnosis, with special reference to molecular techniques. The value of different methods for routine diagnosis and research purposes is discussed.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^1143MkUu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Other Perinatal Outcomes

Evidence for an association between M. genitalium infection and spontaneous abortion is conflicting. An initial meta-analysis reported significantly increased risk in M. genitalium –infected persons, but subsequent studies did not. Using NAAT, M. genitalium has been detected in the endotrachea of neonates, bronchoalveolar lavage samples from children 0–5 years, and ocular samples from infants born to infected mothers, suggesting that transmission of M. genitalium during vaginal delivery might occur. However, positive NAATs might only reflect residual DNA; larger studies are needed to determine the extent of maternal-to-child transmission.

Who Should Be Tested for M. genitalium?

Screening, diagnostic testing, and tests of cure each have different goals. Screening tests are undertaken in asymptomatic persons to provide treatment, limit sequelae, and prevent transmission. Diagnostic tests are performed in symptomatic persons to direct treatment at a specific pathogen and eliminate the organism. Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm eradication of pathogens. Recommendations for each type of testing are typically grounded in a robust body of evidence. When there is less robust evidence, as with M. genitalium, potential benefits must be weighed against potential harms.

### Pediatric encephalitis: what is the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae? [^111Q6DSm]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Encephalitis is a complex, debilitating, and sometimes fatal neurologic condition to which children are especially prone. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common respiratory pathogen, has been implicated as an etiology of encephalitis. Evidence for recent or acute M. pneumoniae infection has been demonstrated in limited studies of both pediatric and adult patients with encephalitis.

Patients and Methods

Unexplained encephalitis cases are referred to the California Encephalitis Project for diagnostic testing. Serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and respiratory specimens are tested by polymerase chain reaction and serology methods for the presence of multiple pathogens, including M. pneumoniae. M. pneumonia-associated cases of encephalitis were compared with other bacterial agents, herpes simplex virus 1, and enterovirus.

Results

Of 1988 patients referred to the California Encephalitis Project, evidence of acute M. pneumoniae infection was found in 111 patients, of which 84 (76%) were pediatric patients. Eighty percent of the 84 patients were positive for M. pneumoniae by serology alone. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for M. pneumoniae was rarely positive (2%). Patients with M. pneumoniae-associated pediatric encephalitis were a median of 11 years old, progressed rapidly (median: 2 days from onset to hospitalization), and were often in the ICU (55%). Symptoms included fever (70%), lethargy (68%), and altered consciousness (58%). Gastrointestinal (45%) and respiratory (44%) symptoms were less common. Compared with patients with other bacterial as well as viral agents, patients with M. pneumoniae-associated encephalitis had fewer seizures and less-severe hospital courses.

Conclusions

M. pneumoniae is the most common agent implicated in the California Encephalitis Project. Patients with M. pneumoniae-associated encephalitis are predominantly pediatric, and their presentations are clinically similar to enterovirus encephalitis, although they frequently require intensive care with prolonged hospitalizations. Given that M. pneumoniae infection is found more than any other pathogen, increased emphasis should be placed on elucidating the role and mechanism of M. pneumoniae in encephalitis.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113SzQnx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory pathogen testing in CAP — guideline-aligned recommendations note that testing for influenza viruses in both outpatient and inpatient settings during periods of community spread is a strong recommendation in the 2021 ATS clinical practice guideline, and testing recommendations for non-influenza viral pathogens endorse the use of NAATs in hospitalized patients with severe CAP or in patients with immunocompromising conditions; although a weak recommendation, in children with appropriate signs and symptoms, M. pneumoniae testing is indicated, and there are several molecular assays available for M. pneumoniae detection and C. pneumoniae detection. Laboratories must have a mechanism in place for screening sputum samples for acceptability prior to routine bacterial culture, and poor quality specimens provide misleading results and should be rejected because interpretation would be compromised.

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115eg6PN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, inpatient regimens, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer empiric combination therapy with a macrolide (oral or parenteral) in addition to a β-lactam antibiotic in hospitalized pediatric patients if Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are significant concerns. Obtain diagnostic testing if available in a clinically relevant time frame.

### Laboratory testing for Chlamydia pneumoniae… [^113YNY2U]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Clinical laboratories can provide diagnostic testing for Chlamydia pneumoniaeinfections using culture, serology, or molecular methods.
- There are multiple Food and Drug Administration -cleared laboratory tests for the detection of C. pneumoniaeinfection.
- Nucleic acid amplification tests, including real-time polymerase chain reaction, are the preferred method of diagnostic testing for acute C. pneumoniaeinfection. Lab methods Clinical laboratories can provide diagnostic testing for C. pneumoniae infections using culture, serology, or molecular methods. There are multiple FDA-cleared tests for the detection of C. pneumoniae infection. Respiratory pathogen panels are the most common test method performed in clinical laboratories. Culture of C. pneumoniae. Serological testing is performed in some clinical laboratories but lacks specificity.

It often requires multiple patient visits to collect acute and convalescent paired sera specimens. Molecular tests, including NAATs, offer high sensitivity and specificity and provide timely results for treatment decisions. These tests can also determine antibiotic susceptibilities. Additional or specialized testing. Laboratory guidelines
- Routinely test cell cultures for Mycoplasmacontamination by PCR
- Confirm positive results by an additional test, such as NAAT
- Do not diagnose an acute infection based on single IgG titers Preferred method: Microimmunofluorescence Non-endorsed methods: Complement fixation, EIA, and whole-inclusion fluorescence.
- Best method for the diagnosis of an acute C. pneumoniaeinfection Preferred method: NAAT, such as real-time PCR, or respiratory pathogen panel Complement fixation is not recommended for diagnosis of acute C. pneumoniae infection.

It cross-reacts with other Chlamydia species and other enteric bacteria. Also, the sensitivity for detecting reinfection is low. EIA is not a recommended diagnostic method because of low sensitivity and specificity. Whole-inclusion fluorescence tests are not species-specific and have not been widely evaluated. Microimmunofluorescence is the only species-specific antibody test available that can measure isotype-specific antibody titers to all Chlamydia species simultaneously. However, this testing is technically complex and interpretation is subjective.

### Diagnosis ofPneumonia with measurement of specific antibody-secreting cells [^112vKZFp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is reported to be the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized U.S. children. However, current diagnostic tests, including PCR of upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens and serology, do not differentiate between Mp infection and carriage. Mp carriage in the URT is found in up to 56% of healthy children. A ≥ 4-fold increase in IgG levels is still used in most centers to confirm Mp infection but has low sensitivity and is not helpful in acute clinical management. In the absence of an accurate diagnostic test, it is not surprising that studies and meta-analyses on the efficacy of antibiotics are inconclusive for Mp CAP in children.

Circulating antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses have been demonstrated to be more rapid and shorter-lived than antibody responses. We hypothesized that Mp -IgM-ASCs circulate in peripheral blood only for a few days or weeks after Mp infection, whereas Mp -DNA in the URT and serum antibodies persist for months. We aimed to evaluate the measurement of Mp -IgM-ASCs by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay as a new test for diagnosing Mp CAP.

Methods

Search Strategy

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database using the keywords Mycoplasma pneumoniae, macrolide, antibiotic resistance, and drug resistance. There was no language restriction in our search. We reviewed eligible full texts and the reference lists of the relevant studies. The last update of the study was on December 1, 2019.

Two independent reviewers (Y.-C.C. and T.-H.C.) screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the study population was restricted to children (< 18 years of age) with community-acquired pneumonia; macrolide resistance was detected by PCR including the 2 common point mutations, positions 2063 and 2064; and a direct comparator was used in the same cohorts (macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae [MSMP] group). We excluded review articles, editorial comments, case reports, and posters but included correspondence or letters that fulfilled these criteria.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

After full-text screening for eligibility and review, the 3 authors extracted data independently of one another. We resolved disagreements by consensus or review by another reviewer. We extracted the following variables from each study, if available: author, journal, year of publication, study design, study country, time period, detected point mutations, clinical symptoms, total febrile days, length of hospital stay, defervescence days after macrolide, antibiotic history, laboratory results, and chest radiographic findings. We also extracted pediatric data from studies with both children and adults, if available. We assessed the quality of nonrandomized studies included in the meta-analysis using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and excluded articles with poor quality (score 0–3).

Data Analysis

We used Review Manager software version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration,) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat,) for the analysis and conducted meta-analysis when > 3 studies with available data reported the same outcome. We calculated heterogeneity (I²) to examine statistical heterogeneity across the included studies. We considered I² > 50% and p < 0.05 to indicate substantial heterogeneity. We used random effects models to calculate odds ratios for binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We used Egger precision weighted linear regression tests and funnel plots to test potential publication bias. If publication bias was present, we used the trim-and-fill method and calculated Rosenthal's fail-safe N to evaluate the effect.

Acute bronchitis and pertussis testing — etiology and molecular diagnostics are summarized as follows: "In 10% of cases, bacterial etiologies such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis are seen" and clinicians should "Consider pertussis in an adolescent or young adult with prominent paroxysmal or prolonged cough". "Several FDA-approved NAAT platforms are available for the detection of a broad range of respiratory viruses and some of the "atypical bacteria" such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and in some cases B. pertussis associated with respiratory syndromes", and "These have largely replaced rapid antigen detection tests and culture in most institutions". For suspected B. pertussis, "there are several FDA cleared assays specifically for B. pertussis detection", "detection of B. pertussis using multiplexed syndromic respiratory pathogen panel tests may be suboptimal compared to targeted singleplex NAATs", and "A targeted NAAT in combination with culture are the optimal tests of choice for B. pertussis detection".

We assessed the utility of culture for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae to diagnose respiratory tract infections. Compared to PCR and IgM serology, culture was less sensitive and had extremely low yield. Culture is not recommended for these pathogens, and this method should be eliminated from routine practice.

### Latest advances in laboratory detection of Mycoplasma genitalium [^111He9WZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an important sexually transmitted pathogen affecting both men and women. Its extremely slow growth in vitro and very demanding culture requirements necessitate the use of molecular-based diagnostic tests for its detection in clinical specimens. The recent availability of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared commercial molecular-based assays has enabled diagnostic testing to become more widely available in the United States and no longer limited to specialized reference laboratories. Advances in the knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical significance of M. genitalium as a human pathogen made possible by the availability of molecular-based testing have led to updated guidelines for diagnostic testing and treatment that have been published in various countries. This review summarizes the importance of M. genitalium as an agent of human disease, explains the necessity of obtaining a microbiological diagnosis, describes currently available diagnostic methods, and discusses how the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has complicated treatment alternatives and influenced the development of diagnostic tests for resistance detection, with an emphasis on developments over the past few years.

### Image-based deep learning in diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumonia on pediatric chest X-rays [^11276meS]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, deep learning methods that utilize CXR images have been extensively applied in medical research, as demonstrated in studies by Prathiksha et al. and Enes et al. Their research primarily emphasized the enhancement of early and accurate diagnoses of pneumonia. However, these studies did not extend to the analysis of specific pathogens responsible for pneumonia, particularly in pediatric patients. Differentiation of mycoplasma pneumonia and viral pneumonia in children is still a challenge in clinical practice. Therefore, we investigated the application of deep learning in the detection of mycoplasma pneumonia. The aim was to provide an accurate binary classification (mycoplasma pneumonia vs. viral pneumonia) and to provide an earlier and faster diagnosis for clinical treatment in the future.

### Comparison of polymerase chain reaction and the indirect particle agglutination antibody test for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children during two outbreaks [^112J3DaN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia is challenging because of the lack of standardized rapid tests. Many serologic tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods are used with different diagnostic criteria.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted to compare the diagnostic values of the indirect particle agglutination test and nested PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children. These assays were evaluated in 234 hospitalized children with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections during 2 outbreaks of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in 2000 and 2003.

Results

The cumulative PCR positive rate was 26.7% in patients with maximum antibody titers of ≤ 1:320 and 78.2% in those with titers of ≥ 1:640. Based on these data, a positive PCR, a 4-fold increase in antibody titer, or a single titer ≥ 1:640 were considered to indicate acute M. pneumoniae infection. Overall, 152 children were diagnosed to have M. pneumoniae pneumonia; 27 (18%) by serology only, 26 (17%) by PCR only, and 99 (65%) by both methods. Children who were diagnosed by PCR only were significantly younger (P = 0.003) and were more often immunocompromised (P = 0.019) than those that were PCR negative. Duration of cough before PCR diagnosis was shorter in cases diagnosed by PCR only than those that were PCR negative (P = 0.045).

Conclusions

In conclusion, during the 2 outbreaks of M. pneumoniae infection, we found that the PCR test may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia, particularly in young children and in immunocompromised patients and in early stage disease.

### Image-based deep learning in diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumonia on pediatric chest X-rays [^112hTKtB]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Simultaneously, we compared several related studies that utilized deep learning methods in diagnosing pneumonia (see Table 4). Their results were a little better than that of the present study. Several factors may contribute to this finding. One possible reason is the different pneumonia pathogens examined; specifically, their studies predominantly focused on bacterial and/or viral pneumonia, whereas the CXR findings of mycoplasma pneumonia tend to be more diverse and atypical compared to those of bacterial pneumonia. Another reason is the limited number of chest radiographs utilized in this study. Consequently, future efforts should aim to enlarge the sample size of CXR, also with image enhancement techniques, thereby enhancing the reliability of the proposed method. Furthermore, to bolster the learning performance of deep learning in diagnosing mycoplasma pneumonia, it is essential to incorporate clinical data, such as the age of children, onset of symptoms, fever, and other laboratory examination. We intend to integrate this type of information in our future study.

Table 4
Detection of different types of pneumonia using deep learning tools based on CXR

The present study has some limitations. First, the experimental model was based on the comparison between mycoplasma pneumonia and viral pneumonia, and the validity of the model may have been affected by the number and proportion of cases. In the future, multi-center study will be carried out, with larger-scale datasets that can better verify the generality of the deep learning models. Cross validation can also be applied to validate their performance. Second, some cases with mixed infection (both viral and mycoplasma) were encountered in data collection, and were excluded from the current dataset. Further study is needed to correctly identify these cases. Third, bacterial infections were not included in the present study. It is expected that three-way classifications (mycoplasma pneumonia/viral pneumonia/no pneumonia) or even four-way classifications (mycoplasma pneumonia/viral pneumonia/bacterial pneumonia/no pneumonia) will be carried out in our future work. Fourth, this study only focused on deep learning models for classification, as they can achieve automatic feature extraction, require fewer manual interventions and usually are more robust than traditional machine learning methods. In the future, more extensive comparisons can be performed with machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest based on radiomics features.

### Mycoplasma genitalium from basic science to public health: summary of the results from a national institute of allergy and infectious disesases technical consultation and consensus recommendations for future research priorities [^112LpwQY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

This article lays out the research priorities for Mycoplasma genitalium research agreed upon by the participants in a 2016 National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded Technical Consultation focused on this organism. The state of current knowledge concerning the microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations of infection, treatment, and public health significance of M. genitalium reviewed at the meeting is described in detail in the individual articles included in this supplemental edition of the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Here we summarize the points made in these articles most relevant to the formulation of the research priorities listed in this article. The most important recommendation resulting from this Technical Consultation is the initiation of clinical trials designed to determine definitively whether screening for and treatment of M. genitalium infections in women and their sexual partners improve reproductive health in women and/or prevent human immunodeficiency virus transmission.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^116Ce4fD]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The 2023–2024 resurgence of M. pneumoniae followed the lifting of COVID-19 NPIs and has provided valuable insights in M. pneumoniae epidemiology. Studies on disease severity yielded mixed results, without showing strong evidence that M. pneumoniae infections generally were more severe compared to previous upsurges. The delayed resurgence compared to other respiratory pathogens may be due to a combination of factors such as viral interactions, bacterial carriage dynamics, and most likely to intrinsic characteristics of M. pneumoniae, including its slow generation time. Challenges in diagnosing M. pneumoniae persist due to carriage and limitations in current diagnostic tools. Treatment remains complicated by macrolide resistance, particularly in East Asia, though tetracyclines and quinolones are emerging as useful alternatives for children.

Many challenges remain, in particular the urgent need for improved diagnostic tests that can identify patients with M. pneumoniae infection that would benefit from antibiotic treatment and predict disease severity. Furthermore, more studies are needed to define the exact role of immunomodulatory treatment, and it in what subset of patients might benefit from these interventions. International collaboration during the 2023–2024 resurgence has proven to be pivotal in advancing our understanding of M. pneumoniae infection in children. To address the remaining challenges, the scientific community again needs to join efforts to answer these critical questions and improve the health of children with M. pneumoniae infection.

### Comparison of different detection methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^114D9fcJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, during the acute phases of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children, the detection of MP-IgM (PA) together with MP-RNA (SAT) proved to be a reliable and precise diagnosis. Paediatricians need to select appropriate detection methods based on the age of children and the onset of the disease, and they need to consider various results to diagnose M. pneumoniae infection.

### Diagnostic efficacy of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody and procalcitonin in children with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^111nyK9r]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common pathogen that causes community-acquired pneumonia and is mainly transmitted by droplets. The emergence of macrolide resistance has raised concerns about the efficacy of macrolides for the treatment of MP pneumonia (MPP) in children. MPP mainly manifests as intractable cough, accompanied by fever, sore throat, chills, headache, and other symptoms, which can lead to pulmonary infarction, pulmonary embolism, and other diseases in severe cases. MPP has the characteristics of severe disease, a long course of disease, and the involvement of many extrapulmonary organs, which affect the normal growth and quality of life of children. Moreover, the symptoms of MPP are not typical, and it is relatively difficult to distinguish it from other diseases.

Accurate and early diagnosis of MP infection is crucial for effective management. Various diagnostic methods have been studied, including antibody titers, RNA detection, serologic tests, and PCR/NAAT, with PCR/NAAT recognized as the gold standard for acute diagnosis. Procalcitonin (PCT), as the precursor of the hormone calcitonin, can be significantly increased during bacterial infection. Procalcitonin has also been investigated as a diagnostic marker for bacterial infections, showing promise in identifying patients with invasive bacterial infections and ruling out such infections in well-appearing young infants with fever of unknown origin. However, the accuracy of single serological IgM tests in children with suspected acute MP infection has been questioned. Additionally, the diagnostic value of procalcitonin in establishing the etiologic diagnosis and evaluating treatment in bacterial pneumonia in children has been validated. Furthermore, the clinical utility of procalcitonin in diagnosing pneumonia has been a subject of research, with varying conclusions on its diagnostic accuracy. This paper aims to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of MP antibody and procalcitonin in children with MP, considering the challenges and advancements in diagnostic methods and markers.

### Update in epidemiology and management of Mycoplasma genitalium infections [^1179kzeg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a frequent cause of urogenital syndromes in men and women and is associated with adverse sequelae in women. M genitalium also infects the rectum, and may cause proctitis, but rarely infects the pharynx. Diagnosis requires nucleic acid amplification testing. Antibiotic resistance is widespread: more than half of infections are resistant to macrolides and fluoroquinolone resistance is increasing. Resistance-guided therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients, involving initial treatment with doxycycline to reduce organism load followed by azithromycin for macrolide-sensitive infections or moxifloxacin for macrolide-resistant infections. Neither screening nor tests of cure are recommended in asymptomatic persons.

### Comparison of nucleic acid amplification and IgM tests for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children during a recent Korean outbreak [^113F5667]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the absence of standardized methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection, we evaluated the diagnostic value of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IgM assays for detecting M. pneumoniae infection in children during a recent Korean outbreak.

Methods

The diagnostic performances of PCR and IgM assays for M. pneumoniae in 1,109 clinical specimens were evaluated by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) scoring system as an interim reference standard.

Results

The level of agreement between both tests was fair. As analyzed by the JRS scoring system, the sensitivity of PCR was 45.2% in the group aged < 5 years, 86.8% in the group aged 5 years to 10 years group, and 72.2% in the group aged 10 years to 18 years; the sensitivity of the IgM assay was 66.8%, 71.4%, and 55.6% in each group, respectively.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of PCR is relatively low but is superior to that of IgM assays such that diagnostic performance can be improved by both test methods in patients aged < 5 years.

### A diagnostic host-specific transcriptome response for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia to guide pediatric patient treatment [^111juJYS]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Establishing the microbiological etiology of pneumonia remains a challenge for clinicians within healthcare facilities, primarily due to the complexity of obtaining direct microbiological samples, which often require invasive procedures. Additionally, there is a delay in obtaining results from other indirect tests, such as pneumococcal antigen in urine, PCR in respiratory swabs, or serology, when available. In the particular case of M. pneumoniae, cultures are considered the gold-standard for bacterial diagnosis; however, due to the difficulty in obtaining representative samples, slow growth rates, and low sensitivity, culture methods are impractical for timely clinical and treatment decision-making. Serology is another commonly used approach for diagnosing M. pneumoniae, but tests show low specificity. IgM antibodies can remain elevated for months after infection, with frequent cross-reactivity with other pathogens but also potential for generating false positives. As a result, serology has gradually been replaced by PCR, a rapid method offering higher sensitivity and specificity compared to serology and culture. PCR is now widely used in developed countries for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. Specific diagnosis of M. pneumoniae is important since, due to its lack of a cell wall, it does not respond to beta-lactams antibiotics such as amoxicillin, which is the first-line treatment for typical community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Azithromycin is the first line of treatment instead. Thus, clinicians often initiate empirical antibiotic treatment and adjust it later based on microbiological test results.

Recent advances in transcriptomics have allowed for the investigation of specific signatures triggered by the host in response to infections by viruses, bacteria, and different pathogens. Given the outbreaks of M. pneumoniae and the lack of precise and clinically useful diagnostic tools, it is essential to explore the specificity of the gene expression response against M. pneumoniae and other microorganisms responsible for pneumonia. While there have been a few attempts to characterize the gene expression profile in pneumonia patients infected by different microorganisms, none of them have focused specifically on the atypical pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae. However, we noted that a transcriptomic microarray study by Wallihan et al.included 30 children infected by M. pneumoniae, although a specific blood transcriptomic signature for this infection was not investigated.

Considering the urgent need prompted by recent outbreaks, it may be helpful to explore host gene expression mechanisms specifically triggered by M. pneumoniae and evaluate them in the context of those generated from pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Delivering a host-transcriptome signature specific for M. pneumoniae infection would be desirable to overcome the limitations of current clinical and non-clinical procedures.

CHALLENGES FOR M. PNEUMONIAE TREATMENT: MACROLIDE RESISTANCE

Notably, there are no trials demonstrating clinical efficacy of macrolides in children with M. pneumoniae infection, which is related to the diagnostic issues described above. However, promising studies are underway, such as a trial aiming to show macrolide efficacy in patients who screened positive for M. pneumoniae using a M. pneumoniae -specific IgM point-of-care assay and will retrospectively be verified by specific PCR and IgM ASC ELISpot. Diagnostic accuracy in these types of trials ideally will be monitored in a research setting using M. pneumoniae- specific IgG seroconversion or IgM ASC ELISpot. With a diagnostic test that at least substantially enriches for patients with M. pneumoniae infection studies could demonstrate macrolide efficacy. In patients with probable or proven M. pneumoniae infection, macrolide antibiotics are first-line treatment, since M. pneumoniae is intrinsically resistant to beta lactam antibiotics because of its lack of a cell wall. Macrolide resistance amongst M. pneumoniae isolates remains high, in particular in East-Asia. Several regional studies demonstrate a prevalence of macrolide resistance up to 90% in China. In contrast to reports from Asia, recent studies in Germany and the USA continue to find low levels of macrolide resistance. Mutation analyses show that A2063G is the predominant cause of macrolide resistance, albeit that macrolide resistance testing is biased since it is almost only performed on genotype level. Culturing M. pneumoniae, and subsequent phenotypical antibiotic resistance testing, is usually not achievable and culture-based studies are thus lacking. The predominance of A2063G mutation can also be explained by the fact that this single point mutation is sufficient for macrolide resistance and can easily arise, particularly in the context of low macrolide concentration, that is just above MIC, which readily occurs in macrolides with long half-life such as azithromycin. At this point there is little evidence to suggest macrolide resistance has changed during the resurgence.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men [^116dBvGy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasmagenitalium is one of the major causes of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) worldwide but an uncommon sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the general population. The risk of sexual transmission is probably lower than for Chlamydia trachomatis. Infection in men is usually asymptomatic and it is likely that most men resolve infection without developing disease. The incubation period for NGU caused by Mycoplasma genitalium is probably longer than for NGU caused by C. trachomatis. The clinical characteristics of symptomatic NGU have not been shown to identify the pathogen specific etiology. Effective treatment of men and their sexual partner(s) is complicated as macrolide antimicrobial resistance is now common in many countries, conceivably due to the widespread use of azithromycin 1 g to treat STIs and the limited availability of diagnostic tests for M. genitalium. Improved outcomes in men with NGU and better antimicrobial stewardship are likely to arise from the introduction of diagnostic M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing including antimicrobial resistance testing in men with symptoms of NGU as well as in their current sexual partner(s). The cost effectiveness of these approaches needs further evaluation. The evidence that M. genitalium causes epididymo-orchitis, proctitis, and reactive arthritis and facilitates human immunodeficiency virus transmission in men is weak, although biologically plausible. In the absence of randomized controlled trials demonstrating cost effectiveness, screening of asymptomatic men cannot be recommended.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections [^112svW2D]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a frequent cause of community-acquired respiratory infections in children and adults. Although the organism is felt to be the most frequent 'atypical' pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia in adults, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae varies greatly from study to study, depending on the population and the diagnostic methods used. Recent studies have found the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in adults with pneumonia to range from 1.9 to over 30%. M. pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in institutional settings. However, the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection is hampered by the lack of standardized, rapid, specific methods. This problem was illustrated by the results of an investigation of an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection in a federal training facility. Accurate diagnosis required a combination of polymerase chain reaction and serology, as IgM antibodies were not present early in the course of the infection in many patients. Several papers evaluating various serological and polymerase chain reaction assays were published during the period of this review. An assessment of the actual performance of these tests was also hampered by the lack of standardized comparative methods. M. pneumoniae is susceptible in vitro to macrolides, tetracyclines and quinolone antibiotics; however, data are limited on the microbiological efficacy of these agents. Several pneumonia treatment studies were published during this period, practically all of them based the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection on serology; different methods and criteria were used in each study, and thus the microbiological efficacy could not be assessed. The Infectious Disease Society of America recently stated in their revised Practice Guidelines for the Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults that, as there were no diagnostic tests available that reliably and rapidly detect M. pneumoniae, therapy must usually be empirical.

### Clinical symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia [^114pZt1j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is a significant cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics is recommended. However, M. pneumoniae is difficult to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and signs. Diagnostic uncertainty can lead to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, which may worsen clinical prognosis and increase antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are (i) to assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia; and (ii) to assess the influence of potential sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (January 1950 to 26 June 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to 26 June 2012). We identified additional references by handsearching the reference lists of included articles and snowballing. We searched the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews identified by searching the Medion database, Database of Reviews of Effects 2012, Issue 6 (25 June 2012) and the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy studies (2 July 2012). Experts in the field reviewed our list of included studies for any obvious omissions.

Selection Criteria

We included peer-reviewed published studies which prospectively and consecutively recruited children with community-acquired pneumonia from any healthcare setting, confirmed the presence of M. pneumoniae using serology with or without other laboratory methods and reported data on clinical symptoms and signs in sufficient detail to construct 2 × 2 tables.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author scanned titles to exclude obviously irrelevant articles. Two review authors independently scanned the remaining titles and abstracts, reviewed full-text versions of potentially relevant articles, assessed the quality of included articles and extracted data on study characteristics and the following clinical features: cough, wheeze, coryza, crepitations, fever, rhonchi, shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, myalgia and headache. We calculated study-specific values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We estimated the post-test probability of M. pneumoniae based on the absence or presence of symptoms and signs. We calculated pooled sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% CIs for symptoms and signs where data were reported by at least four included studies by fitting a bivariate normal model for the logit transforms of sensitivity and specificity. We explored potential sources of heterogeneity by fitting bivariate models with covariates using multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding data from studies for which we were concerned about the representativeness of the study population and/or the acceptability of the reference standard.

Main Results

Our search identified 8299 articles (excluding duplicates). We examined the titles and abstracts of 1125 articles and the full-text versions of 97 articles. We included seven studies in our review, which reported data from 1491 children; all were conducted in hospital settings. Overall, study quality was moderate. In two studies the presence of chest pain more than doubled the probability of M. pneumoniae. Wheeze was 12% more likely to be absent in children with M. pneumoniae (pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; pooled negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.23). Our sensitivity analysis showed that the presence of crepitations was associated with M. pneumoniae, but this finding was of borderline statistical significance (pooled LR+ 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23; pooled LR- 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96).

Authors' Conclusions

M. pneumoniae cannot be reliably diagnosed in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical symptoms and signs. Although the absence of wheeze is a statistically significant diagnostic indicator, it does not have sufficient diagnostic value to guide empirical macrolide treatment. Data from two studies suggest that the presence of chest pain more than doubles the probability of M. pneumoniae. However, further research is needed to substantiate this finding. More high quality large-scale studies in primary care settings are needed to help develop prediction rules based on epidemiological data as well as clinical and baseline patient characteristics.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^115Tq2Qo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

M. PNEUMONIAE DIAGNOSTICS

M. pneumoniae diagnostics available in clinics are based on direct bacterial detection or serology. For direct detection antigen-based assays or M. pneumoniae PCR are used, usually on upper respiratory tract samples such as throat swabs, which will also be positive during M. pneumoniae carriage. Serology includes acute phase M. pneumoniae- specific IgM, which if positive can mean a current infection but a previous infection as well, since M. pneumoniae- specific IgM remains positive for months. The reference standard remains a fourfold increase in M. pneumoniae- specific IgG. Since this requires a convalescent sample obtained 2–3 weeks after the acute phase sample, seroconversion does not provide a timely diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. Attributing cases of respiratory tract infections to M. pneumoniae thus continues to be complicated by the lack of a clinically robust reference standard. All reports during this resurgence are based on diagnostic tests that do not discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection or carriage. However, it seems likely that on a population level, the prevalence of upper respiratory tract carriage of M. pneumoniae has a similar kinetic in time when compared to M. pneumoniae infections. A study in children with recurrent respiratory tract infections found that M. pneumoniae was carried by 68% of children, and associated with a less diverse upper respiratory tract microbiome composition. Because of a lack of robust diagnostic tests, it remains unclear what the role is of M. pneumoniae in individual children with recurrent respiratory tract infections. However, some progress has been made in M. pneumoniae diagnostic testing in recent years. Levels of the biomarker TNF-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) in peripheral blood were found to be elevated in children with M. pneumoniae infection when compared to children with a non- M. pneumoniae respiratory tract infection. While this may sound promising, the added diagnostic value of a combination of TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to an assessment based on clinical characteristics was limited, since the addition of TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP to clinical characteristics did not improve discriminatory accuracy for M. pneumoniae infection. Another study investigated the use of host-response transcriptomics to identify M. pneumoniae with good performance (area under the curve of 0.84–0.95), although it was unclear how this study definitively ascribed pneumonia cases to M. pneumoniae. The ultimate diagnostic test with superior sensitivity and specificity, which ideally would also provide point-of-care results, has not yet been identified. However, the likelihood of M. pneumoniae infection can be estimated using clinical characteristics, such as age more than 5 years, prodromal fever and respiratory symptoms more than 6 days, and CRP or PCT levels that are normal or only slightly elevated, etc. These clinical characteristics have been validated in a patient cohort were M. pneumoniae infection was ascertained using a M. pneumoniae- specific IgM antibody-secreting cell (ASC) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay, which can discriminate between M. pneumoniae carriage and infection. Until there is a diagnostic test that can differentiate carriage from infection, focus should shift from diagnostic studies towards utility studies. Utility studies validate certain diagnostics test that can identify groups of patients likely to have M. pneumoniae infection, thereby identifying patient groups that would have clinical benefit from antibiotics with in-vitro effectiveness against M. pneumoniae.

### Laboratory testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae… [^116khQHa]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Clinical reference laboratories can provide diagnostic testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniaeinfections using culture, serology, or molecular methods.
- Multiple U. S. Food and Drug Administration -cleared tests can detect M. pneumoniaeinfection.
- Nucleic acid amplification tests are the preferred method of diagnostic testing for M. pneumoniaeinfections. Lab methods Culture of M. pneumoniae is performed by specialized reference laboratories, but it's time-consuming and not optimal for treatment decisions. Serological testing is performed in some clinical laboratories but lacks specificity. It often requires multiple patient visits to collect acute and convalescent paired sera specimens. Molecular tests such as nucleic acid amplification tests offer high sensitivity and specificity and provide timely results for treatment decisions. These tests can also predict antibiotic susceptibilities.

Options for routine or specialized testing needs Clinical laboratories support serological and molecular diagnostic testing using commercially available tests and FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic products. Public health laboratories can provide diagnostic support or forward specimens to CDC for specialized testing needs. Availability of molecular tests Currently, many clinical and public health laboratories use molecular test methods, such as NAATs. FDA has cleared multiple in vitro diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae detection. Most detect multiple respiratory pathogens, including M. pneumoniae. However, some FDA-cleared tests are for detection of M. pneumoniae only. Benefit of multi-pathogen testing M. pneumoniaealong with other respiratory pathogens if there's increased respiratory illness in the community, especially among school-age children. Unique characteristics impact diagnostic methods M.

pneumoniae differ from other bacteria in ways that impact the methods used for diagnosis of infection. Laboratorians should keep these characteristics in mind when working with M. pneumoniae.
- They can pass through filters typically used to remove bacteria.
- Light microscopy cannot detect them.
- They don't produce visible turbidity in liquid growth media. In order to achieve visual confirmation of growth, M. pneumoniae cultures require specialized media. Growth in this media can take several weeks to confirm.

### Global trends in the proportion of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114hQSdz]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, there were large variations in the number of studies on the proportion of MRMP infections according to WHO regions and countries. We found that 67.3% of studies (103 of 153) were performed in the Western Pacific region, with China (n = 39) and Japan (n = 41) being the most common countries. These findings limit the generalization of the results. In general, more studies are likely to be performed where the prevalence of the disease is high. The results of the present meta-analysis can help researchers and clinicians better understand and identify the global and geographical proportion of MRMP infections. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, the trend in the proportion of MRMP infections needs to be distinguished by geographical region, although the proportion of MRMP infections is generally increasing. Second, the duration and timing of the studies varied, and the study periods partially overlapped in each study. Therefore, there might be gaps between the timing of tests and the estimation of MRMP infections each year. Third, substantial heterogeneities were present in the aspects of study population, age, type of RTI, severity of M pneumoniae infection, timing of sample collection, and variant type among the included studies. Nevertheless, we combined the studies in our meta-analysis because most cases of M pneumoniae infection are considered to be community-acquired infections, especially CAP in children; therefore, the results of the present meta-analysis can be generalized.

In the present study, we did not consider whether specimens were obtained from oropharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal swabs because only a few studies included such information, although there might be differences in sensitivity and specificity according to specimen type. Although culture is the criterion standard for detecting M pneumoniae, culture methods are not routinely used in clinical practice. Polymerase chain reaction methods have been widely used because of their high sensitivity, and PCR is widely used as a reference method to identify the presence of M pneumoniae. Therefore, we included studies using PCR for the diagnosis of M pneumoniae and the detection of MRMP infection. In the funnel plots of the proportion of MRMP infections using study sample size and the Egger test for investigation of small study biases, we found bias associated with sample size in studies of the A2063G and A2064G variants associated with MRMP infection (eFigure in the Supplement). Although studies on the proportion of MRMP infections inevitably have different sample sizes, the results of the present systematic review and meta-analysis are important despite these biases.

### Prevalence ofin different population groups: systematic review andmeta-analysis [^115trS7c]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We followed a predefined review protocol. This report presents the findings of the first of three review questions (prevalence of M. genitalium). Two other review questions (incidence and persistence of untreated M. genitalium infection) will be addressed in a separate report. We report the findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA, research checklist online).

Eligibility criteria

We included studies that provided an estimate of the prevalence of M. genitalium infection in urogenital or rectal samples from women and men older than 13 years in any country from 1991 onwards, when the first NAAT was described. We included studies conducted among people in the general population or among attenders at healthcare settings that used NAAT to detect M. genitalium. Eligible study designs were cross-sectional studies and baseline data in cohort studies and randomised controlled trials, published as full papers, abstracts or conference posters. We excluded laboratory studies, studies restricted to people with a specific condition, for example, men with urethritis, women with abnormal cervical smears and women with pregnancy complications. Studies need to be large enough to estimate prevalence with sufficient precision. Studies with small sample sizes result in imprecise estimates that tend to be of lower methodological quality than large studies. We decided by consensus that we wanted to include at least 20 studies in the review. After assessing the sample sizes reported in the abstracts of identified records, we determined that inclusion of studies with 500 participants or more would result in at least 20 studies in the review.

Information sources and search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, African Index Medicus, IndMED and LILACS databases from 1 January 1991 to 12 July 2016 without language restrictions. The full search strategy for Medline and Embase is provided in online supplementary text S1. The other databases were searched using only the term ' Mycoplasma genitalium '. We used Endnote (V.7; Thomson Reuters) to import, de-duplicate and manage retrieved records.

Study selection

Two reviewers (LB, MC) independently screened the identified records using prepiloted checklists to assess eligibility, first of abstracts and titles and then of full text records. Differences were resolved by discussion or adjudication by a third reviewer (NL). When multiple records reported on the same study population, we defined a primary record to represent the study, based on a combination of the following factors: description as a main paper by the authors, most detailed report of methods, prevalence reported as the main result and date of publication.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae-an emerging extra-pulmonary pathogen [^117GCDVr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma is a well-recognised pathogen that colonises mucosal surfaces of humans and animals. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts of children and adults, leading to a wide range of respiratory and non-respiratory clinical conditions. M. pneumoniae infection is frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with respiratory illnesses, and is commonly managed empirically with macrolides and fluoroquinolones. This contrasts with patients who present with non-respiratory symptoms in the context of a recent or current unrecognised M. pneumoniae infection, for whom this pathogen is rarely considered in the initial differential diagnosis. This review considers the microbiological, epidemiological, pathogenic and clinical features of this frequent pathogen that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory and non-respiratory infections.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children: a pro / con discussion [^112LWS1z]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen of increasing clinical interest as cases have recently risen in the United States and worldwide following a period of reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. While most cases are mild, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and cannot be reliably distinguished from other common causes of CAP based solely on features of clinical presentation or imaging. However, testing to confirm a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae, when it is suspected, can be logistically challenging in some clinical settings. It also remains unclear which patients with M. pneumoniae CAP benefit from antibiotic treatment, raising the question of whether treatment should be offered, particularly when the diagnosis is not confirmed. This pro/con discussion explores the available data to support or refute routine testing and empiric antibiotic treatment for M. pneumoniae.

### Mycoplasma genitalium as a sexually transmitted infection: implications for screening, testing, and treatment [^113WkAMK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

The evidence that Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted pathogen is virtually incontrovertible based on both the concordance rates among partners and on DNA typing showing the same sequence type among partners in contrast to unrelated M genitalium positive patients. The implications that this has for the screening, testing, and treatment of patients is less certain however. Which tests are the most sensitive and specific, what samples are most appropriate, who should be tested, what treatment is best and how should partners be managed?

### Improved diagnostics help to identify clinical features and biomarkers that predict Mycoplasma pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia in children [^114vhMyy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We evaluated clinical features and biomarkers to diagnose Mp infection within a well-defined cohort of ambulatory and hospitalized children with CAP, in which Mp infection was diagnosed with the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay that allows for the differentiation between Mp infection and carriage. Diagnosing Mp as the cause of CAP at an early stage is important to avoid ineffective first-line empirical β-lactam antibiotics and to evaluate targeted treatment against Mp in severe cases.

Several scores, ratios, algorithms, and prediction rules have been reported to diagnose Mp infection on the basis of clinical features. However, previous studies found no reliable signs or symptoms to differentiate Mp infection in CAP from other etiology, potentially because Mp infection was misclassified as infection when it was carriage. We recently demonstrated that the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay differentiates Mp infection from carriage: While Mp DNA and/or IgM were also detected in 48% and 29% healthy control children (n = 21), all were tested negative by the Mp IgM ASC ELISpot assay. Notably, the high Mp detection rate in CAP patients (46%) in this study may be related to the inclusion age of 3–18 years, in which Mp is most frequently detected, and the coinciding Mp epidemic in Europe during the study period. Prevalence estimates are important for translation of diagnostic study findings into clinical practice. When taking the Bayes theorem into account, the posttest probability of disease presence will be higher given a higher pretest probability or prevalence. For proper implementation of a new diagnostic test into clinical practice, it is therefore necessary that the test will be assessed in the context of all the other diagnostic information that is available at the time point of testing.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in adults reporting sexual contact with infected partners, Australia, 2008–2016 [^111DgLz1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an established sexually transmitted pathogen that causes nongonococcal urethritis, and recent evidence indicates that it increases the risk for cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm delivery, and spontaneous abortion. The estimated prevalence of M. genitalium infection is 1%–3% in men and women, according to community-based studies from the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and Scandinavia. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are therefore important in preventing sequelae and ongoing transmission, particularly the transmission of drug-resistant strains to sex partners.

Published data are limited regarding the likelihood of transmission of M. genitalium and the proportion of persons who are likely to be infected after contact with an infected sex partner. Several small studies, with the number of participants ranging from 8 to 88, have examined the proportion of persons infected when their partner has a confirmed M. genitalium infection, with results indicating a range of 20.6%–66.7%. However, the CIs are broad, and greater precision would provide a more accurate evidence base for partner-notification guidelines and clinical practice. To our knowledge, no published estimates of the likelihood of M. genitalium infection in contacts of infected men who have sex with men (MSM) are available. Studies of M. genitalium in MSM attending clinics report rectal infection prevalence of 1%–5% in predominantly asymptomatic men, whereas a recent study of MSM in Australia with proctitis found 8% of HIV-negative MSM and 20% of HIV-positive MSM had rectal M. genitalium infection.

Treatment guidelines are inconsistent about the need for presumptive treatment of sexual contacts of M. genitalium –infected patients; guidelines in the United States and United Kingdom do not recommend presumptive treatment, whereas guidelines in Australia do. Potential disadvantages of presumptive treatment include cost, unnecessary use of antimicrobial drugs, and risk for adverse effects, particularly from fluoroquinolones used for macrolide-resistant M. genitalium. The potential advantages are that early treatment might prevent reinfection of the index patient or transmission to others and prevent sequelae. The higher the likelihood of infection in a contact of a person with confirmed infection, the stronger the argument for presumptive treatment. Presumptive treatment for chlamydial infection, a sexually transmitted infection with similar characteristics to M. genitalium infection, is recommended based on prevalence estimates of 36%–68% among contacts of sex partners with confirmed chlamydial infection.

### Comparison of different detection methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^115CngVb]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Each detection method of M. pneumoniae has its own advantages and disadvantages. Although molecular assays are superior in detecting M. pneumoniae due to their rapid, sensitive and specific characteristics, they cannot take the place of serology. A study in China analysed data from children hospitalized with MPP using IgM (PA) and RT-PCR. The concordance was close to 90% for the two detection methods. However, 173 (7%) children with a positive PCR had a negative serological test, and there were only 72 (3%) IgM-positive children who were PCR negative. Different detection methods can be used not only to improve diagnostic specificity and sensitivity but also to reduce the false-negative rate and false-positive rate. No single test available can be reliable for the identification of M. pneumoniae infection, and a combination of various methods is the most reliable approach. A positive PCR without serological evidence of infection may indicate that the specimen was collected too early in the course of M. pneumoniae infection for antibodies to develop. PCR results may become negative after a period of antibiotic treatment, while serological results would remain positive for a long time. Some reviews have concluded that no single test could reliably detect M. pneumoniae infection, but a combination of serological tests and PCR might be the most sensitive approach for early diagnosis in children. In our research, two different M. pneumoniae detection methods were combined and evaluated by RT-PCR, and the results showed that MP-IgM (PA) in combination with MP-RNA (SAT) can be used as a good screening method.

Our study had some limitations. First, this study was performed in a single centre and included no data on clinical features because there were no accurate ways to determine the specificity of these characteristics. Second, the lack of a gold standard diagnostic assay, such as microbiological culture and a 4-fold increase in IgM and IgG in paired serum, made it difficult to draw conclusions to confirm the most reliable and accurate method.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) testing and screening — M. genitalium is a recognized pathogen causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in males and cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, with 15%–25% of infections due to this organism; NAATs are the best option for detection. Currently, 2 NAATs for M. genitalium are FDA cleared (Hologic Aptima M. Gen Assay and Abbott's Alinity STI assay) for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples. Routine screening is not recommended in asymptomatic men or women, and testing should be considered in persistent NGU or PID. Molecular tests for resistance markers to macrolides and fluoroquinolones are not commercially available in the United States, and culture or NAATs for Ureaplasma are not recommended because of the high prevalence of colonization in asymptomatic, sexually active people.

Specimen Submission for Diagnostic Testing Requesting support for testing isolates Public health laboratories can forward approved specimens to CDC for specialized testing. Healthcare providers should contact the public health laboratory for their jurisdiction to arrange for specimen submission. CDC uses nucleic acid amplification tests to identify M. pneumoniae. Specimens identified as positive for M. pneumoniae by previous lab testing and/or upon testing at CDC will be subsequently tested for macrolide susceptibility using molecular test methods. CDC does not use culture or serological testing as routine diagnostic methods. For additional information, including acceptable specimen types and specimen preservation, storage, and shipping requirements, please refer to these pages for M. pneumoniae molecular detection and macrolide susceptibility genotyping.

Specimen collection and handling Collect an OP and NP swab specimen Use only sterile Dacron, rayon, or nylon swabs with plastic shafts. If available, use flocked swabs. DO NOT use calcium alginate swabs or swabs with wooden sticks, as they may contain substances that inactivate some agents and inhibit some molecular assays. For OP swab specimens: Insert swab into the posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas. Rub swab over both tonsillar pillars and posterior oropharynx and avoid touching the tongue, teeth, and gums. For NP swab specimens: Insert flexible shaft swab through the nares parallel to the palate until it contacts the nasopharynx. Indications of contact include encountering resistance and the distance equaling that from the ear to the patient's nostril. Gently rub and roll the swab. During the Collecting a Nasopharyngeal Swab Clinical Specimen video the clinician collects samples by swabbing the posterior nasopharynx.

### Distribution of macrolide resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in urogenital tract specimens from women enrolled in a US clinical study cohort [^113QHDVm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen that confers increased risk for adverse reproductive and sexual health outcomes, including nongonococcal urethritis in men and preterm birth, infertility, vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Diagnosis of infection has been difficult since M. genitalium has fastidious culture requirements and slow growth in vitro. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are now the primary tools for detecting the organism in clinical specimens obtained from infected persons.

In the research setting, use of NAATs has provided an understanding of the epidemiology of M. genitalium infection, revealing prevalence estimates often similar to or exceeding those of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in low-risk populations as well as in persons at higher risk for contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The recent advent of clinically validated, in vitro, diagnostic NAATs provides for sensitive methods for detecting M. genitalium in specimens collected from various urogenital sites in symptomatic women, including urine samples as well as swab specimens from cervical and vaginal epithelia.

Since Mycoplasma spp. lack a cell wall, bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents form the basis for treating M. genitalium infections. The semisynthetic macrolide azithromycin has been the first-line treatment for M. genitalium infection due to its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties for treating intracellular bacterial infections, but resistance to the drug has been increasing steadily due to drug-induced mutations in M. genitalium ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically at base positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S subunit. To avoid treatment failure and selection of resistant strains in vivo, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines now recommend testing M. genitalium NAAT–positive specimens from symptomatic patients for the presence of these macrolide-resistance–mediating mutations (MRMs) prior to initiation of treatment.

### PCR sensitivity fordetection in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs: a comparative study [^115WNgJg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the sensitivity of MP detection is significantly higher in oropharyngeal samples than in nasopharyngeal samples. This study indicates that oropharyngeal samples should be used to detect MP rather than a nasopharyngeal sample. The results contribute to a potential change in the current recommendation regarding sampling methods to detect MP, according to national and international guidelines. Accurate identification of respiratory pathogens, including MP, is crucial not only for timely and appropriate antimicrobial treatment but also for efficient epidemiological surveillance.

Key points

The PCR sensitivity of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) was significantly better in oropharyngeal samples than in nasopharyngeal samples. Oropharyngeal samples should be used to detect MP rather than nasopharyngeal samples.

### Macrolide-resistant in children: emphasis on the United States [^111JyMXR]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies regarding infections caused by macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been reported in the last years in the United States, where the prevalence is approximately 10% but may range from 3% to even 80%. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae may be associated with prolonged fever, hospital stay, and complications. Suspicion should be raised by non-response to macrolides, and detection can be achieved through routine reflexive testing of M. pneumoniae -positive specimens with a polymerase-chain reaction assay that rapidly predicts macrolide resistance. After timely initiation of an alternative antibiotic, prompt resolution of the disease is likely in most cases. This review summarizes current US data, offers some suggestions, and identifies knowledge gaps on this infection.

### Mycoplasma genitalium: accurate diagnosis is necessary for adequate treatment [^116rR6gC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma genitalium is very difficult to grow in culture but has been more able to be studied for disease associations since the advent of research molecular amplification assays. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other molecular assays have demonstrated an association with adverse disease outcomes, such as urethritis or nongonococcal urethritis in men and adverse reproductive sequelae in women-for example, cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), including an association with risk for human immunodeficiency virus. The lack of commercially available diagnostic assays has limited widespread routine testing. Increasing reports of high rates of resistance to azithromycin detected in research studies have heightened the need available commercial diagnostic assays as well as standardized methods for detecting resistance markers. This review covers available molecular methods for the diagnosis of M. genitalium and assays to predict the antibiotic susceptibility to azithromycin.

Methods

A PubMed (US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health) search was conducted for literature published between 2000 and 2016, using the search terms Mycoplasma genitalium, M. genitalium, diagnosis, and detection.

Results

Early PCR diagnostic tests focused on the MPa adhesion gene and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Subsequently, a transcription-mediated amplification assay targeting ribosomes was developed and widely used to study the epidemiology of M. genitalium. Newer methods have proliferated and include quantitative PCR for organism load, AmpliSens PCR, PCR for the pdhD gene, a PCR-based microarray for multiple sexually transmitted infections, and multiplex PCRs. None yet are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, although several assays are CE marked in Europe. As well, many research assays, including PCR, gene sequencing, and melt curve analysis, have been developed to detect the 23S ribosomal RNA gene mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin. One recently developed assay can test for both M. genitalium and azithromycin resistance mutations at the same time.

Conclusions

It is recommended that more commercial assays to both diagnose this organism and guide treatment choices should be developed and made available through regulatory approval. Research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness of routine M. genitalium testing in symptomatic patients and screening in all individuals at high risk of acquiring and transmitting sexually transmitted infections.

### Comparison of different detection methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^116225tb]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae, MP) is known as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children throughout the world. M. pneumoniae is the smallest prokaryotic microorganism, lacks a cell wall and has a high affinity for respiratory epithelial cells. A total of 40% or more cases of CAP in children are caused by M. pneumoniae, and approximately 18% of cases require hospitalization. At present, it is believed that the pathogenic mechanism of M. pneumoniae is to cause direct injury through community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin, which induces eosinophilia, increases cytokine production and induces the hyperreactivity of the airway, such as asthma, in animal models. In addition, the immunological response resulting from infection by M. pneumoniae causes pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms.

A worldwide increase in the prevalence of macrolide-resistant mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) strains has been witnessed since 2000. In some regions of Asia, the resistance rates have been reported to be over 90%, whereas in North America and Europe, the rates have reached 25%. Compared to other patients with CAP, children with M. pneumoniae infection may be older and have prolonged symptoms of fever and cough. The period of signs and symptoms will be shortened if accurate antimicrobial treatment is started early in the course of diseases. However, Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children cannot be diagnosed exactly in terms of clinical manifestations.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia has the characteristics of insidious onset, mild pulmonary signs and low specificity of clinical manifestations and imaging. Therefore, effective and sensitive laboratory diagnostic methods are the main basis for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. At present, there are many clinical methods for detecting M. pneumoniae, such as culture, serology and molecular-based methods. However, as the gold standard, culture is limited in clinical utility because it is time-consuming and insensitive. Both serology and molecular assays have their own advantages and disadvantages in clinical practice. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the clinical application value of different methods to detect M. pneumoniae infection by comparing and analysing them to improve diagnostic efficiency.

### Development of a rapid and high-throughput multiplex real-time PCR assay for Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species [^113pAE8M]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). Medium credibility.

Bacterial commensals of the human genitourinary tract, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species (parvum and urealyticum) can be sexually transmitted, and may cause nongonococcal urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma species may also cause severe invasive infections in immunocompromised patients. Current culture-based methods for Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma identification are costly and laborious, with a turnaround time between 1 and 2 weeks. We developed a high-throughput, real-time multiplex PCR assay for the rapid detection of M. hominis and Ureaplasma species in urine, genital swab, body fluid, and tissue. In total, 282 specimens were tested by PCR and compared with historic culture results; a molecular reference method was used to moderate discrepancies. Overall result agreement was 99% for M. hominis (97% positive percentage agreement and 100% negative percentage agreement) and 96% for Ureaplasma species (96% positive percentage agreement and 97% negative percentage agreement). Specimen stability was validated for up to 7 days at room temperature. This multiplex molecular assay was designed for implementation in a high-complexity clinical microbiology laboratory. With this method, > 90 samples can be tested in one run, with a turnaround time of 4 to 5 hours from specimen extraction to reporting of results. This PCR test is also more labor effective and cheaper than the conventional culture-based test, thus improving laboratory efficiency and alleviating labor shortages.

### Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children, Ohio, USA [^114yWMig]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major pathogen that accounts for up to 40% of the total number of community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs) in children and up to 19% of the pediatric CAPs that require hospitalization, yet those numbers might not reflect its actual clinical impact because testing for M. pneumoniae is not performed routinely. M. pneumoniae infection has a wide range of manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit. Because it lacks a cell wall, M. pneumoniae is not susceptible to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs, which are first-line therapy for CAP in children.

Macrolides are considered the antimicrobial drugs of choice for the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections in children; however, in the past few decades, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMp) has emerged. Rates of resistance are highest in Asia, as high as 100%, and reported rates in the United States vary from 3.5% to 13.2% (,–). No published data are available from Ohio, where we conducted our study.

Macrolide resistance is conveyed by single base mutations in the V region of 23S rRNA, which codes for the binding site of macrolides in the M. pneumoniae ribosome. The most common mutations include the change of A to C/G/T at location A2063 or at location A2064. These are the 2 mutations associated with macrolide resistance that have been reported in the United States.

M. pneumoniae is a slow-growing, fastidious organism, making routine culture and phenotypic antimicrobial drug sensitivity testing impractical for clinical use and limiting the use of these techniques mainly to research purposes. Since molecular assays were developed, diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections has shifted from serology to molecular detection using PCR, resulting in improved sensitivity and specificity. However, even with molecular detection, most clinicians have no information regarding antimicrobial sensitivity of M. pneumoniae. Therefore, as in many other settings, we currently have no data on local rates of MRMp, and most children diagnosed with M. pneumoniae infection are treated initially with macrolides. If clinical concerns for macrolide resistance occur while children are receiving therapy, clinicians sometimes choose to switch antimicrobial therapy to another agent, although there are no established clinical parameters or guidelines concerning when to consider potential resistance to macrolide antimicrobial drugs.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children: carriage, pathogenesis, and antibiotic resistance [^115JEo4K]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Both the diagnosis and treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children are currently facing two main challenges: a relatively high carriage in asymptomatic children, and a worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP). This review focuses on the scientific and clinical implications of these crucial issues.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have indicated that the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract is similar among asymptomatic, healthy children and children with a symptomatic respiratory tract infection, and that current diagnostic procedures for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between bacterial carriage and infection. It is therefore possible that the burden of M. pneumoniae-associated disease is overestimated. Another phenomenon that has an important impact on the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections is the rapid worldwide emergence of MRMP isolates.

Summary

The current diagnostic procedures for M. pneumoniae cannot discern between bacterial carriage and infection in a clinically relevant time frame. It is therefore imperative that these procedures be modified such as to unambiguously detect symptomatic M. pneumoniae infections. Moreover, the emergence of MRMP necessitates the application of methods to detect macrolide resistance as well as the implementation of restrictive policies regarding the use of macrolides.

If product manufacture includes cell culture of more than 24 hours, the product should be tested for mycoplasma contamination. Mycoplasma testing should be performed on samples (including both cells and supernatant) obtained prior to final manipulation (i.e. on cells still in conditioned culture medium, before final harvest and wash). For the recommended testing procedure description, refer to the appropriate FDA guidance document. For products that must be administered before obtaining mycoplasma culture test results, alternative rapid mycoplasma detection assays (e.g. PCR based assays) may be performed. For Licensure, equal sensitivity and specificity between the rapid assay and culture-based assay must be validated.

### Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence, coinfection, and macrolide antibiotic resistance frequency in a multicenter clinical study cohort in the United States [^113vRypC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Our data differ from those reported previously in that testing forand other sexually transmitted organisms using sensitive NAAT methods revealed that the majority of subjects (> 80%) of both genders were infected with a single organism and infections with ≥ 2 organisms were relatively uncommon. The reason for this difference is not clear, although the use of geographically and clinically diverse medical practices for the initiation of patient encounters in this study might have revealed infection patterns not apparent in previous studies with smaller or more geographically constrained enrollments. Regardless of the reason, we found here that, for, two-thirds of females and three-quarters of males who tested positive for the organism by a NAAT did not have a concurrent infection with another STO. Similarly, for, approximately one-half of males and three-quarters of females who were positive for the organism by a NAAT had a single infection; for, three-quarters of females and nearly all males had single infections. This apparent predominance of subjects harboring single-organism infections has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals who are at high risk for STIs. Current treatment guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy that is specific to each microorganism and, since coinfection with one or more STOs may be uncommon, the choice of therapy for managing mucosal epithelial inflammatory conditions should be guided by the employment of clinically validated diagnostic methods, rather than a syndromic management approach.

Forinfections, macrolide antibiotics are the current treatment of choice. In recent years, numerous studies on cohorts originating outside the United States have reported high detection rates for a macrolide antibiotic resistance genotype of, thereby limiting the options for treatment. In the present study, we also found high rates of amacrolide resistance phenotype (51% in females and 42% in males), indicating that resistance to this class of drugs is not a regional phenomenon outside North America but is likely to be endemic in the U.S. population as well. Confirmation of this finding using broader evaluations of the U.S. population would complicate current treatment methods forinfections and might indicate a need for comprehensive reassessment of current diagnostic and pharmacological solutions for treating infected patients.

Major strengths of this study include the number of subjects evaluated (n = 946), the demographic and geographic diversity of the population sample studied, and the variety of clinical practice types employed for enrollment of subjects seeking care. Other important attributes of the study were the use of sensitive NAATs to detect all four sexually transmitted organisms and the use of RNA sequencing to detect expression of themacrolide resistance phenotype.

### The rapid diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumonia using in situ hybridization on clinical samples [^1165sz3e]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

The microbiological etiology of seasonal upper respiratory illnesses in the United States is dominated by viruses, including influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV2. Mycoplasma pneumonia, treatable with antibiotics, can also cause upper respiratory symptoms and is typically associated with about 15% of cases. There is no clinical or radiologic finding diagnostic of Mycoplasma pneumonia infection and PCR-based testing is not routinely used in the clinical setting. Further, the bacteria grows slowly in culture and the diagnostic IgM response will take days after the onset of infection. Thus, a rapid diagnostic test for Mycobacterium pneumonia infection is needed. This study documented two cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia infection of the upper respiratory system using in situ hybridization in a series of over 20 patients who were being tested for SARS-CoV2 infection. The respiratory secretions were placed on a glass slide, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and then tested using a Mycoplasma pneumonia probe. The high bacterial number associated with acute infection allowed for straightforward detection by in situ hybridization in a few hours. Antibiotic therapy led to rapid resolution of the symptoms. This highlights the ability of standard in situ hybridization as a rapid diagnostic test for Mycoplasma pneumonia in the clinical setting.

### Molecular methods for the detection of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma infections in humans: a paper from the 2011 william beaumont hospital symposium on molecular pathology [^112adnXo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2012). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species are well-known human pathogens responsible for a broad array of inflammatory conditions involving the respiratory and urogenital tracts of neonates, children, and adults. Greater attention is being given to these organisms in diagnostic microbiology, largely as a result of improved methods for their laboratory detection, made possible by powerful molecular-based techniques that can be used for primary detection in clinical specimens. For slow-growing species, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium, molecular-based detection is the only practical means for rapid microbiological diagnosis. Most molecular-based methods used for detection and characterization of conventional bacteria have been applied to these organisms. A complete genome sequence is available for one or more strains of all of the important human pathogens in the Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma genera. Information gained from genome analyses and improvements in efficiency of DNA sequencing are expected to significantly advance the field of molecular detection and genotyping during the next few years. This review provides a summary and critical review of methods suitable for detection and characterization of mycoplasmas and ureaplasmas of humans, with emphasis on molecular genotypic techniques.

4.2. Mycoplasma contamination

Contamination of cell cultures with mycoplasma was first noted in the 1950s but is still regrettably often disregarded. The following important points should be noted:
Mycoplasma contamination is very frequent, worldwide.
Using mycoplasma-contaminated cells can result in erroneous, misleading or false experimental results.
Owing to lack of visible signs mycoplasma-positive cell cultures can go unnoticed.
Be aware of potential sources of mycoplasma contamination (see Section 4.2.2).
Use good aseptic technique and laboratory practices to avoid mycoplasma contamination.
Have an effective quarantine procedure for all untested cell lines.
Establish a regular and continuous mycoplasma-testing programme.
Scientific journals are starting to ask for evidence of mycoplasma testing before accepting papers for publication.

Mycoplasmas and the related Acholeplasmas (collectively referred to as 'mollicutes') are the smallest and simplest self-replicating bacteria and are significant in that they have become probably the most prevalent and serious microbial contaminant of cell culture systems used in research and industry today. Owing to the absence of any visible morphological changes or other symptoms mycoplasma infection of cell cultures often goes undetected. However, it is the invisible effects of the contamination on the infected cells that makes it such a serious problem. It is therefore essential that routine mycoplasma testing is performed regularly on all research cell lines to ensure the validity of study results before publication. Although > 20 different species of mycoplasma have been isolated from cell cultures, > 95% of infections are caused by six prevalent species, which are the following: M. arginini, M. fermentans, M. hominis, M.hyorhinis, M. orale and Acholeplasma laidlawii.

Although primary cell cultures and early passages are less frequently contaminated with reported incidences of between 1 and 5% continuous cell lines have much higher incidences of between 15 to 35%.

Mycoplasma are unaffected by many of the antibiotics commonly used in cell culture, such as penicillin and can grow to extremely high titres (typically 1 × 10⁷ to 1 × 10⁸ organisms per ml) in mammalian cell cultures without producing any turbidity in the medium, or other obvious symptoms. In addition mycoplasma are extremely small (0.15–0.3 μ m) and pleomorphic, and will pass through standard 0.22- μ m bacteriological filters (0.1- μ m filters are required for sterilisation). The only assured way of detecting mycoplasma contamination is regular testing.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^1173hMPr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Screening

Screening at-risk women for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended in the United States because infections are frequently asymptomatic; robust data exist on risk for sequelae from untreated infections; effective treatment is readily available; and, for chlamydia, data from a randomized trial demonstrated decreased risk for PID in persons screened and treated. M. genitalium meets only 1 of these criteria: infections are frequently asymptomatic (≈30%–60% in clinic populations). Data on the risk for sequelae from untreated M. genitalium infections in women are less robust than data for chlamydia. Prospective studies of sequelae in women are limited, challenging our ability to infer cause. No evidence of adverse sequelae in men exists, although such data are sparse. Given the high rates of macrolide resistance and the advent of fluoroquinolone treatment failures, effective treatment is not readily available for all infected persons (see section on antimicrobial therapies). Finally, randomized controlled trials evaluating whether screening and treatment of M. genitalium infections could prevent PID and perinatal complications are costly; to date, none have been undertaken despite the articulated need. Some population subgroups have higher risk for PID, and screening and treatment in those subgroups might yield greater benefit, but this possibility has not been assessed.

Benefits of Screening for M. genitalium

Screening and effectively treating asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium could theoretically reduce transmission and population-level prevalence. However, reductions in prevalence after implementing screening programs for sexually transmitted infections do not always occur, as demonstrated by increasing chlamydia prevalence in the United States. This increase has been offset by some declines in PID, although PID rates have slightly increased in recent years. If identified infections could be effectively treated while minimizing the selection of resistance, screening could reduce the likelihood of transmitted resistance, leading to subsequent reductions in the population-level prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

Harms of Screening for M. genitalium

If asymptomatic infections do not cause sequelae, screening and treating will result in unnecessary antibiotic exposure. On an individual level, antibiotics might disrupt a person's microbiota and lead to other health conditions, and adverse effects associated with antibiotics are occasionally serious. On a population level, more widespread antibiotic use speeds the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and multidrug-resistant M. genitalium infections are often refractory to treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that treatment-refractory infections can lead to anxiety and depression that would not occur in the absence of screening. Consistent with earlier assessments, screening asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium is not recommended in the 2021 CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines.

### Image-based deep learning in diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumonia on pediatric chest X-rays [^1126gWLe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Correctly diagnosing and accurately distinguishing mycoplasma pneumonia in children has consistently posed a challenge in clinical practice, as it can directly impact the prognosis of affected children. To address this issue, we analyzed chest X-rays (CXR) using various deep learning models to diagnose pediatric mycoplasma pneumonia.

Methods

We collected 578 cases of children with mycoplasma infection and 191 cases of children with virus infection, with available CXR sets. Three deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetv2-S) were used to distinguish mycoplasma pneumonia from viral pneumonia based on CXR. Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Visualization was also achieved through the use of Class Activation Mapping (CAM), providing more transparent and interpretable classification results.

Results

Of the three models evaluated, ResNet50 outperformed the others. Pretrained with the ZhangLabData dataset, the ResNet50 model achieved 80.00% accuracy in the validation set. The model also showed robustness in two test sets, with accuracy of 82.65 and 83.27%, and AUC values of 0.822 and 0.758. In the test results using ImageNet pre-training weights, the accuracy of the ResNet50 model in the validation set was 80.00%; the accuracy in the two test sets was 81.63 and 62.91%; and the corresponding AUC values were 0.851 and 0.776. The sensitivity values were 0.884 and 0.595, and the specificity values were 0.655 and 0.814.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that deep convolutional networks utilizing transfer learning are effective in detecting mycoplasma pneumonia based on chest X-rays (CXR). This suggests that, in the near future, such computer-aided detection approaches can be employed for the early screening of pneumonia pathogens. This has significant clinical implications for the rapid diagnosis and appropriate medical intervention of pneumonia, potentially enhancing the prognosis for affected children.

### Clinical evaluation of a novel point-of-care assay to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae and associated macrolide-resistant mutations [^111RLApX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The recent increase in macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Asia has become a continuing problem. A point-of-care testing method that can quickly detect M. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant mutations (MR mutations) is critical for proper antimicrobial use. Smart Gene (Mizuho Medy Co, Ltd, Tosu City, Saga, Japan) is a compact and inexpensive fully automatic gene analyzer that combines amplification with PCR and the quenching probe method to specify the gene and MR mutations simultaneously. We performed a clinical evaluation of this device and its reagents on pediatric patients with suspected M. pneumoniae respiratory infections and evaluated the impact of the assay on antimicrobial selection. Using real-time PCR as a comparison control, the sensitivity of Smart Gene was 97.8% (44/45), its specificity was 93.3% (98/105), and its overall concordance rate was 94.7% (142/150). The overall concordance rate of Smart Gene diagnosis of MR mutations in comparison with sequence analysis was 100% (48/48). The ratio of MR mutations was significantly higher at high-level medical institutions than at a primary medical clinic (P = 0.023), and changes in antibiotic therapy to drugs other than macrolides were significantly more common in patients with MR mutations (P = 0.00024). Smart Gene demonstrated excellent utility in the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae and the selection of appropriate antimicrobials for MR mutations at primary medical institutions, which play a central role in community-acquired pneumonia care. The use of this device may reduce referrals to high-level medical institutions for respiratory infections, thereby reducing the medical and economic burdens on patients.

### Evaluation of the illumigene Mycoplasma direct DNA amplification assay [^112BubMa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

is a common cause of respiratory tract infections, especially in young adults and school-age children. Diagnosis ofinfection based on a patient's clinical presentation alone is difficult and unreliable. Prompt diagnosis is essential to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection control.

Several methods are utilized fordetection. Culture-based methods are highly specific and sensitive but are time-consuming, and their sensitivity may vary depending on laboratory skills. Serology-based assays (complement fixation assay, enzyme-linked immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and microparticle agglutination assay) are available. The limitations of serology-based assays include a lack of sensitivity due to a delayed antibody response toinfection, a lack of response in older patients, highly prevalent background antibodies in healthy individuals, and cross-reactivity with otherspecies. Rapid antigen kits targeting specific proteins are also being utilized to diagnose. The sensitivity of rapid antigen assays has been reported to vary from 60% to 90%.

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) assays have gained popularity due to increased assay sensitivity, which enables detection at an early stage of infection. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a NAAT assay that is simple, easy to use (no thermocycler is needed), and highly sensitive, with a quick turnaround time. TheMycoplasma (iM) assay (Meridian Bioscience, Inc. Cincinnati, OH) utilizes LAMP technology for the detection offrom throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The primers of this diagnostic kit target a 208-bp DNA sequence found in the intracellular protease-like protein gene of thegenome. A byproduct of the continuous isothermal amplification reaction is magnesium pyrophosphate. This white precipitate leads to turbidity in the reaction mixture. The illumipro-10 incubator/reader monitors the changes in the absorbance characteristics. Significant changes in the absorbance of the reaction mixture indicate the presence of the target gene. A study found the sensitivity and specificity of the iM assay to be 100% and 99%, respectively, compared with the culture method. Another recent study found both sensitivity and specificity of the iM assay to be 100%, compared with the FilmArray respiratory panel (bioMérieux, France).

### Things that could be Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^112EtwH9]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

M. pneumoniae infection gives rise to a wide variety of manifestations. The pathogenesis of secondary manifestations is not always known. Some depend on the direct invasion of M. pneumoniae and others on the indirect effect of M. pneumoniae through pathological immune responses, for instance autoreactive antibodies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Diagnosis remains challenging with currently available diagnostic tests, because they do not demonstrate a causal relation due to M. pneumoniae asymptomatic carriage or previous infection. The mainstay of treatment is macrolide antibiotics, but the role of additional immunomodulation therapy is unclear. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of the different manifestations should guide strategies for diagnosis and treatment.

### Molecular diagnostics update for the emerging (If not already widespread) sexually transmitted infection agent Mycoplasma genitalium: just about ready for prime time [^115gVoTJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an important and emerging agent of sexually transmitted infection in females and males, carrying the potential for postinfection genital tract sequelae.

### Improved diagnostics help to identify clinical features and biomarkers that predict Mycoplasma pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia in children [^112Stu3e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is a common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. There are substantial challenges in differentiating infection from carriage for Mp. Current diagnostic tests, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens or serology, do not reliably differentiate between Mp infection and carriage. Therefore it is not surprising that previous studies found no signs or symptoms to differentiate Mp infection in CAP from other etiology, potentially because Mp detection was misclassified as infection when in fact it was carriage. Mp carriage is estimated to occur in up to 56% of healthy children. Mp infection is generally mild and self-limiting, and patients with Mp CAP are mostly managed in primary care. The lack of a cell wall makes Mp naturally resistant to first-line empirical β-lactam antibiotics for CAP. Empirical macrolide treatment is extensively used to cover potential Mp infection, which has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant Mp and a parallel rise in macrolide resistance in other respiratory pathogens. Therefore, with the challenges in diagnostic testing for Mp and its limited use in the primary care setting, it is essential to determine clinical features and biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of Mp infection in children with CAP.

We recently demonstrated in a prospective cohort study of CAP in children that the measurement of specific peripheral blood immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay improves diagnosis of Mp infection in CAP. This test differentiated between Mp infection and carriage. Using this dataset, we here aimed to identify clinical features and biomarkers associated with Mp CAP, in which infection may be more accurately identified with the measurement of Mp -specific IgM ASCs.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111nwbdL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

M. genitalium is now an established sexually transmitted infection that poses substantial challenges for developing optimal testing and treatment approaches. Antimicrobial resistance has grown rapidly, and untreatable infections have begun to appear. New antimicrobial drugs and better antimicrobial stewardship of existing antibiotics are urgently needed. Resistance-guided therapy is a vital tool to reduce antibiotic pressure and maintain the efficacy of existing antimicrobials. However, only some diagnostic tests incorporate the detection of antimicrobial resistance, limiting our ability to use this tool. Concerns about the rapid spread of resistance have led to recommendations to limit testing and treatment for M. genitalium infections to patients with symptoms. Rigorous and adequately powered clinical trials of screening and treatment of M. genitalium in women are critically needed. Without a better understanding of the natural history of infection, particularly the risk for sequelae, the benefits and harms of testing and treatment approaches cannot be truly weighed.

### Diagnostic efficacy of Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody and procalcitonin in children with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^115h3b7A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We further explored the potential impact of MP-IgM positive children in the control group. Although these children had negative 23 S PCR results, the positive MP-IgM may indicate that they are in the early stages of infection or are asymptomatic carriers. Asymptomatic carriage is relatively common in specific pediatric populations, with a prevalence of 20–50%. This suggests that MP infection may exist even in the absence of symptoms. Therefore, we specifically noted this potential bias in our analysis.

In addressing the limitations of our study, it is important to acknowledge that the retrospective design, while offering valuable insights, may have limited our control over confounding variables and potential biases. The study's reliance on a single hospital setting and a relatively modest sample size further constrains the generalizability of our findings. Such a setting may not fully capture the variability and complexities present in a broader, more diverse population. Additionally, the lack of longitudinal follow-up and potential selection biases inherent in retrospective analyses could have influenced our results. While our findings contribute meaningfully to the understanding of MP antibody and PCT levels in MPP, these limitations underscore the need for further research, possibly incorporating larger, multicenter, and prospective study designs to validate and expand upon our results. Although MP-IgM testing is commonly used for diagnosing MP infections, a single positive IgM result is not sufficient for accurate diagnosis. Acute and convalescent sera are typically required for adequate sensitivity. However, obtaining convalescent serum is often impractical in clinical settings. Therefore, we emphasized the need for caution when interpreting a single IgM positive result and suggested combining IgM results with other diagnostic markers, such as PCT levels, to improve diagnostic accuracy.

While the study did not formally determine the optimal thresholds for PCT and MP antibodies using methods such as the Youden test or utility function, the ROC analysis provided insights into the diagnostic performance of these markers. Future studies should consider these methods to establish more precise diagnostic thresholds. Data on the clinical evolution of cases, including symptom resolution and recovery times, were collected but are not presented in this manuscript due to the focus on diagnostic markers. These data will be included in future analyses. Information on the clinical consequences of delayed diagnosis, such as prolonged hospital stays or complications, was not systematically collected in this study. Future research should focus on the impact of diagnostic delays on patient outcomes.

Key points
- Bacteria called Mycoplasma pneumoniaecan cause respiratory tract infections.
- These infections are generally mild but sometimes can be severe.
- Most will recover without medicine, but some people need antibiotics to get better.
- Call a healthcare provider about difficulty breathing or symptoms that concern you. Types In general, M. pneumoniae infections are mild. Most common: Tracheobronchitis Less common: Pneumonia Quick facts from a U. S. study M. pneumoniaeare a common bacterial cause of the infection. For children, they're the most common cause and, for adults, the second most common cause. Symptoms It can take 1 to 4 weeks for symptoms to appear after someone's been exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms can last for several weeks. Some infected people may have no symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of infection.

Chest cold symptoms Common symptoms include:

- Feeling tired
- Fever
- Headache
- Slowly worsening cough
- Sore throat Younger children may have different symptoms Instead of chest cold symptoms, children younger than 5 years old may have:

- Diarrhea
- Sneezing
- Sore throat
- Stuffy or runny nose
- Vomiting
- Watery eyes
- Wheezing. Complications While uncommon, serious complications can occur that require hospital care. M. pneumoniae infections can cause or make the following conditions worse:

- Asthma attacks or new asthma symptoms
- Encephalitis
- Hemolytic anemia
- Renal dysfunction
- Serious pneumonia
- Skin disorders like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis. Diagnosis There's no quick way to test for M. pneumoniae infections, unlike some other respiratory illnesses.

Instead, healthcare providers often examine the patient and look for signs. They may order a chest x-ray to see if the patient has pneumonia. Most healthcare providers don't test for M. pneumoniae infection. If they do, they'll collect a specimen and send it to a lab. The types of specimens that can be collected include: Most common: A swab from the nose or throat Least common: Blood.

### PCR sensitivity fordetection in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs: a comparative study [^115YAgzD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in school-aged children and adolescents. The mainstay of treatment for MP-induced pneumonia is non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. Given the overlapping symptoms and clinical presentations of LRTI caused by MP with those of respiratory viruses and bacteria (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae), each needing different antimicrobial treatments (i.e. no antimicrobials for viral LRTI and beta-lactam for bacterial pneumonia), a rapid and accurate diagnosis of causal pathogens is critical.

Although obtaining the best sample is crucial for the accurate diagnosis of MP and timely and appropriate treatment, the effect of sample type on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of MP has rarely been investigated. Given the relative lack of evidence regarding optimal sampling type for PCR detection of MP, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other guidelines accept both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples for MP detection. However, to our knowledge, the largest comparative study conducted to date on PCR detection of MP using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs included only 58 MP-positive patients. Moreover, the DNA load was not evaluated in this study. Consequently, data with a larger sample size and bacterial quantification could provide a more detailed evaluation of the factors responsible for the discrepancy in detection using different sampling methods. To establish evidence regarding the optimal sample to detect MP, further studies with a larger sample size, along with measurement of DNA load, are needed.

Diagnostic performance is not only affected by the sampling method but also by other factors, including prior antimicrobial treatment and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Macrolide-resistant MP is an emerging global issue. Evaluation of the impact of these factors on diagnostic performance and DNA load could help develop an optimal diagnostic strategy for MP. The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PCR detection of MP as well as the DNA loads of MP between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of prior antimicrobial therapy as well as the impact of the presence of macrolide-resistance gene mutations on bacterial load.

### Submitting specimens for Mycoplasma pneumoniae testing… [^116vHL55]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- CDC primarily uses nucleic acid amplification tests to identify Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
- CDC tests specimens identified as positive for M. pneumoniaefor macrolide susceptibility.
- CDC doesn't use culture or serological testing as routine diagnostic methods.
- CDC only accepts specimens from state public health laboratories and other federal agencies. Specimen acceptance criteria CDC only accepts certain specimen types for M. pneumoniae testing from public health laboratories and other federal agencies. Healthcare providers should contact the public health laboratory for their jurisdiction to arrange for specimen submission. Public health laboratories can forward approved specimens to CDC for specialized testing. Specimen, documentation, packaging, and shipping Specimen requirements vary by the specific molecular detection test requested. The following links provide information on specimen, documentation, packaging, and shipping requirements:

Common rejection criteria CDC's laboratory most commonly rejects specimens for M. pneumoniae testing for the following reasons:

- Specimens stored, shipped, or received at incorrect temperatures.
- Improperly labeled specimens. Specimen collection protocol Healthcare providers may collect different respiratory specimen types depending on the test that will be performed. Some studies suggest that oropharyngeal swab may be better for detection of M. pneumoniae compared to nasopharyngeal swab. Adherence to proper specimen collection technique is important for accurate test results. For oropharyngeal swab specimens Insert swab into the posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas. Rub swab over both tonsillar pillars and posterior oropharynx and avoid touching the tongue, teeth, and gums. For nasopharyngeal swab specimens Insert flexible shaft swab through the nares parallel to the palate until it contacts the nasopharynx.

Indications of contact include encountering resistance and the distance equaling that from the ear to the patient's nostril. Gently rub and roll the swab.

### Isothermal detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae directly from respiratory clinical specimens [^117LctRz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) across patient populations of all ages. We have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that enables rapid, low-cost detection of M. pneumoniae from nucleic acid extracts and directly from various respiratory specimen types. The assay implements calcein to facilitate simple visual readout of positive results in approximately 1 h, making it ideal for use in primary care facilities and resource-poor settings. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 100 fg by testing serial dilutions of target DNA ranging from 1 ng to 1 fg per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was observed against 17 other Mycoplasma species, 27 common respiratory agents, or human DNA. We demonstrated the utility of this assay by testing nucleic acid extracts (n = 252) and unextracted respiratory specimens (n = 72) collected during M. pneumoniae outbreaks and sporadic cases occurring in the United States from February 2010 to January 2014. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was 88.5% tested on extracted nucleic acid and 82.1% evaluated on unextracted clinical specimens compared to a validated real-time PCR test. Further optimization and improvements to this method may lead to the availability of a rapid, cost-efficient laboratory test for M. pneumoniae detection that is more widely available to primary care facilities, ultimately facilitating prompt detection and appropriate responses to potential M. pneumoniae outbreaks and clusters within the community.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with and without community-acquired pneumonia. what do PCR and serology say? [^1128fm9A]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

IgM titers of Mycoplasma pneumoniae can remain high for months or years, and specific DNA can be detected in asymptomatic people.

Methods

We compared the performance of serology and PCR in children with and without community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae.

Results

In children with CAP, a positive test by M. pneumoniae (PCR and/or paired serology or both) were found in 13.9%. Of these, 10.3% were positive by multiplex PCR (Seeplex-Seegen), and 6.7% exhibited quadrupled titers (22 for IgG, 6 for IgM and 5 for both). Both tests were positive in 2.8% of cases. In the group without CAP, 3.3% were positive by PCR. Thirty-two percent of children with CAP and 38.3% of healthy children had IgM titers > 11 in the acute phase.

Conclusions

The detection of IgM is not useful for diagnosing acute M. pneumoniae infection, and a positive PCR result can be due to colonization and not infection. New and better diagnostic techniques are required.

### Global trends in the proportion of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bkYC4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

In the studies examined here, the diverse types of variants associated with MRMP infection were reported. Data pertaining to secondary outcomes were extracted when available. Data on study author, publication year, study periods, study country, participants' age, participants' sex, detection methods of macrolide resistance of M pneumoniae, number of study population, types of respiratory tract infection (RTI; eg, upper RTI or pneumonia), proportion of MRMP infections, and variant types of MRMP infection were extracted. We could not obtain information on some of these items depending on the studies.

Three reviewers (K.K. S.J. and E.L.) independently assessed the quality of the included studies for risk of bias using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline in 5 items: sample population, sample size, participation rate, outcome assessment, and analytical methods to control for bias (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We resolved disagreement by discussion with a fourth author (H.-J.Y.) and other authors who were not involved in assessment of the quality of studies for bias risk in the first step.

Statistical Analysis

We used random-effects meta-analyses to calculate the proportion of MRMP infections. The I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity in the results of individual studies, and an I² statistic greater than 50% was used as a threshold indicating significant heterogeneity. The Egger test was used to assess potential publication bias. For studies that were performed for more than 2 years without proportion information provided by year, we used the midpoint of the study period owing to heterogeneity in the study year and study period. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which overall summary estimates were restricted to studies of CAP due to M pneumoniae in children. We performed subgroup analyses by time period, World Health Organization (WHO) geographical regions, variant types associated with macrolide resistance of M pneumoniae, age groups (children, adults, and studies including both children and adults), and types of RTI (any RTI vs CAP). The Mann-Kendall trend test was used to identify the consistently increasing or decreasing trend in the proportion of MRMP infections over time.

### Comparison of laboratory diagnostic procedures for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in community outbreaks [^111QqYnj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae continues to be a significant cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). A more definitive methodology for reliable detection of M. pneumoniae is needed to identify outbreaks and to prevent potentially fatal extrapulmonary complications.

Methods

We analyzed 2 outbreaks of CAP due to M. pneumoniae. Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab specimens and serum samples were obtained from persons with clinically defined cases, household contacts, and asymptomatic individuals. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. pneumoniae was performed on all swab specimens, and the diagnostic utility was compared with that of 2 commercially available serologic test kits.

Results

For cases, 21% yielded positive results with real-time PCR, whereas 81% and 54% yielded positive results with the immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M serologic tests, respectively. For noncases, 1.8% yielded positive results with real-time PCR, whereas 63% and 79% yielded serologically positive results with the immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M kits, respectively. The sensitivity of real-time PCR decreased as the duration between symptom onset and sample collection increased, with a peak sensitivity of 48% at 0–21 days. A specificity of 43% for the immunoglobulin M antibody detection assay was observed for persons aged 10–18 years, but the sensitivity increased to 82% for persons aged 19 years.

Discussion

Thorough data analysis indicated that no single available test was reliable for the identification of an outbreak of CAP due to M. pneumoniae. A combination of testing methodologies proved to be the most reliable approach for identification of outbreaks of CAP due to M. pneumoniae, especially in the absence of other suspected respiratory pathogens.

### Evaluation of five real-time PCR assays for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^116Ssozn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Four commercial real-time PCR assays to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae were tested, and the results were compared with the results for an in-house approach. Despite differences of crossing threshold values of up to 4, assays were able to detect at least 20 CFU/5 μl (52 fg DNA/5 μl) of sample with the Diagenode kit showing the best clinical sensitivity.

### Diagnostic utility and clinical significance of naso-and oropharyngeal samples used in a PCR assay to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^112LQZpp]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

PCR assays of naso- and oropharyngeal samples among hospitalized children appear equally effective for the diagnosis of serologically confirmed community-acquired mycoplasmal pneumonia. However, the combination of results from both sites yields optimal sensitivity (57%), specificity (98%), and positive (92%) and negative (82%) predictive values when compared with Mycoplasma pneumoniae enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

### Nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of pneumonia [^115EU9B4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are promising tools for the rapid etiological diagnosis of pneumonia. PCR offers potential advantages over conventional tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella species, and Chlamydia pneumoniae. For pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, PCR adds little to existing diagnostic tests and is unable to distinguish pneumococcal colonization from infection when testing respiratory samples. Although PCR is probably more sensitive than are conventional microscopy-based methods for diagnosing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the specificity is uncertain, because P. carinii can occasionally be detected in the absence of clinical symptoms. PCR is useful for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. Further work is required to better characterize the role of PCR versus the role of other tests for diagnosing pneumonia and to develop standard PCR assays that can be readily adopted by routine diagnostic laboratories.

### Diagnostic assessment of Mycoplasma genitalium in culture-positive women [^1151nh1k]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Detection of Mycoplasma genitalium-mediated, chlamydia-negative nongonococcal urethritis and other M. genitalium-linked infectious etiologies has been very challenging. Although M. genitalium is considered a leading cause of genitourinary symptoms in men and women, extreme difficulties in its cultivation due to its highly fastidious nature and the lack of routine and effective diagnostic tests have slowed the generation of clinical data which directly implicate the presence of M. genitalium in disease pathogenesis. In this study, we compared enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and immunoblot and PCR assays in M. genitalium culture-positive women over 1 to 3 years of clinical visits to determine the usefulness of independent diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, the value of combinatorial diagnostic assessments is described, which provides insights into the dynamics of M. genitalium-host interactions. Overall, we show that neither ELISA nor PCR, alone or in combination, provides the sensitivity required to confidently predict the existence of viable M. genitalium organisms in cervical and vaginal samples. Additionally, culture-positive women exhibited a range of antibody responsiveness to M. genitalium based upon ELISA and immunoblot assessments, indicating immune diversity among this high-risk population.
