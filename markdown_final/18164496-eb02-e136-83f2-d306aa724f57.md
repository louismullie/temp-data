## Question

Intestinal lactase deficiency leads to lactose maldigestion which subsequently can lead to lactose intolerance, i.e. causing clinical symptoms. Infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms. Overall, adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters. What is the approximate percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide?

Answer Choices:
A. 45%-50%
B. 70%-75%
C. 10%-15%
D. 30%-35%

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of the world's adult population are lactase non-persisters, i.e., have primary adult hypolactasia leading to lactose malabsorption. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between lactase persistence and non-persistence and how that translates to lactose malabsorption. Then, I should verify the most authoritative global prevalence estimates and whether they refer to malabsorption or non-persistence. Next, I will check for methodological differences across studies and how they might shift the numbers. Finally, I will reconcile any discrepancies and map the best-supported figure to the answer choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Lactase non-persistence, also called adult-type hypolactasia, is the normal physiological pattern in which intestinal lactase activity declines after weaning, resulting in incomplete lactose digestion and lactose malabsorption; lactase persistence is the less common, genetically determined continuation of high lactase activity into adulthood, concentrated in certain populations.

> Now, I should verify the most authoritative estimate. The 2017 Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology systematic review and meta-analysis, which synthesized data from 450 study populations across 89 countries, reported a global lactose malabsorption prevalence of 68% with a 95% CI of 64–72%, and when restricted to genotyping data, the estimate was 74% (69–80), which aligns closely with the biology of non-persistence [^1113EWuG].

> Wait, let me verify whether these figures reflect non-persistence versus just malabsorption. The Lancet analysis explicitly quantifies lactose malabsorption, which is the functional consequence of lactase non-persistence; thus, the 68–74% range is a direct proxy for the proportion of adults who are lactase non-persisters, acknowledging that a minority of malabsorbers may be asymptomatic and that testing modality can modestly influence estimates [^1113EWuG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for corroborating sources. A contemporaneous JAMA Clinical Approach notes that acquired primary lactase deficiency affects 65% to 74% of the worldwide population, which matches the Lancet range and reinforces that the best-supported estimate hovers around two-thirds globally [^111Sc2JX].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating regional variation with the global figure. The Lancet shows marked regional differences, with lower malabsorption in parts of Europe and higher rates in many Asian, African, and Middle Eastern regions, yet the pooled global estimate remains approximately 68–74% depending on the testing method, which supports choosing the 70–75% band as the closest match among the options [^1113EWuG].

> Let me reconsider the answer choices against this evidence. Options of 10–15% and 30–35% are too low and inconsistent with the high-quality meta-analytic data, whereas 45–50% still underestimates the global burden; 70–75% aligns with the genotyping-based estimate and the upper end of the overall pooled estimate, making it the most defensible choice here [^1113EWuG] [^111Sc2JX].

> Final answer: B. 70%–75%.

---

The correct answer is **B. 70%–75%**. Approximately 70–75% of adults worldwide are lactase non-persistent, meaning they lose lactase activity after weaning and are prone to lactose maldigestion and intolerance [^1113EWuG] [^111Sc2JX]. Prevalence varies by region, with lower rates in Northern Europe and higher rates in Asia, Africa, and Latin America [^1113EWuG].

---

## Physiological basis of lactase persistence and non-persistence

Lactase persistence reflects continued high lactase activity into adulthood, whereas **lactase non-persistence** is the normal decline after weaning [^111Sc2JX]. This decline reduces lactose digestion and can cause maldigestion and intolerance when lactose is consumed [^111Sc2JX].

---

## Global prevalence of lactase non-persistence

The most comprehensive estimate, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis, reports a **global prevalence of lactose malabsorption of 68% (95% CI 64–72)** [^1113EWuG], with genotyping-based estimates at 74% (69–80) [^1113EWuG]. This aligns with the commonly cited 70–75% figure for adult lactase non-persistence [^111Sc2JX].

---

## Regional and ethnic variations

Prevalence varies widely by region and ancestry:

| **Region/ethnic group** | **Prevalence of lactase non-persistence** |
|-|-|
| Northern Europe | 5–20% |
| Southern Europe | 40–60% |
| Middle East | 60–80% |
| Asia | 85–100% |
| Africa | 70–90% |
| Indigenous populations of the Americas | 80–100% |

---

These patterns reflect **genetic differences** in lactase persistence, with higher persistence in populations with a history of dairy farming [^1113EWuG].

---

## Clinical implications

Lactase non-persistence causes lactose maldigestion, but not all with maldigestion have symptoms; about 30–50% report symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence [^111Sc2JX]. Symptom severity depends on dose, gastric emptying, and colonic adaptation [^111Sc2JX].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Lactase non-persistence is assessed by:

- **Hydrogen breath test**: noninvasive and widely used [^1113EWuG].
- **Lactose tolerance test**: measures blood glucose after lactose ingestion [^1113EWuG].
- **Genetic testing**: detects lactase persistence variants (e.g. -13910 C > T) [^1113EWuG].

---

## Management strategies

Management is individualized: dietary modification (limiting lactose, using lactase supplements, or choosing lactose-free products) is common, and **calcium and vitamin D intake** should be ensured when dairy is restricted [^111Sc2JX].

---

## Conclusion

Approximately **70–75% of adults worldwide are lactase non-persistent**, with significant regional variation [^1113EWuG] [^111Sc2JX]. This prevalence underpins the global burden of lactose maldigestion and guides dietary counseling and public health planning.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction — ICD implantation recommendations state that consideration of ICD implantation is recommended in patients with EF less than or equal to 30% with mild to moderate symptoms and anticipated survival with good functional capacity beyond 1 year; documentation of sustained EF reduction despite beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should precede consideration. ICDs are not warranted in refractory HF symptoms (Stage D) or when comorbid illnesses would independently limit life expectancy. Management of patients with EF between 30% and 35% remains controversial; for coronary artery disease, risk stratification may include programmed electrical stimulation to demonstrate inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). In idiopathic cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% to 35%, the physician might want to continue intensive medical therapy before giving consideration to ICD implantation.

Importance

Clinical trials of prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have included a minority of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30% and 35%. Because a large number of ICDs in the United States are implanted in such patients, it is important to study survival associated with this therapy.

Objective

To characterize patients with LVEF between 30% and 35% and compare the survival of those with and without ICDs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD registry (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007) with an LVEF between 30% and 35% who received an ICD during a heart failure hospitalization and similar patients in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) database (January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009) with no ICD. The analysis was repeated in patients with an LVEF less than 30%. There were 3120 patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35% (816 in matched cohorts) and 4578 with an LVEF less than 30% (2176 in matched cohorts). Propensity score matching and Cox models were applied.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; data were obtained from Medicare claims through December 31, 2011.

Results

There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the matched groups (n = 408 for both groups). Among patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35%, there were 248 deaths in the ICD Registry group, within a median follow-up of 4.4 years (interquartile range, 2.7–4.9) and 249 deaths in the GWTG HF group, within a median follow-up of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 2.1–4.4). The risk of all-cause mortality in patients with an LVEF between 30% and 35% and an ICD was significantly lower than that in matched patients without an ICD (3-year mortality rates: 51.4% vs 55.0%; hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69–0.99]; P = 0.04). Presence of an ICD also was associated with better survival in patients with an LVEF less than 30% (3-year mortality rates: 45.0% vs 57.6%; 634 and 660 total deaths; hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.65–0.81]; P < .001) (P = 0.20 for interaction).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure and with an LVEF between 30% and 35% and less than 30%, survival at 3 years was better in patients who received a prophylactic ICD than in comparable patients with no ICD. These findings support guideline recommendations to implant prophylactic ICDs in eligible patients with an LVEF of 35% or less.

Milk and total fat percentage targets in children and adults: The current NCEP guidelines recommend that adults consume 25–35 percent of calories from fat, and the 2010 DGA includes the IOM recommendation for 30–40 percent for ages 1–3 years, 25–35 percent for ages 4–18 years, and 20–35 percent for adults. Consumption of fat-free milk in childhood at age 2 years and through adolescence optimizes these benefits without compromising nutrient quality while avoiding excess saturated fat and calorie intake (Grade A). Between ages 1 and 2 years, milk reduced in fat (ranging from 2 percent milk to fat-free milk) can be used based on growth, appetite, intake of other nutrient-dense foods and other sources of fat, and risk for obesity and CVD, but milk with reduced fat should be used only in the context of an overall diet that supplies 30 percent of calories from fat; dietary intervention should be tailored to each specific child's needs.

### Supplemental vitamin D increases serum cytokines in those with initially low 25-hydroxyvitamin D: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study [^11783dN5]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine if vitamin D status before supplementation influences the cytokine response after supplemental vitamin D. Forty-six reportedly healthy adults (mean(SD); age, 32(7) y; body mass index (BMI), 25.3(4.5) kg/m(2); serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 34.8(12.2) ng/mL) were randomly assigned (double blind) to one of three groups: (1) placebo (n = 15), or supplemental vitamin D (cholecalciferol) at (2) 4000 (n = 14) or (3) 8000IU (n = 17). Supplements were taken daily for 35days. Fasting blood samples were obtained before (Baseline, Bsl) and 35-days after (35-d) supplementation. Serum 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), cytokines, and intact parathyroid hormone with calcium were measured in each blood sample. Supplemental vitamin D increased serum 25(OH)D (4000IU, ≈29%; 8000IU, ≈57%) and 1,25(OH)D (4000IU, ≈12%; 8000IU, ≈38%) without altering intact parathyroid hormone or calcium. The vitamin D metabolite increases in the supplemental vitamin D groups (n = 31) were dependent on initial levels as serum 25(OH)D (r = -0.63, p < 0.05) and 1,25(OH)D (r = -0.45, p < 0.05) at Bsl correlated with their increases after supplementation. Supplemental vitamin D increased interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 in subjects that were vitamin D insufficient (serum 25(OH)D < 29ng/mL) compared to sufficient (serum 25(OH)D⩾30ng/mL) at Bsl. We conclude that supplemental vitamin D increase a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine in those with initially low serum 25(OH)D.

Vitamin D use in nonpregnant adults aged < 50 years — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. Technical remark: This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily). Background notes that levels of 25(OH)D lower than 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) were seen in 14% of Europeans and lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in 40%, and in the United States, 24% and 6% of adults have 25(OH)D levels lower than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), respectively; numerous studies have found associations between low 25(OH)D levels, low BMD, and fractures, low 25(OH)D levels have also been associated with fatigue and higher risks for respiratory infections, and the age span of 18 to 50 years is when peak bone mass occurs.

Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD 1) — age 12–24 months: Transition to reduced-fat* (2% to fat-free) unflavored cow's milk** (see Supportive Actions bullet 1), and limit/avoid sugar-sweetened beverage intake; encourage water. Transition to table food with total fat 30% of daily kcal/EER**, saturated fat 8–10% of daily kcal/EER, avoid trans fat as much as possible, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat up to 20% of daily kcal/EER, and cholesterol < 300 mg/d. Supportive actions include that the fat content of cow's milk to introduce at ages 12–24 months should be decided together by parents and health care providers based on the child's growth, appetite, intake of other nutrient-dense foods, intake of other sources of fat, and potential risk for obesity and CVD; limit 100% fruit juice (from a cup) no more than 4 oz/d; limit sodium intake; and consider DASH-type diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat/fat-free milk and milk products; lower in sugar. Continued breastfeeding is still appropriate and nutritionally superior to cow's milk, milk reduced in fat should be used only in the context of an overall diet that supplies 30% of calories from fat, and EER = Estimated Energy Requirements/d for age/gender.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Immune correlates analysis of the PREVENT-19 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial [^1177c5YL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

For all three markers, vaccine efficacy increases with D35 level

Figure 5 shows the estimated vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 (from 7 to 59 days post-D35) across a range of levels of each D35 antibody marker. [The causal parameter being estimated is one minus the probability of COVID-19 by 59 days for the vaccine group supposing the D35 marker is set to a given level for all vaccine recipients, divided by the probability of COVID-19 by 59 days for all baseline negative per-protocol placebo recipients; see the SAP (Section 11) for details.] Estimated vaccine efficacy increased with the level of each D35 marker. At three selected D35 spike IgG concentration values covering the span of values (100, 1000, and 6934 BAU/ml), estimated VE was 65.5% (23.0%, 90.8%), 87.7% (77.7%, 94.4%), and 94.8% (88.0%, 97.9%), respectively. At three selected D35 RBD IgG concentration values (100, 1000, and 9801 BAU/ml), estimated VE was 60.5% (−4.1%, 90.0%), 86.1% (74.8%, 93.8%), and 95.1% (88.7%, 98.4%), respectively. At four selected nAb ID50 titers (50, 100, 1000, and 7230 IU50/ml), estimated VE was 75.7% (49.8%, 93.2%), 81.7% (66.3%, 93.2%), 92.8% (85.1%, 97.4%) and 96.8% (88.3%, 99.3%), respectively. Additionally, the D35 marker values associated with 80 and 90% VE were: spike IgG, 340 BAU/ml (< LLOQ = 1.35, 1287) and 1577 BAU/ml (26, > ULOQ = 6934), respectively; RBD IgG, 456 BAU/ml (< LLOQ = 30.6, 1595) and 2185 BAU/ml (100, > ULOQ = 9801), respectively; and nAb ID50, 81 IU50/ml (< LOD = 2.612, 369) and 444 IU50/ml (< LOD = 2.612, > 7230), respectively. A causal sensitivity analysis using the same methodology and implementation as used in the correlates analyses of the COVE and ENSEMBLE trials supported that vaccine efficacy increased with each marker after accounting for potential unmeasured confounding of the effect of the D35 antibody marker on occurrence of COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Maternal vitamin D ₃ supplementation at 50 μ g / D protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation [^114P9uS9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown.

Objectives

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (> 30, > 40, > 50, and > 75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

Design

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

Results

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-μg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-μg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-μg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-μg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^116zpQfr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Nutritional optimization — perioperative management in cirrhosis: Preoperative nutritional optimization in patients with cirrhosis includes high-calorie (30–35 kcal/kg/d) and high-protein (1.25–1.5 g/kg/d) intake, initiated ideally at least 2 weeks prior to surgery, and nutritional consultation and nasoenteric feeding may be required. Limited data suggest that perioperative nutritional support initiated 14 days before surgery may reduce major postoperative morbidity rates in patients with cirrhosis (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.96). Patients should consume at least 30–35 kcal/kg calories per day and 1.25–1.5 g/kg per day of protein, and protein intake should not be restricted in patients with hepatic encephalopathy; preoperative nutrition consultation and placement of a nasoenteric tube may be needed, and the latter is not contraindicated by the presence of nonbleeding esophageal varices. In patients with cirrhosis-related frailty and sarcopenia, prehabilitation programs may be considered prior to elective surgery, and such programs have been demonstrated to decrease incidence of postoperative complications and reduce health care utilization in heterogeneous cohorts, including those waitlisted for liver transplantation.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 positivity and severity of the disease [^116UdpYE]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study examined the relationship between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positivity and clinical outcomes of vitamin D levels measured within the 6 months before the PCR test in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 (227) and non-COVID-19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0-10ng/ml), Group II (10-20ng/ml), Group III (20-30ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019-November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID-19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID-19-positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20–80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non-COVID-19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18–75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID-19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23–80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non-COVID-19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20–75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID-19-positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of > 30ng/ml had significantly lower D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID-19 PCR positivity, D-dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID-19-positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID-19.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114kVDUt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — vitamin D for adults with prediabetes: In adults with prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Technical remarks specify that lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes, and that trials primarily related to adults with high-risk prediabetes identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge). Across trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels reported that the baseline mean 25(OH)D level in the 11 trials was 12 to 28 ng/mL (30–70 nmol/L), and among trials without baseline 25(OH)D as an eligibility criterion the baseline mean level of 25(OH)D was 18 to 28 ng/mL (45–70 nmol/L).

Interindividual Variability in Serum 25(OH)D Levels Achieved at 1 Year

Scrutiny of the individual serum 25(OH)D values at 1 year, and the difference in 25(OH)D levels between 12 months and baseline, reveal high variability in the magnitude and direction of response to both doses (Fig. 1). To evaluate the impact of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels and dose on the response to therapy, we performed regression analyses of the change (delta) in serum 25(OH)D level with changing baseline 25(OH)D levels, for each dose. As the baseline 25(OH)D levels increased, the change in serum 25(OH)D levels at 1 year decreased, with both doses (Fig. 4A). However, for any baseline serum 25(OH)D level, there could be substantial variance and overlap in the delta vitamin D achieved, within and between treatment groups (Fig. 4A). The mean increment with the low dose was 6 ng/mL, with a wide range from −13 to 26 ng/mL (Fig. 4B), and 15 ng/mL with the high dose, ranging between −13 and 41 ng/mL (Fig. 4C).

The 25(OH)D delta/100 IU was 1.00 ± 1.26 ng/mL in the low dose, and less than half, with a mean of 0.41 ± 0.27 in the high dose, (P < 0.001) in unadjusted analyses. This variable did not significantly differ by gender or BMI cutoff categories (above vs below 30kg/m 2) (Supplement 2). The 25(OH)D delta/100 IU was 0.99 ± 0.70 ng/mL in the low dose arm after adjusting for baseline 25(OH)D level.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114hqviD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

3.4 Concordance of CSF Tumor Marker Response With EANO‐ESMO Response Assessment

A total of 167 events from 71 LM patients in the training were eligible for EANO‐ESMO response assessment. Among these, 33 events (19.8%) were assessed as response, 59 events (35.3%) as stable, and 75 events (44.9%) as progression (Table S5). We defined three patterns of CSF tumor marker response based on maxTML with different thresholds: (1) response; (2) stable; and (3) progression. MaxTML reductions of ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 30%, or ≥ 35%, respectively, were used as thresholds for determining response. Similarly, maxTML increases of ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 30%, or ≥ 35%, respectively, were used as thresholds for determining progression, and ranges encompassing −15% to 15%, −20% to 20%, −25% to 25%, −30% to 30%, and −35% to 35%, respectively, for stable.

Lactose malabsorption results from congenital lactase deficiency, secondary lactose intolerance, and, most commonly, from acquired primary lactase deficiency, a highly prevalent condition affecting 65% to 74% of the worldwide population, with wide regional and ethnic variations. 1, 2 Symptoms arising from lactose malabsorption result from fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen driven by an osmotic gradient and subsequent fermentation of lactose by bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract. In this article we review the development of clinical lactose intolerance, diagnostic testing, and treatment of individuals presenting with symptoms of lactose intolerance.

Vitamin D Metabolism and Mechanism of Action

Metabolism

Vitamin D 3 is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D 2 and D 3 are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D 3 23) hydroxy forms 24,25(OH) 2 D 2/3, 23,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 2/3 (or 1,23,25(OH) 3 D 3). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH) 2 D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

Data are in-trial from the full analysis set. sema, semaglutide.

We reported in the primary SELECT analysis that serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by 2,941 patients (33.4%) in the semaglutide arm and by 3,204 patients (36.4%) in the placebo arm (P < 0.001). For this study, we analyzed SAE rates by person-years of treatment exposure for BMI classes (< 30 kg m − 2, 30 to < 35 kg m − 2, 35 to < 40 kg m − 2, and ≥ 40 kg m − 2) and provide these data in Supplementary Table 2. We also provide an analysis of the most common categories of SAEs. Semaglutide was associated with lower SAEs, primarily driven by CV event and infections. Within each obesity class (< 30 kg m − 2, 30 to < 35 kg m − 2, 35 to < 40 kg m − 2, and ≥ 40 kg m − 2), there were fewer SAEs in the group receiving semaglutide compared with placebo. Rates (events per 100 years of observation) of SAEs were 43.23, 43.54, 51.07 and 47.06 for semaglutide and 50.48, 49.66, 52.73 and 60.85 for placebo, with no evidence of heterogeneity. There was no detectable difference in hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal SAEs comparing semaglutide with placebo in any of the four BMI classes we evaluated.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney function in adults with prediabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^115B84j3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration has been associated with higher levels of proteinuria and lower levels of eGFR in observational studies. In the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study, we investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney outcomes in a population with prediabetes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Overweight/obese adults with high risk for type 2 diabetes (defined by meeting two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes) were randomized to vitamin D 3 4000 IU per day versus placebo. Median duration of treatment was 2.9 years (interquartile range 2.0–3.5 years). Kidney outcomes included (1) worsening in Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk score (low, moderate, high, very high) on two consecutive follow-up visits after the baseline visit and (2) mean changes in eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).

Results

Among 2166 participants (mean age 60 years, body mass index 32 kg/m 2, serum 25(OH)D 28 ng/ml, eGFR 87 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, UACR 11 mg/g, 79% with hypertension), 10% had moderate, high, or very high KDIGO risk score. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years, there were 28 cases of KDIGO worsening in the vitamin D group and 30 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52 to 1.52]). Mean difference in eGFR from baseline was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.3 to -0.7) in the vitamin D group and -0.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -0.4 to 0.2) in the placebo group; between-group difference was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.6). Mean difference in UACR was 2.7 mg/g (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) in the vitamin D group and 2.0 (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.6) in the placebo group; between-group difference was 0.7 mg/g (95% CI, -1.5 to 2.9).

Conclusions

Among persons with prediabetes, who were not preselected on the basis of serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D supplementation did not affect progression of KDIGO risk scores and did not have a meaningful effect on change in UACR or eGFR.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111cVBdt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Early changes in liver distribution following implementation of share 35 [^112E1X3y]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

In June 2013, a change to the liver waitlist priority algorithm was implemented. Under Share 35, regional candidates with MELD ≥ 35 receive higher priority than local candidates with MELD < 35. We compared liver distribution and mortality in the first 12 months of Share 35 to an equivalent time period before. Under Share 35, new listings with MELD ≥ 35 increased slightly from 752 (9.2% of listings) to 820 (9.7%, p = 0.3), but the proportion of deceased-donor liver transplants (DDLTs) allocated to recipients with MELD ≥ 35 increased from 23.1% to 30.1% (p < 0.001). The proportion of regional shares increased from 18.9% to 30.4% (p < 0.001). Sharing of exports was less clustered among a handful of centers (Gini coefficient decreased from 0.49 to 0.34), but there was no evidence of change in CIT (p = 0.8). Total adult DDLT volume increased from 4133 to 4369, and adjusted odds of discard decreased by 14% (p = 0.03). Waitlist mortality decreased by 30% among patients with baseline MELD > 30 (SHR = 0.70, p < 0.001) with no change for patients with lower baseline MELD (p = 0.9). Posttransplant length-of-stay (p = 0.2) and posttransplant mortality (p = 0.9) remained unchanged. In the first 12 months, Share 35 was associated with more transplants, fewer discards, and lower waitlist mortality, but not at the expense of CIT or early posttransplant outcomes.

### Liver transplantation after share 35: impact on pretransplant and posttransplant costs and mortality [^115BKspM]. Liver Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Share 35 was implemented in 2013 to direct livers to the most urgent candidates by prioritizing Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) ≥ 35 patients. We aim to evaluate this policy's impact on costs and mortality. Our study includes 834 wait-listed patients and 338 patients who received deceased donor, solitary liver transplants at Mayo Clinic between January 2010 and December 2014. Of these patients, 101 (30%) underwent transplantation after Share 35. After Share 35, 29 (28.7%) MELD ≥ 35 patients received transplants, as opposed to 46 (19.4%) in the pre-Share 35 era (P = 0.06). No significant difference in 90-day wait-list mortality (P = 0.29) nor 365-day posttransplant mortality (P = 0.68) was found between patients transplanted before or after Share 35. Mean costs were $3,049 (P = 0.30), $5226 (P = 0.18), and $10,826 (P = 0.03) lower post-Share 35 for the 30-, 90-, and 365-day pretransplant periods, and mean costs were $5010 (P = 0.41) and $5859 (P = 0.57) higher, and $9145 (P = 0.54) lower post-Share 35 for the 30-, 90-, and 365-day posttransplant periods. In conclusion, the added cost of transplanting more MELD ≥ 35 patients may be offset by pretransplant care cost reduction. Despite shifting organs to critically ill patients, Share 35 has not impacted mortality significantly. Liver Transplantation 23:11–18 2017 AASLD.

### Obese living kidney donors: a comparison of hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic versus laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy [^116MFw2x]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Comparison between donors with BMI 30–35 versus with BMI ≥ 35

The results of comparison between donors with BMI 30–35 and with BMI ≥ 35 are shown in Table 3. 176 donors (85.9%) were identified having BMI 30–35 and 29 (14.2%) having BMI ≥ 35. No significant differences between the groups were found in terms of demographic characteristics and operative factors. Regarding postoperative outcome, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of major complications (1.7% vs. 3.5%, P = 0.56) and the LOS (3 days vs. 3 days, P = 0.68). The results of kidney function showed no significant differences between the groups. At 1 year after nephrectomy, rise in creatinine and decline in eGFR were similar between donor BMI categories.

Comparison between donors with BMI < 30 versus with BMI ≥ 30 using the propensity score matching

Donor characteristics before and after PSM are demonstrated in Table 4. Donors with BMI ≥ 30 were younger and had higher ASA and more hypertension than donors with BMI < 30. In addition, LDN was much common in donors with BMI < 30 than those with BMI ≥ 30 (77.9% vs 33.2%, P < 0.001). After PSM, both groups were well adjusted for matched variables. The receiver- operating characteristic curve area under curve was 0.778. Postoperative outcomes and kidney function were not significantly different between the groups.

### An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications [^115gJzN8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen exposure and persistently high FENO — recommendation and considerations: We recommend accounting for persistent and/or high allergen exposure as a factor associated with higher levels of FENO (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Persistently high FENO (> 50 ppb in adults, 35 ppb in children) may result from poor adherence to ICS therapy, poor inhaled drug delivery, or continued exposure to allergen, and continuing or increasing exposure to aeroallergens may result in a rise in FENO or the persistence of an elevated FENO; the magnitude of the effect may be sufficient for FENO levels to increase beyond the cut point of 50 ppb, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. However, if the patient is asymptomatic and has a high FENO, then no change in treatment is required, and levels greater than 50 ppb in a well-treated asymptomatic patient may be "normal" for that specific patient.

BMI and associations with clinical and neonatal outcomes in different patients' subgroups

Adjust for: age of men and women, type of infertility, infertility factors, years of infertility, stage of transferred embryos, number of transferred embryos, whether there were top-level embryos and thickness of endometrium on the day of transfer

The analysis results of the (non-linear) logistic regression method showed that apart from the confounding factors, the effect of BMI on clinical pregnancy and live birth varied with the change in BMI (Fig. 1). In addition, this effect differed in three age groups, i.e. in women younger than 30 years, women 30–35 years old, and women older than 35 years. In those younger than 30 years, the AOR values of clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate did not change before the BMI value reached 22.5, after which it increased. In 30–35-year-old women, the two AOR values increased with BMI, and the curve was almost linear. For women older than 35, these two AOR values increased before BMI > 22.5 and then decreased.

Technical remarks note that 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that this applies to generally healthy adults with obesity who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). The evidence review identified no trials testing a screen-and-treat strategy for low 25(OH)D in people with obesity that improved prespecified outcomes.

### Operative blood loss, blood transfusion, and 30-day mortality in older patients after major noncardiac surgery [^113ndL2L]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Anemia and operative blood loss are common in the elderly, but evidence is lacking on whether intraoperative blood transfusions can reduce the risk of postoperative death.

Methods

We analyzed retrospective data from 239,286 patients 65 years of older who underwent major noncardiac surgery in 1997 to 2004 at veteran hospitals nationwide. Propensity-score matching was used to adjust for differences between patients who received intraoperative blood transfusions (9.4%) and those who did not, and data were used to determine the association between intraoperative blood transfusion and 30-day postoperative mortality.

Results

After propensity-score matching, intraoperative blood transfusion was associated with mortality risk reductions in patients with preoperative hematocrit levels of < 24% (odds ratio: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41–0.87), and in patients with hematocrit of 30% or greater when there is substantial (500–999 mL) blood loss (odds ratio: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22–0.56 for hematocrit levels between 30%-35.9% and 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62–0.97 for hematocrit levels of 36% or greater). When operative blood loss was < 500 mL, transfusion was not associated with mortality reductions for patients with hematocrit levels of 24% or greater, and conferred increased mortality risks in patients with preoperative hematocrit levels between 30% to 35.9% (odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04–1.60).

Conclusions

Intraoperative blood transfusion is associated with a lower 30-day postoperative mortality among elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery if there is substantial operative blood loss or low preoperative hematocrit levels (< 24%). Transfusion is associated with increased mortality risks for those with preoperative hematocrit levels between 30% and 35.9% and < 500 mL of blood loss.

3.6 Safety and tolerability

Rates of AEs were comparable between males (87.9% [87/99]) and females (92.4% [194/210]; Table 1). Gastrointestinal AEs for all survodutide doses pooled were experienced by more females (79.5%) than males (65.7%), and nausea was the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AE in females and males (62.4% and 43.4%, respectively). The frequency of AEs was similar across baseline BMI subgroups (86.7% [26/30] in < 30 kg/m 2; 92.2% [83/90] in 30 to > 35 kg/m 2; 91.8% [90/98] in 35 to > 40 kg/m 2; and 90.1% [82/91] in ≥ 40 kg/m 2; Table 1). Participants with baseline BMI < 30 kg/m 2 experienced fewer gastrointestinal AEs (53.3% vs. 80.0%, 77.6%, and 74.7% in participants with baseline BMI 30 to < 35, 35 to < 40 and ≥ 40 kg/m 2, respectively). Nausea was the most frequently reported gastrointestinal AE across all baseline BMI subgroups (46.7%, 64.4%, 57.1% and 50.5% for baseline BMI < 30, 30 to < 35, 35 to < 40 and ≥ 40 kg/m 2, respectively).

### Extended-release calcifediol normalized 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and prevented progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients in a pilot randomized clinical trial [^111ET7F5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) decline as chronic kidney disease (CKD) advances, becoming insufficient without effective vitamin D repletion and driving onset of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in non-dialysis CKD patients have established that extended-release calcifediol (ERC) effectively raises 25D and 1,25D and reduces elevated intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) despite the progressive loss of renal cytochrome P450 25D-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), suggesting its potential efficacy in treating SHPT in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Methods

This pilot RCT explored the safety and efficacy of oral ERC to raise serum total 25D to ≥ 50 ng/mL, normalize circulating 1,25D and reduce elevated iPTH in ESKD patients requiring regular hemodialysis (HD). Forty-four adults from 27 United States clinics requiring HD three times per week were washed out from iPTH-lowering therapies and randomized 3:1 to 26 weeks of treatment with ERC (300 µg/HD) or placebo. Participants had a mean age of 56.4 ± 11.6 years, body mass index of 32.7 ± 8.1 kg/m2, 46% were female, 68% Black, 30% White, 24% Hispanic. At randomization, iPTH had to be 300- < 1,200 pg/mL, 25D < 50 ng/mL, corrected serum calcium < 9.8 mg/dL and phosphorus < 6.5 mg/dL. These parameters were monitored weekly or biweekly, and 1,25D quarterly.

Results

Mean (± SE) serum total 25D rose with ERC treatment from 24.1 ± 1.7 ng/mL at baseline (BL) to steady-state levels of 157.7 ± 10.4 (p < 0.001) after 12 weeks, with all individual levels exceeding 50 ng/mL but varying inversely with body weight. Serum 25D levels declined with placebo treatment from 36.0 ± 5.3 to 30.6 ± 5.5 ng/mL. Mean 1,25D rose from 9.4 ± 1.2 to 50.7 ± 7.8 pg/mL (p < 0.001) with ERC and concentrations surpassed 19.9 pg/mL (lower limit of normal) in 93% of participants. Mean iPTH increased 19.8 ± 10.6% from BL with placebo (497.6 ± 69.2 to 593.1 ± 95.1 pg/mL) but decreased 1.7 ± 4.7% (p < 0.05) with ERC (530.4 ± 29.4 to 529.6 ± 43.7 pg/mL). A strong correlation was observed between serum 1,25D and 25D (r2 = 0.8248; p < 0.001) with ERC treatment indicating that, on average, 1,25D normalized as 25D reached ≥ 50 ng/mL. Increases in mean serum calcium or phosphorus, episodes of hypercalcemia or adverse events were not observed with ERC treatment.

Conclusion

ERC safely raised serum total 25D, normalized low serum 1,25D and stabilized elevated plasma iPTH in this pilot placebo-controlled RCT involving ESKD patients requiring regular HD. The observed increases in 1,25D indicated that ERC restored adequate endogenous vitamin D hormone production via substrate-driven conversion to calcitriol in extra-renal tissues expressing CYP27B1, thereby preventing SHPT progression.

### Effects of vitamin DSupplementation on vitamin DMetabolism in health and CKD [^11442Czb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Vitamin D supplements are prescribed to correct low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In CKD, vitamin D metabolism is complicated by decreased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by CYP27B1 and possibly decreased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by CYP24A1. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of vitamin D 2 supplementation on vitamin D metabolism in health and CKD.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a treatment-only intervention study of 25 individuals with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and 44 individuals without CKD from three academic centers, all with screening 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 30 ng/ml. Each participant was prescribed vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) 50,000 IU orally twice weekly for 5 weeks. We tested whether changes in plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites and vitamin D metabolic ratios differed by CKD status. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio were calculated as estimates of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 function, respectively.

Results

With treatment, plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2 and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations increased similarly for participants with and without CKD. For participants without CKD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2 increased (2.8 ± 1.3–32.9 ± 1.4 pg/ml), whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 decreased (45.6 ± 1.9–14.6 ± 1.9 pg/ml), resulting in no significant change in total 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio decreased (3.0 ± 0.2–1.7 ± 0.2 pg/ng), and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio increased (115.7 ± 7.8–195.2 ± 7.9 pg/ng). Individuals with CKD had lower baseline levels and smaller changes in magnitude for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 2 (2.1 ± 1.6–24.4 ± 1.6 pg/ml; P interaction = 0.01), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio (1.8 ± 0.2–1.1 ± 0.2 pg/ng; P interaction = 0.05), and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -to-25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 ratio (72.0 ± 9.1–110.3 ± 9.3 pg/ng; P interaction < 0.001). Fibroblast growth factor-23 and parathyroid hormone were not significantly changed in either group.

Conclusions

Vitamin D 2 supplementation decreases conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and induces vitamin D 3 catabolism as evidenced by changes in D 3 metabolites and vitamin D metabolic ratios. These effects occur without significant changes in fibroblast growth factor-23 or parathyroid hormone and are blunted in CKD.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patient disposition and baseline characteristics

Overall, 8246 adults with T2D and ASCVD were randomized, and 8238 received ≥ 1 dose of placebo, ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg (Figure S1). Mean follow‐up was 3.5 years. At baseline, 601 (7%) participants had a BMI of < 25 kg/m 2, 2577 (31%) 25– < 30 kg/m 2, 3004 (36%) 30– < 35 kg/m 2 and 2061 (25%) ≥ 35 kg/m 2. Three participants did not have baseline BMI data and were not included in the analysis.

Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between ertugliflozin and placebo groups (Table 1). Some differences were observed between BMI subgroups including a lower proportion of Asian participants, sulphonylurea (SU) users, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP‐4i) users and a higher proportion of insulin users and glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) users in the highest BMI subgroup. There were 4676 participants with body weight data through 3 years (329, < 25 kg/m 2; 1493, 25– < 30 kg/m 2; 1733, 30– < 35 kg/m 2; 1121, ≥ 35 kg/m 2) and 1534 with data through 5 years (112, < 25 kg/m 2; 499, 25– < 30 kg/m 2; 573, 30– < 35 kg/m 2; 350, ≥ 35 kg/m 2).

Background

The use of bariatric surgery to treat diabetes mellitus (DM) requires procedures developed for morbid obese in patients with normal and over-weight. Therefore, we started tailoring one anastomosis gastric bypass (BAGUA) adapted to each patient. This study analyzes changes in body composition (BC) of patients with BMI 23–50 after BAGUA as well as influence of DM and MS.

We studied 79 (37 diabetic and 42 non-diabetic) patients (BMI 23–50) who completed all evaluation appointment (preoperative, 10 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) after tailored BAGUA for obesity, diabetes, or diabesity. Patients were classified according to BMI (23–29, 30–34, 35–50) and bearing or not diabetes. Variables are components of BC as well as DM and MS.

Results

Preoperatively, mean values of weight varied 37 kg (78–115 kg), muscle mass (MM) 8 kg (54–62 kg), while fat mass (FM) 30 kg (22–53 kg). Basal metabolism (BM) was higher in diabetic. After surgery, percentage (%) of excess weight loss (%EWL) ranged from 76% (BMI 35–50) to 128% (BMI 23–29), FM 56% (BMI 23–29) to 65% (BMI 35–50), without differences bearing DM. MM 12% (non-diabetics BMI 30–34) to 17% (diabetics BMI 35–50) and visceral fat (VF) 50% (diabetics BMI 30–34) to 56% (non-diabetics BMI 35–50).

Conclusions

After tailored BAGUA, MM maintains steady while FM is highly reduced and variable. BM is reduced in all groups. Diabetics lose less weight and VF but more MM than non-diabetic patients. Preoperative presence of MS influences the changes in BC.

### Lacosamide [^116bV1VN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The exit criteria were one or more of the following: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure frequency during any 28 consecutive days, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency, (3) occurrence of a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, (4) clinically significant prolongation or worsening of overall seizure duration, frequency, type or pattern considered by the investigator to require trial discontinuation, (5) status epilepticus or new onset of serial/cluster seizures. The study population profile appeared comparable to that of the historical control population.

For the lacosamide 400 mg/day group, the estimate of the percentage of patients meeting at least 1 exit criterion was 30% (95% CI: 25%, 36%). The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI (36%) was below the threshold of 65% derived from the historical control data, meeting the pre-specified criteria for efficacy. Lacosamide 300 mg/day also met the pre-specified criteria for efficacy.

### Differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D clearance by eGFR and race: a pharmacokinetic study [^114h7SeW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) to the active form of vitamin D occurs primarily in the kidney. Observational studies suggest 25(OH)D clearance from the circulation differs by kidney function and race. However, these potential variations have not been tested using gold-standard methods.

Methods

We administered intravenous, deuterated 25(OH)D 3 (d-25[OH]D 3) in a pharmacokinetic study of 87 adults, including 43 with normal eGFR (≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), 24 with nondialysis CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), and 20 with ESKD treated with hemodialysis. We measured concentrations of d-25(OH)D 3 and deuterated 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 at 5 minutes and 4 hours after administration, and at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 days postadministration. We calculated 25(OH)D clearance using noncompartmental analysis of d-25(OH)D 3 concentrations over time. We remeasured 25(OH)D clearance in a subset of 18 participants after extended oral vitamin-D 3 supplementation.

Results

The mean age of the study cohort was 64 years; 41% were female, and 30% were Black. Mean 25(OH)D clearances were 360 ml/d, 313 ml/d, and 263 ml/d in participants with normal eGFR, CKD, and kidney failure, respectively (P = 0.02). After adjustment for age, sex, race, and estimated blood volume, lower eGFR was associated with reduced 25(OH)D clearance (β = -17 ml/d per 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 lower eGFR; 95% CI, -21 to -12). Black race was associated with higher 25(OH)D clearance in participants with normal eGFR, but not in those with CKD or kidney failure (P for interaction = 0.05). Clearance of 25(OH)D before versus after vitamin-D 3 supplementation did not differ.

Conclusions

Using direct pharmacokinetic measurements, we show that 25(OH)D clearance is reduced in CKD and may differ by race.

Clinical Trial Registry Name and Registration Number

Clearance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Chronic Kidney Disease (CLEAR), NCT02937350; Clearance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 During Vitamin D3 Supplementation (CLEAR-PLUS), NCT03576716.

### Oocyte donor age has a significant impact on oocyte recipients' cumulative live-birth rate: a population-based cohort study [^116FF3RK]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study the impact of the donor's and recipient's age on the cumulative live-birth rate (CLBR) in oocyte donation cycles.

Design

A population-based retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

All women using donated oocytes (n = 1,490) in Victoria, Australia, between 2009 and 2015.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The association between the donor's and recipient's age and CLBR modeled by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression with the covariates of male partner's age, recipient parity, and cause of infertility adjusted for, and donor age grouped as < 30, 30–34, 35–37, 38–40, and ≥ 41 years, and recipient age as < 35, 35–37, 38–40, 41–42, 43–44, and ≥ 45 years.

Result(S)

The mean age of the oocyte donors was 33.7 years (range: 21 to 45 years) with 49% aged 35 years and over. The mean age of the oocyte recipients was 41.4 years (range: 19 to 53 years) with 25.4% aged ≥ 45 years. There was a statistically significant relationship between the donor's age and the CLBR. The CLBR for recipients with donors aged < 30 years and 30–34 years was 44.7% and 43.3%, respectively. This decreased to 33.6% in donors aged 35–37 years, 22.6% in donors aged 38–40 years, and 5.1% in donors aged ≥ 41 years. Compared with recipients with donors aged < 30 years, the recipients with donors aged 38–40 years had 40% less chance of achieving a live birth (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.86) and recipients with donors aged ≥ 41 years had 86% less chance of achieving a live birth (adjusted hazard ratio 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04–0.44). The multivariate analysis showed no statistically significant effect of the recipient's age on CLBR.

Conclusion(S)

We have demonstrated that the age of the oocyte donor is critical to the CLBR and is independent of the recipient woman's age. Recipients using oocytes from donors aged ≥ 35 years had a statistically significantly lower CLBR when compared with recipients using oocytes from donors aged < 35 years.

### Obese living kidney donors: a comparison of hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic versus laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy [^116qzUFh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

No previous studies have investigated the outcome between HARP and LDN in donors with BMI ≥ 30 so far. Our results demonstrated that operative and postoperative outcomes as well as postoperative kidney function did not show any differences except for intraoperative blood loss. Therefore we believe LDN would be possible even in donors with BMI ≥ 30. Actually 57% of procedures were done by LDN in 2017 and 2018. In contrast, HARP was often conducted at the left kidney (78.8%), although not statistically significant. HARP is considered more challenging at the right side, due to interference of the liver. Furthermore, the use of HARP or LDN did not have any effect on postoperative pain.

With respect to comparison between donors with BMI 30–35 and with BMI ≥ 35, donors with BMI ≥ 35 had comparable operative and postoperative outcomes to donors with BMI 30–35. Furthermore, donors with BMI ≥ 30 had similar postoperative outcomes compared to donors with BMI < 30. These results suggest that laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy for donors with BMI ≥ 30 is safe and feasible when looking at short-term outcome, without compromising outcomes. In addition, kidney function 1 year after donation did not differ significantly across the groups. This result supports a precious report that showed donor BMI was not associated with decline in eGFR and percent change in creatinine level at 6 month after kidney donation.

Regarding eligibility criteria for living kidney donor, the CARI guidelines considered obesity (BMI > 30) as a relative contraindication to donation. The British guidelines recommended that individuals with BMI 30–35 should undergo careful preoperative evaluation, and individuals with BMI > 35 should be discouraged from donating because of limited data. The consensus statement of the Amsterdam Forum on the Care of the Live Kidney Donor also recommended that individuals with BMI > 35 should be discouraged from donating, especially when other comorbidities are present. In contrast, The European Association of Urology and the Canadian guidelines have not provided any recommendations for donors with BMI > 30. Accordingly, the question concerning applicable cut-off values of BMI for obese donors remains under debate. A recent systematic review has concluded that the selection of potential kidney donors should not be based on BMI alone, and high BMI should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for living kidney donation. The transplant community should carefully screen each obese individual and make a selection for donation by an obese potential donor with a careful individualized process.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Zv5RF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### The influence of inspired oxygen fraction and end-tidal carbon dioxide on post-cross-clamp cerebral oxygenation during carotid endarterectomy under general anesthesia [^1138dtXv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ten to fifteen percent of awake patients develop neurological deficits secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion after carotid artery cross-clamping. The reversal of such deficits by increasing the inspired oxygen fraction (Fio(2)) has been demonstrated, and regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO(2)) has been shown to improve during carotid cross-clamping in awake patients by increasing Fio(2). Paradoxical improvements in cerebral blood flow during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) at the time of cross-clamping and normalization of post-cross-clamp electroencephalographic abnormalities have been induced by hypocapnia. We performed this study to determine the influence of Fio(2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (Petco(2)) on rSO(2) in patients undergoing CEA with general anesthesia during carotid cross-clamping.

Methods

Twenty patients were recruited. Ten underwent elective shunting. Patients received standardized general anesthesia. rSO(2) was measured using the INVOS 5100B monitor (Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI). After carotid cross-clamping, Fio(2) and minute ventilation were sequentially adjusted: 1) Fio(2) 30%, Petco(2) 30–35 mm Hg; 2) Fio(2) 100%, Petco(2) 30–35 mm Hg; and 3) Fio(2) 100%, Petco(2) 40–45 mm Hg. At each point, rSO(2) was recorded from both operative and nonoperative sides, and arterial blood gas analysis was performed.

Results

Results from shunted and unshunted patients were analyzed separately. Increasing Fio(2): Administration of 100% oxygen while maintaining Petco(2) in the range 30–35 mm Hg in unshunted patients resulted in an 8% increase (P = 0.008) in rSO(2) on the operative side and a 6% increase (P = 0.011) on the nonoperative side compared with an Fio(2) of 30%. In shunted patients, administration of 100% oxygen while maintaining the Petco(2) in the range 30–35 mm Hg resulted in a 4% increase in rSO(2) on both the operative side (P = 0.008) and the nonoperative side (P = 0.011) compared with an Fio(2) of 30%. Increasing Petco(2): In unshunted patients, there was a 6% (P = 0.008) increase in rSO(2) on the operative side and a 5% increase (P = 0.024) on the nonoperative side at Petco(2) 40–45 mm Hg compared with Petco(2) 30–35 mm Hg maintaining Fio(2) at 100%. In shunted patients, there was a 3% increase (P = 0.018) in rSO(2) on the operative side and a 4% increase (P = 0.007) on the nonoperative side at Petco(2) 40–45 mm Hg compared with Petco(2) 30–35 mm Hg maintaining Fio(2) at 100%.

Conclusion

rSO(2) is reliably improved during carotid cross-clamping by increasing Fio(2) in patients undergoing CEA with general anesthesia. Additional improvement in rSO(2) may be gained by increasing Petco(2).

### Perceptions of health, body size, and nutritional risk factors for obesity in people with HIV in South Africa [^1168cLFS]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic disease is increasing in people with HIV (PWH) in South Africa, but little is known about self-perceptions of body size, health, and nutritional behavior in this population. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of individual-level data from the 2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey. This survey measured HIV serostatus and body mass index (BMI). We categorized participants into six BMI groups: 18.5–22 kg/m 2, 22–25 kg/m 2, 25–27.5 kg/m 2, 27.5–30 kg/m 2, 30–35 kg/m 2, and ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and stratified them by HIV serostatus. Our outcomes were self-reported (1) body size and (2) health status among all participants, and intake of (3) chips and (4) sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) in PWH. We described these metrics and used multivariable regression to evaluate the relationship between the nutritional behaviors and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 in PWH only, adjusting for age, sex, educational attainment, and household wealth quintile. Of 6138 participants, 1163 (19.7%) were PWH. Among PWH, < 10% with a BMI 25–30 kg/m 2, < 20% with a BMI 30–35 kg/m 2 and < 50% with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 self-reported as overweight or obese. PWH reported being in poor health at higher rates than those without HIV at each BMI category except ≥ 35 kg/m 2. In adjusted models, SSB consumption was associated with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 (1.13 [1.01–1.25], t-statistic = 2.14, p = 0.033) in PWH. Perceptions of body size may challenge efforts to prevent weight gain in PWH in South Africa. SSB intake reduction should be further explored as a modifiable risk factor for obesity.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^111FdgS9]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Indications in hypercapnic respiratory failure — ELSO identifies CO2 retention on mechanical ventilation despite high plateau pressures (plateau pressure of > 30 cm H2O) as an ECMO indication. Brodie and Bacchetta recommend initiating extracorporeal support whenever uncompensated hypercapnia with acidemia (pH < 7.15) or excessively high end-inspiratory plateau pressure (> 35–45 cm H2O) persists despite the provision of optimal care with invasive mechanical ventilation, and the Brazilian group suggests initiation of ECMO for a pH of 7.20 or less despite a respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min or more (whenever possible), a tidal volume of 4–6 mL/kg, and a plateau pressure 30 cm H2O or less.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^112565fW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary aim of this randomized placebo-controlled, partially-blinded study on 269 healthy adults with mean 25(OH)D of 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L was to evaluate the relative efficacy of equi-unit D2 and D3 oral supplements given daily, 2-weekly, or 4-weekly in raising 25(OH)D level over 20 weeks. Predetermined secondary aims included comparing D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels. The primary outcome measure was adjusted area-under-the-curve between days 0 and 140 (AUC 140). The main results were: 1) in the long term (20 weeks), the D3 2-weekly followed by D3 4-weekly and D2 daily regimens were superior in raising 25(OH)D levels. In the first few weeks of treatment, however, the 4-weekly followed by 2-weekly regimens were superior to all daily regimens. 2) D3 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens were consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens; however, D2 daily regimen was consistently superior to D3 daily regimen. 3) 25(OH)D2 level was significantly higher in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2-treated groups, whereas, 25(OH)D3 level was lower in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3-treated groups 4) The increase in 25(OH)D level was inversely related to baseline level, however, its inverse relation to BMI appeared to be D-type and time dependent (mainly short time after D2 treatment). 5) Daily, 2-weekly, and 4-weekly D2 regimens were associated with a similar and significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated with the increase in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level, in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. 6) The increases in D3 level in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treated groups were higher than the increases in D2 level in the corresponding D2 treated groups, the opposite was true for 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels. 7) Females had higher increases in D3, D2, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels than males. 8) D treatment was associated with significant increases in urinary calcium and creatinine levels but not calcium/creatinine ratio.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112YtL7L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Intralipid [^116Getac]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Intralipid® 20% should be administered as a part of Intravenous nutrition via peripheral vein or by central venous infusion.

Adult Patients

The initial rate of infusion in adults should be 0.5 mL/minute for the first 15 to 30 minutes of infusion. If no untoward reactions occur (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section), the infusion rate can be increased to 1 mL/minute. Not more than 500 mL of Intralipid® 20% should be infused into adults on the first day of therapy. If the patient has no untoward reactions, the dose can be increased on the following day. The daily dosage should not exceed 2.5 g of fat/kg of body weight (12.5 mL of Intralipid® 20% per kg). Intralipid® 20% (A 20% I.V. Fat Emulsion) should make up no more than 60% of the total caloric input to the patient. Carbohydrate and a source of amino acids should comprise the remaining caloric input.

Pediatric Patients

The dosage for premature infants starts at 0.5 g fat/kg body weight/24 hours (2.5 mL Intralipid® 20%) and may be increased in relation to the infant's ability to eliminate fat. The maximum dosage recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics is 3 g fat/kg/24 hours.3

### SAGES guidelines for the management of comorbidities relevant to metabolic and bariatric surgery [^117GeSvc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after sleeve gastrectomy — BMI-based surgical options and hiatal hernia management are outlined as follows: If the patient has medically refractory GERD post-sleeve gastrectomy and has a BMI > 35, the panel suggests conversion to RYGB. For patients with medically refractory GERD with BMI < 35, the data is not clear on whether RYGB or MSA would be superior. For patients with a BMI between 30 and 35, consideration should be given for gastric bypass if the patient has associated metabolic diseases, and for medically refractory patients with a BMI between 30 and 35, MSA and conversion to gastric bypass may both be reasonable options; patients at this BMI range with associated metabolic diseases may derive greater benefit from conversion to gastric bypass. For patients with BMI < 30, potential options for antireflux surgery include MSA and procedures that include gastric diversion. When present, a hiatal hernia should be surgically repaired and in select circumstances it may be the only surgical intervention required; if surgical intervention is being considered and a hiatal hernia is present, this should be addressed at the time of surgery, and such patients who also have a hiatal hernia should undergo repair of the hiatal hernia at the time of conversion to bypass-type anatomy. Nearly every patient with GERD following sleeve gastrectomy will trial medical therapy prior to discussing surgical revision, and for patients with insufficient treatment response post-sleeve, conversion to a malabsorptive bariatric procedure seems the most reasonable approach to address both problems with one operation. The literature identified three studies with low-quality, direct, comparative evidence, and given the poor quality of evidence, the panel decided to make a recommendation based on expert opinion rather than the evidence alone.

Randomized trials — all-cause mortality with vitamin D supplementation: All-cause mortality was reported in 13 RCTs (81 695 participants); estimated daily vitamin D dosage varied between 400 IU (10 μg) and 4800 IU (120 μg), with a median of 2000 IU (50 μg), and most trials allowed supplemental vitamin D between 400 to 800 IU/d. The RR for mortality was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.95–1.20), translating to 2 more per 1000 (2 fewer to 6 more). Mortality risk appeared lower with calcium co-administration (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.79–1.01]) than with vitamin D alone (RR 1.12 [95% CI, 1.01–1.24]) (P for heterogeneity = .021), and higher with high dosages (RR 1.22 [95% CI, 1.06–1.39]) compared with standard dosages (RR 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–1.04]) (P for heterogeneity = .003).

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper: plant-based milks [^113pgcxP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Infant and toddler milk intake — human milk, infant formula, and cow's milk (CM) — is outlined as follows: The universally preferred milk for infants is human milk. Breast milk or infant formula should be an infant's sole food for the first 4 to 6 months of life. In infants not receiving breast milk, iron fortified infant formula should be the source of milk in the diet to 1 year of age, and by 1 year of age most infants are weaned to some form of "milk". USDA recommendations are to consume 2 to 3 servings per day of dairy products per day for a well-balanced, nutritionally complete diet; this amount provides approximately 25% to 30% of total energy needs of 1- to 3-year-olds.

### Managing vitamin D deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease [^111Ahpoz]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As a rule of thumb, s-25(OH)D levels will increase by approximately 1 nmol/L per 1 µg (40 IU) of daily vitamin D3 supplementation. The effect is relatively more pronounced in vitamin D insufficient as compared with vitamin D-replete individuals, whereas the response decreases with increased body weight. Moreover, comparing the two most common vitamin D forms, ergo- (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), cholecalciferol seems more potent than ergocalciferol when supplemented as a large oral bolus.

Accordingly, the daily dose of vitamin D supplementation (in µg) needed to obtain a s-25(OH)D level in the target range (eg, 100 nmol/L) can be estimated as 100 minus measured s-25(OH)D level. Serum 25(OH)D levels should be remeasured after 3–4 months. If not in the target range and a lack of compliance cannot be excluded, it may be considered to recommend intake of vitamin D supplements on a weekly basis in a dose equal to the calculated daily dose. If still not in target range, a vitamin D absorption test may be performed by providing the patient a large oral dose (eg, 100 000–300 000 IU) of vitamin D. In response to such a high dose, a considerable increase in s-25(OH)D level is to be expected within 2–4 weeks. In order to assure compliance, the bolus dose should be provided under the supervision of a healthcare professional. If a response is achieved following a large oral bolus, the most likely explanation for lack of an effect of daily/weekly dosing is low compliance or relative malabsorption. If so, daily/weekly dose of vitamin D may be increased (doubled/tripled) to determine whether this may result in a s-25(OH)D level within the target range. If a substantial increase in s-25(OH)D levels is not achieved in response to a large bolus, severe malabsorption should, however, be considered. Intramuscular vitamin D injections may accordingly be needed, but this should be considered as a last option. Increased sun exposure or use for sunbeds may be considered as an alternative option. Patients should be fully informed that each episode of sun(-bed) exposure should only be for such a short time, due to a potential increased risk of skin malignancies. Time of year should be considered, as the dose of vitamin D needed to maintain a replete vitamin D status may be lower during summertime. For the same reason, we recommend measuring 25(OH)D levels at least annually (preferably during wintertime) and more frequently in case of insufficiency and/or during disease exacerbation (on a 3–4-monthly basis).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute respiratory failure — invasive ventilation considerations and outcomes: The use of invasive ventilation in patients with very severe COPD is influenced by the likely reversibility of the precipitating event, the patient's wishes, and the availability of intensive care facilities, and major hazards include the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia, barotrauma and volutrauma, and the risk of tracheostomy with prolonged ventilation; acute mortality among COPD patients with respiratory failure is lower than mortality among patients ventilated for non-COPD causes, and a large study reported in-hospital mortality of 17–49%, with further deaths over the next 12 months particularly among those with poor lung function before invasive ventilation (FEV1 < 30% predicted), a non-respiratory comorbidity, or who were housebound, whereas patients without a previously diagnosed comorbidity, with a potentially reversible cause (such as an infection), or who were relatively mobile and not using long-term oxygen did well after ventilator support.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

Of the 150 participants enrolled and vaccinated, blood was collected at 28 days from 148 children and at 30–35 months from 115 children (Table 1 and Figure 1). Among participants who received TCV (Groups 1 and 2), there were more males and slightly older than participants who received the control vaccine (Group 3), p = .03 and.01, respectively. Height and weight were similar between the TCV and control groups, p = .66 and.88, respectively. Participants who did not return for their 30–35 month visit had similar baseline characteristics in sex, height, and weight as participants who returned. Those who were lost to follow-up at the 30–35 month visit were slightly older at baseline (Supplementary Table A1).

### Pushing the boundary: the incidence of complications and recurrences following robotic eTEP in BMI ≥ 35 versus BMI [^115UqaGb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity not only contributes to the pathology of primary and incisional ventral hernias but is also associated with increased rates of post-operative complications and hernia recurrence after repair. Whether this holds true for complex robotic eTEP retrorectus hernia repair has not been well researched. The aim of this study was to determine whether obesity increases risks of short-term recurrence or complications after robotic abdominal wall reconstruction.

Methodology

A retrospective chart review was performed for 102 robotic eTEP abdominal wall reconstructions completed at a single institution between 2019 and 2022. Independent variables included patient demographics, hernia characteristics, and intraoperative data. Primary outcomes included 30-day post-operative complications resulting in readmission/ED visits. Outcomes were compared between two cohorts: BMI < 35 and BMI ≥ 35. Univariate analysis was used to compare the incidence of complications between both groups.

Results

Our mean follow-up time was 59.2 ± 98.7 days, and median was 18 days, with the range of 6–419 days. Of the 102 patients, the overall mean BMI was 32.1. 31 patients (30%) had a BMI ≥ 35, while 71 (70%) had a BMI < 35. The BMI ≥ 35 cohort had a mean BMI of 37.9, and the BMI < 35 cohort had a BMI of 29.6. There were no recurrences in the BMI ≥ 35 group and only one in the BMI < 35 group (0% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.51, 95% CI - 0.06 to 0.03). There were two complications in the BMI ≥ 35 group, and seven in the BMI < 35 group (6.5% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.58, 95% CI - 0.17 to 0.11).

Conclusions

The results of our single-center experience showed no significant increase in 30-day hernia recurrence or surgical site occurrences for patients with BMI ≥ 35 undergoing robotic eTEP. This study is limited by small patient cohort size and short follow-up interval.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^1158msPy]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix J. Approaches for eGFR calculation — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is described as the best overall index of kidney function and a measure of how quickly plasma is filtered each minute by the nephron; in young adults normal GFR is approximately 90–130 mL/min and it declines on average 0.8–1.0 mL/min/year after age 30. In clinical practice, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is obtained from validated equations using creatinine, cystatin C, or both, and any estimate assumes steady-state kidney function; if kidney function is changing (e.g. AKI), the creatinine or cystatin C value is unstable and the estimating formulas should not be used, with rising levels in a non-steady state leading formulas to overestimate GFR and falling levels leading formulas to underestimate GFR. eGFR is used for screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with urine albumin/creatinine assessment, determining CKD severity, and monitoring progression of kidney disease, and knowing the level of GFR is important for medication prescribing.

### Country, regional, and global estimates for lactose malabsorption in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113EWuG]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies have shown wide variation in the prevalence of lactose malabsorption across the world, but no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have recently assessed the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in different geographical areas. We aimed to present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in adults, by countries and regions, and to assess the variation between different testing methods.

Methods

Studies reporting on prevalence of lactose malabsorption and lactase persistence were identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to Nov 2, 2016. We evaluated studies presenting lactose malabsorption or lactase persistence prevalence data in adults and children aged 10 years or older, including cross-sectional and prospective studies, using genotyping, hydrogen breath tests, lactose tolerance tests, and other testing methods. We excluded studies in children younger than 10 years, studies using self-reported data, and studies including inpatients and outpatients at gastroenterological wards. Studies were screened by two authors (CLS and SKF) and data values were extracted by two authors (CLS and SKF) independently. The primary outcome was the prevalence of lactose malabsorption. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064802.

Findings

We screened 2665 records, and 306 study populations from 116 full-text articles were included (primary sources); data for 144 additional study populations from 59 articles were obtained from review articles, because full-text primary articles could not be obtained (secondary sources). Of the 450 study populations included, 231 were assessed by genotyping, 83 by hydrogen breath tests, 101 by lactose tolerance tests, and 35 by other methods or methods that were not described sufficiently. The studies included 62910 participants from 89 countries (covering 84% of the world's population). When standardising for country size, the global prevalence estimate of lactose malabsorption was 68% (95% CI 64–72), ranging from 28% (19–37) in western, southern, and northern Europe to 70% (57–83) in the Middle East. When assessing the global prevalence using genotyping data only, the estimate was 74% (69–80), whereas prevalence was 55% (46–65) using lactose tolerance test data, and 57% (46–67) using hydrogen breath test data. Risk of bias was assessed based on ten indicators; 12 of the articles had a score of ten, indicating low risk of bias, 76 had a score of nine, 26 a score of eight, and two articles a score of seven (indicating higher risk of bias). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies within most of the assessed countries.

Interpretation

Lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population. Acknowledging regional patterns of lactose malabsorption is important to guide management of gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of pneumatic dilation in achalasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cpxK3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this large systematic review and meta‐analysis, we compared different pneumatic dilation treatment protocols in patients with primary achalasia. Regarding efficacy, we found that elective additional dilation with 40 mm increases the success rate after an initial 30‐mm and 35‐mm dilation and that, in general, elective additional dilation is slightly more successful than following a predefined dilation protocol. Regarding safety, we found that perforations occurred significantly more often when the first dilation was performed using a 35‐mm balloon than when the first dilation was performed with a 30‐mm balloon. A subsequent 35‐mm dilation was significantly safer than initial dilation with a 35‐mm balloon. No perforations were described in patients undergoing a 40‐mm dilation.

We conclude that the safest and most efficient dilation method for patients with primary achalasia is to start with a 30‐mm balloon, followed by an elective 35‐mm and an elective 40‐mm balloon dilation in patients with insufficient symptom relief. It is surprising that we could not find a higher efficacy of 35 mm after 30 mm. Numerous previous studies did report additional benefit of a 35‐mm dilation after a 30‐mm dilation in a subgroup of patients. 5, 21, 22 Our relatively low efficacy of dilation up to 35 mm could be caused by the smaller sample size in this group, as compared to the number of patients dilated with a 30‐mm or 40‐mm balloon.

### Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: ASCO guideline [^115CZeAw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Health disparities in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and early-onset colorectal cancer are highlighted by claims data showing that Black patients waited an average of eight days longer (67 days after diagnosis) than White patients (59 days after diagnosis). Black patients were also more likely (6.8%) to experience 60 or more days of delayed treatment after diagnosis. In total, more than a third of Black patients experienced this delay, and a targeted approach that meets the specific needs of individual populations is recommended. Regarding molecular testing, a significantly lower percentage of patients who were Black (41.8%) received next-generation sequencing genetic testing, compared with patients who were White (51.6%). Early-onset patterns include that early-onset patients age 35–49 years were most likely to present with symptoms of metastatic disease within 30 days of diagnosis, Roughly 8% of patients age younger than 35 years were found to have sought care at least once for a secondary neoplasm indicative of metastatic disease within 30 days of their initial CRC diagnosis, and The rate of concurrent secondary neoplasm at presentation was 13.7% within the 35–49 years age group, and 9.63% in the 50 years or older age group.

### Lactose intolerance… [^114oq1Nz]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Malabsorption of dietary lactose in the small intestine results in gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, passage of loose, watery stools, and excessive flatus. Lactose intolerance is generally a lifelong inherited condition but can be a temporary result of an infection or other insult to the jejunal mucosa. Recognition of this prevalent condition is important, as it is easily managed by simple dietary adjustments. Accurate diagnosis of lactose intolerance can significantly relieve patient anxiety and avoid inappropriate investigation and treatment. Epidemiology and Etiology Lactose malabsorption is a normal physiologic pattern. 2 The condition occurs in three main types: primary, secondary, and congenital lactase deficiency. The most common form of lactase deficiency is primary adult hypolactasia.

Secondary or acquired hypolactasia can follow any gastrointestinal illness that damages the brush border or significantly decreases transit time in the jejunum mucosa. 3 Lifelong complete absence of lactase is rare. Clinical Features Hypolactasia results in up to 75 percent of dietary lactose passing unaltered through the small intestine into the colon, where it is rapidly metabolized by colonic bacteria, producing excessive fluid and gas in the bowel. 4 The symptoms patients experience vary, however, according to the quantity of lactose ingested and patients' ability to digest lactose. 1 Ingestion of small to moderate amounts of lactose usually produces bloating, cramps, and flatulence but not diarrhea. Ingestion of larger amounts of lactose, a faster gastric emptying time, and faster intestinal transit time all contribute to more severe symptoms. Conversely, increased lactase activity in the small intestine reduces symptoms.

Other foods and the presence of suitable microflora in the colon can cause patients to be more symptomatic. 5 Consideration of differential diagnoses is important in patients with primary hypolactasia. 3 Acquired lactase deficiency or secondary lactose intolerance are present in a variety of gastrointestinal diseases with histologic evidence of mucosal damage. Irritable bowel syndrome is a benign gastrointestinal disorder with complex multifactor pathology. 6 Lactose intolerance and IBS have similar symptom complexes and incidences. 9 A rise in breath hydrogen concentration greater than 20 ppm over baseline after lactose ingestion suggests hypolactasia. The lactose breath hydrogen test is positive in 90 percent of patients with lactose malabsorption. The amount of lactose used for the breath hydrogen test is not physiologic.

Stop LEVORA 0.15/30–28 if an arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic event occurs.
Stop LEVORA 0.15/30–28 if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.
Discontinue LEVORA 0.15/30–28 during prolonged immobilization. If feasible, stop LEVORA 0.15/30–28 at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery, or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.
Start LEVORA 0.15/30–28 no earlier than four weeks after delivery in females who are not breast-feeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the likelihood of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.
Before starting LEVORA 0.15/30–28 evaluate any past medical history or family history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether the history suggests an inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy. LEVORA 0.15/30–28 is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic/thromboembolic diseases (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Arterial Events

COCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk is greater among older women (> 35 years of age), smokers, and females with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or obesity.

LEVORA 0.15/30–28 is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked.

BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The median soymilk dose was 500 mL/day (range, 240–1000 mL/day) with a median soy protein of 22 g/day (range, 2.5–70 g/day) or 6.6 g/250 mL (range, 2.6–35 g/250 mL) and median total (added) sugars of 17.2 g/day (range, 4.0–32 g/day) or 6.9 g/250 mL (range, 1–16 g/250 mL) in the sweetened soymilk. The comparators included skim (0% milk fat) (2/17 trials, 12%), low-fat (1% milk fat) (4/17 trials, 24%), reduced fat (1.5–2.5% milk fat) (7/17 trials, 41%), and whole (3% milk fat) (1/17 trials, 6%) cow's milk. Three trials did not report the milk fat content of cow's milk used. The median cow's milk dose was 500 mL/day (range, 236–1000 mL/day) with a median milk protein of 24 g/day (range, 3.3–70 g/day) or 8.3 g/250 mL (range, 3.4–35 g/250 mL) and median total (lactose) sugars of 24 g/day (range, 11.5–49.2 g/day) or 12 g/250 mL (range, 10.8–12.8 g/250 mL). The median study duration was 4 weeks (range, 4–16 weeks). The trials received funding from industry (1/17 trials, 6%), agency (8/17 trials, 47%), both industry and agency (4/16 trials, 25%), or they did not report the funding source (4/17 trials, 24%).

### Lactose intolerance in infants, children, and adolescents… [^111QdcL6]. publications.aap.org (2006). Low credibility.

1 Lactose ingestion in certain susceptible individuals can cause abdominal symptoms that are variable and can be treated with dietary restriction or enzyme replacement, depending on the amount of lactose consumed and the degree of lactase deficiency. Pediatricians and other pediatric care providers should maintain awareness of the benefits and controversies related to the consumption of dietary milk products and milk-based infant formula. Milk intolerance may be attributed to either the lactose or the protein content. Lactose intolerance can occur among infants and young children with acute diarrheal disease, although the clinical significance of this is limited except in more severely affected children. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are relatively common among older children and adolescents; however, associated intestinal injury is infrequently seen.

Lactose malabsorption is the physiologic problem that manifests as lactose intolerance and is attributable to an imbalance between the amount of ingested lactose and the capacity for lactase to hydrolyze the disaccharide. Primary lactase deficiency is attributable to relative or absolute absence of lactase that develops in childhood at various ages in different racial groups and is the most common cause of lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. Primary lactase deficiency is also referred to as adult-type hypolactasia, lactase nonpersistence, or hereditary lactase deficiency. Secondary lactase deficiency with clinical signs of lactose intolerance can be seen in celiac disease, Crohn disease, and immune-related and other enteropathies and should be considered in these children. Diagnostic evaluation should be directed toward these entities when secondary lactase deficiency is suspected and an infectious etiology is not found.

Young infants with severe malnutrition develop small intestinal atrophy that also leads to secondary lactase deficiency. The onset of diarrhea and other symptoms is related to the amount of lactose that is not absorbed. As little as 12 g of lactose may be sufficient to cause symptoms in children with chronic abdominal pain. MANAGEMENT When children are diagnosed with lactose intolerance, avoidance of milk and other dairy products will relieve symptoms. However, those with primary lactose intolerance have varying degrees of lactase deficiency and, correspondingly, often tolerate varying amounts of dietary lactose.

Lactose-intolerant children should realize that ingestion of dairy products resulting in symptoms generally leads to transient symptoms without causing harm to the gastrointestinal tract. Although lactose malabsorption does not predispose to calcium malabsorption.

### Development of a definition of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111DrTKL]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with persistent, relapsing, or new symptoms or other health effects occurring after acute infection, termed postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID. Characterizing PASC requires analysis of prospectively and uniformly collected data from diverse uninfected and infected individuals.

Objective

To develop a definition of PASC using self-reported symptoms and describe PASC frequencies across cohorts, vaccination status, and number of infections.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective observational cohort study of adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection at 85 enrolling sites (hospitals, health centers, community organizations) located in 33 states plus Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Participants who were enrolled in the RECOVER adult cohort before April 10, 2023, completed a symptom survey 6 months or more after acute symptom onset or test date. Selection included population-based, volunteer, and convenience sampling.

Exposure

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

PASC and 44 participant-reported symptoms (with severity thresholds).

Results

A total of 9764 participants (89% SARS-CoV-2 infected; 71% female; 16% Hispanic/Latino; 15% non-Hispanic Black; median age, 47 years [IQR, 35–60]) met selection criteria. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.5 or greater (infected vs uninfected participants) for 37 symptoms. Symptoms contributing to PASC score included postexertional malaise, fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, changes in sexual desire or capacity, loss of or change in smell or taste, thirst, chronic cough, chest pain, and abnormal movements. Among 2231 participants first infected on or after December 1, 2021, and enrolled within 30 days of infection, 224 (10% [95% CI, 8.8%-11%]) were PASC positive at 6 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

A definition of PASC was developed based on symptoms in a prospective cohort study. As a first step to providing a framework for other investigations, iterative refinement that further incorporates other clinical features is needed to support actionable definitions of PASC.

### Comparison of the colonic metabolism in patients with lactose… [^111DJh2w]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Comparison of the Colonic Metabolism in Patients With Lactose Intolerance and Healthy ControlsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Most people are born with the ability to digest lactose, a dissacharide consisting of β-D-glucose and β-D-galactose, because of the presence of lactase at the brush border of the small intestine. In about 75% of the world population the activity of this enzyme decreases after weaning, resulting in incomplete digestion of lactose and lactose malabsorption in adulthood. Secondary forms of lactose malabsorption may be due to inflammation or functional loss of the intestinal mucosa such as celiac disease, infectious enteritis or Crohn's disease. Very rarely, lactase deficiency is congenital due to an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, preventing lactase expression from birth.

Whereas some people with lactose malabsorption are asymptomatic, most lactose-nonpersisters experience symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, excess flatulence or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance refers to the syndrome of having one or more symptoms after consumption of lactose-containing food. At present, the origin of the symptoms of lactose-intolerance is not well understood. Several studies have indicated a poor correlation between lactose maldigestion and symptoms of lactose intolerance. In a study by Vonk et al., lactose intolerant subjects with severe symptoms and intolerant subjects with only mild symptoms did not differ in degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine indicating a similar lactase activity and leading them to the hypothesis of a "colon resistence factor". It was suggested that the colonic processing of maldigested lactose may play a role in the symptoms experienced by lactose intolerant patients.

When lactose is malabsorbed and enters the colon, it is rapidly fermented by the resident microbiota into a variety of metabolites including lactate, formate, succinate and short chain fatty acids as well as gases. More recently, Campbell et al. introduced the bacterial metabolic toxin hypothesis, stating that also other bacterial metabolites, such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids and ketones, resulting from carbohydrate fermentation play a role in the pathogenesis of lactose-intolerance. These metabolites might inhibit bacterial growth and affect eukaryotic cells.

### Calcitriol [^115Xnc8D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

Calcitriol is rapidly absorbed from the intestine. Peak serum concentrations (above basal values) were reached within 3 to 6 hours following oral administration of single doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mcg of calcitriol. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mcg, mean serum concentrations of calcitriol rose from a baseline value of 40.0 ± 4.4 (SD) pg/mL to 60.0 ± 4.4 pg/mL at 2 hours, and declined to 53.0 ± 6.9 at 4 hours, 50 ± 7.0 at 8 hours, 44 ± 4.6 at 12 hours, and 41.5 ± 5.1 at 24 hours.

Following multiple-dose administration, serum calcitriol levels reached steady-state within 7 days.

Distribution

Calcitriol is approximately 99.9% bound in blood. Calcitriol and other vitamin D metabolites are transported in blood, by an alpha-globulin vitamin D binding protein. There is evidence that maternal calcitriol may enter the fetal circulation. Calcitriol is transferred into human breast milk at low levels (i.e., 2.2 ± 0.1 pg/mL).

### International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement on the referral and selection of pediatric lung transplant candidates [^1152K1Jo]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

ISHLT pediatric lung transplantation — non-adherence burden and risks: the prevalence of non-adherence in pediatric LTx cohorts is expected to be as high as 30%, and non-adherence to immunosuppressive regimens is a known risk factor for late acute rejection, graft loss, and mortality in other transplant populations; therefore, it is reasonable to infer that persistent medication non-adherence most likely increases the risk for antibody mediated rejection, CLAD, and possibly even late mortality in pediatric lung transplantation.
