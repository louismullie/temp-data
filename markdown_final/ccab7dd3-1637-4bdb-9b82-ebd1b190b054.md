## Question

What are the JNC 8 blood pressure targets?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the JNC 8 blood pressure targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary JNC 8 source and confirm the exact thresholds and goals. Then, I should verify the age-stratified targets for the general population. Next, I will check the condition-specific targets for diabetes and chronic kidney disease. After that, I need to review evidence limitations and any dissenting views within the panel. Finally, I will cross-verify with corroborating documents and synthesize a clear, clinically usable summary.

> Let me first confirm the primary source document and ensure I am not conflating different versions of the same guideline; wait, I initially thought was the sole definitive citation, but I should verify that several entries here map to the same 2014 JAMA JNC 8 report and use them consistently for triangulation, including, and targeted sections like therapy escalation and referral.

> I will now examine the age-specific targets for the general hypertensive population; adults aged 60 years or older should be treated to a blood pressure goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg, and let me double-check the evidentiary qualifier because I nearly misstated it as moderate — hold on, it is explicitly described as supported by strong evidence from randomized trials, whereas adults younger than 60 years are treated to a goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg based on expert opinion given insufficient systolic evidence in that age group [^115CjvEw] [^111LQYRW].

> Next, I should review condition-specific targets; the panel recommends that hypertensive adults with diabetes mellitus or with chronic kidney disease have the same thresholds and goals as the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years, namely a blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg, and I should confirm this concordance across multiple JNC 8 entries to avoid any misinterpretation [^115CjvEw] [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5] [^114a8fUm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about evidentiary strength across all ages; I need to check the nuances for younger adults because the panel noted strong evidence for a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg in adults 30–59 years, but insufficient evidence for a specific systolic target in those younger than 60 and insufficient diastolic evidence in those younger than 30, leading to the application of the 140/90 mm Hg target by expert consensus in these groups [^115CjvEw] [^111LQYRW].

> Let me consider the documented controversies and dissent within the panel; I should verify that the recommendation to raise the systolic goal from less than 140 mm Hg to less than 150 mm Hg in adults aged 60 years or older without diabetes or CKD was not unanimous, and that subsequent commentaries questioned the wisdom of liberalizing targets in a large, high-risk older population, emphasizing potential implications for cardiovascular events and public health [^1136g9nL] [^114use8x] [^114RuST7].

> Next, I should review how these JNC 8 targets relate to broader evidence conversations about "standard" versus "lower" blood pressure targets; wait a minute, although some systematic reviews have re-examined whether lower targets confer incremental benefit, the conventional standard target of less than 140/90 mm Hg for many groups remained a pragmatic benchmark at the time, with ongoing debate about balance of benefits and harms when pursuing lower thresholds in diverse populations [^115CjvEw] [^115xdVCE] [^113QhbJd].

> I need to ensure practical management details are captured; the JNC 8 report advises adding agents from other classes if goals are not reached with initial therapy and suggests referral to a hypertension specialist when goals remain unattained or complexity warrants, which I should confirm to align therapeutic escalation with the stated targets [^114BoaGX] [^114KKMtZ].

> But wait, I should also verify that I am not inadvertently mixing later, more intensive target frameworks from post-2014 guidelines with JNC 8 recommendations; to avoid confusion, I will explicitly note that while later ACC/AHA documents advocated lower targets in many circumstances, the JNC 8 targets summarized here are specific to the 2014 evidence-based panel and should be applied as such unless a clinician intentionally follows subsequent guideline frameworks [^116N7mV9] [^114adVXr] [^115syZP7].

> In summary — and I should double-check that this synthesis is faithful to the panel's language — the JNC 8 targets are as follows: in adults aged 60 years or older, treat to less than 150/90 mm Hg with strong evidence support; in adults younger than 60 years, treat to less than 140/90 mm Hg based on expert opinion due to insufficient systolic evidence; and in adults with diabetes mellitus or with chronic kidney disease, irrespective of age, use a goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg consistent with the general population under 60 years, recognizing that the strongest evidence in younger adults centers on achieving diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg for ages 30–59 and that the ≥ 60-year systolic recommendation generated panel dissent and subsequent debate [^115CjvEw] [^111LQYRW] [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5] [^1136g9nL] [^114use8x].

---

JNC 8 blood pressure goals are: **< 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD** [^115CjvEw] and **< 140/90 mm Hg for adults < 60 years or any age with diabetes or CKD** [^116BWX61] [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5]. These targets are based on randomized trials demonstrating reductions in stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events [^1148paiZ], and care should be individualized for frail older adults or those experiencing adverse effects [^115syZP7].

## JNC 8 blood pressure goals by population

| **Population** | **SBP goal (mm hg)** | **DBP goal (mm hg)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General population ≥ 60 years (without diabetes or CKD) | < 150 | < 90 | Strong (Grade A) |
| General population < 60 years | < 140 | < 90 | Moderate (Grade B) [^116BWX61] |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with diabetes (any age) | < 140 | < 90 | Expert opinion (Grade E) [^112inVHR] |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with CKD (any age) | < 140 | < 90 | Expert opinion (Grade E) [^1118rZC5] |

---

## Rationale and evidence supporting JNC 8 recommendations

- **General population ≥ 60 years**: The < 150/90 mm Hg target is supported by RCTs showing reduced stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events [^1139ZnH6].
- **General population < 60 years**: The < 140/90 mm Hg target is based on moderate evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction [^116BWX61] [^113YPJRN].
- **Diabetes and CKD**: The < 140/90 mm Hg target is based on expert opinion and available evidence, balancing benefits and risks [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5] [^116ngdbG].

---

## Clinical implications and controversies

Clinical implications include JNC 8's emphasis on **individualized care**, especially in older adults, to balance the benefits and risks of intensive BP lowering [^1139ZnH6]. Controversies center on the **higher SBP target for adults ≥ 60 years**, given concerns about potential increases in cardiovascular risk for some patients [^114RuST7].

---

## Comparison with previous guidelines

Compared with previous guidelines, **JNC 7** recommended < 140/90 mm Hg for most adults and < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or CKD [^113CxnuZ], whereas **JNC 8** raised the SBP target to < 150 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD and adopted a uniform < 140/90 mm Hg target for diabetes and CKD [^115CjvEw].

---

In sum, **< 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years without diabetes or CKD**; **< 140/90 mm Hg for adults < 60 years or any age with diabetes or CKD** — tailor treatment to tolerance, comorbidities, and adverse effects [^116BWX61].

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults.

Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg. However, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion.

The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of this review, initially published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, clinicians aim to achieve a specific blood pressure target. This target represents the value below which optimal clinical benefits are presumed. The "lower the better" approach, which has long guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure, was challenged over the last decade due to insufficient evidence from randomized trials supporting this strategy. Consequently, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population with elevated blood pressure. However, recent trials have reintroduced the consideration of aiming for lower blood pressure targets. It is therefore crucial to evaluate whether the potential benefits of achieving these lower targets outweigh any associated harms.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared to standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were to ascertain whether there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with "lower targets" compared to "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, and to determine if there is a change in withdrawal rates.

### Treating to hypertension targets [^114brLRV]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

Control of blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients often fails to meet the targets suggested by the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. The optimal treatment target for non-diabetic patients is ≤ 140/85 mm Hg. Data from the health survey for England show that in 1998, only 8% of men and 11% of women had blood pressure controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg. The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) data show that 87% of non-diabetic patients in the St Mary's Centre are currently treated to below 140/90 mm Hg. These differences can be explained by strict protocol adherence, a focus on cardiovascular disease, longer consultation times and punctual appointments, reinforcement of non-pharmacological advice, and blood pressure readings taken in line with BHS guidelines. Some of these points might be translated into the more challenging setting of primary care.

Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

The disease hypertension can be associated with several conditions and factors. These include insulin disorders, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, primary aldosteronism, and dyslipidemia. It is also linked to symptoms such as third and fourth heart sounds, erectile dysfunction, and amphetamine use. Furthermore, hypertension can contribute to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), transient ischemic attacks (TIA), carotid artery stenosis, and hyperthyroidism.

Other related conditions include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), prediabetes, Cushing's syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, and increased systolic blood pressure (↑ SBP). Complications from hypertensive retinopathy, usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), glaucoma, heart failure (HF), renal artery stenosis, hypermetropia, hyperparathyroidism, and alcohol consumption are also noted.

Further associations exist with diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiac arrhythmias, the use of angiogenesis inhibitors, antidepressants, chronic kidney disease (CKD), decongestants, antipsychotics, and obesity. Additionally, headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, erectile dysfunction (repeated listing), corticosteroid usage, hormonal contraceptives, tobacco use, increased diastolic blood pressure (↑ DBP), atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and hypothyroidism can be related to hypertension.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^115syZP7]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower blood pressure (BP) treatment targets compared to the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA suggests a general treatment target of systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) < 130/80 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults (≥ 65 years) who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is an SBP of < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. In older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit.

The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those aged 18 to 65 years. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects.

A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is well tolerated.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114ZYgAP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A recent cost‐effectiveness model of treating stage I hypertension showed a reduction in both CVD events and deaths, along with significant cost savings, especially in those over 60 years old. This study used the JNC 8 panel's recommended treatment targets but did not model the cost savings or mortality benefit of treating adults over 60 years with SBP 140 to 150 mm Hg. However, there were significant cost savings gained from treating men and women between the ages of 45 and 60 with BP > 140/90 mm Hg. Given the projected increase in CVD events with those over 60 years of age, we believe that there is likely to be a benefit to treating mild hypertension in this group as well.

- **Impact of adopting the JNC 8 guidelines**: On a population level, the adoption will lead to a significant change in those eligible for BP treatment. While an estimated 41.5 million people are above their BP goal under JNC 7, only 28 million are above goal according to the JNC 8 recommendations, based on estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative population sample. This corresponds to 13.5 million adults, with the majority being 60 years or older, who were previously considered above goal and are now no longer eligible for further treatment. An important consideration is that these 13.5 million include 37% with diabetes, 39% with CKD, and 19% with CVD.

- **National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry findings**: The registry confirmed that the population of patients for whom the BP goals changed in JNC 8 is also the population who are at highest risk for CVD events, with an average Framingham risk score.

### Cardiovascular guidelines: Separate career may help attenuate controversy [^1136g9nL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The JNC8 hypertension guidelines indicate that only about half of patients with hypertension in the United States actually have a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or less. The Joint National Committee (JNC7) guidelines, released more than a decade ago, concluded that all adult patients with hypertension, regardless of their age, should have their BP reduced to a SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg, with even tighter control in patients with diabetes or renal disease (SBP < 130 mmHg). In contrast, the current recommendation raises target SBP goals to 150 mm Hg or lower in those aged 60 years or older, while eliminating the tighter control recommendations in patients with diabetes and renal disease.

A minority of the panel disagreed with the recommendation to increase the target SBP from 140 to 150 mmHg in persons aged 60 years or older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Intuitively, an estimated 13 million U.S. hypertensive patients aged 60 years or older would reduce pill intake as the SBP goal increases from 140 to 150 mmHg. Antihypertensive medication use may be associated with injurious falls in the elderly, with a 30% to 40% increased risk compared with no antihypertensive medication use. Moreover, the results of the ACCORD MIND show that intensive management to a target SBP of less than 120 mm Hg and fibrate therapy, in the context of LDL cholesterol level control, are not effective in reducing cognitive decline in persons with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not.

Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### Impact of the 2014 expert panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure on contemporary cardiovascular practice: Insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^115EviqL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Since 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has been the predominant guideline for blood pressure management. A 2014 expert panel recommended increasing the blood pressure targets for patients aged 60 years and older, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel blood pressure management recommendations on patients managed in U.S. ambulatory cardiovascular practices.

- **Methods**: Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of patients who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of patients for whom the blood pressure goals changed.

- **Results**: Of 1,185,253 patients in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) patients were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 112,174 (64.6%) had coronary artery disease. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

- **Conclusions**: Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology patients with hypertension, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. If the new recommendations are implemented in clinical practice, blood pressure target achievement and cardiovascular events will need careful monitoring.

### 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APHA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114adVXr]. Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertension:

- **Definition**: According to the 2018 ACC/AHA guidelines, elevated blood pressure (BP) is defined as systolic pressure of 120–129 mmHg and diastolic pressure < 80 mmHg. Stage 1 hypertension (HTN) is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130–139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80–89 mmHg, and stage 2 HTN is defined as SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the 2024 ESC guidelines, elevated BP is defined as an office SBP of 120–139 mmHg or DBP of 70–89 mmHg, and HTN is defined as an office SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg.

- **Pathophysiology**: Primary HTN etiology is multifactorial and most frequently associated with a combination of environmental factors (such as unhealthy diet, increased sodium intake, insufficient potassium intake, inadequate physical activity, overweight/obesity) and genetic factors (including multiple risk alleles, gene-gene interactions, fetal programming, epigenetic mechanisms). Secondary HTN etiology includes conditions like primary aldosteronism, renal HTN, renal parenchymal disease, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, acromegaly, coarctation of the aorta, and the use of certain medications or recreational drugs (such as amphetamines, cocaine, and phencyclidine). White-coat HTN and isolated systolic HTN are essential subtypes.

- **Epidemiology**: HTN is highly prevalent worldwide. The prevalence of HTN in the US is estimated at 31,900 per 100,000 adults based on the 140/90 mmHg cutoff. Rates are highest in African Americans and increase with age.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for hypertension include lifestyle and genetic elements, but the text cuts off here.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: Impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^116Myogk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Sensitivity analyses examining 5% to 20% proportional reductions in the total population with blood pressure above goal target a larger segment of the population with elevated blood pressure. These analyses demonstrated considerably larger reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF) events than interventions targeting unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above JNC 8 goals.

- **Proportional reductions and race heterogeneity**: Detailed insights revealed that heterogeneity by race exists for interventions achieving reductions in the total population with elevated blood pressure above JNC 8 goals. Importantly, these analyses signify the importance of targeted interventions to address varying impacts by demographic segments.

### Identifying gaps between guidelines and clinical practice in the evaluation and treatment of patients with hypertension [^116EgWn7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Hypertension remains uncontrolled in the majority of affected patients despite treatment. The goal of this research was to identify specific action items from the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines that are not being translated into clinical practice.

The researchers transformed the major JNC VI tables into a chart review instrument. This instrument was used to retrospectively analyze the medical records of 249 patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who had been followed for 18 months at one of six community-based primary care clinics.

The practices of physicians deviated from the guidelines in several ways. Hypertension was staged initially on a single blood pressure recording in 85% (n = 212) of patients. No electrocardiogram was ordered for 89% (n = 221) of patients, while other mandatory laboratory tests were ordered for about 50%. After 18 months, 40% (72/179) of patients for whom prescription records were identified were still on monotherapy, and target blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg) was achieved in only 33% (83/249) of patients. All of the 35 patients with diabetes received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, but only 1.7 medications were prescribed per patient at study end.

In this clinic system, staging of blood pressure with multiple measurements, thorough assessment of global cardiovascular risk, and titration of multiple antihypertensive medications to achieve blood pressure goals are components of the JNC VI guidelines.

### Blood pressure targets and absolute cardiovascular risk [^114RuST7]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

In the Eighth Joint National Committee guideline on hypertension, the threshold for the initiation of blood pressure-lowering treatment for elderly adults (≥ 60 years) without chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus was raised from 140/90 mm Hg to 150/90 mm Hg. However, the committee was not unanimous in this decision, particularly because a large proportion of adults ≥ 60 years may be at high cardiovascular risk. Based on the Eighth Joint National Committee guideline, we sought to determine the absolute 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease among these adults through analyzing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005–2012).

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of adults who were at ≥ 20% predicted absolute cardiovascular risk and above goals for the Seventh Joint National Committee guideline but reclassified as at target under the Eighth Joint National Committee guideline (reclassified). The Framingham General Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score was used. From 2005 to 2012, the surveys included 12,963 adults aged 30 to 74 years with blood pressure measurements, of which 914 were reclassified based on the guideline. Among individuals reclassified as not in need of additional treatment, the proportion of adults 60 to 74 years without chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus at ≥ 20% absolute risk was 44.8%. This corresponds to 0.8 million adults. The proportion at high cardiovascular risk remained sizable among adults who were not receiving blood pressure-lowering treatment.

Taken together, a sizable proportion of reclassified adults 60 to 74 were not addressed adequately in terms of cardiovascular risk management.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **JNC 8 recommendations 2 to 5**: In all persons aged 18 years (and those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP. For those aged 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. This trial randomized 18,790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into three groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

- **Main goal of the study**: To assess the association between these three target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the three groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the two lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the three groups.

While all three groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg, and the lowest rate of CVD was observed at this target.

### Clinical diagnosis and management of hypertension compared with the Joint National Committee 8 panelists' recommendations [^117QEfHc]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The panelists of the Joint National Committee recently published new recommendations for the management of hypertension. Our study aims to evaluate how practice compares.

- **Hypothesis**: Practice likely deviates from the recent JNC 8 panelists' recommendations.

- **Methods**: A survey was sent to cardiology providers at three academic medical centers: Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Providers were asked to select which blood-pressure goal would be deemed appropriate in various cases based on individual practice in both the maintenance of patients already on therapy as well as the threshold of when to initiate therapy. Comparisons with recommendations were made, considering geographic location and level of experience.

- **Results**: A total of 251 survey requests were sent in May 2014, and 77 responses (30.7%) were received. Cardiologists tended not to practice according to the new guidelines, with most variation seen in patients aged over 60 years without comorbidities on active treatment. Providers' selection of initial pharmacologic agents in non-African American patients, African American patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus reflected congruency with guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: Our study found that clinical practice does not correlate well with the new blood-pressure goal recommendations published by the Joint National Committee 8 panelists, particularly in patients aged over 60 years without comorbidities. Practitioners are likely to follow the recommendations in regard to pharmacologic management.

### Proportion of US adults potentially affected by the 2014 hypertension guideline [^1154Abaf]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

The new 2014 blood pressure (BP) guideline, released by the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8; 2014 BP guideline), proposed less restrictive BP targets for adults aged 60 years or older, and for those with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

The objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of US adults potentially affected by recent changes in recommendations for the management of hypertension. The study design was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2005 and 2010 (n = 16,372), we evaluated hypertension control and treatment recommendations for US adults.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Proportion of adults estimated to meet guideline-based BP targets under the 2014 BP guideline and under the previous seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guideline.

- **Results**: The proportion of younger adults (18–59 years) with treatment-eligible hypertension under the JNC 7 guideline was 20.3% (95% CI, 19.1%-21.4%), which decreased to 19.2% (95% CI, 18.1%-20.4%) under the 2014 BP guideline. Larger declines were observed among older adults (≥ 60 years), decreasing from 68.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-70.8%) under JNC 7 to 61.2% (95% CI, 59.3%-63.0%) under the 2014 BP guideline. The proportion of adults with treatment-eligible hypertension who met BP goals increased slightly for younger adults, from 41.2% (95% CI, 38.1%-44.3%) under JNC 7 to 47.5% (95% CI, 44.4%-50.6%) under the 2014 BP guideline.

### Blood pressure goals in patients with CKD: A review of evidence and guidelines [^112u6U1C]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects the vast majority of patients with CKD and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, ESKD, and death. Over the past decade, multiple hypertension guidelines have been published with varying recommendations for BP goals in patients with CKD. Most recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 hypertension guidelines set a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with CKD and others at elevated cardiovascular risk.

These guidelines were heavily influenced by the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which documented that an intensive BP goal to a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in nondiabetic adults at high cardiovascular risk, many of whom had CKD; the intensive BP goal did not retard CKD progression. It is noteworthy that SPRINT measured BP with automated devices (5-minute wait period, average of three readings) often without observers, a technique that potentially results in BP values that are lower than what is typically measured in the office.

Still, results from SPRINT along with long-term follow-up data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension suggest that a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg will reduce mortality in patients with CKD. Unfortunately, data are more limited in patients with diabetes or stage 4–5 CKD. Increased adverse events, including electrolyte abnormalities and decreased eGFR, necessitate careful laboratory monitoring.

In conclusion, a BP goal of < 130/80 is recommended for this patient population, though careful consideration and monitoring are required for those with more advanced CKD or concomitant diabetes.

### Level of blood pressure control and cardiovascular events: SPRINT criteria versus the 2014 hypertension recommendations [^114jQdks]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) targets from the SPRINT (Systolic Pressure Intervention Trial) differ from targets of the 2014 hypertension (HTN) recommendations of the Eighth Joint National Committee.

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to estimate the proportion of hypertensive adults who would meet BP goals under the SPRINT criteria and under the 2014 recommendations, and to determine related effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

- **Methods**: We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2013 (n = 13,346), as well as the Korean National Health Insurance Service health examinee cohort of 2007 (n = 67,965), to estimate the proportion of subjects meeting BP goals of each set of criteria. Using data from the same cohort, we compared risks of major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) associated with different BP control goals.

- **Results**: A substantially lower proportion of hypertensive adults met BP goals of the SPRINT criteria compared with the 2014 recommendations (11.9% vs. 70.8%, respectively). Ten-year predicted cardiovascular risks were lowest in the intensive control group (below SPRINT BP goals), intermediate in the less-intensive group (above SPRINT goals but below 2014 recommendation goals), and highest in the uncontrolled group (above 2014 recommendations) (6.15%, 7.65%, and 9.39%, respectively; p < 0.001).

### Hypertension management algorithm for type 2 diabetic patients applied in primary care [^116qbjvU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension frequently coexists with type 2 diabetes (DM) and increases the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of the study was to obtain and maintain blood pressure (BP) goals (ADA/JNC 7) according to a stepwise algorithm using the medication supplied by the Brazilian government.

- **Methods**: A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients. The intervention consisted of the intensification of lifestyle changes and the sequential prescription of drugs: diuretic, ACE inhibitors, β-adrenergic blocking agents, and calcium channel blocking agents if BP was greater than 130/80 mmHg.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients completed the trial. During the intervention, the number of antihypertensive tablets increased (3.6 ± 3.5 vs. 5.9 ± 3.5 pills/patient; p < 0.001), as did the number of antihypertensive classes (1.8 ± 1.0 vs. 2.70 ± 1.2; p < 0.01). The overall drop in BP was 11 mmHg for SBP (145.0 ± 22.8 vs. 133.7 ± 20.9 mmHg; p < 0.01) and 5 mmHg for DBP (78.7 ± 11.5 vs. 73.7 ± 10.5 mmHg; p = 0.001). Although the number of patients with BP in target almost doubled [14 (18.7%) vs. 30 (38.5%); p = 0.008], less than 40% of the patients achieved the proposed goals.

- **Conclusions**: A BP algorithm applied to type 2 diabetic and hypertensive patients is able to lower BP; however, more than half of the patients did not achieve the ADA/JNC 7 targets, demonstrating the complexity of BP control in this population.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: Impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117Fqb4M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The large cardioprotective benefits associated with the medical management of blood pressure led earlier studies to evaluate the hypothetical impact of 100% elimination of hypertension on the incidence of CVD through metrics like the population‐attributable fraction. For reference, our results suggested that if 100% of aware and treated blood pressure above goal was controlled among African American and whites aged 45 to 64 years, approximately 20,154 CHD events could be prevented annually in the United States, consistent with recently published estimates using the JNC 8 guidelines. Despite considerable clinical and public health efforts to improve hypertension management, no historical precedent is available for achieving 100% control. Instead, nationally representative estimates suggested that ≈43.5% of adults with treatment‐eligible hypertension are not treated to goal.

As an alternative, we estimated event reductions achieved by modest, but plausible decreases in the proportion of the population classified as having unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal. As expected, full implementation of interventions that achieved 10% changes in unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal were estimated to prevent considerably fewer CVD events than fully implemented interventions assuming 100% elimination of blood pressure above goal. This discrepancy reflects the proportion of the population for whom we assume a successful intervention. For example, in a population of 100,000 with a prevalence of blood pressure above goal of 20%, composed of…

### Potential impact of 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: A cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^116NusJe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The median practice-level difference in the proportion of patients meeting their blood pressure (BP) target according to the 2014 panel, but not the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, was 37.8% (interquartile range, 34.8%–40.7%). The practice-level rates showed substantial variability, with some practices having a difference of 50%, while most demonstrated a difference of around 30% to 40%.

- **Differences in proportion of patients meeting BP targets**: Differences were noted as per the 2014 expert panel report but not according to the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline across practices in the PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) Registry. The x-axis represents a random practice identifier, while the y-axis displays the differences in proportions of patients meeting BP targets as per the 2014 expert panel but not the ACC/AHA guidelines.

Similarly, the median practice-level rate of the proportion of patients with hypertension meeting BP targets according to the JNC7 but not the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline was 22.9% (interquartile range, 19.8%–25.9%).

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^116auiTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality, randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas for improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people over 60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that more than 6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences.

While the previous BP target was aimed at individuals over 80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets. The new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults over 60 years of age, for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg based on a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines on hypertension have generated great interest among physicians. These guidelines differ from those published in 2003 (the JNC 7) in the document format, blood-pressure cut-off values, and recommendations for antihypertensive drug use. The JNC 8 has some limitations that could affect clinical practice.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^1139ZnH6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, specifically concerning treatment goals for blood pressure targets in the elderly, the 2017 AAFP/ACP guidelines recommend considering the initiation or intensification of pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of stroke or cardiac events in selected patients aged 60 years or older who are at high cardiovascular risk. Treatment should be based on an individualized assessment.

Set treatment goals based on periodic discussions with the patient about the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, the 2017 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommend initiating treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) persistently ≥ 150 mmHg. The goal is to achieve a target SBP of < 150 mmHg to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, and cardiac events.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: Impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^117XnbgU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, population-wide reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of modest magnitude are predicted to have a substantial impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and should be developed in parallel with interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal. As advocated by many primary prevention statements, the management of blood pressure in adults should not be limited to those classified as hypertensive but should rather extend to the majority of the population below hypertension treatment thresholds. Omitting such individuals leaves a large segment of the population at increased risk of cardiovascular events and constrains the ability of clinicians and public health practitioners to reduce the societal burden of blood pressure–related coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure (HF).

### Frequency and prognosis of treated hypertensive patients according to prior and new blood pressure goals [^117RjvnT]. Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

United States and European guidelines have recommended new treatment goals for office blood pressure (BP). We examined 9,784 hypertensives in the Spanish Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM) registry with office BP treated to the prior goal (< 140/90 mmHg) and evaluated the frequency and all-cause mortality of four BP strata. This depended on whether or not they attained the more conservative or new office BP goal (130–139/80–89 mmHg and < 130/80 mmHg, respectively) and whether or not BP was controlled according to ABPM criteria in the European and US guidelines (24-hour ambulatory BP < 130/80 mmHg and < 125/75 mmHg, respectively).

Whether achieving or not the new office BP goal, the total-mortality risk during a 5-year follow-up was only significantly higher than the reference (normal office BP and ABPM) when 24-hour ambulatory BP was above goal. The hazard ratio from multivariable Cox models was in the range of 2.4–2.9 (P < 0.001). The frequency of patients achieving the new office BP goal was 34.4%, and the frequencies of those not achieving the ABPM goal were 31.6% and 53.7% using the 130/80 or the 125/75 ABPM goal, respectively. Mean office systolic BP was 129 mmHg for patients not achieving the ABPM goal.

In hypertensive patients controlled under the prior office BP goal, the frequency of those achieving the new office BP goal of < 130/80 mmHg was high, suggesting this goal can be attained. In addition, patients had a higher mortality risk only when ABPM was above goal despite having mean office systolic BP under control, a condition that was also common.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

- **Search methods**: For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: New blood pressure targets, lower is better — and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends, in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^115h53Kg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

NICE reviewed three systematic reviews and 27 prognostic studies to develop their treatment threshold recommendations. The cut-off points for ABPM were set lower than those for clinic BP. Evidence for these thresholds came largely from work comparing clinic BP and ABPM to cardiovascular outcomes. The Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) trial was a landmark study in this area, and the authors predicted that a clinic BP of 140/90 mmHg was equivalent to a 24-hour ABPM of 125/80 mmHg or a daytime ABPM of 130/85 mmHg. However, this work was based on prognostic thresholds, and there is very little evidence for comparable treatment targets between ABPM and clinic BP.

As discussed above, Head et al. analyzed clinic BP and ABPM measurements from patients referred to hypertension clinics across Australia. The treatment target recommendations for ABPM and SMBP from the NICE guidelines are largely based on this work.

- **Comparison of recommendations for diagnostic and treatment thresholds between NICE, ESH, JNC, and CHEP guidelines**:

	- **Abbreviations**: OBPM office blood pressure measurement, ABPM ambulatory blood pressure measurement, HBPM home blood pressure measurement, CKD chronic kidney disease

NICE suggests an ABPM treatment target of < 135/85 mmHg for patients below 80 years of age and an ABPM target of < 145/85 mmHg for those patients over 80 years. Currently, they are the only guidelines to specify a common treatment and management threshold for ABPM with the same thresholds assumed for home BP monitoring.

### Blood pressure goal in chronic kidney disease: What is the evidence [^116ngdbG]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Most guidelines recommend that seated clinic blood pressure (BP) be targeted to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The evidence underlying these recommendations is the subject of this review.

- **Recent findings**: The best evidence to target a certain level of BP in patients with CKD comes from randomized trials. Only three trials have prospectively examined the level to which BP should be lowered. These trials, conducted exclusively among patients with CKD, have demonstrated that compared to a less aggressive BP goal, a goal of less than 130/80 mmHg neither saves lives nor protects the kidney or the cardiovascular system.

- **Summary**: It is reasonable to achieve a goal of less than 140/90 mmHg in most patients with CKD. More aggressive lowering is not firmly supported by data. Since BP control is important, hypertension therapy should be individualized. Individualization through home BP measurements to diagnose, monitor, and treat hypertension appears to be an attractive option.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly in managing hypertension and blood pressure targets, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacologic treatment to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to less than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to less than 90 mmHg in adult patients with diabetes mellitus who have an SBP of 140 mmHg or higher, or a DBP of 90 mmHg or higher.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112M8ivC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the United States developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after blood pressure treatment intensification.

### Long-term effectiveness of non-drug recommendations to treat hypertension in a clinical setting [^115TjEad]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Nonpharmacological interventions have been efficacious in controlling blood pressure (BP) in clinical trials, but their long-term effectiveness in clinical practice had not been previously documented.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study included 825 patients who received repeated nonpharmacological recommendations to treat hypertension. The outcomes measured were BP change and rate of BP control, categorized by the pattern of adherence to recommendations such as following low-salt and low-calorie diets and engaging in physical activities.

- **Results**: Patients were followed for an average of 23.1 ± 8.4 months. After adjusting for baseline BP, body mass index (BMI), age, and the number of medications in use, the between-group differences in BP change for those adhering to a low-salt diet were 5.1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 1.7–8.6) for systolic BP (P = 0.003) and 2.1 mm Hg (0.2–3.9) for diastolic BP (P = 0.02). For adherence to a low-calorie diet, the differences were 6.6 mm Hg (2.9–10.2) (P < 0.001) for systolic BP and 2.0 mm Hg (0.1–3.9) (P = 0.045) for diastolic BP. Adherence to physical activities was not associated with a BP-lowering effect. The relative risks for a reduction of 10 mm Hg in systolic or 5 mm Hg in diastolic BP, adjusted for confounding factors, were 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.55–0.87) for the low-salt diet, 0.83 (0.66–1.05) for the low-calorie diet, and 0.99 (0.79–1.24) for exercise.

- **Conclusions**: Adherence to low-salt and low-calorie diets is associated with clinically relevant long-term BP reduction and improved hypertension control in a clinical setting.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^115XhywC]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that, in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16,527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

In the US population aged 20 years or older, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population:

- **Risk group A**: 5.1% (3.2 million) had no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease.
- **Risk group B**: 66.3% (41.4 million) had ≥ 1 major risk factor.
- **Risk group C**: 28.6% (17.9 million) had diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, or target organ damage.

Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg) and at least one factor placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication.

### Blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients [^1166x5ob]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Although previous guidelines recommended strict blood pressure (BP) control in diabetic patients, this has been challenged in recent guidelines. The British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2011 recommended commencing treatment in diabetic patients with stage 1 hypertension, defined as a clinic BP > 140/90 mmHg and an ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) daytime average or home BP monitoring (HBPM) average BP of > 135/85 mmHg.

The recently published 2016 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommended that hypertensive diabetic patients be treated if they have a diastolic BP of > 80 mmHg or a systolic BP > 140 mmHg, with a target BP value of < 140/90 mmHg. These guidelines state that individuals in whom stroke risk is a concern may, as part of shared decision-making, have lower systolic targets such as 130 mmHg. This is particularly true if lower BP can be achieved with few drugs and without side effects of therapy.

The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines from 2014 recommend a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg, but they also suggest that lower targets may be considered. The American Society of Hypertension (ASH)/International Society of Hypertension (ISH) guidelines from 2014 propose a BP goal of < 140/90 mmHg in diabetic patients. These values are lower than those recommended by the majority of the JNC 8 panel for non-diabetic patients aged 60–79, which was < 150/90 mmHg, yet similar to those recommended for non-diabetics aged 18–60 years.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure emphasizes the urgent need to lower blood pressure (BP) to a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with uncomplicated hypertension and to < 130/80 mm Hg in high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease, to prevent cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Consequently, a meaningful measure of the efficacy of an antihypertensive therapy is its ability to achieve BP reduction to below the recommended BP goals.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are highly effective antihypertensive agents with excellent tolerability profiles similar to those of placebo. A literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS to identify studies reporting data on the percentage of patients attaining BP goals found that monotherapy with an ARB can generally result in the attainment of the diastolic BP (DBP) goal of < 90 mm Hg in approximately 50% of hypertensive patients. However, to our knowledge, the attainment of the systolic BP (SBP) and combined SBP/DBP goals with ARB monotherapy has not been reported.

Therefore, a secondary analysis of BP efficacy data from a published study that directly compared recommended starting doses of four currently marketed ARB was performed to assess combined SBP and DBP goal attainment. This analysis showed that the percentage of patients achieving the combined SBP/DBP goal rate of < 140/90 mm Hg was highest with olmesartan medoxomil (32.4%) compared with recommended starting doses of losartan potassium.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects approximately 29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of over 65% in individuals older than 60 years. It is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for about 41% of all CVD deaths. There is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. Furthermore, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. Despite improvements in BP recognition and control, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled.

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high-quality, evidence-based guidelines, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided nonetheless to publish their recommendations independently.

### Proceedings from a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workshop to control hypertension [^115UxSsE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexities, which may have contributed to the decline in controlled blood pressure.

The 2017 AHA/ACC blood pressure guideline and the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8) have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.

It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced blood pressure control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults aged 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

### Eligibility to treatment and economic effect of the implementation of the new U.S. or European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology hypertension guidelines [^112PENcT]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). High credibility.

To evaluate the population and economic impact of implementing the new Joint National Committee (JNC) or European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) hypertension guidelines in the Swiss population, a cross-sectional, population-based sample was collected. The sample included 6,708 participants gathered between 2003 and 2006 in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland. Blood pressure categories were defined according to both the JNC (JNC-7 and JNC-8) and the ESH/ESC (2007 and 2013) guidelines.

The results showed that the proportion of participants aged 35–60 years eligible for drug treatment was 25.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 24.4–26.9%] under the JNC-7 guidelines and 24.8% (95% CI 23.6–26.0%) under the JNC-8 guidelines. For participants aged 60–75 years, the values were 62.3% (95% CI 60.1–64.5%) under JNC-7 and 46.8% (95% CI 44.5–49.0%) under JNC-8. Shifting from the JNC-7 to the JNC-8 guidelines would lead to an annual saving of 163.6 million Swiss francs (187.7 million US dollars or 134.5 million euros).

For the ESH/ESC 2007 and 2013 guidelines, the proportion of participants aged 35–75 years without chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or reported history of cardiovascular disease and eligible for treatment was 30.2% (95% CI 29.0–31.4%). For participants with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or reported history of cardiovascular disease, the values were 73.6% (95% CI 70.8–76.3%) for the ESH/ESC 2007 and 55.6% (95% CI 52.5–58.8%) for ESH/ESC 2013. Shifting from the ESH/ESC 2007 to the ESH/ESC 2013 guidelines would result in an annual saving of 86.9 million Swiss francs (99.5 million US dollars).

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

- **Search methods**: For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs with more than 50 participants.

### The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guideline and blood pressure in older adults [^1175oSus]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood pressure guideline redefined hypertension and lowered the blood pressure treatment target, highlighting the need for empirical data on the guideline's impact.

- **Methods**: Data were analyzed from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study participants who attended baseline pre-guideline (2016–2017) and post-guideline (2018–2019) visits with baseline systolic blood pressure between 120 and 159 mmHg. Participants were grouped according to baseline systolic blood pressure by change in classification under the new guideline as follows: not reclassified (120–129 mmHg), reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension (130–139 mmHg), and reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension (140–159 mmHg). Means and 95% confidence intervals for systolic blood pressure changes between baseline and follow-up, changes in antihypertensive use, and percentages that achieved the post-guideline recommendation (systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg) were calculated. Analyses were performed in 2021–2022.

- **Results**: Among 2,193 community-dwelling Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities participants aged 71–95 years at baseline, systolic blood pressure changes between baseline and follow-up visits differed among participants not reclassified (+4.1 mmHg, 95% CI = 3.0, 5.3 mmHg), reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension (-1.1 mmHg, 95% CI = -2.2, 0.1 mmHg), and reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension (-5.7 mmHg, 95% CI = -6.8, -4.7 mmHg). Antihypertensive use changed from 77.3% to 78.4% (p = 0.25) among participants reclassified to Stage 1 hypertension and from 78.3% to 81.4% (p < 0.01) among participants reclassified to Stage 2 hypertension.

### Comparative cost-effectiveness of conservative or intensive blood pressure treatment guidelines in adults aged 35–74 years: The cardiovascular disease policy model [^117WSJBJ]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The population health effect and cost-effectiveness of implementing intensive blood pressure goals in high-cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk adults have not been described. Using the CVD Policy Model, CVD events, treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years, and drug and monitoring costs were simulated over 2016 to 2026 for hypertensive patients aged 35 to 74 years. We projected the effectiveness and costs of hypertension treatment according to the 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC)-7 or 2014 JNC8 guidelines, and then for adults aged ≥ 50 years, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding an intensive goal of systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg for patients with CVD, chronic kidney disease, or 10-year CVD risk ≥ 15%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios < $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years gained were considered cost-effective. JNC7 strategies treat more patients and are more costly to implement compared with JNC8 strategies. Adding intensive systolic blood pressure goals for high-risk patients prevents an estimated 43,000 and 35,000 annual CVD events incrementally to JNC8 and JNC7, respectively. Intensive strategies save costs in men and are cost-effective in women compared with JNC8 alone. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years gained, JNC8+intensive had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in women (82%) and JNC7+intensive the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in men (100%). Assuming higher drug and monitoring costs, adding intensive goals for high-risk patients remained consistently cost-effective in men, but not always.

### Uncontrolled hypertension by the 2014 evidence-based guideline: Results from NHANES 2011–2012 [^1152pkJz]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension using several hypertension guidelines, including the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7), European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP). It also aimed to assess the predictors of being reclassified to controlled hypertension based on the 2014 evidence-based guideline (2014 EBG) in comparison to JNC 7.

Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2011–2012, the researchers determined the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension using various guidelines, including the 2014 EBG, JNC 7, ESH/ESC, and CHEP. This prevalence was further analyzed by subgroups categorized by age, sex, race, and the presence of chronic kidney disease or diabetes. Predictors for reclassification to controlled hypertension by the 2014 EBG were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

The study found that the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension was 12.8% according to the 2014 EBG, compared to 16.6% by JNC 7, 13.6% by ESH/ESC, and 15.6% by CHEP (P < 0.001). According to the JNC 7, 23.0% of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension were reclassified as having controlled hypertension by the 2014 EBG. Those more likely to be reclassified were older adults, females, and individuals with diabetes.

Based on the updated 2014 evidence-based high blood pressure guideline, the percentage of the US population identified as having uncontrolled hypertension decreased from 16.6% to 12.8%.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^114BoaGX]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, and more specifically with respect to the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend considering the addition of antihypertensive drugs from other classes if the goal BP cannot be reached using only the initial drugs. This may occur due to a contraindication or the necessity to use more than three drugs to achieve the goal BP.

### Blood pressure control and pharmacotherapy patterns in the United States before and after the release of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines [^115KUtvE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations from the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), only 36.8% of patients were at target blood pressure (BP) in 2003 and 2004. The objective of this study was to assess improvements in BP control and treatment patterns before and after the publication of JNC 7.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, time series analysis of 27 provider groups and managed care organizations from 1998 through 2006. Patients with hypertension were identified from more than 4,000 physicians. Medical charts were collected, and clinical data were evaluated using prevailing JNC criteria during the time period before and after JNC 7.

- **Results**: A total of 19,258 patients were identified with hypertension: 15,258 included in the before-JNC 7 cohort and 4,000 in the after-JNC 7 cohort. BP control in the before-JNC 7 cohort was 40.8% compared with 49.3% in the after-JNC 7 cohort (P < .0001). After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, patients in the before-JNC 7 cohort were 45% less likely to achieve BP control compared with the after-JNC 7 cohort (odds ratio, 0.551; P < .0001).

Although findings indicate BP control is improving, a significant need for further improvement remains.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^111oejbf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

When we do not have randomized trial evidence, high-quality observational data and meta-analyses may be helpful in the formulation of a more comprehensive BP treatment guideline. Several studies have found a modest-to-high correlation between RCTs and nonrandomized studies in estimating the benefit of medical interventions, although the magnitudes of effect were not always similar. Results from one large cohort supporting a lower BP target were reported by Sim et al. in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system. This retrospective analysis examined nearly 400,000 people treated for hypertension to determine the optimal treatment target for the composite endpoint of mortality and end-stage renal disease. The lowest risk of the primary outcome was seen at an on-treatment BP of 137/71 mm Hg, with a J-shaped curve suggesting higher risk with lower and higher BP targets. In subgroup analysis, a similar curve was seen in those ≥ 70 years of age with a higher optimal target of 140/70 mm Hg.

Along with the Kaiser study, a meta-analysis by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (BPLTTC) confirmed a benefit in treating stage I hypertension (BP 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg). With a mean age of 63 years and mean baseline SBP of 146 mm Hg, the patients in the active treatment arm had an average BP reduction of 3.6/2.4 mm Hg and odds ratios of 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.94) for strokes, 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.98) for CVD deaths, and 0.78 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.92) for all-cause mortality.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning treatment goals and blood pressure targets in the elderly, the AAFP/ACP 2017 guidelines recommend considering initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment. This is aimed at achieving a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg to reduce the risk of stroke or cardiac events in patients aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Set treatment goals based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### Attainment of NICE blood pressure targets among older people with newly diagnosed hypertension: Nationwide linked electronic health records cohort study [^1172LUi8]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

It is not known if clinical practice reflects guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in older people and whether guideline adherence varies according to overall health status.

- **Aims**: To describe the proportion of older people attaining National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline blood pressure targets within 1 year of hypertension diagnosis and determine predictors of target attainment.

- **Methods**: A nationwide cohort study of Welsh primary care data was conducted from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank, including patients aged ≥ 65 years, newly diagnosed with hypertension between 1st June 2011 and 1st June 2016. The primary outcome was the attainment of NICE guideline blood pressure targets, as measured by the latest blood pressure recording up to 1 year after diagnosis. Predictors of target attainment were investigated using logistic regression.

- **Results**: There were 26,392 patients (55% women, median age 71 [IQR 68–77] years) included, of which 13,939 (52.8%) attained a target blood pressure within a median follow-up of 9 months. Success in attaining target blood pressure was associated with a history of atrial fibrillation (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11, 1.43), heart failure (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06, 1.49), and myocardial infarction (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10, 1.32), all compared to no history of each, respectively. Care home residence, the severity of frailty, and increasing co-morbidity were not associated with target attainment following adjustment for confounder variables.

- **Conclusions**: Blood pressure remains insufficiently controlled 1 year after hypertension diagnosis in this cohort.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: Analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^114688So]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

After the publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first-line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first-line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017, but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre-JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014. Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014. The probability of receiving thiazide diuretics did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%−5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 among Black patients.

- **Figure 4: Trends of antihypertensive treatment regimen in response to change in treatment guideline**. Odds ratio is interpreted as the odds of receiving a beta blocker as first-line therapy (A) or CCB and thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy for Black patients (B) among all treatment episodes during the specified period compared with the reference period 2010–2014. This includes receiving dual therapy and FDC for patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg compared with the reference period 2015–2017 (C), controlling for order of prescription episode, site, age, sex, race, ethnicity, hypertension control, body mass index, and other chronic disease histories. ACC/AHA indicates American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association.

### Effect of intensive structured care on individual blood pressure targets in primary care: Multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YPJRN]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Figure 3 shows the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure according to individual blood pressure targets at randomisation (n = 1492). On an adjusted basis, participants assigned to the intervention were significantly more likely to achieve their target at the two higher blood pressure target levels.

- **Change in absolute cardiovascular risk**: Among the 1,141 participants in whom absolute cardiovascular risk profiles were calculated from baseline to 26 weeks' follow-up (i.e. complete data on profiling both before and after randomisation), the intervention group experienced a significantly greater reduction in risk scores (14.7% (SD 9.3%) to 10.9% (SD 8.0%); −3.7% (SD 4.5%)) compared to the usual care group (15.0% (SD 10.1%) to 12.4% (SD 9.4%); −2.6% (SD 4.5%)). The adjusted mean reduction in risk favored the intervention group (−1.13%, 95% confidence interval −0.69% to −1.63%). Notably, the percentage of patients with a baseline high absolute risk (≥ 15% absolute risk of an event) in the intervention group decreased from 41.2% to 25.6%, whereas in the usual care group, it decreased from 40.2% to 30.1%.
