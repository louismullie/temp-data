## Question

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise diagnostic and management algorithm for suspected GERD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the initial assessment, including typical versus extraesophageal symptoms and alarm features. Then, I should verify the initial empiric management pathway with PPIs and lifestyle measures. Next, I will review how to assess treatment response and define refractory GERD. After that, I need to check the diagnostic workup sequence: endoscopy off PPI, ambulatory reflux monitoring, and manometry. Then, I will consider management tailored to objective findings, including medical optimization and procedural options such as fundoplication, TIF, and Stretta. I should also examine extraesophageal presentations, special populations, and long-term follow-up and surveillance, ensuring shared decision-making and PPI stewardship throughout.

> Let me first confirm the symptom framework and the working definition of GERD, because if I start from the wrong premise, everything downstream could misfire. Typical esophageal symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation often allow a presumptive diagnosis and an empiric therapeutic trial in the absence of alarm features, while "troublesome" symptoms that impair quality of life define clinically relevant GERD in contemporary reviews, so I should keep that threshold in mind during triage [^111scUUW]. Hold on, I should also review extraesophageal manifestations such as chronic cough, laryngitis, asthma, dental erosions, and noncardiac chest pain, because their presence shifts testing strategy and lowers the specificity of symptom-based diagnosis, especially if typical heartburn is absent [^115KM5vq] [^113uRcum].

> Next, I should screen for alarm features without delay, because missing these changes management from empiric therapy to prompt endoscopy. Alarm features include dysphagia or odynophagia, unintentional weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent vomiting, and unexplained iron deficiency anemia; chest pain requires cardiology exclusion first before attributing it to reflux, and if present, endoscopic evaluation should not be deferred [^115i1PB1] [^111aB4BW] [^114GnoGJ]. I need to ensure I also factor Barrett's risk: age 50 or older, male sex, white race, central obesity, smoking, or a family history of Barrett's or esophageal adenocarcinoma, because these can justify early endoscopy even without classic alarm symptoms [^112BYF8i].

> For patients with typical symptoms and no alarm features, I will now examine the appropriateness of an empiric PPI trial. A 4–8 week trial of a once-daily PPI, taken correctly 30–60 minutes before the first meal, is appropriate and cost-effective; if initial response is suboptimal, switching to a more potent agent or increasing to twice daily may be reasonable, though I should avoid escalating before assessing adherence and timing first [^114cCD18]. Wait, let me verify that guidelines concur: both ACG and AGA endorse empiric PPIs in this scenario, and suggest moving to diagnostic testing if symptoms persist after an adequate trial or recur on withdrawal, which frames the next steps [^114cCD18] [^112NP6wx].

> I should confirm that lifestyle measures are recommended for virtually all patients in parallel with medical therapy, even though evidence quality varies. Weight loss for those with overweight or obesity, smoking cessation, head-of-bed elevation, avoidance of recumbency for about three hours after meals, and individualized trigger minimization are reasonable and guideline-endorsed; structured weight reduction is associated with clinically meaningful symptom improvement in observational and prospective cohorts, so I should emphasize this early [^112A9Xq2] [^114Kon4r] [^111jdZFt] [^113g991u]. Hold on, I should double-check that practical, patient-centered advice is encouraged; recent consensus statements and nutrition guidelines support standardized education and lifestyle support to improve outcomes and reduce overreliance on high-dose PPIs long term [^116CXFEx] [^1131C2ZY] [^111zeLSJ].

> After 8 weeks, I need to reassess response carefully. If symptoms largely resolve, I should confirm the plan to use the lowest effective maintenance dose and consider dose step-down or intermittent therapy when stable for several months, while maintaining lifestyle optimization and shared decision-making about risks, benefits, and monitoring of chronic PPI use as part of stewardship [^111zeLSJ] [^115p31Sp]. But wait, I must not jump to conclusions; recurrence off therapy or incomplete control should prompt confirmation of adherence, timing, and the possibility of alternate diagnoses before reflexively escalating treatment or labeling the case as refractory [^111zeLSJ].

> I should now define refractory GERD precisely, because mislabeling functional disease as GERD leads to inappropriate escalation. Troublesome symptoms persisting despite appropriately timed once-daily PPI often triggers the "refractory" label; prevalence estimates around 40% among treated patients reflect the heterogeneity of mechanisms, including nonacid reflux, reflux hypersensitivity, and functional heartburn, many of which are not acid-mediated and require testing before intensifying acid suppression [^116kLUoe] [^113sGb53]. Let me reconsider: before escalating to twice-daily dosing, guidelines advise moving to objective evaluation if the initial trial was adequate, as diagnostic clarity improves targeted therapy and avoids overtreatment [^111zeLSJ] [^112NP6wx].

> For the diagnostic workup, I will now examine upper endoscopy as the first-line investigation in specific contexts. Endoscopy is indicated for alarm symptoms, failure of an 8-week PPI trial, recurrence after stopping PPIs, high risk for Barrett's, and certain special populations; to maximize diagnostic yield for esophagitis, I should stop PPIs for 2–4 weeks before the procedure when it is safe to do so and obtain biopsies even if the mucosa appears normal to assess for alternative pathology such as eosinophilic esophagitis or microscopic esophagitis [^114cCD18] [^114GnoGJ] [^116KAQJJ]. Wait, let me verify documentation standards: I should use LA grading for erosive esophagitis, Prague classification for Barrett's, and carefully record GEJ landmarks, hiatal hernia size, and Hill grade with photo-documentation to guide subsequent management [^115jVrQN].

> Interpreting endoscopy requires nuance, so I need to ensure I link findings to downstream testing correctly. Severe erosive esophagitis (LA C or D) constitutes objective GERD and obviates the need for off-therapy reflux monitoring; by contrast, normal endoscopy or mild LA A/B changes are insufficient alone and usually warrant reflux monitoring to confirm GERD before long-term or invasive therapies, and long-segment Barrett's is similarly considered objective evidence in which further pH testing is not needed for diagnosis [^1146HQs6] [^112NP6wx] [^114K6Fx3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost equated LA A/B with definite GERD; I should double-check that ACG 2013 explicitly advises additional confirmation in Grade A because of limited specificity, reinforcing the role of physiologic testing in such cases [^116FETv3].

> Next, I should review ambulatory reflux monitoring indications and timing, because this is the linchpin for diagnostic clarity. Off-therapy pH or pH-impedance monitoring is indicated when endoscopy is normal or equivocal to establish or refute GERD, while on-therapy impedance-pH testing is appropriate when GERD is established and symptoms persist despite PPI, to assess breakthrough reflux and symptom association, distinguishing true PPI failure from functional disorders [^112NP6wx] [^113sioh5]. For extraesophageal presentations, I need to tailor testing on- or off-therapy based on the clinical scenario, recognizing the absence of a single definitive tool and integrating global clinical impression with test results and response to therapy [^116wk1t7] [^1132eXKb] [^114wiYDb].

> I will now examine the role of esophageal manometry, being careful not to misuse it as a diagnostic test for GERD. Manometry does not diagnose GERD, but it is essential preoperatively to exclude major motility disorders and to characterize peristalsis, and it is reasonable in refractory cases with normal endoscopy and reflux monitoring to evaluate for motility abnormalities that may guide management or contraindicate surgery such as absent contractility or achalasia mimics [^11419r5f] [^111L1McA] [^111DRQpx]. Hold on, I should verify escalation logic: if endoscopy and reflux monitoring are unrevealing yet symptoms persist, high-resolution manometry is endorsed to complete the evaluation before considering invasive interventions [^115gxqKW].

> With objective GERD confirmed and persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy, I should confirm medical optimization before procedural options. Strategies include PPI optimization or switching to a more potent agent, moving to twice-daily dosing in selected cases, and adding a bedtime H2RA for documented nocturnal acid breakthrough; in suboptimal responders, CYP2C19 pharmacogenomic testing may guide PPI choice and dosing to improve acid suppression and outcomes [^116kLUoe] [^115Cic86]. But wait, let me ensure that nonacid mechanisms are not overlooked; if impedance shows nonacid reflux with symptom association, non-acid directed strategies or procedural options may be preferable to further acid escalation [^113sioh5].

> When structural or mechanical contributors are present, I need to align the intervention to anatomy and physiology. For large hiatal hernias, or when Hill grade is III–IV, surgical evaluation for laparoscopic fundoplication with concurrent hernia repair, or a combined hernia repair plus TIF (cTIF) where appropriate, should be considered in a multidisciplinary context; guideline panels often favor posterior partial fundoplication to balance reflux control and side effects, although selection should be individualized [^115ZijKH] [^111JFPsc] [^1166eoBZ]. For small hernias 2 cm or less with Hill I–II and documented GERD, TIF is a reasonable alternative in patients with chronic PPI exposure, regurgitation-predominant symptoms, refractoriness, or preference to avoid long-term PPIs; Stretta may be considered when fundoplication or TIF are not feasible, though I should discuss the variable evidence base with the patient [^116vKytq] [^1128265b].

> Let me now consider regurgitation-predominant disease, because PPIs frequently disappoint here. In patients with objective GERD and regurgitation as the dominant, PPI-refractory symptom, antireflux surgery or TIF is recommended over continued medical therapy alone, as symptom mechanisms often relate to mechanical reflux rather than acidity per se [^113Cts9c]. I should confirm that patients understand the benefit-risk balance and that preoperative testing supports a reflux-mediated mechanism before proceeding [^111L1McA].

> For extraesophageal manifestations, I need to ensure I do not jump to invasive therapy without hard evidence. Diagnosis should not rely on laryngoscopy alone; instead, obtain objective evidence of GERD and use a multidisciplinary approach integrating ENT, pulmonology, or allergy where relevant, tailoring testing and therapy to the suspected mechanism and recognizing that failure to respond to PPIs predicts poor surgical outcomes and should temper enthusiasm for antireflux procedures [^115r645A] [^115baWXJ] [^115baWXJ]. Let me verify alternatives for persistent extraesophageal symptoms: lifestyle and dietary modifications, alginate therapy, neuromodulators, CBT-based strategies, and external UES compression devices may be considered as part of comprehensive care when reflux is not the sole driver or remains unproven [^113D5ura] [^116wk1t7].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios so I do not overlook important nuances. After sleeve gastrectomy or POEM, GERD risk is increased; symptomatic patients warrant endoscopic evaluation and tailored management, often in conjunction with foregut surgery or bariatric expertise, with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass considered when GERD coexists with severe obesity and lifestyle measures fail [^1122WDcB] [^112uJwPP] [^112dz6yH]. In pediatrics, a careful history and examination guide initial management, reserving endoscopy for alarm features; in adults with chest pain but no heartburn, cardiac causes must be excluded first, with endoscopy and reflux monitoring considered thereafter based on persistence and risk [^114SWH8D] [^113uRcum] [^111aB4BW].

> For long-term follow-up and surveillance, I need to ensure maintenance is individualized and risks are balanced. The goal is symptom control and mucosal healing on the lowest effective PPI dose with periodic reassessment and step-down when feasible, accompanied by ongoing lifestyle measures and education about PPI safety as part of stewardship; after healing severe erosive esophagitis (LA C/D), a repeat endoscopy is recommended to exclude underlying Barrett's, and patients with chronic GERD should be monitored for complications according to risk [^111zeLSJ] [^1144CQA2] [^115p31Sp]. Hold on, I should not forget quality-of-life impact and shared decision-making; for many, sustained symptom relief and function are the primary outcomes that guide therapy intensity over time [^111zeLSJ].

> Stepping back, I should reaffirm key principles that anchor this algorithm. Objective evidence of GERD is required before invasive antireflux procedures, testing should escalate in a stepwise manner matched to symptom severity and response, and multidisciplinary care improves outcomes in complex phenotypes; throughout, shared decision-making and PPI stewardship help align therapy with patient goals and evolving evidence while avoiding overtreatment and unnecessary risk [^111JFPsc] [^112NP6wx] [^1161MnkZ] [^111zeLSJ].

GERD is a **chronic condition** [^116289iV] caused by reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, leading to symptoms and complications. Diagnosis is usually clinical for typical presentations [^111scUUW]; endoscopy is indicated for alarm features or refractory symptoms [^114GnoGJ] [^114cCD18], and pH monitoring when the diagnosis is uncertain [^112NP6wx] [^111T7xLZ]. Management focuses on lifestyle changes and PPIs [^115p31Sp]; surgery or endoscopic options are considered for refractory or complicated disease [^111JFPsc] [^1122WDcB]. Key points: **clinical diagnosis** for typical symptoms [^111zeLSJ], **PPIs are first-line** therapy [^115ocwcJ], and **objective testing** for refractory or atypical cases [^114wiYDb].

---

## Pathophysiology

GERD arises from **multiple mechanisms**. These include transient LES relaxations — the primary mechanism permitting reflux [^1137hxwF] [^114qBgGd]; reduced LES pressure that weakens the sphincter [^1137hxwF] [^1158WG2M]; hiatal hernia disrupting the gastroesophageal junction [^1137hxwF] [^115uQkS8]; impaired esophageal clearance with delayed acid clearance [^1137hxwF] [^117Pw8H4]; and delayed gastric emptying, which increases gastric volume and reflux [^1137hxwF] [^116289iV].

---

## Clinical presentation

GERD presents with **typical and atypical symptoms**:

| **Symptom type** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Typical | - Heartburn [^116289iV] <br/> - Regurgitation <br/> - Dysphagia |
| Atypical | - Chronic cough <br/> - Laryngitis <br/> - Asthma [^1132eXKb] <br/> - Dental erosions [^115KM5vq] |

---

Alarm symptoms (dysphagia, weight loss, GI bleeding) require **prompt evaluation** [^114GnoGJ] [^115i1PB1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is usually **clinical** for typical presentations; testing is reserved for specific scenarios:

- **Empiric PPI trial**: 4–8 weeks [^111zeLSJ] for typical symptoms without alarms [^111scUUW].
- **Endoscopy**: For alarm symptoms, refractory symptoms, or Barrett's risk [^114cCD18] [^1122WDcB].
- **Ambulatory reflux monitoring**: pH or impedance-pH when the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms are refractory [^112NP6wx] [^111T7xLZ].
- **Manometry**: Not for diagnosis; use for preoperative planning or motility assessment [^111DRQpx] [^11419r5f].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **weight loss** for overweight or obese patients [^1131C2ZY] [^112A9Xq2] and dietary changes — such as avoiding triggers, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and eating smaller meals [^111jdZFt] [^116289iV]. Smoking cessation is recommended [^114Kon4r], and head-of-bed elevation is recommended for nocturnal symptoms [^111jdZFt] [^115va67t].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **PPIs**: First-line for symptom control and mucosal healing [^115ocwcJ] [^115p31Sp].
- **H2RAs**: Alternative or adjunctive therapy [^1129s8aN].
- **Antacids**: Short-term relief [^112ARiWo].
- **Prokinetics**: Limited role; consider for delayed gastric emptying [^112ARiWo] [^114qBgGd].

---

### Surgical and endoscopic interventions

Surgical and endoscopic interventions are considered for refractory symptoms or complications [^113Cts9c]; **laparoscopic fundoplication** is a standard option [^111JFPsc] [^1166eoBZ]. Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) is an alternative for select patients [^116vKytq], and the Stretta procedure may be used when other therapies are not feasible [^1128265b].

---

## Complications

Untreated GERD can lead to:

- **Esophagitis**: Inflammation of the esophagus [^111scUUW] [^116289iV].
- **Strictures**: Narrowing from chronic inflammation [^111scUUW] [^113ZxQtP].
- **Barrett's esophagus**: Metaplasia with cancer risk [^111scUUW] [^113ZxQtP].
- **Esophageal adenocarcinoma**: Increased risk with chronic GERD [^111scUUW] [^116289iV].

---

## Prognosis

GERD is chronic and recurrent; prognosis depends on adherence and disease severity [^111scUUW]. Most patients **respond to medical therapy**, but some require surgery or endoscopic therapy [^116289iV].

---

GERD is a chronic condition with typical and atypical presentations [^116289iV]. Diagnosis is usually clinical for typical cases, with testing for alarm features or refractory symptoms [^114cCD18]. Management includes **lifestyle changes**, **PPIs** [^115p31Sp], and surgical or endoscopic therapy for refractory or complicated disease [^113Cts9c].

### Endoscopic management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A review [^112jFFZM]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is the most common esophageal disorder encountered in the United States. Its symptoms are associated with a negative quality of life and increased healthcare costs, necessitating an effective management strategy. Although proton pump inhibitors remain the primary treatment, they do not cure the disorder and may leave patients with persistent symptoms despite treatment. Moreover, patients remain at risk of developing complications such as peptic strictures, Barrett's metaplasia, and esophageal cancer.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been the conventional alternative treatment for patients who develop complications, experience intractable symptoms, or wish to discontinue taking proton pump inhibitors. Nevertheless, investigators have continued to develop several endoscopic approaches for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease. This report reviews the history of endoscopic treatments devised for managing gastroesophageal reflux disease and examines the published data and outcomes associated with the latest approach — endoscopic fundoplication using the EsophyX2 device.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: Summary and recommendations [^1122WDcB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

This clinical practice guideline from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) provides an evidence-based approach for strategies to diagnose and manage GERD. This document was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework and serves as an update to the 2014 ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of GERD.

This updated guideline addresses the indications for endoscopy in patients with GERD, as well as in the emerging population of patients who develop GERD after sleeve gastrectomy or peroral endoscopic myotomy. It also discusses how to endoscopically evaluate gastroesophageal junctional integrity in a comprehensive and uniform manner.

Importantly, this guideline also discusses management strategies for GERD, including the role of lifestyle interventions, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and endoscopic antireflux therapy (including transoral incisionless fundoplication [TIF], radiofrequency energy, and combined hiatal hernia repair and TIF [cTIF]) in the management of GERD.

- **Endoscopy recommendations**: The ASGE suggests upper endoscopy for the evaluation of GERD in patients with alarm symptoms, multiple risk factors for Barrett's esophagus, and a history of sleeve gastrectomy. The ASGE recommends careful endoscopic evaluation, reporting, and photo-documentation of objective GERD findings with attention to gastroesophageal junction landmarks and integrity in patients who undergo upper endoscopy to improve care.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: In patients with GERD symptoms, the ASGE recommends lifestyle modifications.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: A review [^116289iV]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined by troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, or GERD-specific complications and affects approximately 20% of the adult population in high-income countries.

- **Observations**: GERD can influence patients' health-related quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity, tobacco smoking, and genetic predisposition increase the risk of developing GERD. Typical GERD symptoms are often sufficient to determine the diagnosis, but less common symptoms and signs, such as dysphagia and chronic cough, may occur. Patients with typical GERD symptoms can be treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Among patients who do not respond to such treatment or if the diagnosis is unclear, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and esophageal pH monitoring are recommended. Patients with GERD symptoms combined with warning symptoms of malignancy (e.g. dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding) and those with other main risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as older age, male sex, and obesity, should undergo endoscopy.

- **Treatment options**: Lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery are the main treatment options for GERD. Weight loss and smoking cessation are often useful. Medication with a PPI is the most common treatment, and after initial full-dose therapy, which usually is omeprazole 20 mg once daily, the aim is to use the lowest effective dose. Observational studies have suggested several adverse effects after long-term PPI use.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113sioh5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly in the management of refractory disease, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend considering esophageal impedance-pH monitoring on PPIs in patients with an established diagnosis of GERD if symptoms have not responded adequately to twice-daily PPIs.

---

### Telemetry capsule for ambulatory pH monitoring: Is it time for a change [^116JVWCS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no clear gold standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most common practice, a therapeutic trial of antisecretory therapy, falls short of being ideal. Endoscopy is insensitive and impractical as an early diagnostic test for the majority of patient presentations. Ambulatory reflux monitoring offers the most effective means of documenting the presence of abnormal esophageal acid exposure and abnormal reflux frequency and to correlate the association of symptoms and reflux episodes. However, even this diagnostic test has fallen short of being an adequate and reliable standard for diagnosis. Telemetry capsule monitoring offers the opportunity for creative improvement in the diagnostic utility of pH monitoring and is the subject of the study discussed.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^111jdZFt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with reflux-like symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) are often not well advised on implementing individualized strategies to help control their symptoms using dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, behavioral changes, or fast-acting rescue therapies. One reason for this may be the lack of emphasis in management guidelines due to 'low-quality' evidence and a paucity of interventional studies. Thus, a panel of 11 gastroenterologists and primary care doctors used the Delphi method to develop consolidated advice for patients based on expert consensus.

A steering committee selected topics for literature searches using the PubMed database, and a modified Delphi process, including two online meetings and two rounds of voting, was conducted to generate consensus statements based on prespecified criteria (67% voting 'strongly agree' or 'agree with minor reservation'). After expert discussion and two rounds of voting, 21 consensus statements were generated and assigned strength of evidence and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) rating.

- **Dietary advice**: Eleven statements achieved the strongest (100%) agreement: five are related to diet and include identification and avoidance of dietary triggers, limiting alcohol, coffee, and carbonated beverages, and advising patients troubled by postprandial symptoms not to overeat.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: The remaining six statements concern advice around smoking cessation, weight loss, raising the head of the bed, avoiding recumbency after meals, stress reduction, and alginate use.

The aim of developing the consensus statements is to provide clear and evidence-based advice to patients to manage their reflux-like symptoms effectively.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend considering esophageal pH monitoring. The monitoring can be performed using Bravo, catheter-based, or combined impedance-pH monitoring off PPIs if the diagnosis of GERD has not been established by a previous pH monitoring study. Additionally, it is recommended when endoscopy shows long-segment Barrett's esophagus or severe reflux esophagitis, categorized as Los Angeles grade C or D.

### "Refractory GERD": Acid, nonacid, or not GERD [^116kLUoe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition, with 44% of Americans surveyed reporting heartburn at least once a month and 20% once a week. Despite major advances in our understanding of this disease, management of GERD remains a challenge. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective than H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in the initial healing of erosive esophagitis, providing symptom relief and maintenance. Due to their established efficacy and safety, PPI treatment is used as the initial "test" in diagnosing GERD in the absence of bleeding, anemia, weight loss, or dysphagia. A single dose of PPI provides adequate symptom relief in most patients; however, dose escalation to twice a day may be needed in some cases. Patients unresponsive to PPI therapy are often labeled as having "refractory GERD". However, this term is poorly defined and has different meanings in different countries. More importantly, the cause of "refractory GERD" is poorly understood.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116KAQJJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy after discontinuing PPI therapy, ideally for 2–4 weeks, if not already performed. Esophageal biopsies should be conducted even if endoscopy reveals normal mucosa.

---

### Medical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112ARiWo]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Medical treatment is effective in the majority of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Lifestyle modifications are often recommended for patients with GERD, although the data supporting lifestyle recommendations are limited. Antacids are often used to treat the symptoms of GERD, but their effect is short-lived. H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors provide more effective options for remission of GERD symptoms and healing of esophagitis. Prokinetic medications (e.g. metoclopramide) have not been proven to help in the control of symptoms. Baclofen, which inhibits transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, provides an additional option for patients with persistent symptoms related to GERD; however, its use is limited by side effects. Long-term medical therapy for GERD should be tailored to each patient to provide symptomatic control and maintain esophageal mucosal healing.

### Modern diagnosis of GERD: The Lyon consensus [^111T7xLZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

GERD is empirically diagnosed and treated in clinical practice based on the clinician's symptom assessment. Indications for testing include treatment failure, diagnostic uncertainty, and treating (or preventing) complications of GERD. Diagnostic testing may or may not support the initial diagnosis, as the criteria defining GERD are specific to each testing modality. Understanding the performance characteristics of each diagnostic modality and recognizing evidence that supports or refutes the clinical impression of GERD is crucial. The Lyon Consensus evaluated GERD diagnostic tests from that perspective, and test results were categorized as being adequate to establish or refute a GERD diagnosis or inconclusive in the absence of additional supportive evidence.

The primary focus of esophageal testing has been on the detection of excessive acid reflux, indicative of pathological GERD, supported by reflux-symptom association analysis. The threshold value discriminating abnormal from normal esophageal acid exposure with 24-hour pH-metry was initially selected based on evidence that higher acid exposure is associated with the presence of reflux esophagitis. However, the focus of GERD management is on healing mucosal disease and managing symptoms. The association of esophageal acid exposure with patient symptoms is weak, making sole reliance on this metric problematic. Expansion of testing to include esophageal mucosal impedance, manometry, histopathology, and psychometrics may help in this regard.

### Recent developments in the pathophysiology and therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease and nonerosive reflux disease [^114qBgGd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, a very common disorder. Proton pump inhibitors are the highly successful mainstay of medical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, some limitations of proton pump inhibitor therapy continue to drive studies aimed at better understanding and managing the manifestations of the disease. This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Recent findings have demonstrated a potential role of increased gastric acid secretion in gastroesophageal reflux disease, a factor that has been largely neglected over the last decade. The failure to respond adequately to proton pump inhibitor therapy has been attributed to diagnostic inaccuracy, nocturnal acid breakthrough, ongoing non-acid reflux, and esophageal hypersensitivity. The relevance of nocturnal acid breakthrough has been recently challenged.

- **Potential therapeutic targets**: Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations are a major mechanism of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and inhibiting these relaxations is a potentially important therapeutic target. Recent studies have focused on GABA receptor stimulation using baclofen or sodium valproate.
- **Role of esophageal body peristalsis**: The role of esophageal body peristalsis in the clearance of reflux events has been questioned.
- **Endoscopic antireflux therapies**: These aim at perendoscopic reinforcement of the antireflux barrier as a novel therapeutic approach to gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, long-term and controlled data are currently scarce.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: An evidence-based consensus [^116CXFEx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with reflux-like symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation, often lack effective individual strategies to control their symptoms through dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, behavioral adjustments, or fast-acting rescue therapies. This shortfall is partly due to the limited emphasis in management guidelines stemming from 'low-quality' evidence and a scarcity of interventional studies. Consequently, a panel of 11 experts, including gastroenterologists and primary care doctors, utilized the Delphi method to form consolidated patient advice grounded in expert consensus.

A steering committee orchestrated literature searches via the PubMed database to inform a modified Delphi process, which included two online meetings and two rounds of voting. The goal was to produce consensus statements based on predefined criteria, where 67% of participants voted 'strongly agree' or 'agree with minor reservation'. Following expert discussions and voting, 21 consensus statements were formulated, each assigned a strength of evidence and a Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) rating.

- **Dietary recommendations**: Eleven statements achieved unanimous (100%) agreement. Five statements focus on diet, urging the identification and avoidance of dietary triggers, and advising limitations on alcohol, coffee, and carbonated beverages. Patients experiencing postprandial symptoms are advised against overeating.

- **Lifestyle and behavioral changes**: The remaining six statements pertain to smoking cessation, weight loss, elevating the head-of-the-bed, avoiding recumbency after meals, stress reduction, and alginate use.

The objective of developing these consensus statements is to provide actionable, evidence-based management advice for patients experiencing reflux-like symptoms.

### Pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease: New understanding in a new era [^1137hxwF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has increased in the last decades, becoming one of the most common chronic diseases. Our understanding of GERD pathophysiology has experienced significant fluctuations, often driven by advances in investigational techniques. It is now recognized as a multifactorial disease, though its pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Factors contributing to reflux include sliding hiatus hernia, low lower esophageal sphincter pressure, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, the acid pocket, obesity, increased distensibility of the esophagogastric junction, prolonged esophageal clearance, and delayed gastric emptying.

Moreover, several mechanisms influence GERD symptom perception: the acidity and proximal extent of the refluxate, presence of gas in the refluxate, duodenogastroesophageal reflux, longitudinal muscle contraction, mucosal integrity, and peripheral and central sensitization. Understanding GERD's pathophysiology is crucial for developing future therapies, especially since proton pump inhibitor-refractory GERD symptoms persist as a common issue.

In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms leading to reflux and the factors influencing symptom perception, considering historical developments. Despite recent advances in understanding GERD's pathophysiology, continued research is necessary.

### Latin American consensus on diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115A9Svq]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be challenging given varying symptom presentations and complex multifactorial pathophysiology. The gold standard for GERD diagnosis is esophageal acid exposure time (AET) measured by pH-metry. A variety of additional diagnostic tools are available. The goal of this consensus was to assess the individual merits of GERD diagnostic tools based on evidence and provide consensus recommendations following discussion and voting by experts.

- **Methods**: This consensus was developed by 15 experts from nine countries, based on a systematic search of the literature. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology was used to assess the quality and strength of the evidence and provide recommendations regarding the diagnostic utility of different GERD diagnosis tools, using AET as the reference standard.

- **Key results**: A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial is appropriate for patients with heartburn and no alarm symptoms, but not for patients with regurgitation, chest pain, or extraesophageal presentations. Severe erosive esophagitis and abnormal reflux monitoring off PPI are clearly indicative of GERD. Esophagram, esophageal biopsies, laryngoscopy, and pharyngeal pH monitoring are not recommended to diagnose GERD. Patients with PPI-refractory symptoms and normal endoscopy require reflux monitoring by pH or pH-impedance to confirm or exclude GERD, and to identify treatment failure mechanisms. GERD confounders need to be considered in some patients. pH-impedance can identify supragastric reflux events contributing to symptoms.

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114Ao6St]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is prevalent worldwide, particularly in developed countries. It is estimated that the prevalence of GERD in the United States is approximately 20% and that it is increasing because of the epidemic of obesity.

The objective of this research is to review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of GERD.

- **Evidence review**: A search of PubMed was conducted for the years spanning 1985 to 2015 and included the following terms: heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough, aspiration, laryngitis, GERD, GORD, endoscopy, manometry, pH monitoring, proton pump inhibitors, open fundoplication, and laparoscopic fundoplication. Only articles in English were included.

- **Findings**: Lifestyle modifications, proton pump inhibitors, and laparoscopic fundoplication are proven treatment modalities for GERD. Endoscopic procedures have not been proven as effective. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the procedure of choice when GERD and morbid obesity coexist.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a highly prevalent disease. Once the diagnosis has been established, the best results are obtained by a multidisciplinary team with the goal of individualizing treatment for patients.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113ZxQtP]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifaceted disorder encompassing a family of syndromes attributable to, or exacerbated by, gastroesophageal reflux that impart morbidity, mainly through troublesome symptoms. Major GERD phenotypes include non-erosive reflux disease, GERD hypersensitivity, low or high-grade esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux chest pain, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and regurgitation dominant reflux. GERD is common throughout the world, and its epidemiology is linked to the Western lifestyle, obesity, and the demise of Helicobacter pylori.

Because of its prevalence and chronicity, GERD is a substantial economic burden measured in physician visits, diagnostics, cancer surveillance protocols, and therapeutics. An individual with typical symptoms has a fivefold risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, although mortality from GERD is otherwise rare.

The principles of management are to provide symptomatic relief and to minimize potential health risks through some combination of lifestyle modifications, diagnostic testing, pharmaceuticals (mainly to suppress or counteract gastric acid secretion), and surgery. However, it is usually a chronic recurring condition, and management needs to be personalized to each case. While escalating proton pump inhibitor therapy may be pertinent to healing high-grade esophagitis, its applicability to other GERD phenotypes, wherein the modulating effects of anxiety, motility, hypersensitivity, and non-esophageal factors may dominate, is highly questionable.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^113QKyn6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms, experienced regularly by up to 20–50% of individuals. Individuals with mild heartburn frequently use over-the-counter antacids, while those with more severe symptoms often resort to long-term use of acid-suppressant medications. This acid-centered approach, which is highly effective for healing reflux oesophagitis, ignores the more complex aetiology of oesophageal symptoms, wherein dietary habits, reflux hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, and obesity may also play a role. However, the impracticality of exploring this complex symptom aetiology compared with the pragmatic approach of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has led to widespread, open-ended PPI use. Unfortunately, this also means that reflux-like symptoms, the severity of which exhibits only a weak relationship with pathological oesophageal acid exposure, continue to impact the day-to-day lives of a large proportion of individuals.

The concept that dietary and lifestyle factors can influence the likelihood of reflux-like symptoms is well accepted. However, patients are generally given minimal and inconsistent advice about implementing diet, lifestyle, and behavioral changes, despite these being low-harm, pragmatic approaches to self-management. One reason for this is a historical lack of emphasis in evidence-based clinical guidelines, which stems from a paucity of high-quality interventional studies. Ideally, guidelines and clinical advice should be based on rigorous evidence, for which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11126SPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

### Surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1157adqZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects an estimated 20% of the population in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Lifestyle modifications and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are effective in the majority of patients and remain the mainstays of GERD treatment. However, some patients will need surgical intervention because they have partial control of symptoms, do not want to be on long-term medical treatment, or suffer complications related to PPI therapy.

- **Aims**: The aim of this study was to review the available evidence supporting laparoscopic antireflux surgery and to study the effect of surgical therapy on the natural history of GERD.

- **Results**: The key elements for the success of antireflux surgery are proper patient selection, careful analysis of the indications for surgery, complete pre-operative work-up, and proper execution of the surgical technique.

- **Conclusions**: When these key elements are respected, antireflux surgery is very effective in controlling GERD, and it is associated with minimal morbidity and mortality.

### The role of diet and lifestyle measures in the pathogenesis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115va67t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the complications associated with it are very common in the Western world. There has been speculation for many years about the role of certain dietary and lifestyle factors in the pathogenesis or course of GERD. However, a comprehensive review of the available data reveals conflicting findings regarding the impact of most of these factors. In addition, the majority of the studies have been based on small numbers of patients and do not meet the criteria for evidence-based medicine in most cases. Therefore, any advice given on modifying diet and/or lifestyle in the management of GERD represents a form of empirical therapy. A general consensus on the control of GERD through alterations in diet and lifestyle factors is unlikely to be based on clinical or outcome study results. In practice, however, the treatment of GERD is oriented toward the individual patient's symptoms and includes offering reasonable advice on adapting to personal dietary intolerance and lifestyle factors.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: beyond mucosal injury [^11755NYa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Emerging information on the physiology and pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease raises the question of whether our thought process should go beyond mucosal injury. It suggests considering two parallel tracks that may cross each other at some times, but at other times, they may indeed remain parallel. These tracks are the neurally mediated effects of reflux events beyond the esophageal wall and the inflammation-mediated effects of reflux within the esophageal wall.

In this process, intraesophageal events, with or without causing mucosal injury, may induce changes in neural function on a temporary or long-term basis. This could result in symptoms at different organs and various levels, not completely in lock-step with esophageal mucosal injury. Emerging data also suggest the influence of liminal and subliminal esophageal acid exposure on cerebral cortical networks involved in motor function, such as swallowing, in addition to its effect on sensory centers.

These observations suggest the existence of a more extensive influence of esophageal sensory input on the cerebral cortical processing mechanisms than previously thought. This may provide new avenues for research in the pathophysiology of reflux disease.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115p31Sp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to be among the most common diseases seen by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Our understanding of the varied presentations of GERD, enhancements in diagnostic testing, and approaches to patient management have evolved. During this time, scrutiny of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased considerably. Although PPIs remain the medical treatment of choice for GERD, multiple publications have raised questions about adverse events, raising doubts about the safety of long-term use and increasing concern about the overprescribing of PPIs. New data regarding the potential for surgical and endoscopic interventions have emerged.

In this new document, we provide updated, evidence-based recommendations and practical guidance for the evaluation and management of GERD, including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Key concepts and suggestions that, as of this writing, do not have sufficient evidence to grade are also provided.

### Short-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1129s8aN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To investigate the efficacy of acid suppressant drugs in the empirical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and in the treatment of endoscopy-negative reflux disease (ENRD), a comprehensive study was conducted. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched, and bibliographies were reviewed.

Studies were eligible if they compared the short-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) with each other or with placebo in adults with GERD, who were enrolled irrespective of endoscopic findings (empirical cases) or in whom endoscopy showed no signs of esophagitis (endoscopy-negative cases). Of 1,408 studies, only 13 could be included for meta-analysis. Data on 3,433 patients empirically treated for GERD and 2,520 patients treated for ENRD were extracted. The primary endpoint was the relief of heartburn.

In the empirical treatment of GERD, the summary relative risk (sRR) for symptom relief from H2RAs versus placebo was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.99). In the only placebo-controlled PPI trial, the relative risk (RR) was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.46). The sRR for standard dose PPIs versus H2RAs was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.68). In treatment of ENRD, both PPIs (sRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.79) and H2RAs (sRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97) were superior to placebo, and PPIs were superior to H2RAs (sRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.95).

Acid suppressant therapy, with a PPI or an H2RA, is more effective than placebo for short-term relief of heartburn in patients with persistent symptoms.

### Current trends in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1158WG2M]. Gut and Liver (2018). High credibility.

The following provides key background information on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):

- **Definition**: GERD is a disorder characterized by symptoms or signs caused by regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, or lungs.
- **Pathophysiology**: GERD results from transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure, hiatal hernias, impaired esophageal clearance, and delayed gastric emptying.
- **Epidemiology**: The estimated prevalence of GERD symptoms in the US ranges from 6% to 30%, with a weekly prevalence of symptoms approaching 20%.
- **Disease course**: Reflux of gastric contents leads to damage of the esophagus, heartburn, bronchoconstriction, esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Barrett's esophagus occurs in about 10% of patients with chronic GERD.

### Updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111gv15W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were published in 1995 and updated in 1999. These and other guidelines undergo periodic review. Advances continue to be made in the area of GERD, leading to a review and revision of previous guideline statements. GERD is defined as symptoms or mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. These guidelines were developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee, and approved by the Board of Trustees.

Diagnostic guidelines address empiric therapy and the use of endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monitoring, and esophageal manometry in GERD. Treatment guidelines address the role of lifestyle changes, patient-directed (OTC) therapy, acid suppression, promotility therapy, maintenance therapy, antireflux surgery, and endoscopic therapy in GERD. Finally, there is a discussion of the rare patient with refractory GERD and a list of areas in need of additional study.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the physiological assessment and diagnosis of GERD [^117Pw8H4]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

GERD is a common condition worldwide. Key mechanisms of the disease include abnormal oesophagogastric junction structure and function, and impaired oesophageal clearance. A therapeutic trial of acid-suppressive PPI therapy is often the initial management, with endoscopy performed in the setting of alarm symptoms to exclude other conditions. If symptoms persist and endoscopy does not reveal evidence of GERD, oesophageal function tests are performed, including oesophageal manometry and ambulatory reflux monitoring. However, reflux episodes can be physiological, and some findings on endoscopy and manometry can be encountered in asymptomatic individuals without GERD symptoms.

The diagnosis of GERD on the basis of functional oesophageal testing has been previously reported, but no updated expert recommendations on indications and the interpretation of oesophageal function testing in GERD have been made since the Porto consensus over a decade ago. In this Consensus Statement, we aim to describe modern oesophageal physiological tests and their analysis, with an emphasis on establishing indications and consensus on interpretation parameters of oesophageal function testing for the evaluation of GERD in clinical practice. This document reflects the collective conclusions of the international GERD working group, incorporating existing data with expert consensus opinion.

### Developments in pathogenesis and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115uQkS8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Although gastroesophageal reflux is a common disorder, diagnosis is still imprecise, and its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. This review summarizes recent progress in diagnosis and our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Recent studies have focused on the pattern of reflux in the distal esophagus, just above the esophago-gastric junction, challenging its importance on the genesis of reflux symptoms. New techniques, such as impedance, could improve the diagnostic yield, especially in patients with nonacid reflux. Esophageal sensitivity and motility, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, and hiatus hernia are important pathogenic mechanisms of reflux disease. Studies showed that obesity plays a role in the pathogenesis of reflux symptoms; a disruption of the esophago-gastric junction (leading to hiatus hernia) could allow reflux to occur. The association between reflux (particularly nonacid) and extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease has been further evaluated.

Improvement of diagnostic techniques and better understanding of the pathogenesis of reflux may lead to new or better therapeutic modalities. Our understanding of some of the risk factors for reflux has been increased. Extra-esophageal manifestations and their association with gastroesophageal reflux are still a very controversial and promising area of research.

### Nexium [^111E88eB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Nexium is indicated for the short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic resolution of diagnostically confirmed erosive esophagitis. For patients who have not healed after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 4 to 8 week course of Nexium may be considered. In infants 1 month to less than 1 year, Nexium is indicated for short-term treatment (up to 6 weeks) of erosive esophagitis due to acid-mediated GERD. Nexium is also indicated to maintain symptom resolution and healing of erosive esophagitis. Controlled studies do not extend beyond 6 months. For symptomatic GERD, Nexium is indicated for short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) of heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD in adults and children 1 year or older.

- **Risk reduction of NSAID-associated gastric ulcer**: Nexium is indicated for the reduction in the occurrence of gastric ulcers associated with continuous NSAID therapy in patients at risk for developing gastric ulcers. Patients are considered to be at risk due to their age (≥ 60) and/or documented history of gastric ulcers. Controlled studies do not extend beyond 6 months.

- **H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence**: In triple therapy, Nexium, in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcers.

### Novel developments in non-erosive and erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112Efc1s]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite being clinically important and highly prevalent, several aspects of gastroesophageal reflux disease are incompletely understood. Research activity remains high; hence, we shall review some highlights from last year's publications.

- **Recent findings**: Community-based epidemiological studies have elucidated the risk factors for gastroesophageal reflux disease and demonstrated a significant risk for developing complications over time. New histological parameters, such as distended intercellular spaces in the epithelium, will detect minor signs of reflux damage. The esophageal endoscopic capsule has been studied as a way of screening for esophageal disease. Wireless pH-metry and impedance-pH-metry have increased our insight into the pathophysiology and improved the diagnostic work-up in atypical and therapy-resistant cases. At the molecular level, the role of cytokines has been elucidated, and there is increased support for the nitrosative stress theory for epithelial damage at the cardia. Endoscopic therapies have shown disappointing long-term results or safety concerns, leading to the withdrawal of several methods.

Ultimately, the last year has brought significant development in diagnostic modalities and increased our insight into the molecular events involved in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This progress may lead to new therapeutic modalities, supplementing proton pump inhibitors in medical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### Weight loss can lead to resolution of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms: A prospective intervention trial [^113g991u]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Weight gain is an important risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); however, whether weight loss can lead to resolution of GERD symptoms is not clear. Our aim was to measure the impact of weight loss on GERD symptoms.

In a prospective cohort study at a tertiary referral center, overweight/obese subjects (BMI 25–39.9 kg/m²) were enrolled in a structured weight loss program. Weight loss strategies included dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and behavioral changes. At baseline and at 6 months, BMI and waist circumference were measured, and all participants completed a validated reflux disease questionnaire.

A total of 332 adult subjects, with a mean age of 46 years and 66% being women, were prospectively enrolled. At baseline, the mean body weight, BMI, and waist circumference were 101 (± 18) kg, 35 (± 5) kg/m², and 103 (± 13) cm, respectively. At 6 months, the majority of subjects (97%) lost weight, with an average weight loss of 13 ± 7.7 kg, and compared to baseline, there was a significant decrease in the overall prevalence of GERD (15% vs. 37%; P < 0.01) and in the mean GERD symptom score (1.8 vs. 5.5; P < 0.01). Overall, 81% of the subjects had a reduction in GERD symptom scores; 65% had complete resolution, and 15% had partial resolution of reflux symptoms. There was a significant correlation between percentage body weight loss and reduction in GERD symptom scores (r = 0.17, P < 0.05).

In conclusion, the overall prevalence of GERD symptoms is high (37%) in overweight and obese subjects. A structured weight loss program can lead to complete resolution of symptoms in a significant proportion of individuals.

### Patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease: Diagnostic tools [^115TmLRE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Management of a patient with refractory GERD symptoms requires a high level of certainty about the initial diagnosis of GERD, so the utility of diagnostic tests based on the identification of residual reflux, and anatomical and histological abnormalities of the esophagus is of importance. Although various evaluative tests are available for patients who failed PPI therapy, none is considered the gold standard. Upper endoscopy has limited value in discovering GERD-related findings in patients with persistent GERD symptoms on PPIs.

Esophageal pH monitoring is commonly performed in patients with refractory GERD symptoms; however, only a minority of these patients continued to report symptoms due to ongoing acid reflux. Bilitec has limited availability in clinical practice. There is evidence supporting the use of combined impedance-pH monitoring as a promising strategy for the evaluation of symptomatic GERD patients on PPIs.

It seems reasonable to propose that before embarking on impedance-pH monitoring on PPI therapy, the presence of GERD should have been previously demonstrated by pH testing off therapy.

### Medical treatments in the short term management of reflux oesophagitis [^115ocwcJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Oesophagitis arises when reflux of acid from the stomach into the oesophagus causes mucosal inflammation. It is a common problem, and a systematic review on the optimum treatment would be useful.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), prokinetic therapy, sucralfate, and placebo in healing oesophagitis or curing reflux symptoms or both. Additionally, to compare adverse effects with the different treatments.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the National Research Register until December 2004 and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials assessing the healing of oesophagitis or reflux symptoms or both. Treatment involving PPIs, H2RAs, prokinetics, sucralfate, and combinations either in comparison to another treatment regimen or to placebo for 2 and 12 weeks.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 134 trials involving 35,978 oesophagitis participants. Five RCTs evaluated the standard dose of PPI versus placebo in 965 participants. There was a statistically significant benefit of taking standard dose PPI therapy compared to placebo in healing of oesophagitis (RR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Ten RCTs reported on the outcome for H2RA versus placebo evaluating 1,241 participants. There was a statistically significant benefit of taking H2RA compared to placebo in healing.

### Assessing old and new diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113Xnyai]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A detailed critique of objective measurements of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) would improve management of patients suspected of having reflux, leading to rational selection of treatment and better outcomes. Many diagnostic tests for GERD have been developed over the past decades. We analyze their development, positive and negative predictive values, and ability to predict response to treatment. These features are important for the development of medical, surgical, and endoscopic therapies for GERD. We discuss the value of available diagnostic tests and review their role in the management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. This issue is becoming a significant health economic problem due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. GERD is believed to cause nonesophageal symptoms, such as those provoked by ear, nose, throat, or respiratory disorders. We analyze the value of GERD diagnostic tests in the evaluation of these troublesome, nonesophageal symptoms.

### Assessment of reflux symptom severity: Methodological options and their attributes [^112gjryQ]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Despite major advances in our understanding of reflux disease, the management of this disorder still presents many challenges. Reduction of heartburn is the most readily apparent objective for the patient with reflux disease, and thus, the ability to measure heartburn accurately is of fundamental importance to clinical research in this field. Here, the available data on the assessment of reflux symptoms — predominantly heartburn — in clinical trials of symptomatic reflux disease are examined.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: Expert review [^111zeLSJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

This review addresses the challenge that as many as one-half of all patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not benefit from acid suppression. It outlines a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach to GERD symptoms.

- **Methods**: The Best Practice Advice statements were developed from an expert review of existing literature combined with extensive discussion and expert opinion to provide practical advice. This clinical practice update did not aim to formally rate the quality of evidence or the strength of recommendations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should develop a care plan for investigating symptoms suggestive of GERD, selecting therapy (with an explanation of potential risks and benefits), and managing long-term treatment, including possible de-escalation, in a shared-decision-making model with the patient.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should emphasize the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Clinicians should offer patients with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. If the response is inadequate, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day.

### Individualizing the choice of surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113jmdaz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic antireflux surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia (HH) should be performed in referral centers that provide comprehensive diagnosis and a range of surgical techniques tailored to the individual patient and the GERD phenotype. The operation should effectively control reflux, with limited side effects, and demonstrate durability. Surgical procedure selection should be based on shared decision-making with the patient, considering disease severity and risk for progression. By targeting individual components of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) competence, it may be possible to achieve reflux control without total fundoplication, potentially reducing the incidence of side effects.

### Gastroesophageal reflux treatment in infancy through young adulthood [^1146NHNi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux treatment varies greatly across the pediatric age spectrum. Infant reflux treatments rely heavily on nutritional interventions, whereas reflux in older children is treated more commonly with medications. However, because of the broad differential diagnosis, treatment nonresponse merits a re-evaluation of the diagnosis being treated and additional testing to provide a more precision-medicine approach to care.

### ACG practice guidelines: Esophageal reflux testing [^115e5Wsk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Investigations and technical advances have enhanced our understanding and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The recognition of the prevalence and importance of patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease, as well as those refractory to proton pump inhibitor therapy, have led to an increasing need for objective tests of esophageal reflux. Guidelines for esophageal reflux testing are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees.

- **Utilization of conventional, catheter-based pH monitoring**: Issues regarding the use of this method are discussed. Improvements in the interpretation of esophageal pH recordings through symptom-reflux association analyses, as well as limitations identified from recent studies, are reviewed.
- **Clinical utility of pH recordings**: The recordings in the proximal esophagus and stomach are examined.
- **Newly introduced techniques**: Techniques such as duodenogastroesophageal reflux, wireless pH capsule monitoring, and esophageal impedance testing are assessed and contextualized with traditional methodology.

Finally, recommendations on the clinical applications of esophageal reflux testing are presented.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: An evidence-based consensus [^113yWdx7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The consensus procedure involved an extensive literature search that identified a total of 406 articles. After removing 50 duplicates and excluding non-relevant studies, the steering committee reviewed 135 references to develop 27 pilot statements regarding risk factors and interventions for reflux-like symptoms. These were shared with the expert panel along with the level of supporting evidence for each study, which was assigned by the steering committee using a previously described scale (1–6).

In the first consensus meeting, the statements and evidence were thoroughly reviewed. Based on panel discussions, three new statements were added, and four were eliminated. The revised pilot statements provided the basis for the steering committee to develop 21 directive statements. These were subsequently shared with supporting evidence for anonymous voting using the Qualtrics online platform. Experts, including the steering committee, indicated their level of agreement for each statement on a scale from 1 to 6 (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree with major reservation; 3 = disagree with minor reservation; 4 = agree with major reservation; 5 = agree with minor reservation; 6 = strongly agree).

Results were analyzed by the meeting facilitator, with the consensus threshold set a priori at agreement (level 5 or 6) by at least 67% of respondents.

During the second meeting, the results of the first round of voting were reviewed and discussed.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: Summary and recommendations [^116vKytq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), specifically in relation to indications for antireflux surgery, the ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend considering transoral incisionless fundoplication in patients with confirmed GERD and a small hiatal hernia (≤ 2 cm), with Hill grade I or II, as an alternative to chronic medical management. This recommendation applies if they meet any of the following criteria:

- **Chronic GERD**: Patients must have experienced GERD for at least 6 months.

- **Chronic PPI use**: Patients have been using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for at least 6 months to manage GERD symptoms.

- **Refractory GERD**: Patients have GERD that is unresponsive to standard treatments.

- **Regurgitation-predominant GERD**: Patients experience primary symptoms of regurgitation.

- **Preference to avoid long-term PPI use**: Patients prefer to avoid the long-term use of PPIs.

These guidelines provide critical considerations for evaluating potential candidates for surgical intervention in the management of GERD.
