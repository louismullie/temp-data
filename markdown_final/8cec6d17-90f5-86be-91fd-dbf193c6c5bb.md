## Question

High basophils

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and interpret an elevated basophil count, including when to worry, what tests to order, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true basophilia and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology and prioritize life-threatening etiologies. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to pursue bone marrow evaluation. After that, I should consider special contexts like cardiovascular risk and drug reactions. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and follow-up, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline-backed criteria throughout.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its magnitude, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true basophilia rather than a lab artifact. Basophils are normally less than 1% of leukocytes, so even a modest absolute increase can be clinically meaningful; historically, an absolute basophil count above about 50/µL has been associated with allergic sensitization, whereas counts below about 20/µL can accompany acute allergic reactions, though these are heuristic thresholds rather than universally standardized cutoffs [^112Y7xDH]. I should double-check the automated differential with a manual smear to verify morphology and exclude pseudobasophilia or instrument misclassification, and I should repeat the CBC to confirm persistence before labeling it as chronic basophilia [^111xbocB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by pathophysiology to guide testing. Reactive causes include allergic and hypersensitivity states, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, while clonal hematologic causes include myeloproliferative neoplasms like chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, as well as acute and chronic basophilic leukemias and systemic mastocytosis. Drug-induced basophilia has been reported with agents such as venlafaxine, tretinoin, and ceftriaxone, and azithromycin labeling lists basophil elevation as a rare laboratory abnormality, so I need to check the medication list carefully [^116SgCYZ] [^113Ji2gM] [^112jnMiv] [^113GqCbK].

> I will now examine the clinical context to prioritize the workup, because the pretest probability shifts dramatically with symptoms and comorbidities. In a patient with fatigue, weight loss, splenomegaly, or leukocytosis, I should prioritize myeloproliferative disease and consider BCR-ABL1 testing and bone marrow evaluation. In someone with recurrent anaphylaxis or flushing, I should consider mastocytosis and obtain baseline tryptase. In a patient with chronic urticaria refractory to antihistamines, I should think about autoimmune urticaria and consider basophil activation or histamine release assays. And in a patient with stable coronary artery disease, I should remember that higher basophil counts correlate with increased mortality and prothrombotic activity, which may influence risk stratification even if it does not immediately change management [^115tW3UQ] [^112uQVnv] [^117JXFpD] [^111wPnjM].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory evaluation, and I need to ensure I do not miss a myeloid neoplasm. A repeat CBC with manual differential, peripheral smear, and a comprehensive metabolic panel are foundational. I should add a baseline serum tryptase if mastocytosis is on the table, and I should obtain BCR-ABL1 qualitative testing if basophils are clearly elevated or if there is any myeloid left shift or eosinophilia, because basophilia is a feature of CML and can be part of accelerated phase criteria. If eosinophilia coexists, I should follow eosinophilia workup principles and consider bone marrow evaluation when indicated [^112uQVnv] [^117JowR3] [^115BHUKw].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold for concerning basophilia in hematologic disease. The term hyperbasophilia, defined as a persistent absolute basophil count of at least 1000/µL, is highly suggestive of an underlying myeloid neoplasm and should trigger a detailed hematologic investigation, including bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics. In CML, basophils at or above 20% of the differential are one of the modified MD Anderson criteria for accelerated phase, so I should explicitly quantify basophils on smear review and correlate with blast percentage and cytogenetics [^114DqEMe] [^117JowR3].

> I should confirm when to proceed to bone marrow evaluation, because delaying it in the wrong context can be consequential. Indications include an absolute basophil count of 1000/µL or more, unexplained persistent basophilia with abnormal myeloid morphology or cytopenias, concurrent eosinophilia with atypical features, splenomegaly, or suspected mastocytosis. In the marrow, I will assess blast percentage, dysplasia, basophil morphology, and fibrosis, and I will send cytogenetics and molecular studies including BCR-ABL1, JAK2 V617F, CALR, MPL, and KIT D816V as indicated, because these findings distinguish chronic phase from accelerated or blast phase and guide therapy selection [^116ekhyR] [^117JowR3] [^111oZzBy].

> But wait, what if the elevated basophils are a clue to cardiovascular risk rather than hematologic disease? In stable coronary artery disease cohorts, higher basophil counts independently associate with total and cardiovascular mortality and with increased factor II coagulant activity, suggesting prothrombotic mechanisms. While this does not mandate immediate hematologic therapy, it should prompt tighter cardiovascular risk modification and consideration of antithrombotic strategies per cardiology standards, with the recognition that basophil count functions as a prognostic biomarker rather than a therapeutic target in this context [^111wPnjM] [^113DUHzE] [^114iHjkN].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts so I do not overlook important nuances. In children, basophilia is uncommon and, when present, should raise suspicion for clonal or severe inflammatory disease rather than benign reactive causes. In Down syndrome, basophilia has been reported among hematologic alterations, though clinical significance is often unclear and warrants correlation with the overall clinical picture. In drug hypersensitivity, basophil activation testing can help identify IgE-mediated culprits when skin testing is contraindicated or unavailable, but I should remember that BAT requires fresh blood, specialized flow cytometry, and careful interpretation of stimulation indices and non-responders [^113rohUL] [^116Kpkxs] [^115nzxSS].

> I should double-check the management framework by etiology, because treatment diverges substantially. For reactive basophilia, management targets the underlying cause, such as treating allergies, infections, or inflammatory disease, and discontinuing offending drugs when feasible. For clonal myeloid neoplasms, disease-directed therapy with TKIs for CML or cytoreduction for other MPNs is indicated, with basophil counts serving as a disease activity marker. For mastocytosis, mediator-directed therapy and consideration of KIT inhibitors are guided by disease subtype and symptom burden. For autoimmune chronic urticaria, basophil assays may inform expectations with omalizumab, but I should confirm that these tests are not universally available and should be interpreted in specialist hands [^117JowR3] [^112uQVnv] [^117JXFpD].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring, and I need to ensure I set appropriate intervals. For confirmed reactive basophilia, repeating the CBC in 4 to 6 weeks after treating the precipitant is reasonable. For clonal disease, basophil counts should be tracked alongside other hematologic parameters during therapy, with molecular monitoring for BCR-ABL1 transcripts in CML. For cardiovascular risk contexts, basophil count can be incorporated into periodic risk assessments, but I should avoid overinterpreting small fluctuations within the normal range and focus on persistent elevations that track with other risk markers [^117JowR3] [^111wPnjM].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm true basophilia with a manual differential, contextualize by symptoms and comorbidities, screen broadly but prioritize myeloid neoplasms and mastocytosis when red flags are present, escalate to bone marrow when thresholds or morphology dictate, and tailor management to the underlying cause while using basophil counts as a biomarker for disease activity and, in select contexts, cardiovascular risk. If I find myself anchoring on allergy alone, I should pause and reconsider clonal etiologies, because missing a myeloid neoplasm would be the most consequential error in this pathway [^116SgCYZ] [^116ekhyR] [^117JowR3].

High basophils (basophilia) are defined as an **absolute basophil count > 0.1 × 10⁹/L** [^116ekhyR] and are most often due to **myeloproliferative neoplasms** (notably chronic myeloid leukemia) [^117JowR3], allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, or chronic inflammatory diseases [^116SgCYZ]. Persistent basophilia, especially > 1.0 × 10⁹/L, is a red flag for **myeloid neoplasms** and warrants a hematology referral, bone marrow evaluation, and cytogenetic testing (BCR-ABL1, JAK2, CALR, MPL) [^117JowR3]. Reactive causes are managed by treating the underlying condition, whereas clonal disease requires targeted therapy (e.g. TKIs for CML) [^117JowR3]. Basophilia is uncommon and, when persistent, should never be ignored [^116ekhyR].

---

## Definition and normal ranges

Basophils normally account for **< 1% of leukocytes** [^115LFvpJ]; basophilia is defined as an **absolute basophil count (ABC) > 0.1 × 10⁹/L** [^116ekhyR]. Mild elevations (0.1–0.5 × 10⁹/L) are often reactive, whereas **counts > 1.0 × 10⁹/L** are strongly associated with clonal myeloid disorders [^116ekhyR].

---

## Clinical significance and causes

Basophilia is **uncommon** and, when persistent, signals significant disease [^116ekhyR]. The major etiologies include:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) | - Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [^117JowR3] <br/> - Polycythemia vera <br/> - Essential thrombocythemia <br/> - Primary myelofibrosis [^1139CMDE] |
| Allergic and hypersensitivity reactions | - IgE-mediated allergies (food, drug, venom) [^116Kpkxs] <br/> - Chronic urticaria [^116RAiY8] <br/> - Serum sickness [^116SgCYZ] |
| Chronic inflammatory diseases | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Chronic infections (e.g. tuberculosis) [^116SgCYZ] |
| Endocrine disorders | - Hypothyroidism [^116SgCYZ] <br/> - Pituitary basophilism (Cushing's disease) [^112Y7xDH] |
| Medications | - Venlafaxine <br/> - Tretinoin <br/> - Ceftriaxone [^116SgCYZ] <br/> - Azithromycin (rare) [^113Ji2gM] |

---

Persistent basophilia, especially > 1.0 × 10⁹/L, is a **red flag for myeloid neoplasms** and requires urgent hematologic evaluation [^116ekhyR].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential:

- **Confirm basophilia**: Repeat CBC with manual differential to exclude spurious counts [^111xbocB].
- **History and exam**: Assess for allergy, infection, endocrine symptoms, and splenomegaly [^116SgCYZ].
- **Laboratory tests**: CRP/ESR, thyroid function, IgE, and infection screens as indicated [^notfound].
- **Hematology referral**: For persistent basophilia or ABC > 1.0 × 10⁹/L [^116ekhyR].
- **Bone marrow evaluation**: Aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics (BCR-ABL1, JAK2, CALR, MPL) and flow cytometry [^117JowR3].
- **Molecular testing**: BCR-ABL1 for CML; JAK2/CALR/MPL for other MPNs [^117JowR3].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Basophilia reflects **underlying disease** and carries specific risks:

- **Myeloid neoplasms**: Basophilia correlates with disease burden and progression in CML and other MPNs [^117JowR3].
- **Thrombosis**: Basophils release procoagulant mediators (e.g. polyphosphate, platelet-activating factor), increasing thrombotic risk, especially in cardiovascular disease [^116A2S6z].
- **Symptomatic mediator release**: Pruritus, urticaria, and gastrointestinal symptoms from histamine and leukotrienes [^1164b423].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **cause**:

- **Reactive basophilia**: Treat the underlying allergy, inflammation, or endocrine disorder; remove offending drugs [^116SgCYZ].
- **Clonal basophilia**: Disease-directed therapy (e.g. TKIs for CML) [^117JowR3]; monitor response with CBC and molecular testing [^117JowR3].
- **Supportive care**: Antihistamines for mediator-related symptoms; anticoagulation when thrombotic risk is high [^1164b423].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **etiology**. Reactive basophilia resolves with treatment of the underlying condition, whereas clonal basophilia — especially in CML or other MPNs — signals aggressive disease and worse outcomes if untreated [^117JowR3]. Basophilia in primary myelofibrosis independently predicts shorter survival [^1139CMDE].

---

High basophils are uncommon and, when persistent, often indicate serious disease — most notably **myeloid neoplasms**. Persistent basophilia, especially > 1.0 × 10⁹/L, mandates hematology referral, bone marrow evaluation, and molecular testing to guide therapy and mitigate complications [^116ekhyR].

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^1153dfKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging can distinguish many of the causes. Often input from specialists (eg, hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management. What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

### Basophil activation test: how many basophils are enough? [^112EGvka]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

To further emphasize the importance of a statistical cutoff, we investigated the effect of low basophil counts on the rate of false positives, that is, the probability of recording a positive result on a negative (unstimulated) sample. In the case of fixed cutoffs, fewer than 450 basophils resulted in a heightened rate of false positives, particularly for cutoffs below 10% (Figure 2B, C). In contrast, considering cutoffs with their confidence margins imposes stricter criteria when stochastic variation is high, thereby keeping false positives to a minimum, even down to 50 basophils (Figure 2D). This analysis also applies to peanut‐allergic samples to minimize false negatives (Figure S5), with further validation needed for drug allergies, where activation levels are notoriously low.

In summary, we have demonstrated that a statistical approach to cutoffs helps counteract the stochastic variations in CD63+ activation caused by limited basophil counts. It is then not a matter of enough basophils, but whether their measured activation reaches statistical significance compared to the cutoff. Tests with fewer basophils are conceivable, with the risk of heightened inconclusive results; but if their activation level largely exceeds the cutoff, significant reactivity may be concluded. The statistical methodology outlined herein represents a crucial aspect for increasing clinical confidence in BAT for allergy diagnosis.

### Promises and remaining challenges for further integration of basophil activation test in allergy-related research and clinical practice [^1161DzoZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 20 years after having been initially proposed, the relevance and usefulness of basophil activation test (BAT) for the field of allergy research and testing were demonstrated on many occasions. Leveraging the fully open format of a flexible, whole blood-based functional assay, BAT has been shown to be equally important for fundamental research, clinical research, and diagnosis. Regardless of whether the focus of a study is on the characterization of the allergenic moiety, on the patient side, or on the study of the fundamental processes involved in the allergic disease or its treatment, BAT enables the gathering of very important insights. In spite of this, its full capabilities have yet to be leveraged. Various bottlenecks, including but not limited to assay logistics, robustness, flow cytometry access, and/or expertise, have indeed been limiting its development beyond experts and long-term users. Now, various initiatives, aiming at resolving these bottlenecks, have been launched. If successful, a broader use of BAT could then be contemplated. In such a situation, its more thorough integration in clinical practice has the potential to significantly change the allergic patient's journey.

### Basophil activation test: how many basophils are enough? [^115LFvpJ]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

However, a critical factor remains unaddressed: basophil counts. Most studies enforce a minimum of 200–1000 basophils, with 500 basophils broadly accepted as the lower limit (basophils represent < 1% of leukocytes). Recent reports have challenged this consensus, suggesting that dose–response curves in peanut‐allergic individuals can be assessed with as few as 50 basophils. A universal approach to BAT analysis that accounts for basophil count is therefore urgently needed to boost confidence in test results across assays and laboratories, particularly in patients with low basophil counts (e.g. basopenia) or for low‐volume samples.

Herein, we generalize activation cutoffs for any given basophil count by considering their confidence intervals, arising from the limited number of observations (Figure 1B). This effectively introduces a 'confidence margin' around the cutoff, within which results are considered inconclusive (Figure 1C). A result is unequivocal only if the CD63+ fraction falls either above or below the confidence interval. For instance, in cases with low basophil counts, activation levels must be well above the cutoff to statistically conclude a positive result, owing to the stochasticity inherent to small populations (Tables S1 and S2). Conversely, above 500 basophils, the result interpretation is close to that of a conventional fixed cutoff.

To validate our proposed approach, we statistically analysed a BAT dataset comprising 299 whole blood samples. Each sample was tested with two degranulation stimuli (fMLP and anti‐FcεRI mAb) and without stimulation in duplicate (Figure S2). From this, we computed the variations in CD63+ basophil fractions resulting from decreased basophil counts. We found that these variations matched the predictions from theoretical proportion statistics, with variations declining with increasing basophil counts and absolute variations being maximal at mid‐level activations (Figure 2A, Figures S3 and S4).

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^1176FzFS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the associations between tryptase elevation and the performance of BATs among patients with PA. In our large cohort of patients with PA undergoing BATs, almost all (94.6%) positive results came from patients with significantly elevated tryptase during the index reaction. This phenomenon is reminiscent of previous reports describing the association between BAT positivity and elevated tryptase among patients experiencing reactions during desensitization with platinum compounds. Because tryptase exists (almost exclusively) within both MCs and basophils, significant elevation during PA may reflect the individual tendency for MC/basophil degranulation (in context with the specific drug culprit). Therefore, such individuals would have an increased likelihood of positive BAT result with the same drug, in comparison to those without significantly elevated tryptase levels. Furthermore, recent reports suggest a close interplay between MCs and basophils, and it is possible that a positive BAT result reflects a more significant role of basophils in activating MCs during PA in certain susceptible individuals. Interestingly, this may partly explain why the same associations with elevated tryptase levels were not observed with positive ST result or sIgE. It would be of great interest to investigate whether similar phenomena can be observed in MC activation test assays or within the context of non–drug-induced anaphylactic reactions.

### The role of IgE in upper and lower airway disease: more than just allergy! [^1178Wo8Q]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

The basophil activation test serves as a useful ex vivo test of allergic response, in which basophils from whole blood or isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells are exposed to allergens of interest, and the subsequent expression of basophil activation markers in response to exposure is measured by flow cytometry. Although the analysis of whole and isolated peripheral blood samples is more typically used in the detection of systemic allergen response, recent studies have shown that this technique may hold a utility as a non-invasive analysis of localized response. In patients with LAR, the basophil activation test has demonstrated sensitivity sufficient to diagnose an IgE-mediated response where an SPT and serum-specific IgE testing were found to be negative. Moreover, studies have shown that the use of antihistamines does not impact the results of the basophil activation test, and they therefore do not need to be discontinued before testing. One potential drawback of these tests, however, is that they rely on the prior confirmation of an allergen of interest by SPT or measure of serum-specific IgE. Additionally, there is currently limited standardization regarding the technique and interpretation of basophil activation test outcomes. With these established, the basophil activation test serves as a promising methodology for determining IgE activity at both the local and systemic levels.

Although there are many available diagnostic tools to determine the role of IgE in disease, there is still room for improvement. Negative results on the most routinely used tests (SPT, serum testing for allergen-specific IgE) do not conclusively indicate the lack of an allergic response, and neither do they identify local innate immunity. However, more localized tests can be invasive, not broadly applicable, and are limited by the lack of routine use in practice. As technology and standardization of practice continue to improve, so too will the diagnosis of IgE-mediated disease. In the meantime, the use of a treatment that addresses the common, underlying factor in these diseases can serve to improve patient outcomes.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^111xbocB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Extending the role of tryptase in perioperative anaphylaxis: predicting positive results in basophil activation tests [^112Pj1VQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Basophil activation tests (BATs) are useful in identifying culprits of perioperative anaphylaxis (PA), but their utility remains limited due to technical limitations, cost, and availability. Being able to prioritize patients with likely higher yields for BAT would be useful in reducing costs and manpower.

Objective

We sought to investigate whether tryptase levels and clinical parameters may be useful for selecting patients for BATs.

Methods

We performed a 10-year retrospective study in Hong Kong to investigate the performance of BATs associated with tryptase levels (taking during PA) and other clinical parameters.

Results

Of 90 patients, 70 (77.8%) showed significant tryptase level elevation and 37 (41.1%) had a positive BAT result. BAT-positive patients presented with significantly higher absolute levels (15.9 μg/L vs 9.1 μg/L; P = 0.018), absolute elevation (12.8 μg/L vs 7.1 μg/L; P = 0.012), and fold elevation (5.6- vs 4.1-fold; P = 0.014) of acute tryptase than did BAT-negative patients. Among patients with positive BAT result, 94.6% (35 of 37) demonstrated elevated acute tryptase, significantly more than the BAT-negative group (66.0%; P < .001). In regression analysis, tryptase elevation was the sole significant factor correlated to BAT positivity (odds ratio, 10.14; 95% CI, 2.15–47.85; P = 0.003). Overall, elevated acute tryptase demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.7% and a negative predictive value of 90.0% in predicting positive results with BATs.

Conclusions

We observed that tryptase elevation is a very sensitive predictor of BAT positivity among patients with identified culprits of PA. Acute elevation of tryptase would not only aid in confirming anaphylaxis but may also help guide the decision toward selecting labor-intensive and costly in vitro tests such as BATs.

### Basophil blood cell count is associated with enhanced factor II plasma coagulant activity and increased risk of mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease: not only neutrophils as prognostic marker in ischemic heart disease [^113DUHzE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

White blood cell count, which is inexpensive and widely available in clinical practice, has been proposed to provide prognostic information in coronary artery disease (CAD). Elevated levels of white blood cell subtypes may play different roles in atherothrombosis and predict cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods and Results

The association between white blood cell counts and mortality was evaluated in 823 subjects with angiographically demonstrated and clinically stable CAD in an observational–longitudinal study. The correlation among white blood cell counts and factor II plasma coagulant activity was analyzed in 750 subjects (554 CAD and 196 CAD‐free) not taking anticoagulant drugs. Subjects with overt leukocytosis or leukopenia were excluded. In the longitudinal study after a median follow‐up of 61 months, 160 (19.4%) subjects died, 107 (13.0%) of whom from cardiovascular causes. High levels of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were associated with an increased mortality rate. In multiadjusted Cox regression models, only neutrophils and basophils remained predictors of total and cardiovascular mortality. The associations remained significant after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and by including D‐dimer and the chemokine CXCL12 in the regression models. Neutrophils and basophils were also significant predictors of factor II plasma coagulant activity variability after adjustment for blood cell counts, age, sex, inflammatory markers, CAD diagnosis, and prothrombin G20210A polymorphism. Factor II plasma coagulant activity was similarly increased in subjects with high neutrophil and basophil counts and in carriers of the prothrombin 20210A allele.

Conclusions

Both high neutrophil and basophil blood counts may predict mortality in patients with clinically stable CAD and are associated with enhanced factor II plasma coagulant activity, thereby suggesting underlying prothrombotic mechanisms.

Background White blood cell count, which is inexpensive and widely available in clinical practice, has been proposed to provide prognostic information in coronary artery disease (CAD). Elevated levels of white blood cell subtypes may play different roles in atherothrombosis and predict cardiovascular outcomes. Methods and Results The association between white blood cell counts and mortality was evaluated in 823 subjects with angiographically demonstrated and clinically stable CAD in an observational-longitudinal study. The correlation among white blood cell counts and factor II plasma coagulant activity was analyzed in 750 subjects (554 CAD and 196 CAD-free) not taking anticoagulant drugs. Subjects with overt leukocytosis or leukopenia were excluded. In the longitudinal study after a median follow-up of 61 months, 160 (19.4%) subjects died, 107 (13.0%) of whom from cardiovascular causes. High levels of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were associated with an increased mortality rate. In multiadjusted Cox regression models, only neutrophils and basophils remained predictors of total and cardiovascular mortality. The associations remained significant after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and by including D-dimer and the chemokine CXCL12 in the regression models. Neutrophils and basophils were also significant predictors of factor II plasma coagulant activity variability after adjustment for blood cell counts, age, sex, inflammatory markers, CAD diagnosis, and prothrombin G20210A polymorphism. Factor II plasma coagulant activity was similarly increased in subjects with high neutrophil and basophil counts and in carriers of the prothrombin 20210A allele. Conclusions Both high neutrophil and basophil blood counts may predict mortality in patients with clinically stable CAD and are associated with enhanced factor II plasma coagulant activity, thereby suggesting underlying prothrombotic mechanisms.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^117UQnMd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — anaphylaxis mediators and mast cell markers — Histamine and leukotriene release measurements from human basophils after incubation with allergen are valuable research tools for in vitro investigations of allergy, and sensitive immunoassays for histamine and leukotriene C4 advance measurement in biologic fluids or cellular release. Histamine and its N-methyl histamine metabolite may be measured in 24-hour urine samples after suspected anaphylactic episodes. Plasma tryptase, particularly the β form, should be obtained within 4 hours after an anaphylactic episode, and combined α and β species of plasma tryptase are elevated in patients with systemic mastocytosis.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of new biochemical and immunohistochemical parameters in chronic myeloid leukemia [^117MUqrv]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem-cell disease characterized by multilineage expansion of clonal BCR/ABL+ cells. Transformation from chronic into accelerated and blast phase of CML is usually associated with drug resistance and is accompanied by typical clinical and/or laboratory features, such as splenomegaly, increase in precursor cells, disturbed megakaryopoiesis, basophilia or marrow fibrosis. Because of new treatment options, early recognition of disease-acceleration is of importance. In this article, we review most recent developments in diagnostic procedures employing basophil-related biochemical and histopathological markers. These tests are useful to quantitate basophil-lineage cells in the peripheral blood in CML, to determine and quantify basophilia in the bone marrow, and to detect focal accumulations of blast cells and megakaryocytes as well as increased angiogenesis and fibrosis in bone marrow sections. Application of these markers may assist in determining the phase of disease and may help to better predict the prognosis in individual patients.

### Histamine excess symptoms in basophilic chronic granulocytic leukemia… [^1164b423]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Basophilia is not uncommon in the myeloproliferative disorders, particularly chronic granulocytic leukemia. Total blood histamine usually is increased in proportion to the absolute basophilia. However, histamine symptoms are not reported in these situations, in contrast to systemic mast cell disease in which they are the rule. Our patient had chronic granulocytic leukemia with basophilia; intense and disabling pruritus, cold urticaria, and epigastric discomfort developed. Total blood histamine exceeded previously reported levels and gastric analysis suggested histamine stimulation. Moderate relief was obtained with antihistaminic agents. No similar case has been described to our knowledge. Youman JD, Taddeini L, Cooper T. Histamine Excess Symptoms in Basophilic Chronic Granulocytic Leukemia. Arch Intern Med. 1973; 131: 560–562.

### Basophil activation test: mechanisms and considerations for use in clinical trials and clinical practice [^116Kpkxs]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

The basophil activation test (BAT) is a functional assay that measures the degree of degranulation following stimulation with allergen or controls by flow cytometry. It correlates directly with histamine release. From the dose-response curve resulting from BAT in allergic patients, basophil reactivity (%CD63 + basophils) and basophil sensitivity (EC₅₀ or similar) are the main outcomes of the test. BAT takes into account all characteristics of IgE and allergen and thus can be more specific than sensitization tests in the diagnosis of allergic disease. BAT reduces the need for in vivo procedures, such as intradermal tests and allergen challenges, which can cause allergic reactions of unpredictable severity. As it closely reflects the patients' phenotype in most cases, it may be used to support the diagnosis of food, venom and drug allergies and chronic urticaria, to monitor the natural resolution of food allergies and to predict and monitor clinical the response to immunomodulatory treatments, such as allergen-specific immunotherapy and biologicals. Clinical application of BAT requires analytical validation, clinical validation, standardization of procedures and quality assurance to ensure reproducibility and reliability of results. Currently, efforts are ongoing to establish a platform that could be used by laboratories in Europe and in the USA for quality assurance and certification.

### The clinical utility of basophil activation testing in diagnosis and monitoring of allergic disease [^111y3H3R]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The basophil activation test (BAT) has become a pervasive test for allergic response through the development of flow cytometry, discovery of activation markers such as CD63 and unique markers identifying basophil granulocytes. Basophil activation test measures basophil response to allergen cross-linking IgE on between 150 and 2000 basophil granulocytes in < 0.1 mL fresh blood. Dichotomous activation is assessed as the fraction of reacting basophils. In addition to clinical history, skin prick test, and specific IgE determination, BAT can be a part of the diagnostic evaluation of patients with food-, insect venom-, and drug allergy and chronic urticaria. It may be helpful in determining the clinically relevant allergen. Basophil sensitivity may be used to monitor patients on allergen immunotherapy, anti-IgE treatment or in the natural resolution of allergy. Basophil activation test may use fewer resources and be more reproducible than challenge testing. As it is less stressful for the patient and avoids severe allergic reactions, BAT ought to precede challenge testing. An important next step is to standardize BAT and make it available in diagnostic laboratories. The nature of basophil activation as an ex vivo challenge makes it a multifaceted and promising tool for the allergist. In this EAACI task force position paper, we provide an overview of the practical and technical details as well as the clinical utility of BAT in diagnosis and management of allergic diseases.

### Basophil activation test: bridging allergy and oncology for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic applications in allergoOncology: an EAACI position paper [^115nzxSS]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

A detailed description of the main strenghts and limitations of BAT has very recently been reviewed. We briefly highlight that the readouts of the BAT can be influenced by different factors such as selection of activation markers, use of IL‐3 within the stimulation buffer (which is known to increase basophil sensitivity to stimuli), nature and concentration of stimuli (whole extract/native drug, components, or metabolites), and patient's current treatment regimen. Moreover, analysis and interpretation of the test outcome: basophil reactivity (as a percentage of cells expressing the activation marker or stimulation index) and basophil sensitivity ('CD‐sens': inversion of the concentration at which 50% of basophils respond [EC₅₀]) are also critical.

Additionally, factors such as the time elapsed between blood collection and analysis, the duration and condition of blood storage, and the interval between the clinical reaction and test performance are all known to influence the readouts. Importantly, BAT cannot be interpreted on subjects displaying 'non‐releaser' basophils, which may occur due to spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) deficiency (about 10%–20% of the population) or treatments with corticosteroid drugs. These conditions can change over time, are independent of skin mast cell activation, and the clinical implications remain unknown. False‐negative BAT results may occur immediately after an anaphylactic episode. Moreover, recent allergen exposure could influence baseline activation of basophils. Technical issues, predominantly blood handling, can also cause high background activation (> 2%–2.5% CD63+ basophils). It is possible to interpret results as a positive BAT response when the allergen‐specific basophil activation shows at least a Stimulation Index (SI) of 2 or above. Standardisation of these aspects is required for BAT to become a widely available tool (Figures 3 and 4).

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^114iabtr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) thyroid screening and autoantibody testing — Screening for thyroid disease is of low yield in patients without specific thyroid-related symptoms or history of thyroid disease, and increased anti-thyroglobulin or anti-thyroid antibodies are commonly detected in euthyroid (ie, normal TSH) subjects, although clinical implications are unclear (C). A significant proportion of patients with CU have increased thyroid autoantibodies but are euthyroid, and although some authors have reported improvement with thyroxine in euthyroid patients, others have not, and to date there are no large, blinded, placebo-controlled trials. Although commercial assays are now available, the utility of testing for autoantibodies to the high-affinity IgE receptor or autoantibodies to IgE has not been established (C); in vitro assays to detect these autoantibodies are commercially available and an ASST or APST might also be performed, but the ASST does not consistently correlate with in vitro assays, there can be both false-positive and false-negative ASST results, basophils from patients without CU can induce positive ASST results, and therefore the role and accuracy of such testing in clinical evaluation and management of CU is unclear. Currently, there are no published studies that provide the sensitivities, specificities, or positive or negative likelihood ratios for diagnosis by using these assays, and whether detection identifies a clinically unique population or leads to a change in management is also currently unclear.

### Basophil activation test: bridging allergy and oncology for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic applications in allergoOncology: an EAACI position paper [^1148nie7]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The implementation of BAT is expanding in research and routine diagnostics. Despite its emerging use in oncology drug reactions, standardisation of BAT has proven difficult due to variability in basophil responses to the different drug classes. Harmonisation and standardisation of protocols and test outcome analysis, with the scope to apply data‐driven programmatic approaches, are essential for adaptation to oncology settings (Box 3). Further phenotyping of basophils, including their resting state (e.g. using CD203c) as well as deeper assessment of CD203c and CD63 expression under different stimulation conditions, must be assessed in relation to applications in oncology.

To further optimise the BAT for application in oncology, key aspects requiring clarification include determining the minimum number of basophils necessary for a valid test and minimum stimulation levels that would reflect a clinical reaction. These likely depend on the stimulant evaluated and the magnitude of activation that can be achieved ex vivo. Additionally, the volume of blood required per test may need adjustment, particularly in patients with low basophil counts such as when following a suspected HPS reaction, and in neutropenic patients with advanced malignant disease. Another challenge relates to the requirement for fresh blood sample processing, normally within 24 h of blood collection. 'Non‐releasers' in BAT pose an additional challenge; although the proportion of 'non‐releasers' in oncology cohorts appears comparable to other patient cohorts, it remains unclear whether the basophil activation profiles of oncology patients differ significantly from allergic individuals, and thus whether these might potentially affect test outcomes.

### The circulating basophil as an indicator of hypersensitivity in man… [^112SZtad]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Twenty-five healthy male volunteers received novobiocin orally for 15 days. One third of these subjects showed an increase in the percentage of circulating basophils which was interpreted as an immune response. Later challenge of one of these subjects with novobiocin caused a reactive basophilia within 24 hours. One of the men developed a typical ninth-day erythema or morbilliform eruption as a result of novobiocin sensitization. This individual regularly showed a unique and dramatic drop in the percentage of basophils within four hours of readministration of the drug. Such a basopenic response may be used diagnostically. Indirect basophil tests were negative for urticarial or anaphylactic antibodies in all 25 subjects. However, one subject did develop a novobiocin-induced serum toxicity for the rabbit basophil.

### De novo CD5 + diffuse large B cell lymphoma with basophilia in the peripheral blood: successful treatment with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation [^1171aCjR]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Basophils play an important role in allergic inflammation and are pathologically related to hematological disturbances, such as iron deficiency anemia and myeloproliferative disorders; however, they are only rarely encountered in lymphoid malignancies. Here, we report the case of a 33-year-old man with a bulky mass of the small intestine, multiple paraaortic lymphoadenopathy, pleural effusion, and ascites, who was diagnosed as a case of de novo CD5+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This patient showed a marked elevation of the basophil count in the peripheral blood, which appeared to run in parallel with the tumor burden. High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood cell transplantation yielded complete remission, and the patient has remained disease free for 5 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of de novo CD5+ DLBCL showing marked elevation of the PB basophil count.

### Predicting responses to omalizumab in antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria: a real-world longitudinal study [^117UUKoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

The following factors have been reported to be linked to a poor or slow response to omalizumab treatment: type IIb autoimmunity, characterized by positive results in autologous serum skin tests; the presence of IgG autoantibodies against IgE, FcεRIα, and thyroid antigens; elevated basophil histamine release; and increased expression of basophil FcεRI. However, conducting these tests is not routine in most real-world practice for patients with CU.

The identification of valid and reliable predictors for treatment responses in CU is currently a prominent area of research. In our study, we reaffirmed that low IgE levels (< 40 kU/L) can predict nonresponses to omalizumab add-on therapy after accounting for potential confounding variables. It is vital to recognize that whereas IgE levels are generally elevated in patients with CSU versus in healthy individuals, low IgE levels, along with basopenia and eosinopenia, are associated with autoimmune CSU, limiting the effectiveness of omalizumab treatment. Additionally, inflammatory markers driven by a combination of neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets, such as SIRI and PLR, are considered valuable indicators of inflammation in CU as well as in various chronic diseases and malignancy. Mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width, as markers of platelet activation, have been reported to increase in patients with CU in relation to disease severity. Recent studies have explored the impact of omalizumab on platelet and inflammatory markers in patients with CU, but these have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. In our study, we observed a notable trend of higher PLRs being associated with a higher likelihood of being a late responder to omalizumab treatment. However, PLR was not found to predict nonresponse to omalizumab. This finding differs from the results reported by Ertas et al, who noted that nonresponders had a lower platelet distribution width than responders did. In a recent study, pretreatment SIRI was found to be an independent predictor of patients with CSU being omalizumab responders at the 3-month follow-up. However, in our retrospective cohort with at least 6 months of omalizumab treatment, we were unable to identify SIRI as a significant predictor of being a nonresponder or late responder to omalizumab treatment. Blood basopenia is associated with disease activity, the presence of autoantibodies, and a poor response to H1AH and omalizumab. Interestingly, our study had similar results, showing that lower basophil counts in the peripheral blood were a significant predictor of a delayed response to omalizumab. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the potential roles of inflammatory markers in patients with CSU, further studies are needed.

### Basophil blood cell count is associated with enhanced factor II plasma coagulant activity and increased risk of mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease: not only neutrophils as prognostic marker in ischemic heart disease [^117A3irU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In the longitudinal study, neutrophil cell count, but not that of basophils, correlated with D‐dimer plasma levels. D‐dimer is a reliable and sensitive index of fibrin deposition and stabilization, thus being indicative of in vivo thrombus formation at one point in time. However, its plasma concentration may be high in several other conditions unrelated to thrombosis including inflammatory disorders. 38 In our subanalysis, high D‐dimer levels were associated with an increased risk of mortality at univariate analysis. However, the associations of neutrophil and basophil counts with mortality were substantially unchanged after adjustment for D‐dimer levels.

In the present work, neutrophil and basophil counts predicted mortality independent of the chemokine CXCL12 levels. CXCL12, also known as stromal derived cell factor‐1, is present in many tissues and constitutively expressed by bone marrow stromal cells. CXCL12 plays a role in recruitment and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells and in trafficking and homing of leukocytes, 41, 42 including neutrophils and basophils. 43, 44 Consistent with earlier studies indicating that CXCL12 may be important for the recruitment and activation of the basophils, 45 in our study sample, CXCL12 levels correlated with basophil count. Certainly, CXCL12 is not a main cytokine regulating the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow and their release into the bloodstream. However, this chemokine has been identified as a potential causal mediator of CAD in humans with proatherogenic properties, 39, 40 and the genomic locus 10q11, hosting the CXCL12 gene, has been linked with CAD by genome‐wide association studies. 46 Among WBC subtypes, neutrophils showed the strongest association with mortality. This result was expected, because neutrophils play a crucial role in inflammatory and innate immunity response, and several studies have shown a harmful proinflammatory role of neutrophils in the development and progression of CAD. 8, 47 As proof of concept, therapies reducing neutrophils' inflammatory response, such as colchicine (an agent inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis by interfering with the formation of microtubules) 48 and canakinumab (a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin‐1‐β), 49 have been shown to reduce the cardiovascular risk. Consistent with such biological backgrounds, neutrophil counts, even within what is considered the normal range, have been associated with cardiovascular events in various study cohorts. 50

Finally, the study population was stratified in 4 groups on the basis of both neutrophil and basophil cell count, by differently combining patients in the lowest neutrophil quartile and patients in the highest basophil quartile (Figure 2). Subjects with either high neutrophil (≥ 3.180/µL) or basophil cell count (≥ 60/µL) had an increased mortality rate (P < 0.001 by log rank for trend), but subjects with both high neutrophil and basophil levels had the worst survival rate, with a 3‐fold increased risk of total mortality (full‐adjusted HR, 2.95 with 95% CI, 1.44–6.03) and even a 4‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (full‐adjusted HR, 4.01 with 95% CI, 1.38–11.71).

### Current understanding of allergic transfusion reactions: incidence, pathogenesis, laboratory tests, prevention and treatment [^113yMMK8]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

Plasma protein levels and plasma protein antibodies against IgA and Hp of both the IgG and IgE classes, if possible, need to be examined first. In-house systems are typically used to detect these deficiencies and antibodies, although commercial systems recently became available for detecting IgA deficiency and IgA antibodies (Palmer et al). Even without identifying the allergens and antibodies, it is possible to examine whether transfused blood products were causative and whether the reactions were allergic in nature on the basis of the following two tests.

Tryptase test

Tryptase is the most abundant secretory granule-derived serine proteinase contained in mast cells. Elevated tryptase levels in serum, plasma and other biological fluids are consistent with mast cell activation in systemic anaphylaxis and other immediate hypersensitivity allergic reactions (Schwartz et al). In the above-mentioned anaphylaxis case that occurred after passive transfer of peanut allergens to a sensitized boy, the serum tryptase levels after this reaction were significantly high and suggested a causative relationship between the reaction and the transfusion (Jacobs et al). In two of three recent anaphylactic reaction cases that occurred after transfusions of methylene blue-treated plasma, serum tryptase levels were elevated and aided in the diagnoses (Dewachter et al; Nubret et al). In Japan, serum tryptase levels are measured in patients suffering from non-haemolytic transfusion reactions if an allergic reaction is suspected and the patients' serum samples are available. It has been shown that the tryptase test is useful in diagnosing allergic transfusion reactions (Hirayama). However, it has a couple of drawbacks.

First, it is often difficult to obtain a patient's serum sample for a tryptase test because of the short tryptase half-life, which is only 2 h after its release into the circulation (Schwartz). Second, only a small amount of tryptase is produced by basophils, the other mediator of allergic reactions (Castells et al; Foster et al). In contrast, the basophil activation test (BAT) has no restrictions regarding the timing for patient sample collection and can assess basophil activation.

### Distinct parameters of the basophil activation test reflect the severity and threshold of allergic reactions to peanut [^114so68o]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

A relationship between severity and threshold has previously been suggested, with patients who react to lower doses being more at risk of severe symptoms. In our study and othersthe clinical parameters of severity and threshold were not correlated. However, a strong correlation was found for the respective basophil parameters. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that during the BAT, the " in vitro challenge" can progress to higher doses, whereas the in vivo OFC is typically stopped with the first allergic symptoms and signs. Allergic reactions during OFCs might have been different if a large dose had been consumed at once. The fact that basophil activation can be determined up to high doses of allergen regardless of disease severity is another clear advantage of the BAT as a biomarker of disease severity.

We identified BAT markers of severity and threshold of reactions during OFCs, but they might not reflect the severity and threshold of allergic reactions in the community. Hourihane et alshowed that the challenge score correlated with the most recent reaction but not with the most severe reaction in the community, suggesting that a patient's reactivity to peanut changes over time. Cofactors that can increase the severity of allergic reactions (eg, uncontrolled asthma, viral infections, menstruation, exercise, consumption of alcohol or drugs, and psychological factors) might be present in the community and are usually controlled during OFCs. Also, with respect to threshold, there might be some variation because the eliciting dose during OFCs can be underestimated because the patient feels safe during the OFC but can also be overestimated because mild symptoms would remain unnoticed in the community. Severity and eliciting dose during challenges have not been reproducible in other studies.

The ED‐based anaphylaxis study was first described by Lin et al, 53 and then adapted by others. 50, 54, 55, 56 Patients with anaphylaxis are studied prospectively at the time of presentation to the ED, with sample collection typically occurring 1 to 2 hours after onset of symptoms, and usually after initial treatment and stabilization. 50, 53, 55, 56 Patients with the most severe reactions including hypoxaemia or hypotension can be investigated, 50, 56 although this is typically after initial stabilization and treatment (usually with adrenaline). In the case of field‐treatment of anaphylaxis, patients are very often treated with systemic corticosteroids and antihistamines as well. 50, 57, 58 Corticosteroids have broad immunological effects, albeit much delayed compared to other anti‐allergic therapies. With respect to basophils, corticosteroids inhibit their pro‐allergic functions, 50, 59, 60 and this might be an important confounder.

### Proposed diagnostic criteria and classification of basophilic leukemias and related disorders [^116ekhyR]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Basophils form a distinct cell lineage within the hematopoietic cell family. In various myeloid neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, basophilia is frequently seen. Acute and chronic basophilic leukemias, albeit rare, have also been described. However, no generally accepted criteria and classification of basophilic leukemias have been presented to date. To address this unmet need, a series of Working Conferences and other meetings were organized between March 2015 and March 2016. The current article provides a summary of consensus statements from these meetings, together with proposed criteria to delineate acute basophilic leukemia (ABL) from chronic basophilic leukemia (CBL) and primary forms of the disease where no preceding myeloid malignancy is detected, from the more common 'secondary' variants. Moreover, the term hyperbasophilia (HB) is proposed for cases with a persistent peripheral basophil count ⩾1000 per μl of blood. This condition, HB, is highly indicative of the presence of an underlying myeloid neoplasm. Therefore, HB is an important checkpoint in the diagnostic algorithm and requires a detailed hematologic investigation. In these patients, an underlying myeloid malignancy is often found and is then labeled with the appendix -baso, whereas primary cases of ABL or CBL are very rare. The criteria and classification proposed in this article should facilitate the diagnosis and management of patients with unexplained basophilia and basophil neoplasms in routine practice, and in clinical studies.

### Basophil activation testing [^112kTBj8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Both the treatment of patients with allergic diseases and the study of allergic disease mechanisms depend on a wide variety of assays that in various ways assess the presence and function of IgE antibody. The study of allergic diseases could benefit from the study of its 2 principle cellular participants, mast cells and basophils, but the basophil is more accessible than mast cells for ex vivo studies. Its functionality is tested by using 2 predominant methodologies: the secretion of mediators of allergic inflammation and the expression of proteins on the plasma membrane after stimulation. Each approach has benefits. There are also many operational details to consider regardless of which general approach is taken, and proper interpretation of the methods requires a good understanding of the reagents used and the receptors expressed on basophils and a detailed understanding of the factors regulating aggregation of cell-surface IgE.

### Basophil activation test is a complementary tool in the diagnosis of immediate reactions to platinum salts and taxanes [^116AYTxu]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our main objective was to assess and validate BAT as a diagnostic tool for HSRs to PSs and TXs in two populations of "well‐defined patients" (i.e. strict diagnostic pathways including DPT). We also explored how these results relate to the different endophenotypes of CHT‐HSRs. Finally, we described the results, practicalities, and important considerations of the diagnostic (risk assessment, ST, DPT) pathway as a whole.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^1177uJdv]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

In specialized clinics, typically 20%‐50% 4, 24, 25 of patients undergoing OFC, and up to 70% in some reports, 26 develop an allergic reaction during the OFC. The proportion of positive OFC depends on the criteria chosen to refer patients for OFC. The severity of the allergic reactions is unpredictable and, while generally regarded as a safe procedure in qualified settings, severe reactions can and do occur during OFC to different foods in patients with varying degrees of IgE sensitization. 27 The majority of severe reactions occur when less than half of the challenge food has been ingested. 27 Furthermore, OFCs require significant resources and a highly skilled clinical team experienced in this procedure and prepared to treat severe allergic reactions including severe anaphylaxis.

Novel approaches with the potential to improve the accuracy of existing allergy tests and reduce the need for OFC, both for diagnostic and for monitoring purposes, especially given the multiple new therapeutic modalities now being assessed for approval, would be very useful in clinical practice and could have a measurable impact in the care for patients with suspected food allergy and for food‐allergic patients.

### Basophils, high-affinity IgE receptors, and CCL2 in human anaphylaxis [^111BMQDh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, rapidly progressing systemic allergic reaction that can lead to death caused by airway obstruction or vascular collapse after exposure to allergens, including insect venom, foods, and medication. Mast cell activation is postulated to have a pivotal role in anaphylaxis, and an increase in serum mast cell tryptase levels can confirm the diagnosis. However, in subjects experiencing anaphylaxis, it is not unusual to find normal serum tryptase levels in the context of increased plasma histamine levels, suggesting that anaphylaxis might also involve basophil activation. However, there are few published data demonstrating a direct contribution of basophils to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in human subjects.

Mast cells enter tissues as immature progenitors, where they undergo the final stages of their development and remain resident in situ for weeks or months. In contrast, basophils typically mature in hematopoietic tissues and subsequently circulate in the blood, with a half-life of less than 1 week. Local allergen challenge studies in human subjects have demonstrated an influx of basophils to inflammatory sites within several hours of allergen exposure, demonstrating the existence of mechanisms for basophil recruitment from the circulation to the site of allergen exposure. Both mast cells and basophils can rapidly secrete histamine and similar (but not necessarily identical) mediators and cytokines after IgE cross-linking. In murine studies basophils contribute to IgG-mediated anaphylaxis. In contrast, human basophils cannot be activated through IgG receptors, and their function is inhibited by IgG-mediated triggering through FcγRIIb receptors; moreover, they lack protease-activated receptors and antigen-presenting functions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic urticaria, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, BAD 2022 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a basophil histamine release assay, if feasible, in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria with an inadequate response to first-line treatment, recognizing that a positive basophil histamine release assay may indicate a higher probability of disease responsiveness to cyclosporin and slower or delayed response to omalizumab, whereas a negative basophil histamine release assay may indicate a higher probability of disease responsiveness to omalizumab.

### Airway basophils are increased and activated in eosinophilic asthma [^114o3TXm]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of basophils on asthma pathogenesis remains largely unexplored, particularly in humans. Here, we evaluated the frequencies and activation status of basophils in the sputum of adult asthmatic patients and related our findings to other parameters of eosinophilic airway inflammation.

Methods

We enrolled 44 adult asthmatic patients who were being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Analysis of the induced sputum, exhaled nitric oxide fraction (FeNO) measurement, and asthma control test (ACT) were carried out together with standard blood and pulmonary function tests. The cellular composition of the sputum was examined by flow cytometry, and the phenotypes of blood and sputum basophils were compared.

Results

Basophils were increased in the sputum of asthmatic patients. The expression of CD203c on sputum basophils was significantly higher than that on blood basophils. The percentage of sputum basophils was positively correlated with those of eosinophils and mast cells; it was also correlated with that of blood eosinophils and FeNO. However, sputum basophils were not correlated with serum IgE, lung function, or the percentage of blood basophils. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed the superiority of sputum basophils as a surrogate marker of the percentages of sputum eosinophils compared with absolute numbers of blood eosinophils and FeNO.

Conclusion

The number of activated basophils was increased in the sputum of patients with eosinophilic asthma and correlated with airway and blood eosinophils. Our observations suggest that sputum basophils may serve as a biomarker to monitor new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma.

1 Introduction: Basophils, Their Functions and Application of the Basophil Activation Test in Allergy

Basophils are rare leukocytes that mature from haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and are mobilised as fully differentiated cells into the peripheral blood, constituting < 1% of total white blood cells in humans. The precise ontology of basophils is not yet completely clear. In humans, a shared basophil/eosinophil progenitor has been described, while distinct basophil/mast cell progenitors have also been reported in animal models. In some ways, basophils resemble mast cells, which are found in tissue, primarily located near blood vessels and mucosal surfaces, whereas basophils are circulating leukocytes. Basophils have numerous cytoplasmic secretory granules filled with proinflammatory mediators and express a wide range of cell surface receptors that facilitate activation through multiple pathways. Among them, fully functional IgE receptors (FcεRI) can bind allergen‐specific IgE (sIgE) with high affinity and be cross‐linked by multivalent allergen interactions. This results in basophil activation and rapid degranulation, with the release of histamine, tryptase, and other proinflammatory mediators, including certain eicosanoids (e.g. leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that cause the characteristic allergic reactions). In addition to IgE‐mediated activation, basophils can be triggered by a wide range of stimuli. These include N‐formylmethionine‐leucyl‐phenylalanine (fMLP), complement anaphylatoxins (C5a or C3a) that activate these cells via a G‐protein coupled receptor, and immune complexes of antigens formed with IgG functioning through recognition of Fcγ receptors. Additionally, certain experimental non‐physiological conditions induce basophil degranulation in vitro, such as hypo‐ or hyper‐osmolar conditions, direct increase of cytosolic Ca2+ by A23187, or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester (Figure 1).

### Prognostic significance of early molecular response in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^113KgwHE]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man presented with splenomegaly (10 cm below left costal margin) and leucocytosis (145 × 10⁹/L). Differential showed neutrophilia with increased basophils (2%), eosinophils (1.5%), and left shift including myeloblasts (3%). A diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was established after marrow cytogenetics demonstrated the Philadelphia chromosome. Molecular studies showed a BCR-ABL1 qPCR result of 65% on the International Scale. Imatinib therapy at 400 mg daily was initiated due to patient preference, with achievement of complete hematological response after 4 weeks of therapy. BCR-ABL1 at 1 and 3 months after starting therapy was 37% and 13%, respectively (all reported on International Scale). Is this considered an adequate molecular response?

### Principles, potential, and limitations of ex vivo basophil activation by flow cytometry in allergology: a narrative review [^113nP5YC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The major challenge of allergy diagnosis lies in the development of accessible and reliable diagnostics allowing correct prediction of the clinical outcome following exposure to the offending allergen(s) and cross-reactive structures. Since the late nineties, evidence has accumulated that flow-assisted analysis and quantification of ex vivo-activated basophils (according to the basophil activation test [BAT]) might meet this requirement for different IgE-dependent allergies and particular forms of autoimmune urticaria. Other so-called nondiagnostic applications of the BAT involve therapeutic monitoring, follow-up of natural histories, and identification of allergenic recognition sites. However, it has also become clear that appropriate use of the BAT necessitates knowledge about degranulation metrics and guidance to guarantee correct execution and interpretation of the results. Here, we have reviewed the most relevant applications and limitations of the BAT. Some personal statements and views about its perspectives are made.

### Relevance of the basophil high-affinity IgE receptor in chronic urticaria: clinical experience from a tertiary care institution [^11568yoF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expression on effector cells has been poorly characterized in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) to date.

Objectives

To investigate the FcεRI expression on blood basophils in a large cohort of patients with CU and its potential relationship with relevant features of the disease.

Methods

Basophil FcεRI expression was measured by flow cytometry in 287 patients with CU (192 with chronic spontaneous urticaria and 95 with chronic inducible urticaria) at their initial evaluation in our department. A control group of healthy nonatopic individuals was included to provide reference data, and the effect of antihistamine and anti-IgE therapy on the basophil FcεRI expression was also evaluated in a cohort of patients with CU.

Results

The median FcεRI expression was found significantly higher in patients with CU compared with healthy controls (P < .0001). A positive correlation was found between serum IgE levels and basophil FcεRI expression (R = 0.422; P < .001). Significantly higher FcεRI levels on basophils were detected in patients with CU who presented with concomitant atopic features (P = 0.003), negative autologous serum skin test (P = 0.002), negative autologous plasma skin test (P = 0.009), or undetected levels of antithyroid antibodies (P = 0.01). Baseline FcεRI expression was not related to the activity and duration of the disease, and was not significantly modified during antihistamine therapy; however, it correlated with the clinical response to omalizumab (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Although further multicenter studies are needed to corroborate these findings, the assessment of basophil FcεRI levels might be relevant in daily clinical practice supporting an autoimmune pathogenesis and predicting response to anti-IgE treatment.

Histamine release testing — applications and clinical correlations — describes that histamine release from human basophils is primarily a valuable research tool for in vitro investigations of allergy, commonly adding allergen or antigen to washed leukocytes from venous blood, and that leukotriene C4 release has been monitored from basophils as an indication of specific IgE; in ragweed‑allergic persons there is a good correlation between clinical symptoms and in vitro histamine release, with histamine release correlating with skin test magnitude and serum IgE specific for ragweed Amb a 1, and both the antigen concentration at which 30% to 50% histamine release (cell sensitivity) occurs and the maximum percentage of histamine release (cell reactivity) correlate with clinical severity, with similar correlations noted in Hymenoptera venom–sensitive patients.

6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities

Adults:

Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5,000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality.

Pediatric Patients:

One, Three, and Five Day Regimens

Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1% to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500 cells/mm3to 1,500 cells/mm3was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4,700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.

### Optimizing the diagnosis of food allergy [^111YGfpw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing a patient with a possible food allergy is important to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions and prevent life-threatening reactions. Routine testing modalities have limited accuracy, and an oral food challenge is often required to make a definitive diagnosis. Given that they are labor intensive and risk inducing an allergic reaction, several alternative diagnostic modalities have been investigated. Testing for IgE antibodies to particular protein components in foods has shown promise to improve diagnostics and has entered clinical practice. Additional modalities show potential, including epitope binding, T-cell studies, and basophil activation.

### Basophil blood cell count is associated with enhanced factor II plasma coagulant activity and increased risk of mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease: not only neutrophils as prognostic marker in ischemic heart disease [^116A2S6z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The link between neutrophils and cardiovascular events goes beyond inflammation, and recent interest has been addressed to hemostatic pathways. Neutrophils are not only able to activate platelets via ROS production, but also can stimulate coagulation by several mechanisms. Neutrophils increase the expression of tissue factor by endothelial cells, degrade the tissue factor pathway inhibitor by means of neutrophil‐derived proteinases (eg, cathepsin G), 47 and release NETs, 20, 22, 24, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 which may provide a trigger and support for thrombus formation. Consistent with these concepts, we found a strong direct correlation between neutrophil count and FII:c, which may reflect the global activation of a coagulation cascade. 26 The association between neutrophil cell expansion and prothrombotic diathesis, although with some still controversial results, is now widely recognized. 57 Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first highlighting a direct correlation between neutrophil count and FII:c. Although our data on neutrophils are substantially confirmatory of previous findings of scientific literature, the major novelty in the present study is represented by the results on basophils, which is the less‐considered and less‐understood leukocyte subtype in clinical practice. Basophilia is an unusual condition, potentially related to various and different clinical conditions, like hypersensitivity reactions, myeloproliferative disorders, and hypothyroidism. Data about basophils and CAD are scanty so far. In a Japanese study cohort investigating associations between leukocyte counts and CAD risk factors, high basophil count was linked with lipid abnormalities, in particular high triglyceride plasma levels. 58 In the UK Biobank study cohort, the group of subjects who died from either cardiovascular or noncardiovascular causes also had slightly higher basophil counts at univariate analysis. 59 In our longitudinal analysis, basophil cell count was shown for the first time to be an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality in CAD. In the second part of our study, basophil cell count was associated with FII:c variability. The effects of basophil and neutrophils appeared to be additive, with the highest risk of mortality, as well as the largest increase of FII:c levels, in subjects with both high basophil and high neutrophil counts as compared with those with both low basophil and low neutrophil counts (Figures 2 and 3, respectively). Notably, subjects with both neutrophil and basophil cell counts had increased FII:c, similar to the carriers of the prothrombin 20210A allele, a well‐known prothrombotic gene variant. This is the first report linking basophil with prothrombotic diathesis and cardiovascular risk. It is worth noting that there are some molecular grounds that may support the biological plausibility of such a relationship. As neutrophils, basophils also can release extracellular DNA traps facilitating coagulation activation and thrombus formation. 60, 61 Basophil granules contain polyphosphate, 62 which is now recognized as a procoagulant player in hemostasis and can accelerate blood clotting by activating the contact pathway and promoting the activation of factor V. 63 Basophils can synthetize platelet‐activating factor, 64 which regulates platelet aggregation and has been implicated in different pathophysiologic mechanisms, including thrombosis and tissue ischemia. 65 Finally, it is intriguing to observe that mast cells, the tissue counterparts of basophils, have been proposed to play a pathophysiological role in thrombosis and CVD, also beyond allergic acute coronary syndrome (the so‐called Kounis syndrome 66), and novel therapeutic strategies to prevent cardiovascular events via targeting of mast cells have been speculated. 67, 68

Allergy diagnostic testing — non–IgE-mediated laboratory evaluation and adjunct tests: Summary Statement 206 states that the availability of specific laboratory tests for non–IgE-mediated drug allergies is limited, and immediate skin or specific IgE tests are not diagnostic of cytotoxic, immune complex, or cell-mediated drug-induced reactions. For hematologic drug reactions, both direct and indirect Coombs tests are often positive in drug-induced hemolytic anemia, while specific antibody tests for drug-induced neutropenia or thrombocytopenia have been reported only from research laboratories and are not clinically available; overall, drug-specific tests are generally confined to research settings and are not clinically applicable for most drugs.

Leukocyte Subtypes and Plasma Coagulant Activity of Factor II

On the associations between blood cell counts and FII:c, the general characteristics of the study sample are summarized in Table S4. Neutrophil, basophil, lymphocyte, and platelet levels correlated directly with FII:c at univariate analysis (Table 5). However, after adjustment for blood cell counts, age, sex, hs‐CRP, and CAD diagnosis, among leukocyte subtypes, only neutrophils (standardized β coefficient = 0.085; P = 0.021) and basophils (standardized β coefficient = 0.073; P = 0.042) remained significant predictors of FII:c variability (Table 5). These associations were confirmed even after adjustment for the carriership of the prothrombin 20210A allele for both neutrophils (standardized β coefficient = 0.109; P = 0.003) and basophils (standardized β coefficient = 0.107; P = 0.004), as well as in the subgroup of patients with CAD (neutrophil standardized β coefficient = 0.165; P < 0.001 and basophil standardized β coefficient = 0.118; P = 0.005).

Table 5
Associations Between Blood Cell Counts and Factor II Coagulant Activity at Univariate Analysis and by Including All Blood Cell Counts in Sex, Age, High‐Sensitivity C‐Reactive Protein, and Coronary Artery Disease–Adjusted Regression Model *

Stratifying the second study population according the threshold values defined in the previous longitudinal study, FII:c increased progressively along neutrophil or basophil quartiles, from the lowest to the highest (Figure 3A and 3B). The effect of neutrophil and basophil was independent and additive, with the lowest FII:c in subjects with low levels of both neutrophils (< 3180/µL) and basophils (< 60/µL) and the highest FII:c in those with high levels of both neutrophils (≥ 3180/µL) and basophils (≥ 60/µL), as shown in Figure 3C. As expected, carriers of the prothrombin 20210A allele had higher FII:c levels, whereas no significant association was found with either neutrophil or basophil blood cell counts (Table S5). Stratifying the study sample on the basis of neutrophils/basophils and prothrombin G20210A polymorphism, subjects with high counts of both neutrophils and basophils had increased levels of FII:c, similar to the carriers of the prothrombin 20210A allele (Figure 4).

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^1128yxb4]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Smoldering BCR::ABL1 -positive chronic myelogenous leukemia

In 1972, a case of what was designated "preleukemic CML" was described in a patient with a normal white cell count but a low percentage of blood myelocytes and metamyelocytes, and on further study, the Ph chromosome was found in 22% of metaphase marrow cells. The patient had no significant changes in his blood counts for 5 years at which time he developed a blast crisis of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML. After a hiatus of 35 years, 14 subsequent cases were reported of similar patients, some with normal hemoglobin, white cell counts and platelet counts and in some cases very slight increases in myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the white cell differential count and occasionally a mildly elevated basophil count. These findings prompted cytogenetic and/or genetic studies that found the Ph chromosome and/or the BCR::ABL1 oncogene in a significant percentage of blood cells. The patients' disease evolved into overt BCR::ABL -positive CML months or years later. This situation has been dubbed "preleukemic" or "smoldering" CML. In a few cases, the patient had received cytotoxic therapy for lymphoma or had an alternative myeloproliferative disease (e.g. polycythemia vera) prior to the discovery of the BCR::ABL- positive blood cells. In several cases, the clues were subtle, such as an unexplained low percentage of myelocytes in the blood and a barely elevated basophil count, just exceeding normal.

### Basophil activation test discriminates between allergy and tolerance in peanut-sensitized children [^1136xu9Q]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The main limitation of BAT was the patients with nonresponder basophils, rendering BAT uninterpretable. The proportion of nonresponders we found (11.5% in the primary study population and 6.2% in the external validation population) was similar to that previously described. This is analogous, for example, to situations in which SPT cannot be interpreted because of a negative histamine control or in which P-sIgE cannot be interpreted in the light of a high polyclonal IgE production or indeed when an OFC is inconclusive. Importantly, these are not misdiagnosed patients but cases in which BAT is uninterpretable and the diagnostic workup needs to be taken further, namely, by doing an OFC. The fact that nonresponders were almost exclusively (92%) peanut-tolerant patients raises the question whether basophil unresponsiveness through the IgE-mediated pathway could be a mechanism underlying peanut tolerance. Another limitation was that different peanut extracts were used for different tests; however, all extracts contained the major peanut allergens. Furthermore, our study was performed in children recruited in a specialized clinical setting and thus may not reflect the results of BAT to peanut in adults or the general population. Further limitations to consider when applying BAT in clinical practice are the fact that BAT needs to be performed on live cells, soon after blood collection, and requires flow cytometry equipment and appropriately trained staff.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^112uQVnv]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Executive summary — anaphylaxis prevalence, diagnosis, and mast cell evaluation: Anaphylaxis has a lifetime prevalence estimated at 1.6% to 5.1%. For diagnostic support, a tryptase level above the laboratory-defined normal value (eg, ≥ 11.4 ng/mL in many laboratories) is informative, but many cases may not show such elevation; in these situations, an acute serum total tryptase level at least 20% plus 2 ng/mL above the patient's BST level may provide evidence of systemic mast cell activation. For patients with recurrent, idiopathic, or severe anaphylaxis or with suspected mastocytosis, obtaining a BST level is advisable as elevated levels are found in patients with HαT and clonal mast cell disease and are associated with more severe anaphylaxis. Adult patients with severe insect sting anaphylaxis or recurrent IA may require evaluation for mastocytosis, including a bone marrow biopsy especially if they have a predictive REMA score, and alpha-gal allergy should be considered in patients who have recurrent IA and an appropriate exposure history.

### Immunology in the clinic review series; focus on allergies: basophils as biomarkers for assessing immune modulation [^113eyAU3]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective clinical treatment for hypersensitivity to many allergens. Studies of basophils during immunotherapy have provided insight into underlying immune mechanisms and support the potential use of basophil activation as a biomarker of clinical outcomes. This review examines the evidence for different pathways of basophil modulation associated with various forms of immunotherapy. Better understanding the molecular mechanisms of basophil activation and desensitization and the relationship between suppression of these effector cells to clinical outcomes holds promise for further development and improvement in potential therapies for allergic diseases.

### Effect of clinically significant thresholds of eosinophil elevation on health care resource use in asthma [^112692oR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood eosinophil counts correlate with exacerbations, but there is a lack of consensus on a clinically relevant definition of eosinophil count elevation.

Objective

To analyze health care resource use among patients with elevated blood eosinophil counts defined at 150 cells/μL or greater and 300 cells/μL or greater.

Methods

Data on patients who received a diagnosis of asthma between 2007 and 2016 were extracted from EMRClaims + database. Patients were defined as having elevated eosinophil counts if any test result during 3 months before follow-up found blood eosinophil count of 150 cells/μL or more or 300 cells/μL or more. Hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and associated costs were compared. With logistic regression, likelihood of hospitalization was assessed in the presence of eosinophil elevation.

Results

Among 3687 patients who met the study criteria, 1152 received a test within 3 months before the follow-up period, of whom 644 (56%) had elevated eosinophil counts of 150 cells/μL or greater and 322 (29%) had eosinophil counts of 300 cells/μL or greater. Overall, the mean (SD) number of hospitalizations for patients with elevated eosinophil counts vs the comparator was significantly greater (0.29 [0.92] vs 0.17 [0.57], P < .001 at ≥ 150 cells/μL and 0.30 [0.95] vs 0.18 [0.61] at ≥ 300 cells/μL, P = 0.001). The total mean cost was significantly greater for patients with elevated eosinophil counts (at ≥ 150 cells/μL: $10,262 vs $7149, P < .001 and at ≥ 300 cells/μL: $9966 vs $7468, P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Patients with asthma incurred greater health care resource use when their blood eosinophil counts were elevated at 150 cells/μL or greater and 300 cells/μL or greater as measured within 3 months of follow-up.

4 THE ROLE OF BASOPHILS IN ANAPHYLAXIS

4.1 Basophil activation

HIGHLIGHTS

Studies of anaphylaxis investigating human basophil activation in vivo are required.

4.1.1 Secretion of mediators of allergic inflammation

The current evidence for basophil degranulation resulting in anaphylaxis in humans is very limited. However, there are several important indirect observations. Total tryptase (which is produced by mast cells, but not basophils) is within normal limits in up to 30% of patients with anaphylaxis. The proportion of patients with normal tryptase is even higher in the case of food‐induced anaphylaxis (even when blood samples are optimally timed), 61 or in the case of positive oral food challenge in which symptoms of anaphylaxis are observed. 62, 63 From these data, some authors speculate that, at least in some patients, the anaphylactic episode may primarily involve basophil and not mast cell degranulation. 42 However, there are several other possible reasons for this discrepancy. For example, in the case of localized (eg in the gut) rather than generalized mast cell degranulation, tryptase may enter the circulation less efficiently. A further level of complexity is added by reports that some mast cells express less tryptase (ie those present in the respiratory epithelium, alveolar wall and small intestinal mucosa) than others (eg in the skin, heart and perivascular tissue), and that in some subjects tryptase may be eliminated very rapidly. 42

Several studies have assessed the impact of the anti‐IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab (which prevents IgE from binding to the high‐affinity IgE receptor) on the acute allergic response to nasal allergen or oral food challenge models, which has allowed an evaluation of the relative contribution of basophils and mast cells. 52, 64 Using titrated skin prick testing to assess mast cell responses, and histamine release assays after in vitro allergen stimulation to assess basophil responses, these studies demonstrated that a reduction in symptoms occurred when the basophil — rather than mast cell — response was reduced. These results indirectly suggest a potentially important role for basophils in acute allergic reactions. However, in vitro stimulation cannot directly show that basophils are involved in acute allergic response in different target organs.

CEA Changed White Blood Cell Counts and Composition in Patients With CAS

Our transcriptional data indicate the potential role of cellular communication and immune cell populations in CAS. Because of ethical concerns and difficulty in obtaining brain specimens, we analyzed the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. After 1 year, all WBC counts were decreased after CEA (P < 0.01, Figure S3). Specifically, patients with MoCA CI exhibited significantly higher WBC counts than those in patients who were CN pre‐CEA (P < 0.05, Figure 6A). However, no significant difference was found between patients with CI and CN using the MMSE pre‐CEA (P > 0.05, Figure S4A). Also, no significance were found between pre‐CEA and post‐CEA in patients with CN rather than CI (Figure S4B, C). Remarkably, for patients with MoCA CI, CEA significantly downregulated WBC counts a year later (P < 0.05, Figure 6B). In particular, CEA induced significant downregulation of the percentage of neutrophils and basophils and upregulation of the percentage of lymphocytes in patients with MoCA CI (P < 0.05, Figure 6C). In addition, the improvement in MoCA scores was positively correlated with an elevated percentage of basophils within a year after CEA (P < 0.05, Figure 6D). These findings suggest that WBC activation may contribute to cognitive progression in patients with CAS with MoCA‐related CI and that CEA surgery effectively reduced these blood inflammatory indices.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^113KTvFL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — What's new covers updated indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT), mast cell disorders and basal serum tryptase, venom skin test technique, and diagnostic methods. In adults with cutaneous systemic reactions, at least 2 prospective studies show less than 2% chance of progression to more severe reactions, and there is still the option for VIT when considering high-risk factors and quality-of-life concerns. For mast cell disorders, elevated basal serum tryptase is linked to increased risk of severe anaphylaxis to stings before, during, and after VIT; when to measure tryptase includes patients with hypotension or severe anaphylaxis and to consider in all patients who are candidates for VIT; and abnormal results include to recognize increased risk, monitor for increasing level, consider bone marrow biopsy, and give VIT indefinitely. Mastocytosis-related points include an estimated 2% frequency in adult patients with insect sting allergy and insect allergy in patients with mastocytosis at 25% frequency, which is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis and can be the presenting sign of indolent systemic mastocytosis. Technique and interpretation updates include whether to use volume of injection 0.02–0.03 mL vs 0.05 mL or bleb size 3–4 mm for intradermal skin tests, and whether a positive test result is a wheal diameter of 3 mm or 5 mm. Diagnostic methods updates include recombinant/component resolved diagnostics with increased species specificity and no greater sensitivity than native venom, and the basophil activation test, which has variable methods and may add sensitivity to diagnostic testing.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in food allergy [^112bJ8CU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

However, if the outcome from the above tests is equivocal, BAT could be a useful tool. If BAT is highly positive, it is likely to confirm food allergy and providers could then potentially avoid an unnecessary OFC resulting in a severe or life-threatening reaction. If BAT shows nonresponsive basophils or obtaining a suitable fresh sample within the diagnostic testing time frame is not possible, the MAT could be an alternative test option. Given that both BAT and MAT are not available in most clinical settings, then proceeding to an OFC for confirmation of allergic status would be an appropriate step in confirming a food allergy diagnosis. It is also important to recognize that there will be children where their test probability is low. This may be seen in their initial test results or as a change over time but it is likely that they would benefit from having an OFC to see if they have developed tolerance. In this circumstance, the use of diagnostic cutoffs may help guide when the timing of conducting one is most appropriate and safe.

FIGURE 1
Flowchart of the patients included. Diagnoses refer to suspected diagnosis based on clinical history. CRR, Cytoquine realese síndrome; DPT, Drug provocation test; ST, skin test.

"Hypersensitive" patients were classified as IgE‐mediated Type I when ST results were positive. Patients with negative ST results were classified as Type I non‐IgE‐mediated or CRR, depending on the clinical features appearing during a positive DPT. If factors for diagnosing Type I and CRR coincided in the same reaction, the diagnosis was established as a mixed reaction. Patients unable to meet any of these criteria were classed as indeterminate.

2.1.1 Tryptase

Tryptase was measured at baseline and 30–120 min after the initial reaction or the DPT (Tryptase fluoroimmunoassay, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). Tryptase levels equal to or greater than baseline × 1.2 + 2 μg/L were considered significant dynamic elevations.

2.1.2 Basophil activation test

BAT was performed as previously described, in all patients studied for reaction after PS or TX administration (with whole blood collected before in vivo tests) and a group of exposed controls using carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and/or paclitaxel, at increasing concentrations (0.05–2500 μg/mL). Results were expressed as percentage of activated basophils (CD63 + or CD203c +high cells). Non‐responder patients and controls who did not show a detectable basophil response upon positive controls and drug‐specific stimulation were excluded from BAT analysis. These results were regarded as non‐valid as they cannot be considered false‐negative. More details are shown in Data S1.

Tryptase algorithm for diagnosing systemic anaphylaxis — serum acute tryptase (SAT) relative to baseline tryptase (BT) uses the threshold "SAT > (1.2 × BT) + 2"; neither an sBT nor an sAT alone has sufficient sensitivity, and sensitivity increases with clinical severity, primarily correlating with hypotension. For sampling, the optimal acute blood collection is 30 to 120 minutes after symptom onset, and the optimal baseline sample is either before the event or at least 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved. The test has high specificity (> 90%), while sensitivity varies with time of collection, clinical severity, and trigger.

### Basophilia and eosinophilia in primary myelofibrosis: phenotype, genotype, and prognostic correlates [^1139CMDE]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Two other studies have also reported on the adverse impact of basophilia in PMF. In one retrospective study of 58 cases, the authors used ROC analysis to define basophilia at an ABC of > 0.1 × 10⁹/L and showed a DIPSS -independent adverse impact on OS. In the second study, the authors identified 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) arising from a previous diagnosis of MF and compared them to a control group of MF patients who did not develop AML and showed persistent basophilia and more frequent CALR mutation in the former. Taken together, the observations from the current study and those of the aforementioned reports warrant additional studies to prospectively clarify the prognostic impact of basophilia in PMF and related MPNs and standardize the prognostically optimal ABC cutoff level and examine the additional impact from PB basophil percentage.

### Basophil activation test as predictor of severity and threshold of allergic reactions to egg [^115WSDcs]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

It was surprising that patients in the lower threshold group were also in the lower severity group. A possible explanation is that patients who develop symptoms earlier after consuming a lower dose end up consuming less of the allergen and trigger fewer effector cells leading to lower release of mediators and less severe symptoms. Conversely, patients who react to a higher threshold had consumed more of the allergen by the time they reacted leading to a greater amount of allergen present in their body and to a greater release of mediators by mast cells and basophils and more severe symptoms.

We had previously reported data on BAT as predictor of severity and threshold of allergic reactions to peanut in independent cohorts of children being assessed for possible peanut allergy. In the BAT2 study, we have confirmed this for egg allergy. Our findings are particularly useful in children, a population in which egg allergy is most common and for whom egg represents a valid and economic source of high‐quality nutrients. The relevance of our findings needs to be further investigated in adults.

### Increased expression of formyl peptide receptor-1 by basophils from patients with mastocytosis [^1126Pjnj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mastocytosis is a disease that is characterized by the accumulation of clonal mast cells (MCs) in tissues often associated with enhanced release of mediators such as histamine, cytokines and proteases. Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) refers to cases with a relatively low burden of MCs and a more indolent clinical course with better prognosis than that of more aggressive forms of the disease. Basophils, which share many functional characteristics with MCs and are involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses against parasites and initiation of allergic reactions, remain generally normal in number in mastocytosis. Basophils may be activated and contribute to the increase in inflammatory mediators after engagement of FcεRI and other receptors such as the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), the latter of which are G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind a chemotactic factor derived from bacteria, namely, N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Despite the recognized contributions of basophils to allergic reactions, it is unknown whether basophil responses might be enhanced in patients with ISM due to an increase in inflammatory mediators in these patients.

The basophil activation test (BAT) using flow cytometry is a widely used diagnostic method to evaluate allergic hypersensitivity. The BAT measures activation markers such as CD63 on basophils in response to allergens, with responses to fMLP serving as a control. In the process of examining the responsiveness of basophils from patients with ISM to FcεRI cross-linking, we unexpectedly found that they were abnormally responsive to fMLP. This observation led us to further compare the basophil reactivity to fMLP in patients with ISM with that in healthy volunteers and to also explore fMLP receptor expression.

### Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: a Work group report of the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee [^111oZzBy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Eosinophilia — definitions and bone marrow biopsy indications — Eosinophilia is defined as an elevation of the eosinophil count in peripheral blood, usually above 0.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, whereas HE is defined as eosinophil count above 1.5 × 10⁹ eosinophils/L, and tissue eosinophilia is defined as > 20% eosinophils in the bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy is indicated in evaluation of eosinophilia when there are persistent eosinophilia without obvious reactive etiology, changes in the complete blood count other than eosinophilia, peripheral blood smear that shows atypical eosinophils or dysplasia in other lineages, organomegaly, an elevated tryptase, or an elevated serum vitamin B12, and other reasons based on clinical suspicion may prompt the need. In addition, bone marrow biopsy should be performed in patients with HE in which reactive etiologies have been excluded or if complete blood count/lab data raise suspicion for the likelihood for neoplastic processes.

indifferent, + positive result, - negative result, ↓ declining, ~ divergent reduction.

pCML-WP recommendation

To date, no single marker unambiguously differentiates de novo CML-BP from Ph + ALL in all cases at the time of diagnosis. In such cases, additional parameters must be obtained after therapy commences (Table 3). A high leukocyte count, left-shifted myeloid maturation, or an increased basophil or eosinophil count at diagnosis and the presence of a major transcript type are indicative, but not conclusive, in diagnosing de novo CML-BP. The panel, therefore, recommends using real-time PCR for BCR::ABL1 and IgH/TCR or flow cytometry markers (if identifiable at diagnosis) in parallel to monitor response to therapy. The accuracy of diagnosis should then be reevaluated as therapy proceeds if a divergence between the clonal markers and BCR::ABL1 transcript levels is detected. The clear detection of BCR::ABL1 in neutrophils by interphase FISH is confirmatory for CML-BP.

Diagnostic work-up

When CML is diagnosed, a bone marrow aspirate is required for morphology, since the proportion of blast cells and of basophils is important to distinguish CP from accelerated phase (AP) and blastic phase (BP), and for cytogenetics. A core biopsy may be done to evaluate the degree of fibrosis which has prognostic importance and may identify nests of blasts not evident in the aspirate. Cytogenetics should be performed by CBA of Giemsa-stained metaphases from bone marrow cells. A qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR on peripheral blood cells is mandatory to identify the type of BCR-ABL1 transcripts that can be appropriately followed when assessing response to TKI therapy. About 2–4% of patients harbor atypical BCR-ABL1 transcripts lacking ABL1 exon2 (e13a3 or e14a3) or resulting from atypical BCR breakpoints (e.g. e1a2, e6a2, e8a2, or e19a2) that may yield a false negative PCR using routine primer/probe sets in qualitative or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. If not tested at diagnosis, a false impression may be given that a patient is in complete molecular response after TKI treatment. A quantitative PCR is not mandatory at diagnosis. If a molecular assay demonstrates BCR-ABL1, but the Ph-chromosome cannot be identified by cytogenetics, a FISH test is required. The diagnostic work-up is completed by a physical examination with particular reference to spleen and liver size, a standard biochemical profile including hepatitis B serology, cholesterol, lipase, and hemoglobin A1c values, and an electrocardiogram (Table 1).

Table 1
Diagnostic work-up, baseline.

Performing other tests and diagnostic procedures depends on characteristics of the individual patient, medical history, and comorbidities.

The definitions of CP, AP, and BP are based on hematologic and clinical parameters and unchanged from previous published versions. However, resistance to two TKIs, detection of a BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD)-mutation, or emergence of additional chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells (ACA) raise concerns for progression of disease.

Anaphylaxis — tryptase interpretation for systemic mast cell activation notes that expert consensus has suggested that "a rise of the acute serum total tryptase level at least 20% plus 2 ng/mL over the patient's BST level is evidence of systemic mast cell activation", but investigators "found that a ratio of acute/baseline tryptase of 1.685 was able to better identify anaphylaxis (sensitivity 94.4%, specificity 94.4%)", with proposed tailored cutoffs "of 1.868 when clinical suspicion of anaphylaxis is low and a ratio of 1.374 when clinical suspicion is high"; accordingly, "we do not recommend using the 20% plus 2 ng/mL equation alone to diagnose anaphylaxis", and a calculator is available "at https://tryptase-calculator.niaid.nih.gov".

### Lack of basophilia in human parasitic infections [^112RFWWo]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2003). Low credibility.

While basophilia is often found in animal models of parasitic infection, it has not yet been established whether it occurs in parasite-infected humans. We investigated the relationship between basophilia and parasitic infections in humans by reviewing charts from 668 patients with confirmed parasitic infection (472 with only helminths, 146 with only protozoa, and 50 with both helminth and protozoan infections) and from 50 patients without parasitic infections. Basophilia (> 290 cells/mm3) occurred in only four of the 668 parasite-infected patients (0.6%), and there were no statistically significant differences in the percentages of patients with basophilia or in the absolute basophil counts among either the helminth-infected, protozoa-infected, or uninfected populations. Analysis with regard to relative basophil levels revealed that basophils constituted more than 3% of the peripheral white blood cell population in only four patients. Thus, basophilia occurs only rarely in human parasitic infections and is consequently not a useful clinical marker in the evaluation of suspected parasitic disease.

5.4 What is the clinical relevance of basophil migration?

The importance of basophil migration is currently unclear, and we do not know where or when basophil activation and degranulation occurs during anaphylaxis. The observations that IgE‐mediated basophil migration might occur without degranulation, 87, 88 and that migration out of the circulation may occur at the onset of symptoms, 50 might be consistent with the hypothesis that basophils migrate to the site of allergen exposure where activation and degranulation could occur, thereby contributing to the clinical presentation (Figure 2). This is consistent with clinical observations of different severities and end‐organ patterns of anaphylaxis which suggest that local rather than generalized mast cell and/or basophil degranulation may predominate in some individuals. 42

Figure 2
Hypothetical role of basophil migration in anaphylaxis. Upon allergen challenge, basophil‐directed chemokine2 (possibly secreted from mast cells) induces a rapid migration of basophils out of the circulation. This may reactogenic, with migration to target organs resulting in activation and degranulation. Alternatively, the migration may be a protective response, removing basophils from the circulation so that they are unable to degranulate in response to circulating allergen.2, chemokine (C‐C motif) ligand 2;2, C‐C chemokine receptor type 2; IgE, Immunoglobulin E; IgE receptor, high‐affinity IgE receptor (Fcε)

However, it is also possible that basophil migration occurs as a protective response, preventing their activation and degranulation in the circulation which thus limits systemic degranulation and protects patients against severe anaphylaxis (Figure 2). Unfortunately, we are currently unable to answer these essential questions without the labelling of basophils and tracking their migration in vivo during an acute allergic reaction. Such inflammatory cellular migration, in the case of eosinophils and neutrophils, including the kinetics of cellular influx/efflux into the lungs and other organs, was recently studied and imaged over 4 hours in vivo, either in control subjects 93 or during allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics. 94 However, our attempts to undertake similar studies in human volunteers have been limited by poor uptake of radiotracers by human basophils.

### Presentation of chronic myeloid leukemia in basophilic blast crisis [^116f4pxD]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Basophilia with mature and dysplastic basophils is a common phenomenon in CML. However, a basophilic blast crisis is a very rare form of acute transformation. A review of 410 patients with disease in transformation revealed only two cases (0.5%) of basophilic blast crisis. The dominance of basophil blast cells with fewer or no other myeloblasts or lymphoblasts confirms the diagnosis. Clonal evolution is likely to be evident with additional chromosomal abnormalities, often including i(17q) or other abnormality of chromosome 17. Diagnosis is straightforward when a patient is known to have CML but is more problematic if a patient presents already in blast crisis.

When should tryptase genotyping (HαT test) be recommended?

From a clinical point of view, knowledge about HαT is essential for many patients, both for estimating the risk of more severe anaphylaxis in certain populations and for estimating the probability that the patient is suffering from an underlying SM. Typical indications for a HαT test in clinical practice are summarized in Table V. The intention to determine the copy number status of the TPSAB1 gene in individual cases depends on (1) the BST level, (2) clinical symptoms at presentation and in the case history (including family history), and (3) the age of the patient. Because extra copy numbers of TPSAB1 are primarily detected in individuals with a serum tryptase level of at least 8 ng/mL, testing for HαT is usually recommended when the basal tryptase level is 8 ng/mL or greater. However, cases of HαT with a basal tryptase lower than 8 ng/mL (sometimes as low as 6.5 ng/mL or even lower) have been described. By contrast, in most patients with a tryptase level greater than 15 ng/mL, tryptase genotyping should be performed, unless the patient is asymptomatic and/or has a known underlying disease that explains the tryptase elevation (nephropathy, myeloid neoplasm, or MC neoplasm). For example, in an 80-year-old patient with an MDS who has no MC mediator-related symptoms and a stable basal tryptase level of 27 ng/mL, we would not recommend a genetic test. By contrast, in a 30-year-old patient with the same tryptase level who is suffering from recurrent severe mediator-induced symptoms, tryptase genotyping should be considered. If HαT testing is negative, the patientś peripheral blood leukocytes should then be tested for KIT D816V and the patient should be considered for a bone marrow (BM) biopsy to rule out SM and other BM neoplasms. If the HαT test is positive, no BM biopsy may be required, unless KIT D816V is also detected in blood leukocytes and/or other indicators of a coexisting SM or other BM neoplasm are present. It is important to know that the presence of HαT does not rule out SM. Rather, in symptomatic cases with SM and in SM cases in which tryptase levels are relatively high compared with the infiltration grade of the BM with neoplastic MC (eg, serum tryptase 120 ng/mL; BM infiltration grade 10%), tryptase genotyping should be considered because the likelihood of HαT is very high.

Reduced IgE‐mediated ex vivo basophil activation propensity and reduced circulating basophil levels basophils in patients who experienced urticarial symptoms through MOv18 IgE treatment. (A) Significantly decreased ex vivo basophil activation via IgE‐mediated mechanisms (anti‐FcɛRI and anti‐IgE) was observed in all patients (upper row) and in those patients who experienced any CTCAE grade urticaria following treatment with MOv18 IgE (middle row). Stimulation (% CD63 expression) was as measured via the basophil activation test at baseline and at the last available timepoint during MOv18 IgE treatment. No significant changes were observed in ex vivo basophil activation by a non‐IgE‐mediated (fMLP) stimulus in the whole patient cohort and in patients who experienced urticaria (upper and middle row: right). No significant changes in basophil activation were observed by IgE‐mediated and non‐IgE‐mediated stimuli in patients who did not experience urticaria through treatment with MOv18 IgE (lower row). All patients: n = 24, urticaria patients: n = 15, and non‐urticaria patients: n = 9. Patient A's datapoints highlighted in red. (B) Proportion of basophils in whole blood significantly significant decreased in all patients (upper, n = 24), and in those patients that experienced urticaria through treatment with MOv18 IgE (middle, n = 15). No significant changes in % of basophils in blood proportion were observed in those patients who did not experience any urticaria during treatment (lower, n = 9).

### The absolute basophil count… [^112Y7xDH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The basophil leukocyte rarely enters into clinical thinking, since it is usually absent from the differential count. However, a determination of the absolute basophil count can provide significant information. The present report describes a new technique for the ABC which gives reproducible counts coupled with excellent visualization of the cell morphology. A count of over 50/cu mm is often a sign of allergic sensitization, whereas a count below 20 regularly accompanies allergic reactions. Basophilia is found in association with myxedema, colitis, polycythemia vera, and myeloid leukemia, as well as in the sensitized individual. Conversely, basopenia occurs in hyperthyroidism, pituitary basophilism, and stress reactions, and may follow prolonged steroid therapy, as well as the immediate allergic reaction itself.

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^114MnE4M]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients have triple-negative essential thrombocythemia lacking oncogenic JAK2, CALR and MPL mutations in their blood cells. Marrow megakaryocytes should be investigated in those patients for features compatible with BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia. As a failsafe, blood cells should be tested for BCR::ABL1. Thus, the diagnostician should think in terms of quadruple-negative thrombocythemia (JAK2, CALR, MPL or BCR::ABL1). The ability to induce long remissions with TKI therapy is the most important reason to consider this fourth possible molecular alteration as the cause of thrombocythemia.

Minor bleeding, such as epistaxis, erythromelalgia, acquagenic pruritis or signs of thrombosis, such as cerebral or limb ischemia, are rarely present in patients with BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia, in contrast to their frequency in essential thrombocythemia. In some cases, the absolute basophil count is mildly elevated.

In one study of 1,591 patients with extreme thrombocytosis, 87 Ph-positive patients (5.4% of cases) were found. There was a striking female predominance. The M:F ratio was 24:63 cases or 0.38:1.0 compared to a 1.7:1.0 M:F ratio in all patients with BCR::ABL1 -positive CML in the U.S. National Cancer Institute SEER database. There was usually an e14a2 fusion transcript (Table 1), and the Sokal or Euro prognostic score indicated an intermediate or high-risk profile. Those cases, however, had good clinical, cytogenetic and molecular responses to TKI therapy. The disease in these patients was usually JAK2 -negative, but there are uncommon cases of BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia with coexisting JAK2 or, much less often, CALR mutations.

Evolution from BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia to blast crisis may occur, and was frequent in the pre-TKI era. In one report, all seven cases were in women and all developed blast crisis. The frequency of this variant of BCR::ABL1 -positive CML depends on the platelet count threshold used for inclusion.

### Investigation of the diagnostic accuracy of basophil activation test for allergic phenotypes of rhinitis [^112U4YZL]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study represents the largest investigation about the diagnostic performance of BAT for airway allergy, and includes patients with all rhinitis phenotypes besides HC. The allergic etiology was investigated systematically in all study individuals by conducting several NAC. We also analyzed separately the diagnostic value of BAT for every allergen and allergic phenotype, and identified cut‐offs and clinical biomarkers associated with BAT positivity. These results will facilitate the recognition of rhinitis patients with allergic phenotypes and IgE‐mediated endotype, and will translate into an earlier implementation of disease‐modifying interventions like AIT.

### Identification of basogranulin (BB1) as a novel immunohistochemical marker of basophils in normal bone marrow and patients with myeloproliferative disorders [^115bUr4J]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

In myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), basophils typically increase in number in the bone marrow (BM) and blood. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), basophilia is a diagnostic and prognostic variable. However, no reliable approach for routine detection and enumeration of basophils in BM sections is available. We applied the antibasogranulin antibody BB1 on paraffin-embedded BM sections in 21 control samples (normal BM), 45 patients with CML, 9 with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, 11 with polycythemia vera, 19 with essential thrombocythemia, and 7 with indolent systemic mastocytosis. As assessed by immunostaining of serial BM sections, BB1+ cells coexpressed myeloperoxidase, histidine decarboxylase, and leukosialin but did not express B- or T-cell-restricted antigens. BB1+ BM cells were found to be highly elevated in patients with CML compared with normal BM or other MPDs, with maximum counts found in accelerated phase CML (median, 160 cells/mm(2)). In summary, BB1 (basogranulin) is a new immunohistochemical basophil marker that should allow quantification of basophils in CML at diagnosis and during therapy.
