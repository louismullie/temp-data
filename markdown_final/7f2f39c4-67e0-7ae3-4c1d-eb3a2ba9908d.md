## Question

How does air pollution impact the incidence of asthma in urban areas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how air pollution impacts the incidence of asthma in urban areas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between asthma incidence versus exacerbations and the specific pollutants most implicated. Then, I should verify the strength of epidemiologic evidence by study design and credibility. Next, I will examine dose–response and timing of exposure, especially early life. After that, I need to assess effect modification by individual and community factors. I will then consider mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I should translate this into clinical and policy implications, including uncertainties and research gaps, and ensure I cite only figures that appear in the provided references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: incidence refers to new-onset asthma, not worsening of existing disease, and the pollutants most consistently linked to incident asthma in urban settings are traffic-related pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, with ozone also implicated in some studies, so I should keep the focus on NO2 and PM2.5 while acknowledging multipollutant mixtures and co-exposures [^5184d5f1] [^0ab856d9].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The Southern California Children's Health Study showed that reductions in NO2 and PM2.5 over two decades were associated with significant decreases in incident childhood asthma, with an IRR of 0.80 for NO2 and 0.81 for PM2.5, translating to absolute reductions of roughly 0.83 and 1.53 cases per 100 person-years, respectively, which supports a causal interpretation given the longitudinal, population-based design and temporal ordering of exposure before outcome [^ec349b92] [^831538f4].

> I will now examine large, diverse cohorts. The ECHO CREW consortium found that a 1-IQR increase in early-life NO2 (about 6.1 μg/m3) was associated with a 25% higher asthma incidence by age 5 and a 22% higher incidence by age 11, and a 1-IQR increase in PM2.5 (about 3.4 μg/m3) was associated with a 31% higher incidence by age 5 and a 23% higher incidence by age 11, with stronger effects in communities with fewer opportunities and higher poverty, reinforcing both the magnitude and the equity dimension of risk [^7dfd4682] [^48bf5f32].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adults. I initially thought adult-onset asthma would show the same signal, but wait, let me verify. A 15-year population-based cohort in Ontario found NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with incident COPD but did not find strong associations with adult-onset asthma, whereas a nationwide Danish case-control study did link PM2.5 and NO2 to childhood asthma onset, and a Taiwanese adult study associated NO2 with incident asthma, suggesting heterogeneity by population, exposure assessment, and confounding control, so I should be cautious about generalizing to adults [^26d7ff57] [^56b78047] [^4946f884].

> Let me consider dose–response and timing. The California analysis showed that communities with larger decreases in NO2 and PM2.5 experienced larger decreases in asthma incidence, implying a graded relationship, and multiple cohorts indicate early life as a critical window, with exposure during the first 1–3 years conferring the strongest risk signal, while some studies also suggest persistent effects of long-term TRAP exposure through childhood [^ec349b92] [^7dfd4682] [^84826294].

> I need to check effect modification carefully. CREW demonstrated that associations of PM2.5 and NO2 with incident asthma were amplified in children of mothers with less than high school education, in Black children, and in neighborhoods with higher poverty, higher population density, and fewer child opportunities, aligning with broader environmental justice literature showing disproportionate exposure and susceptibility in marginalized urban communities [^7dfd4682] [^1169c34c] [^275d7d9a].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility. Air pollutants can damage airway epithelium, induce oxidative stress, promote eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, alter immune maturation, and enhance allergen sensitization; epigenetic changes and gene–environment interactions further modulate susceptibility, which together provide a biologically coherent pathway to incident asthma rather than mere exacerbation of existing disease [^0ab856d9] [^5184d5f1] [^aeca483f].

> But wait, what if co-exposures confound the signal. I should double-check the role of indoor pollutants and social determinants. Studies in urban children show that indoor PM, NO2, mouse allergen, and ETS modify asthma risk and interact with ambient pollution, and socioeconomic adversity compounds exposure and susceptibility, so failure to account for these factors can bias estimates, while simultaneous consideration of both outdoor and indoor exposures strengthens inference [^ae050d53] [^9c2dd881] [^1169c34c].

> I will now translate this into clinical and policy implications. For clinicians, early-life exposure to traffic-related air pollution is a modifiable risk factor for incident asthma, and counseling on exposure reduction, especially in the first years of life and in high-traffic neighborhoods, is reasonable alongside standard asthma prevention guidance; for policymakers, the evidence supports stricter ambient standards and targeted emission reductions, with CREW estimating that lowering PM2.5 and NO2 could prevent a meaningful fraction of incident asthma cases, particularly in disadvantaged communities [^7dfd4682] [^baae9ae4] [^0ab856d9].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and gaps. While the weight of evidence supports causality for NO2 and PM2.5 in children, some adult data are null, ozone findings are less consistent across ages, and most studies rely on modeled ambient exposures rather than personal or indoor measurements; future work should integrate multipollutant mixtures, refine exposure assessment, and test interventions that reduce traffic-related pollution to strengthen causal inference and quantify benefits [^26d7ff57] [^a0687fd3] [^7dfd4682].

> In summary, after reviewing the strongest longitudinal and cohort evidence, I can conclude that in urban areas, higher long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution — especially NO2 and PM2.5 — increases the incidence of new-onset asthma in children, with a dose–response pattern, early-life susceptibility, and amplified risk in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities; reducing these pollutants is likely to lower incident asthma and advance health equity [^ec349b92] [^7dfd4682] [^5184d5f1].

Air pollution in urban areas increases asthma incidence, especially in children, through **traffic-related pollutants** (NO2, PM2.5, ozone) that cause airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune dysregulation [^5184d5f1] [^0ab856d9]. Early-life exposure to these pollutants is linked to **higher asthma risk** [^7dfd4682], with NO2 alone estimated to cause 13% of new pediatric asthma cases globally [^e428161d]. Risk is higher near major roads and in disadvantaged communities, and reductions in NO2 and PM2.5 are associated with lower asthma incidence [^ec349b92] [^7dfd4682]. The evidence supports a causal relationship, particularly for NO2 and PM2.5, and argues for stronger air quality standards and targeted interventions in high-risk urban areas [^5184d5f1] [^7dfd4682].

## Key pollutants and their sources

Urban air pollution includes several pollutants strongly linked to asthma incidence:

| **Pollutant** | **Primary urban sources** |
|-|-|
| Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) | Vehicle emissions, power plants |
| Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) | Traffic, industrial emissions, construction |
| Ozone (O3) | Secondary formation from NOx and VOCs |
| Sulfur dioxide (SO2) | Industrial emissions, fossil fuel combustion |

---

Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a major contributor, with NO2 and PM2.5 as key markers of exposure [^5184d5f1] [^a0687fd3].

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking air pollution to asthma incidence

Multiple high-quality studies show that air pollution increases asthma incidence:

- **Southern California Children's Health Study**: Decreases in NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with significant reductions in incident childhood asthma, with an IRR of 0.80 for NO2 and 0.81 for PM2.5 [^ec349b92].
- **ECHO CREW consortium**: Early-life exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with increased asthma incidence by early and middle childhood, with stronger effects in communities with fewer opportunities and resources [^7dfd4682] [^48bf5f32].
- **Global burden of disease study**: NO2 exposure is estimated to cause 13% of new pediatric asthma cases globally, with the highest burden in urban areas [^2d86cc73] [^a74f5ab7].

---

## Biological mechanisms

Air pollution promotes asthma through several mechanisms:

- **Oxidative stress**: Pollutants like NO2 and PM2.5 induce oxidative injury, damaging airway epithelium and promoting inflammation [^5184d5f1] [^0ab856d9].
- **Inflammation**: Pollutants trigger eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, airway remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness [^0ab856d9] [^f5891a41].
- **Immune dysregulation**: Pollutants alter immune responses, enhancing sensitization to allergens and increasing asthma risk [^5184d5f1] [^f5891a41].
- **Epigenetic changes**: Early-life pollution exposure can cause epigenetic modifications that increase asthma susceptibility [^0ab856d9] [^8d7828f3].

---

## Vulnerable populations

Certain groups are at **disproportionately high risk**:

- **Children**: Developing lungs and higher exposure per body weight make children especially susceptible [^c5aec256] [^275d7d9a].
- **Low socioeconomic status communities**: Higher exposure and cumulative stressors amplify risk [^7dfd4682] [^1169c34c].
- **Minority populations**: Black and Hispanic children experience higher exposure and stronger associations with asthma incidence [^7dfd4682] [^1169c34c].

---

## Geographic and socioeconomic disparities

Asthma incidence linked to air pollution shows **marked spatial and social gradients**:

- **Proximity to traffic**: Living near major roads increases asthma risk, with a 29% higher risk within 75 meters [^f0b447a4].
- **Urban vs rural**: Urban areas have higher asthma prevalence, largely due to higher pollution and TRAP exposure [^f0b447a4] [^5184d5f1].
- **Environmental justice**: Disadvantaged communities bear disproportionate exposure and health impacts, reflecting systemic inequities [^7dfd4682] [^1169c34c].

---

## Interventions and policy implications

Evidence-based interventions can reduce pollution-related asthma:

- **Air quality regulations**: Stricter NO2 and PM2.5 standards are linked to lower asthma incidence [^ec349b92] [^7dfd4682].
- **Traffic interventions**: Reducing vehicle emissions and congestion lowers pollution and asthma risk [^7348c1cf].
- **Urban planning**: Buffer zones, green infrastructure, and reduced traffic exposure near schools and homes can mitigate risk [^notfound].
- **Indoor interventions**: Reducing indoor pollutants (e.g. ETS, NO2, PM) improves outcomes, especially in urban children [^f2863ef6] [^219322d2].

---

## Knowledge gaps and future research

Despite strong evidence, key questions remain:

- **Causality**: More longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to confirm causality and quantify dose–response [^5184d5f1] [^7dfd4682].
- **Mixture effects**: Understanding how pollutant mixtures interact is essential for risk assessment [^a0687fd3] [^503311fa].
- **Individual susceptibility**: Genetic and epigenetic modifiers of pollution effects need further exploration [^25d344d2] [^8d7828f3].
- **Effective interventions**: Evaluating real-world policy and behavioral interventions will guide practice and policy [^7348c1cf] [^3ecb3e61].

---

Air pollution in urban areas, especially TRAP, **significantly increases asthma incidence**, particularly in children and disadvantaged communities. The evidence supports a causal relationship, with NO2 and PM2.5 as key drivers. Reducing exposure through regulation, urban planning, and targeted interventions can lower asthma incidence and improve health equity [^5184d5f1] [^7dfd4682].

### Air pollution and airway disease [^8d7828f3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and toxicological research continues to support a link between urban air pollution and an increased incidence and/or severity of airway disease. Detrimental effects of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulate matter (PM), as well as traffic-related pollution as a whole, on respiratory symptoms and function are well documented. Not only do we have strong epidemiological evidence of a relationship between air pollution and exacerbation of asthma and respiratory morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but recent studies, particularly in urban areas, have suggested a role for pollutants in the development of both asthma and COPD. Similarly, while prevalence and severity of atopic conditions appear to be more common in urban compared with rural communities, evidence is emerging that traffic-related pollutants may contribute to the development of allergy. Furthermore, numerous epidemiological and experimental studies suggest an association between exposure to NO(2), O(3), PM and combustion products of biomass fuels and an increased susceptibility to and morbidity from respiratory infection. Given the considerable contribution that traffic emissions make to urban air pollution researchers have sought to characterize the relative toxicity of traffic-related PM pollutants. Recent advances in mechanisms implicated in the association of air pollutants and airway disease include epigenetic alteration of genes by combustion-related pollutants and how polymorphisms in genes involved in antioxidant pathways and airway inflammation can modify responses to air pollution exposures. Other interesting epidemiological observations related to increased host susceptibility include a possible link between chronic PM exposure during childhood and vulnerability to COPD in adulthood, and that infants subjected to higher prenatal levels of air pollution may be at greater risk of developing respiratory conditions. While the characterization of pollutant components and sources promise to guide pollution control strategies, the identification of susceptible subpopulations will be necessary if targeted therapy/prevention of pollution-induced respiratory diseases is to be developed.

Respiratory Health & Air Pollution This website is archived for historical purposes and is no longer being maintained or updated. The Healthy Community Design Initiative, also known as the Built Environment and Health Initiative, is no longer a funded program and the information on this website is not being reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Transportation-related pollutants are one of the largest contributors to unhealthy air quality. Exposure to traffic emissions has been linked to many adverse health effects including: Exacerbation of asthma symptoms, diminished lung function, adverse birth outcomes, and childhood cancer. Common transportation-related air pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Ozone, formed when nitrogen dioxide and sunlight react, is also a common pollutant. Particulate matter and ozone are known respiratory irritants that can aggravate asthma either by themselves or when combined with other environmental factors.

Recent health studies also suggest that particulate matter is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Motor vehicles contribute to more than 50% of air pollution in urban areas. The design of communities and transportation systems impacts how often automobiles are used, how many automobile trips are taken, and how long those trips are. Reducing automobile trips by increasing mass transit use, carpooling, walking, and bicycling can help reduce air pollution, especially in urban areas. Several years ago, researchers took advantage of a natural experiment to learn about the impact on pediatric asthma of decreased traffic levels and improved air quality. During the 1996 Summer Olympics Games in Atlanta, when peak morning traffic decreased 23% and peak ozone levels decreased 28%, emergency visits for asthma events in children decreased 42%. At the same time, children's emergency room visits for causes other than asthma did not change.

These results suggest that efforts to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality can also help improve the respiratory health of a community.

### Asthma and air quality [^ad9fcf63]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is evidence for an association between asthma and air pollutants, including ozone, NO2 and particulate matter. Since these pollutants are ubiquitous in the urban atmosphere and typically correlated with each other it has been difficult to ascertain the specific sources of air pollution responsible for the observed effects. Similarly, uncertainty in determining a causal agent, or multiple agents, has complicated efforts to identify the mechanisms involved in pollution-mediated asthma events and whether air pollution may cause asthma as well as exacerbate preexisting cases.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies have examined specific sources of air pollution and their relationship to asthma. This review summarizes recent work conducted, specifically, on traffic pollution and presents results that elucidate several plausible biological mechanisms for the observed effects. Of note are studies linking susceptibility to several genetic polymorphisms. Together, these studies suggest that remaining uncertainties in the asthma-air pollution association may be addressed through enhanced assessment of both exposures and outcomes.

Summary

Air-pollution research is evolving rapidly; in the near future, clinicians and public health agencies may be able to use this new information to provide recommendations for asthmatics that go beyond only paying attention to the air-pollution forecast.

### Outdoor air pollution and asthma [^f4715ca6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The relation between outdoor air pollution and asthma has always been a major focus of research. The evidence that current levels of air pollution in many countries result in increased morbidity and mortality is fairly consistent. With rapid urbanization in many communities, traffic exhausts have become the major source of pollution, and many recent research studies have attempted to investigate the detrimental effects of this type of pollution. This paper reviews the recent evidence of the possible detrimental effects of ambient air pollution on the inception and morbidity of asthma.

Recent Findings

Traffic related pollution has been confirmed in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to be associated with increased asthma morbidity and cardiopulmonary mortality. There is also evidence that pollutants such as ozone and traffic exhausts may be responsible for new incident cases of asthma. Among the particulate pollution, research investigating the ultrafine particles and the bacterial components suggested that these particles may have important role in asthma morbidity.

Summary

More research studies are needed to reveal how various air pollutants may interact with the host systems, such as the immune system, leading to increased morbidity in susceptible individuals. Reduction of the current levels of ambient air pollution should be an integral part of the overall effort in minimizing asthma morbidity or mortality in the community.

### Urbanisation and asthma in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review of the urban-rural differences in asthma prevalence [^36e2736f]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of the scientific literature to identify studies that have assessed the relationship between asthma and urbanisation in LMICs following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Inclusion criteria

Population and context

Subjects of all ages living in urban or rural areas of LMICs. We excluded populations living in HICs. LMICs were defined using the list of countries of the World Bank based on the year in which each study was conducted.

Study designs

Cross-sectional, case–control, cohort and ecological studies. We excluded intervention, experimental and genetic studies. Studies that lacked essential data for calculating ORs were also excluded.

Exposure

Urban areas or urban environments defined by demographic, socioeconomic, administrative or other indicators associated to the urbanisation process. We excluded studies evaluating the effects of air pollution on asthma.

Outcomes

Prevalence of asthma measured by wheeze/asthma in the last 12 months, clinical symptoms, doctor's diagnosis, questionnaire data and pulmonary function tests.

Search strategy

A literature search was done in PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scielo databases in February 2017 (online supplementary figure 1). To include all available evidence, past reviews, letters to the editor and publications discussing the relationship between urbanisation and asthma were also evaluated. Further, no restrictions were imposed regarding sample size, age, sex and publication date. Articles in English, Spanish and Portuguese were included in the search. The search process concluded on July 2017.

Paper selection and retrieval process

Publications were grouped by three methods: (a) studies comparing the prevalence of asthma between rural and urban areas, (b) studies comparing the prevalence of asthma between cities of the same country or across countries and (c) studies examining variations in the prevalence of asthma within cities. Titles and abstracts of the articles identified with the initial search were screened by AR. Full-text papers were retrieved and classified based on the previously mentioned categories. Retrieved texts were evaluated by two reviewers (AR and PC) and a final decision on their inclusion or exclusion was made based on the criteria previously outlined. In case of any doubts and uncertainties, a third author was consulted (LR). Non-systematic review papers and letters to the editor were included to provide a general overview of the topic and as a reference source only and did not provide primary data. A flow chart of the selection process is shown in figure 1.

### Asthma and air pollution: recent insights in pathogenesis and clinical implications [^0ab856d9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Air pollution has adverse effects on the onset and morbidity of respiratory diseases, including asthma. In this review, we discuss recent insights into the effects of air pollution on the incidence and exacerbation of asthma. We focus on epidemiological studies that describe the association between air pollution exposure and development, mortality, persistence and exacerbations of asthma among different age groups. Moreover, we also provide an update on translational studies describing the mechanisms behind this association.

Recent Findings

Mechanisms linking air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone to the development and exacerbation of asthma include the induction of both eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation driven by stimulation of airway epithelium and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, oxidative stress and DNA methylation changes. Although exposure during foetal development is often reported as a crucial timeframe, exposure to air pollution is detrimental in people of all ages, thus influencing asthma onset as well as increase in asthma prevalence, mortality, persistence and exacerbation.

Summary

In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of reducing air pollution levels to avert the progressive increase in asthma incidence and morbidity.

### External environmental pollution as a risk factor for asthma [^aeca483f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Air pollution is a worrisome risk factor for global morbidity and mortality and plays a special role in many respiratory conditions. It contributes to around 8 million deaths/year, with outdoor exposure being responsible for more than 4.2 million deaths throughout the world, while more than 3.8 million die from situations related to indoor pollution. Pollutant agents induce several respiratory symptoms. In addition, there is a clear interference in numerous asthma outcomes, such as incidence, prevalence, hospital admission, visits to emergency departments, mortality, and asthma attacks, among others. The particulate matter group of pollutants includes coarse particles/PM 10, fine particles/PM 2.5, and ultrafine particles/PM 0.1. The gaseous components include ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The timing, load, and route of allergen exposure are other items affecting allergic disease phenotypes. The complex interaction between pollutant exposures and human host factors has an implication in the development and rise of asthma as a public health problem. However, there are hiatuses in the understanding of the pathways in this disease. The routes through which pollutants induce asthma are multiple, and include the epigenetic changes that occur in the respiratory tract microbiome, oxidative stress, and immune dysregulation. In addition, the expansion of the modern Westernized lifestyle, which is characterized by intense urbanization and more time spent indoors, resulted in greater exposure to polluted air. Another point to consider is the different role of the environment according to age groups. Children growing up in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods suffer more important negative health impacts. This narrative review highlights the principal polluting agents, their sources of emission, epidemiological findings, and mechanistic evidence that links environmental exposures to asthma.

### How much, how long, what, and where: air pollution exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies of respiratory disease [^a0687fd3]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiology has played an important role in the understanding of air pollution as a risk factor for respiratory disease and in the evidence base for air quality standards. With the widespread availability of genetic information and increasingly sophisticated measurements of molecular markers of adverse effects, there is a need for more specific and precise assessment of exposure to maximize the potential information to be derived from epidemiologic studies. Here advances in air pollution exposure assessment and their applications to studies of respiratory disease are reviewed, with a focus on recent studies of traffic-related air pollution and asthma. Although continuous measurements of personal exposures for all study subjects for a complete study period might be considered the desired "gold standard" for exposure, this is rarely, if ever, achieved due to feasibility constraints. Given this, exposure is typically estimated using models. Recent applications of geospatial (e.g., land use regression) models to studies of respiratory disease have made possible new study designs focused on spatial variability in exposure within urban areas and have provided new insights into the potential role of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) as a risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, regarding what agent(s) within TRAP might be responsible for the observed associations. Future research will require increasing the specificity of exposure assessment to identify the potential roles of individual air pollution components, to elucidate potential mechanisms, and to facilitate studies of mixtures and gene-air pollution interactions.

### Outdoor air pollution and asthma [^5184d5f1]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Traffic and power generation are the main sources of urban air pollution. The idea that outdoor air pollution can cause exacerbations of pre-existing asthma is supported by an evidence base that has been accumulating for several decades, with several studies suggesting a contribution to new-onset asthma as well. In this Series paper, we discuss the effects of particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), and mixed traffic-related air pollution. We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to inflammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation. Although several pollutants have been linked to new-onset asthma, the strength of the evidence is variable. We also discuss clinical implications, policy issues, and research gaps relevant to air pollution and asthma.

### Urbanisation and asthma in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review of the urban-rural differences in asthma prevalence [^36150b24]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Intraurban studies evaluate how living in a particular area of a city may be associated with asthma outcomes. Such studies tend to use spatial groupings of individuals, commonly represented by neighbourhoods or census wards, to assess the effect of place of residence within an urban area on community or individual health. These studies often require spatial and socioeconomic information in these localities at individual and contextual levels, commonly provided by censuses and other publicly available data sources. For asthma research, this approach would be appropriate for addressing questions related to identifying the characteristics of areas within cities that may be associated with asthma. However, few such studies have been done in LMICs.

Limitations of this review

Studies evaluating specific characteristics of the urban environment, such as air pollution or distance to an urban location, were not included. In the case of air pollution, there is a large literature and this topic may be better dealt with separately. We considered only studies done in LMICs because these countries share historical and developmental processes determining the evolution of the urban environment that are distinct from those that have occurred in HICs. Other ecological studies, especially those related to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood, were not included here because they use populations from both LMICs and HICs. Because of the large degree of heterogeneity between studies (different study setting, population age, asthma definitions, urban–rural definitions) and variable methodological quality, pooled ORs estimated by asthma definition need to be interpreted with caution. Finally, although we carried out a thorough search of the literature and produced funnel plots to investigate potential publication bias (see online supplementary figure 2), the plots were not suggestive of publication bias, but we cannot completely exclude the possibility that studies that do not show a positive association are less likely to be published.

### Indoor air pollution and asthma in children [^f2863ef6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review indoor air pollution factors that can modify asthma severity, particularly in inner-city environments. While there is a large literature linking ambient air pollution and asthma morbidity, less is known about the impact of indoor air pollution on asthma. Concentrating on the indoor environments is particularly important for children, since they can spend as much as 90% of their time indoors. This review focuses on studies conducted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment as well as other relevant epidemiologic studies. Analysis of exposure outcome relationships in the published literature demonstrates the importance of evaluating indoor home environmental air pollution sources as risk factors for asthma morbidity. Important indoor air pollution determinants of asthma morbidity in urban environments include particulate matter (particularly the coarse fraction), nitrogen dioxide, and airborne mouse allergen exposure. Avoidance of harmful environmental exposures is a key component of national and international guideline recommendations for management of asthma. This literature suggests that modifying the indoor environment to reduce particulate matter, NO(2), and mouse allergen may be an important asthma management strategy. More research documenting effectiveness of interventions to reduce those exposures and improve asthma outcomes is needed.

### The environment and asthma in US inner cities [^9f28233d]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Poor, minority children living in US inner cities have increased rates of asthma morbidity and mortality. Factors that contribute to these increased rates are varied and complex, with current evidence suggesting that the environment is an important causative factor. Respiratory morbidity is often the result of allergens and air pollutants. Additionally, for children living in urban environments, underlying societal susceptibility factors specific to the inner city serve to increase asthma morbidity. Even though ambient pollutants have been declining in US cities, asthma morbidity and mortality rates have been increasing. Indoor pollutants are closely linked to increased asthma prevalence and morbidity. While the understanding of environmental influences is still relatively limited, we can say that indoor exposures are more important than ambient pollutants, and we know that bioaerosols containing allergenic proteins are especially important. Additionally, certain particulate aerosols and ozone cause inflammation individually and may act synergistically to enhance the acute and chronic IgE-mediated inflammation. The purpose of this article is to review the data relating exposure to environmental pollutants and airborne allergens, and the relationship of this exposure to asthma prevalence and morbidity in order to inform plans for public health programs to reduce an asthma burden.

### Pulmonary health effects of air pollution [^1ae1efec]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

Air pollution continues to be a major public health concern affecting nine out of 10 individuals living in urban areas worldwide. Exposure to air pollution is the ninth leading risk factor for cardiopulmonary mortality. The aim of this review is to examine the current literature for the most recent updates on health effects of specific air pollutants and their impact on asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infection.

Recent Findings

A total of 52 publications were reviewed to establish new insights as to how air pollution is associated with pulmonary morbidity and mortality. Considerable past evidence suggests that air pollution is an important factor that enhances pulmonary disease, while also causing greater harm in susceptible populations, such as children, the elderly, and those of low socio-economic status worldwide. Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and respiratory infections all seem to be exacerbated because of exposure to a variety of environmental air pollutants with the greatest effects because of particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. New publications reviewed reaffirm these findings.

Summary

Continued vigilance will be essential to lessen the effects of air pollution on human health and pulmonary disease. Cooperation at a multinational level will be required on the part of governments, industry, energy-based enterprises, and the public working together to solve our air quality issues at the local, national, and global level.

### The epidemiology and genetics of asthma risk associated with air pollution [^25d344d2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

The occurrence of asthma and allergic diseases has continued to increase in the United States and worldwide, despite general improvements in air quality over the past 40 years. This observation has led many to question whether air quality is truly a significant risk factor in the development and exacerbation of asthma and whether further improvement in air quality is likely to result in improved health outcomes. However, epidemiologic studies have shown that levels of pollutants of less than the current ambient air quality standards still result in exacerbations of asthma and are associated with other morbidities as well. Specific locations, such as living near a roadway, might pose a special exposure risk. Genetic factors almost certainly play a role in determining susceptibility to pollutants, such as including those involved with antioxidant defenses. The best studied of these in the context of air pollution risks are glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms. Irrespective of whether pollutants contribute to the development of asthma or the well-documented increases in asthma results in more people having pollutant-induced disease, poor air quality in many places remains a significant problem for patients with asthma and allergic disease. A number of public health, pharmaceutical, and nutriceutical interventions might mitigate the effects of pollutant exposure and deserve further study.

### Air pollution and family related determinants of asthma onset and persistent wheezing in children: nationwide case-control study [^7a8c2fe5]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is among the most prevalent diseases in children worldwide. As children of parents with asthma are more prone to develop the disease, genetic susceptibility has been considered an important risk factor. The rapid increase in prevalence of asthma and allergy globally suggests that besides genetic factors, environmental and social factors might also play a part.

Exposure to passive smoking is recognised as an important environmental risk factor for the development of asthma in children. Urbanisation has been associated with asthma, but it is unknown what factors, or combination of factors, such as environmental exposures, activities, or health behaviours might be part of the association. Residential area might also reflect socioeconomic status, as measured by parental income, and educational level has been linked with asthma in children.

Peaks in exposure to air pollution have been associated with exacerbation of asthma, whereas the role of long term exposure and timing of exposure for asthma onset is less clear. Many studies have been limited to non-representative populations, covering children in families from certain areas and socioeconomic groups. This might introduce selection bias and affect the analysis of the influence of socioeconomic status on asthma and the role of socioeconomic status and related factors in the effect of air pollution.

The development of asthma and wheezing is likely to result from a complex interplay between environmental and social factors, rather than from individual factors alone, underscoring the need to explore the relation between air pollution and asthma in large, representative populations. Using a registry based nationwide approach covering all Danish children born during 1997–2014, we explored a combination of air pollution and family related factors potentially contributing to asthma onset and persistent wheezing. We determined whether asthma onset and persistent wheezing was associated with family related factors, whether high levels of air pollution in the children's residential area was associated with an increased risk of asthma and persistent wheezing, and whether associations of air pollution with asthma and persistent wheezing vary by family related factors.

### Nitrogen dioxide, an EPA parameter, may forecast the incidence of asthma exacerbations across urban areas: an observational study [^6b40ee3c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that affects millions of lives in the United States, with certain areas of the country more affected than others. These areas are known as Asthma Capitals by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA). Pollution is known to play a key role in the onset and severity of asthma, especially in the Asthma Capitals. Traffic‐related air pollution (TRAP), composed of toxic gases and particles which include nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), is known to significantly increase the odds of asthma related emergency department visits. The Clean Air Act, a comprehensive federal law that regulates air emissions, authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health and public welfare and to regulate the emissions of hazardous air pollutants such as NO 2 in high‐risk areas. Currently, per the EPA, the NAAQS for NO 2 is annually 53 parts per billion (ppb). Zip codes in the Asthma Capitals have NO 2 levels below this level of 53 ppb, but the levels recorded may still be high enough to impact asthma control. Despite the NAAQS, TRAP, consisting of NO 2, continues to significantly increase the odds of asthma related emergency department visits. Therefore, the current NO 2 regulations are not strict enough to improve pediatric asthma health.

Previous studies have demonstrated that NO 2 is a significant risk factor for asthma exacerbations in the pediatric population.NO 2 plays an important role in asthma development, and there are longitudinal studies evaluating the relationship between early childhood exposure to NO 2 and future asthma development. In fact, early exposures to NO 2 are associated with a higher incidence of asthma until 20 years of age. However, the pattern of NO 2 emissions and its relationship to asthma exacerbations in key urban areas with high asthma burden remain unknown. Though zip codes are known to vary in their emissions, the EPA reports its US air quality index data collected from air pollution monitors at the zip code level for urban regions that are known to have high levels of air pollution. Practically, we investigate the pattern of NO 2 exposure at these zip codes because these are the zip codes that are of importance to the EPA. Understanding the exact interplay between nitrogen oxide levels and the incidence of asthma could help determine whether stronger regulations on air pollution levels are needed to benefit the pediatric asthma population.

### Traffic, outdoor air pollution, and asthma [^3566c953]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of asthma and outdoor air pollution has shown that respiratory health effects can vary in relation to different emission sources, types of pollutants, underlying nutritional status, medication use, and genetic polymorphisms. Using sophisticated exposure assessment methods in conjunction with clinical tests and biomarkers that provide mechanistic information, the study of outdoor epidemiology and asthma has evolved into a complex multidisciplinary field. This article presents an overview of the mechanisms by which outdoor air pollution and traffic-related emissions lead to changes in respiratory health and lung function in subjects with asthma.

### Fine particulate air pollution and hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases… [^7bac96aa]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There was a short-term increase in hospital admission rates associated with PM2. 5 for all of the health outcomes except injuries. The largest association was for heart failure, which had a 1. 28% increase in risk per 10-μg/m3 increase in same-day PM2.
5. Cardiovascular risks tended to be higher in counties located in the Eastern region of the United States, which included the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, and the South. Conclusion Short-term exposure to PM2. 5 increases the risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Significance is assessed by the posterior probability that the RR is larger than zero. Values greater than. 95 are considered significant. Effect modification of short-term effects of PM2. 5 on hospital admission rates was investigated by using both county and regional averages of PM2. 5 concentrations, temperature, and ozone.

Both county and regional average temperature positively modified the association between PM2. 5 and hospital admission rates for the 2 respiratory outcomes. For example, comparing 2 regions that differ by 1°C, there would be an estimated 18 additional hospital admissions per 10 000 individuals for COPD and 9 additional hospital admissions per 10 000 individuals for respiratory tract infections per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2. 5 in the warmer region. We did not find evidence of the effect modification by average concentrations of either PM2. 5 or ozone. As reported by Ito et al, 45 updated analyses of these data showed positive associations of PM2. 5 for hospitalization for pneumonia, COPD, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure. In comparison with the present study, the reported risk estimates were several-fold higher. Moolgavkar46, 47 used data for Los Angeles County, California, for 1987–1995 and found that PM2.

5 was significantly associated with risk for hospital admission for cardiovascular disease in persons aged 65 years or older. Sheppard et al48, 49 reported a positive association of PM2. 5 with risk for hospital admission for asthma in Seattle, Wash, for 1987–2004, but elderly persons were excluded. Finally, Burnett et al50 assessed risk for hospitalization for cardiorespiratory diseases in relation to particulate air pollution over 3 summers in Toronto, Ontario. Positive associations were found in univariate models that were attenuated with consideration of gaseous pollutants in bivariate models.

### Early-life air pollution and asthma risk in minority children. the GALA II and SAGE II studies [^5233f605]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

Air pollution is a known asthma trigger and has been associated with short-term asthma symptoms, airway inflammation, decreased lung function, and reduced response to asthma rescue medications.

Objectives

To assess a causal relationship between air pollution and childhood asthma using data that address temporality by estimating air pollution exposures before the development of asthma and to establish the generalizability of the association by studying diverse racial/ethnic populations in different geographic regions.

Methods

This study included Latino (n = 3,343) and African American (n = 977) participants with and without asthma from five urban regions in the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. Residential history and data from local ambient air monitoring stations were used to estimate average annual exposure to five air pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide, particulate matter not greater than 10 μm in diameter, and particulate matter not greater than 2.5 μm in diameter. Within each region, we performed logistic regression to determine the relationship between early-life exposure to air pollutants and subsequent asthma diagnosis. A random-effects model was used to combine the region-specific effects and generate summary odds ratios for each pollutant.

Measurements and Main Results

After adjustment for confounders, a 5-ppb increase in average NO₂ during the first year of life was associated with an odds ratio of 1.17 for physician-diagnosed asthma (95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.31).

Conclusions

Early-life NO₂ exposure is associated with childhood asthma in Latinos and African Americans. These results add to a growing body of evidence that traffic-related pollutants may be causally related to childhood asthma.

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^200aa1dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between early life exposure to air pollution and the risk of asthma by early and middle childhood, and is this association modified by individual and community-level characteristics?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5279 children, mean fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and mean nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) air pollution during the first 3 years of life were associated both with asthma incidence by early and by middle childhood, after adjusting for individual-level characteristics. The association of ambient pollution (PM 2.5 or NO 2) with incident asthma was modified by community-level and individual-level socioeconomic circumstances, including maternal education and race.

Meaning

These findings suggest that exposure to PM 2.5 or NO 2 air pollution during early childhood may play a role in the development of childhood asthma, with higher risk among minoritized families living in densely populated communities characterized by fewer opportunities and resources and multiple environmental coexposures.

### Impact of air pollution on respiratory diseases in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma [^a1db1bed]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Air pollution is a major public health threat, particularly in urban areas with high traffic. Current scientific evidence has demonstrated a potential association between urban air pollutants and adverse health effects, particularly those that affect the respiratory and cardio-vascular systems. Children, the elderly and subjects suffering from chronic disease are particularly vulnerable groups. However, the vulnerability of children is unique, particularly very young children. First, because the lungs of a child are still growing and early exposure to environmental pollutants can easily alter lung development and function; second, children, particularly the preschoolers, are considerably more physically active than all categories of teenagers and adults with longer periods of increased breathing rate that could lead to the deposition of large amounts of environmental pollutants in the respiratory tract; third, young children are predominantly oral breathers, which means that the nasal filter is by-passed, permitting the entry of a large number and variety of pollutants into the lower airways.

In children, exposure to traffic-related pollutants has been linked to cough, wheezing, asthma and impaired lung function; however, it remains unclear whether these effects occur in the whole pediatric population or only in children who are predisposed to or are already suffering from recurrent or chronic respiratory disease. Moreover, it is not clear whether exposure to air pollution influences the risk of more frequent and/or more severe respiratory infections in the pediatric population. To investigate the questions, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of traffic-related pollution on the development of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections in a population of Italian children with a history of recurrent wheezing or asthma compared to healthy controls. We also estimated the association between incremental increases in principal pollutants and the incidence of respiratory symptoms over a 12-month period in both study groups.

### Outdoor air pollution. asthma and other concerns [^e3db914e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Despite governmental efforts to improve the quality of outdoor air, a significant number of children growing up in the US are exposed to airborne pollutants. It is now recognized that infants generally at risk for atrophy when exposed to specific environmental airborne pollutants are more likely to develop asthma. Once asthma is established, airborne pollutants are important triggers in causing exacerbations. Airborne ozone and suspended articles are the two most important criteria pollutants with respect to exposure prevalence and suspected adverse health effects in US children. Pediatricians should be involved both in community advocacy programs to improve air quality and as knowledgeable practitioners in discussing practical air pollution avoidance strategies with patients and their families.

### Global, regional and national estimates of the burden of childhood asthma attributable to NOexposure for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023: a global burden of disease study 2023 [^a74f5ab7]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Though our meta-analysis of NO 2 -pediatric asthma risk literature is systematic and comprehensive, it remains limited by the availability of NO 2 -asthma relative risk studies. There is a notable scarcity of data for low- and middle-income locations and adult study populations. While our meta regression approach reflects increasing risk with increasing exposure it cannot ultimately confirm causality. Furthermore, our estimation of PAFs relies on several standard assumptions, including the absence of unmeasured confounding, the independence of other risk factors from the exposure, and the plausibility of the counterfactual scenario. While we cannot rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounding, we have adjusted for a comprehensive set of covariates. We also assume that removal of the exposure would not alter the distribution of other risk factors. Importantly, the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) used here is based on low exposure levels observed in empirical studies, supporting the realism of this counterfactual scenario.

Due to lack of available evidence, we were unable to account for adult asthma or asthma-attributable mortality in this analysis, meaning that our results likely underestimate the global burden of NO 2 pollution. Finally, we also need to acknowledge that NO 2 may be correlated with other exposures as it often co-occurs with a mixture of combustion-related emissions, including particulate matter and other gaseous pollutants potentially leading to confounding in statistical analyses. Hence, while the effects of each individual component cannot be completely disentangled, NO 2 serves as a robust indicator of traffic- and combustion-related air pollution and results should be interpreted with that in mind.

While the burden of proof assessment does not confirm causality, it provides a robust framework for evaluating the strength of evidence supporting a relationship between NO 2 exposure and pediatric outcomes. By synthesizing an updated RR estimate that accounts for between-study heterogeneity with granular NO 2 exposure data, we were able to compare trends in NO 2 -attributable burden across space and time, as well as with burden estimates for other risk factors. We identified a NO 2 pollution as a global priority amongst environmental risks for children, especially in high-income locations and urban areas. Different from other risk factors, such as household air pollution, ambient particulate matter pollution, or water, sanitation, and hygiene, NO 2 exposure levels are concentrated in high-income and urban locations instead of developing or rural areas. Evidence also shows that NO 2 pollution contributes to urban environmental health disparities, with minority and lower socioeconomic status populations experiencing increased NO 2 exposure within cities.

### All I need is the air that I breath: outdoor air quality and asthma [^a7e58fb4]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

In recent years, developing insight into the pathophysiology of asthma and advances in asthma management have been substantial. Despite these advancements, asthma remains a significant health problem in the paediatric population. In the USA, the prevalence of asthma in children under 18 years of age is estimated at 7% [US Environmental Health Protection Agency. Publication # EPA-100-r-018. Washington, DC, 2000]. Prevalence rates in various subpopulations, particularly African and Hispanic Americans, are much higher. Certain inner-city census tracts have estimated prevalence rates of 20 to 25% [Crain EF Weiss KP, Stein REK. Pediatric 1994; 94: 356–362]. Many of these subpopulations experience alarmingly disparate and apparently increasing morbidity and mortality associated with asthma. Similar trends in prevalence and morbidity have been observed in urban populations outside the USA as well [Sears MR. Lancet 1997; 350: 1015–1020]. There is considerable controversy as to the scientific basis for these observed trends. While the identification of a single factor or even a closely related group of factors appears unlikely, there is considerable speculation about the role of environmental factors, particularly outdoor air quality. In the USA, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs) offer specific standards for air quality. These standards are applied to certain criteria pollutants, including ozone, particulate matter (both PM(10) and PM(2.5)), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide [Committee on Environmental Health, AAP. In: Handbook of Pediatric Environmental Health. Elk Grove Village, IL, 1999; 181–191]. The NAAQs were recently revised for both ozone and particulate matter based on data that suggested health risks existed at levels below those set forth in the previous standards. Monitoring data reveals that urban populations are more likely to be exposed to elevated levels of these pollutants [Dickey JH. Disease Monitor 2000; 46(9): 566–589]. Children are uniquely predisposed to the potential harmful effects of these pollutants. This predisposition is related to unique physiologic, anatomic and behavioural characteristics of the infant, child and adolescent. There is compelling evidence that an interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to a number of chemical and infectious agents may be operative in both the inception and persistence of the clinical asthma phenotype. The relative role of the criteria air pollutants in this interplay is the subject of considerable study. The potential value of intervention by regulatory agencies or by behavioural modification among individuals or communities should be explored. At the very least, the current data offers implications for situational strategies of asthma management based on local monitoring data.

### Risk and protective factors for the development of childhood asthma [^84e5205d]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Childhood asthma prevalence worldwide has been increasing markedly over several decades. Various theories have been proposed to account for this alarming trend. The disease has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that several important lifestyle and environmental factors including obesity, urban living, dietary patterns such as food low in antioxidants and fast food, non-breastfeeding, gut flora imbalance, cigarette smoking, air pollution, and viral infection are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. However, only environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with the development of asthma. Despite epidemiological studies indicating that many other factors are probably associated with the development of asthma, the relationships are not considered causal due to the inadequate evidence and inconsistent results from recent studies. This may highlight that sufficient data and exact mechanisms of causality are still in need of further study.

### Urban asthma [^d96d02d6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the possible reasons why the prevalence and morbidity of asthma are greater in those living in an urban setting.

Recent Findings

Urban asthma is associated with exposure to air pollution, urban allergens, and violence. Outdoor air pollution is a particular problem in urban areas and affects children more than adults. Asthma has been shown to be exacerbated by ozone, respirable particulates, and nitrogen dioxide. Exposure to high point sources of pollutants such as heavy traffic is of particular concern. Urban allergens include cockroach, mouse, and rat. Cockroach exposure increases the risk of asthma exacerbations and may increase the risk of developing asthma. Although mouse allergen is also found in suburban homes, the concentration is a log-fold higher in inner-city homes at levels known to elicit symptoms in workers in animal facilities. Rat allergen is found in a third of inner-city homes and is associated with asthma morbidity. A recent interventional study showed that comprehensive environmental control of cockroach allergen reduced asthma morbidity. Finally, stress elicits asthma symptoms and exposure to violence is associated with greater asthma morbidity.

Summary

The increase in prevalence and morbidity of asthma associated with urban living is associated with at least three plausible causative factors each of which is amenable to intervention, raising the issue of environmental justice issues: controlling air pollution in general and exposure to point sources in particular; reducing cockroach, mice, and rat infestations; and preventing violence.

### Urban air pollution and children's asthma: what do parents and health professionals think? [^4eca782f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2004). Low credibility.

Our objective was to explore and compare, in the context of other exposures, lay and professional perceptions of the links between urban air pollution and children's asthma. We used a triangulated survey approach, using quantitative questionnaire surveys enriched by qualitative interviews. Derivation of indicators of actual local air quality used modelled air pollution and a geographical information system. Our setting involved families and community health professionals in the London borough of Ealing, and pediatric respiratory specialists across the United Kingdom. Participants included 863 parents of children aged 3–11 years, 151 reporting currently asthmatic children, of whom 20 were extensively interviewed; 98 local general practitioners and 50 practice nurses; and 75 paediatric respiratory consultants and 55 specialist nurses. Main outcome measures involved views about the links between urban air pollution and children's asthma, relative to other triggers. Comparison of assessments of local air quality, with actual pollution levels, was made by parents with and without asthmatic children. Many parents were unsure as to what factors initiate asthma, but the most frequently cited was traffic pollution; it was also considered important in the exacerbation of asthma. Health professionals' assessments were inconsistent: specialists conformed to the dominant literature dismissing strong links between air pollution and asthma, while local clinicians reflected the views of parents in their community. Surrounding parents' views were difficulties defining exposures to urban air pollution, underlying concerns about risks to general health, perceived lack of control, unclear expert opinion, and widely accepted informal "messages" which assumed strong links. Parents with experience of asthma were found to have significantly less accurate (negatively biased) perceptions of local air quality. In conclusion, reactions to uncertainty surrounding associations between asthma and urban air pollution varied: parents' concerns were heightened (and propagated by other influences), specialist clinicians were dismissive, and community clinicians fell between these extremes.

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^48bf5f32]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study of children from a highly diverse US population, PM 2.5 and NO 2 averaged over the first 3 years of life were associated with increased asthma incidence by early and middle childhood. The associations of PM 2.5 and NO 2 were greater among families living in urban US communities with fewer opportunities and resources with multiple environmental coexposures. Air pollution continues to be a global burden with serious consequences on childhood health. Reducing asthma risk in the US requires regulation and reduction of air pollution combined with creation of greater environmental, educational, and health equity at a community level.

Outdoor air pollution — associations and triggers in asthma: Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies showed a significant association between air pollutants such as ozone, nitrogen oxides, acidic aerosols, and particulate matter and symptoms or exacerbations of asthma, including emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and use of digital monitoring identified a lag of 0–3 days between higher levels of multiple pollutants and increased asthma medication use. Proximity to main roads at home and school is associated with greater asthma morbidity, certain weather and atmospheric conditions like thunderstorms may trigger asthma exacerbations by a variety of mechanisms, and reduction of outdoor air pollutants usually requires national or local policy changes.

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^9621421c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Air pollution is a near ubiquitous exposure and the largest environmental contributor to disease and premature death in the world, including for children. Exposure to air pollution has been consistently associated with respiratory morbidity, including wheeze and exacerbation of asthma in children. Several reviews, on air pollution, asthma, and respiratory symptoms in children concluded that outdoor traffic pollution contributes to the development of childhood asthma.

However, community-level and individual-level contextual factors that increase not only exposure, but also susceptibility to air pollution–related childhood asthma effects, including the developmental stage and age of onset of asthma, remain poorly understood. Most prior cohort studies with individual-level information lacked the geographic, racial and ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity to explore the modifying role of community-level contextual factors and the association between air pollution exposure and asthma development.

The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW)consortium, a US nationwide birth cohorts network, is well-positioned to address these questions given the multiple decades of recruitment and follow-up of birth cohorts, the geographic and demographic diversity of study participants, the wide distribution of state-of-the-art spatio-temporally-resolved fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) estimates, and the diverse individual and area-level socioeconomic and built environment factors that vary across and within cohorts.

Previously, we found in the CREW consortium that Black and Hispanic children and children who resided in census tracts with higher rates of household poverty and population density were at increased risk for developing childhood asthma. Building upon these findings, we hypothesized that (1) early life exposure to PM 2.5 and NO 2 is associated with increased asthma risk by early and middle childhood, and (2) not only individual-level, but also community-level factors (eg, living in areas with higher level of poverty, and less opportunity) are associated with increased child susceptibility to pollution effects on asthma risk.

### Inner city asthma [^c29c93c9]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The inner city has long been recognized as an area of high asthma morbidity and mortality. A wide range of factors interact to create this environment. These factors include well-recognized asthma risk factors that are not specific to the inner city, the structure and delivery of health care, the location and function of the urban environment, and social inequities. In this article, these facets are reviewed, and successful and unsuccessful interventions are discussed, to understand what is needed to solve this problem.

### The role of environmental controls in managing asthma in lower-income urban communities [^9c2dd881]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Children living in lower-income urban communities are at much greater risk of developing asthma, going to the emergency department for an asthma attack and being hospitalized for asthma than children living in upper- and middle-income communities. For many asthmatic children living in urban communities, especially those with greater morbidity, the allergic pathway is important in the etiology of the disease. The stages of developing allergic disease can be divided into the onset of allergic sensitization, development of allergic disease and subsequent exacerbations, and it is useful to consider the relevance of interventions at each of these stages. Indoor allergens and environmental exposures are a major contributor to allergic disease, particularly among lower socioeconomic status, urban, minority communities. These exposures include allergens, environmental tobacco smoke, combustion by-products, and mold, all of which can play an important role in asthma progression as well as morbidity. These exposures are often not found in isolation and thus these concomitant exposures need to be considered when conducting environmental interventions. There have been numerous studies looking at both primary and tertiary prevention strategies and the impact on allergic sensitization and asthma with varied results. While the outcomes of these studies have been mixed, what has emerged is the need for tertiary interventions to be targeted to the individual and to reduce all relevant exposures to which an asthmatic child is exposed and sensitized. In addition, effective intervention strategies must also consider other social determinants of asthma morbidity impacting low socioeconomic, urban communities.

### Asthma in the inner city and the indoor environment [^e956b66c]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Inner-city residents continue to suffer disproportionate asthma morbidity despite recent progress in reducing asthma morbidity and mortality in other strata of the United States population. Studies over the past decade indicate that the indoor environment is a strong contributor to poor asthma control and asthma-related health care use in inner-city populations. Certain indoor exposures are more common and occur in higher concentrations in inner-city communities than in suburban communities. Identification of "asthmagenic" indoor exposures has paved the way for the development of intervention strategies aimed at reducing asthma morbidity. This article reviews the growing body of evidence that certain indoor environmental exposures contribute to the burden of asthma in the inner city.

### The role of air pollution in asthma and other pediatric morbidities [^c5aec256]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

A growing body of research supports the role of outdoor air pollutants in acutely aggravating chronic diseases in children, and suggests that the pollutants may have a role in the development of these diseases. This article reviews the biologic basis of children's unique vulnerability to highly prevalent outdoor air pollutants, with a special focus on ozone, respirable particulate matter (PM 2.5 [< 2.5 microm in diameter] and PM 10 [< 10 microm in diameter]), lead, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. We also summarize understanding regarding health effects and molecular mechanisms of action. Practitioners can significantly reduce morbidity in children and other vulnerable populations by advising families to minimize pollutant exposures to children with asthma, or at a broader level by educating policymakers about the need to act to reduce pollutant emissions. Management of children with asthma must expand beyond preventing exposures to agents that directly cause allergic reactions (and therefore can be diagnosed by means of skin tests) and must focus more attention on agents that cause a broad spectrum of nonspecific, generalized inflammation, such as air pollution.

### Air pollution effects in allergies and asthma [^24578465]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Outdoor air pollution is associated with exacerbations of allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other atopic conditions. The increased allergic disease prevalence has been linked to this urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth globally. Air pollutants are well-known to disrupt the epithelium leading to specific diseases in any organ system that has epithelial linings. This review provides an overview of the health effects of air pollution on allergic disorders and specifically addresses how it may impact the epithelial barrier in the upper and lower respiratory tracts to facilitate the health effects associated with these exposures.

### EAACI guidelines on environmental science for allergy and asthma-recommendations on the impact of indoor air pollutants on the risk of new-onset asthma and on asthma-related outcomes [^8d9f9ce2]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The EAACI Guidelines used the GRADE approach to evaluate the impact of major indoor air pollutants (dampness and mould, cleaning agents, volatile organic compounds and pesticides) on the risk of new-onset asthma and on asthma-related outcomes. The guideline also acknowledges the synergies among indoor air pollutants and other components of the indoor exposome (allergens, viruses, endotoxins). Very low to low certainty of evidence was found for the association between exposure to indoor pollutants and increased risk of new-onset asthma and asthma worsening. Only for mould exposure there was moderate certainty of evidence for new-onset asthma. Due to the quality of evidence, conditional recommendations were formulated on the risk of exposure to all indoor pollutants. Recommendations are provided for prevention, patient care and mitigation in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management. For policymakers and regulators this evidence-informed guideline supports setting legally binding standards and goals for indoor air quality at international, national and local levels. Asthma management counselled by the current EAACI guidelines can improve asthma-related outcomes but community and governmental measures for improved indoor air quality are needed to achieve significant impact.

### The association between air pollution and childhood asthma: United States, 2010–2015 [^46e8bb43]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The current population-based study examines the association between county-level ambient air pollution and childhood asthma.

Methods

Data from the nationally representative 2010–2015 National Health Interview Survey were linked to nationwide fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) air pollution data at the county-level from the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network which utilizes air quality monitoring stations and modeled PM 2.5 measurements (Downscaler model data) and adjusted by county-level socioeconomic characteristics data from the 2010–2015 American Community Survey. Multilevel modeling techniques were used to assess the association between PM 2.5 annual concentrations (quartiles < 8.11, 8.11–9.50, 9.51–10.59, ≥ 10.60µg/m 3) and current childhood asthma along with two asthma outcomes (episode in the past year, emergency room (ER) visit due to asthma).

Results

From 2010 to 2015, there were significant declines in PM 2.5 concentrations and asthma outcomes. In unadjusted models, children living in areas with higher PM 2.5 concentrations were more likely to have current asthma, ≥ 1 asthma episode in the past year, and ≥ 1 ER visit due to asthma compared with children living in areas with the lowest quartile (< 8.11µg/m 3). After adjusting for characteristics at the county, geographic, and child and family-level, significant associations remained for asthma episode, and ER visit among children living in areas with PM 2.5 annual concentrations between 9.51 and 10.59µg/m 3 (3rd quartile) compared with children living in areas with the lowest quartile.

Conclusions

This study adds to the limited literature by incorporating nationally representative county-, child-, and family-level data to provide a multi-level analysis of the associations between air pollution and childhood asthma in the U.S.

### Air pollution as a risk factor for incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. A 15-year population-based cohort study [^26d7ff57]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Current evidence on the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and new onset of chronic lung disease is inconclusive. Objectives: To examine associations of incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and adult-onset asthma with past exposure to fine particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM 2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), ozone (O 3), and the redox-weighted average of NO 2 and O 3 (O x) and characterize the concentration-response relationship. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study of all Ontarians, aged 35–85 years, from 2001 to 2015. A 3-year moving average of residential exposures to selected pollutants with a 1-year lag were estimated during follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazard models and Aalen additive-hazard models to quantify the pollution-disease associations and characterized the shape of these relationships using newly developed nonlinear risk models. Measurements and Main Results: Among 5.1 million adults, we identified 340,733 and 218,005 incident cases of COPD and asthma, respectively. We found positive associations of COPD with PM 2.5 per interquartile-range (IQR) increase of 3.4 μg/m 3 (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.08), NO 2 per IQR increase of 13.9 ppb (1.04; 1.02–1.05), O 3 per IQR increase of 6.3 ppb (1.04; 1.03–1.04), and O x per IQR increase of 4.4 ppb (1.03; 1.03–1.03). By contrast, we did not find strong evidence linking these pollutants to adult-onset asthma. In addition, we quantified that each IQR increase in pollution exposure yielded 3.0 (2.4–3.6), 3.2 (2.0–4.3), 1.9 (1.3–2.5), and 2.3 (1.7–2.9) excess cases of COPD per 100,000 adults for PM 2.5, NO 2, O 3, and O x, respectively. Furthermore, most pollutant-COPD relationships exhibited supralinear shapes. Conclusions: Air pollution was associated with a higher incidence of COPD but was not associated with a higher incidence of adult-onset asthma.

### Global, regional and national estimates of the burden of childhood asthma attributable to NOexposure for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023: a global burden of disease study 2023 [^2d86cc73]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), a key component of ambient air pollution and a common marker for traffic-related air pollution, especially in urban areas, is associated with the development of asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness leading to airway inflammation and constriction. Studies of airway response to NO 2 exposure indicate that NO 2 amplifies inflammatory response in airways via oxidative stress. Some studies highlight increasing neutrophilactivity as a source of airway inflammation, while others suggest heightened eosinophil, activity and sensitivity to allergens. Studies of the biological mechanism of NO 2 -exacerbated inflammation have prompted population-based studies on the relationship between NO 2 and asthma, particularly childhood asthma. Though previous research has underlined variability in study design and findings, growing supports a negative impact of NO 2 on childhood asthma.

In 2023, asthma accounted for 5.23 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3.33–7.56 million) years lived with disability (YLDs) globally among individuals under 20 years. Asthma burden is highest in high-income areas like North America, western Europe, and Australasia, but it is also high in Latin America and the Caribbean. Paediatric asthma YLD rates have notably surged in recent years in high-income North America, from 505.5 (321.72–739.28) per 100,000 in 1990 to 646.46 (407.89–968.32) per 100,000 in 2024. While asthma YLD rates for children have dropped since 1990 in most regions, there have been moderate increases in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania and the high-income super-region since the mid-2000s. These trends underscore the relevance of examining NO 2 as a risk factor for childhood asthma.

### Air pollution from traffic and the development of respiratory infections and asthmatic and allergic symptoms in children [^ec7ed493]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the important contribution of traffic sources to urban air quality, relatively few studies have evaluated the effects of traffic-related air pollution on health, such as its influence on the development of asthma and other childhood respiratory diseases. We examined the relationship between traffic-related air pollution and the development of asthmatic/allergic symptoms and respiratory infections in a birth cohort (n approximately 4,000) study in The Netherlands. A validated model was used to assign outdoor concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5 micro m in aerodynamic diameter, and "soot") at the home of each subject of the cohort. Questionnaire-derived data on wheezing, dry nighttime cough, ear, nose, and throat infections, skin rash, and physician-diagnosed asthma, bronchitis, influenza, and eczema at 2 years of age were analyzed in relation to air pollutants. Adjusted odds ratios for wheezing, physician-diagnosed asthma, ear/nose/throat infections, and flu/serious colds indicated positive associations with air pollutants, some of which reached borderline statistical significance. No associations were observed for the other health outcomes analyzed. Sensitivity analyses generally supported these results and suggested somewhat stronger associations with traffic, for asthma that was diagnosed before 1 year of age. These findings are subject to confirmation at older ages, when asthma can be more readily diagnosed.

### Inner-city asthma in childhood [^112653b6]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The inner-city is a well-established and well-studied location that includes children at high risk for high asthma prevalence and morbidity. A number of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors contribute to asthma in inner-city populations. This review seeks to explore these risk factors and evaluate how they contribute to increased asthma morbidity. Previous literature has identified risk factors such as race and ethnicity, prematurity, obesity, and exposure to aeroallergens and pollutants. Environmental and medical interventions aimed at individual risk factors and specific asthma phenotypes have contributed to improved outcomes in the inner-city children with asthma.

### Early origins of asthma and allergies: clues from studies in China [^e428161d]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

6.4 Outdoor Air Pollution

While driving economic growth, China's rapid urbanisation and industrialisation have come at a cost: increasingly poor air quality. This environmental challenge has coincided with a worrying rise in asthma prevalence. Traffic‐related air pollution (TRAP), a significant contributor to urban air pollution, is particularly implicated in this trend. TRAP, which includes nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), ozone (O 3), and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 1), damages airway linings, disrupts the epithelial barrier, and promotes inflammation, creating a fertile ground for asthma development. This is more severe in urban areas in China, as detailed in Table 1. Globally, NO 2 is estimated to be responsible for up to 4.0 million (95% CI: 1.8–5.2 million) new paediatric asthma cases annually, accounting for 13% (95% CI: 5.8%–16%) of the global incidence of childhood asthma. Notably, China bears the highest burden, with an estimated 760,000 cases attributable to NO 2 each year.

Real‐world events offer a glimmer of hope. The traffic restrictions implemented during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the widespread lockdowns during the COVID‐19 pandemic dramatically improved air quality and decreased asthma exacerbations. These examples offer compelling evidence that reducing air pollution can directly and positively impact respiratory health. Effective air pollution control measures are critical to protecting vulnerable populations, especially children, from the harmful effects of this growing and pervasive threat.

### Air quality, tobacco smoke, urban crowding and day care: modern menaces and their effects on health [^57108dca]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The known adverse health effects of outdoor air pollution were reduced in the last century by effective legislation and pollution control. Although combustion of biomass fuels in the indoor environment remains a major hazard in developing countries, there has been a change in the nature of the traffic-generated air pollutants in outdoor air in developed countries. The role of day care and siblings in increasing the risk of infection early in life contrasts with protection from allergic disease later.

Methods

The mechanisms of how these pollutants exert their effects are poorly understood, but there is emerging evidence that the toxic effects may be related to infection. This synopsis discusses the epidemiologic relationship of the menaces of modern living, including air pollution, urban crowding and infection, and will explore some of the mechanisms of how they act synergistically to cause exacerbations of illnesses in individuals with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as asthma. It will also discuss the roles of day care and siblings in relation to respiratory disease risk.

Results

Current evidence suggests that much of the morbidity and mortality related to sources of both indoor and outdoor pollution occur by causing or interacting with respiratory infection and other acute or chronic health conditions, such as asthma.

Conclusion

Improvements in air quality through efforts to tackle environmental problems such as pollution and tobacco smoke will help achieve better health. Day care and siblings increase infectious disease early in life but are associated with protection against development of allergic disease later.

### Long-term trends in the burden of asthma in China: a joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort analysis based on the GBD 2021 [^8d5d48f6]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, research on the disease burden of asthma in China has made substantial and comprehensive progress in recent years, leading to an overall improvement in the burden of asthma. Stricter air pollution controls have diminished exposure to asthma triggers. Enhanced healthcare systems and heightened public health awareness have improved disease management. Furthermore, urbanization and socioeconomic progress have fostered better living conditions and expanded access to medical resources. These changes underscore the efficacy of national policies on public health.

Our study has several limitations. First, the apc model and risk attribute analysis cannot establish causal relationships and are prone to bias. Second, this study did not compare asthma in China with that in other regions globally. Future research should address this gap to assess the comparative severity and burden of asthma in different populations. Third, incorporating provincial-level research data and obtaining more representative data from both developed and remote areas are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of asthma. Future studies could improve predictive accuracy by utilizing long-term case registration data or conducting regular sampling surveys. Despite these limitations, our research offers valuable and updated insights into the burden of asthma and its risk factors in China.

### Complex interactions of pollutant and allergen exposures and their impact on people with asthma [^476ea1f7]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Pediatric asthma has many causes and can manifest differently in different children and at different times. Understanding the many factors related to the development and exacerbation of asthma is complicated by the complexity of the many environmental exposures related to asthma development and morbidity. Furthermore, the same environmental exposures that may cause increased symptoms at 1 point in time may be protective when the exposure occurs earlier or at high enough levels. We know that environmental exposures such as allergens, irritants, and pollutants are quite complex in their composition; further examination of this complexity may improve our understanding of this complex and highly prevalent disease.

### Effects of climate change on environmental factors in respiratory allergic diseases [^5a7a2fef]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

A body of evidence suggests that major changes involving the atmosphere and the climate, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere and the human environment. Studies on the effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still lacking and current knowledge is provided by epidemiological and experimental studies on the relationship between asthma and environmental factors, such as meteorological variables, airborne allergens and air pollution. However, there is also considerable evidence that subjects affected by asthma are at an increased risk of developing obstructive airway exacerbations with exposure to gaseous and particulate components of air pollution. It is not easy to evaluate the impact of climate change and air pollution on the prevalence of asthma in general and on the timing of asthma exacerbations. However, the global rise in asthma prevalence and severity suggests that air pollution and climate changes could be contributing. Pollen allergy is frequently used to study the interrelationship between air pollution, rhinitis and bronchial asthma. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernized lifestyle are correlated to an increase in the frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy, prevalent in people who live in urban areas compared with those who live in rural areas. Meteorological factors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.) along with their climatological regimes (warm or cold anomalies and dry or wet periods, etc.), can affect both biological and chemical components of this interaction. In addition, by inducing airway inflammation, air pollution overcomes the mucosal barrier priming allergen-induced responses. In conclusion, climate change might induce negative effects on respiratory allergic diseases. In particular, the increased length and severity of the pollen season, the higher occurrence of heavy precipitation events and the increasing frequency of urban air pollution episodes suggest that environmental risk factors will have a stronger effect in the following decades.

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^7dfd4682]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Exposure to outdoor air pollution contributes to childhood asthma development, but many studies lack the geographic, racial and ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity to evaluate susceptibility by individual-level and community-level contextual factors.

Objective

To examine early life exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxide (NO2) air pollution and asthma risk by early and middle childhood, and whether individual and community-level characteristics modify associations between air pollution exposure and asthma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included children enrolled in cohorts participating in the Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup consortium. The birth cohorts were located throughout the US, recruited between 1987 and 2007, and followed up through age 11 years. The survival analysis was adjusted for mother's education, parental asthma, smoking during pregnancy, child's race and ethnicity, sex, neighborhood characteristics, and cohort. Statistical analysis was performed from February 2022 to December 2023.

Exposure

Early-life exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 according to participants' birth address.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Caregiver report of physician-diagnosed asthma through early (age 4 years) and middle (age 11 years) childhood.

Results

Among 5279 children included, 1659 (31.4%) were Black, 835 (15.8%) were Hispanic, 2555 (48.4%) where White, and 229 (4.3%) were other race or ethnicity; 2721 (51.5%) were male and 2596 (49.2%) were female; 1305 children (24.7%) had asthma by 11 years of age and 954 (18.1%) had asthma by 4 years of age. Mean values of pollutants over the first 3 years of life were associated with asthma incidence. A 1 IQR increase in NO2 (6.1 μg/m3) was associated with increased asthma incidence among children younger than 5 years (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.03–1.52]) and children younger than 11 years (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.04–1.44]). A 1 IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.4 μg/m3) was associated with increased asthma incidence among children younger than 5 years (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04–1.66]) and children younger than 11 years (OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.01–1.50]). Associations of PM2.5 or NO2 with asthma were increased when mothers had less than a high school diploma, among Black children, in communities with fewer child opportunities, and in census tracts with higher percentage Black population and population density; for example, there was a significantly higher association between PM2.5 and asthma incidence by younger than 5 years of age in Black children (HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.15–2.22]) compared with White children (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.90–1.52]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, early life air pollution was associated with increased asthma incidence by early and middle childhood, with higher risk among minoritized families living in urban communities characterized by fewer opportunities and resources and multiple environmental coexposures. Reducing asthma risk in the US requires air pollution regulation and reduction combined with greater environmental, educational, and health equity at the community level.

### Association of changes in air quality with incident asthma in children in California, 1993–2014 [^ec349b92]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Exposure to air pollutants is a well-established cause of asthma exacerbation in children; whether air pollutants play a role in the development of childhood asthma, however, remains uncertain.

Objective

To examine whether decreasing regional air pollutants were associated with reduced incidence of childhood asthma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multilevel longitudinal cohort drawn from 3 waves of the Southern California Children's Health Study over a period of air pollution decline. Each cohort was followed up from 4th to 12th grade (8 years): 1993–2001, 1996–2004, and 2006–2014. Final follow-up for these data was June 2014. Population-based recruitment was from public elementary schools. A total of 4140 children with no history of asthma and residing in 1 of 9 Children's Health Study communities at baseline were included.

Exposures

Annual mean community-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the baseline year for each of 3 cohorts.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prospectively identified incident asthma, collected via questionnaires during follow-up.

Results

Among the 4140 children included in this study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 9.5 [0.6] years; 52.6% female [n = 2 179]; 58.6% white [n = 2273]; and 42.2% Hispanic [n = 1686]), 525 incident asthma cases were identified. For nitrogen dioxide, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for asthma was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71–0.90) for a median reduction of 4.3 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.83 cases per 100 person-years. For PM2.5, the IRR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67–0.98) for a median reduction of 8.1 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 1.53 cases per 100 person-years. For ozone, the IRR for asthma was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71–1.02) for a median reduction of 8.9 parts per billion, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.78 cases per 100 person-years. For PM10, the IRR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.82–1.07) for a median reduction of 4.0 μg/m3, with an absolute incidence rate decrease of 0.46 cases per 100 person-years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children in Southern California, decreases in ambient nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 between 1993 and 2014 were significantly associated with lower asthma incidence. There were no statistically significant associations for ozone or PM10.

### Air pollution and family related determinants of asthma onset and persistent wheezing in children: nationwide case-control study [^56b78047]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Air pollution and potential effect modifiers

Despite heterogeneity in study designs and methods used across studies, in our study the results were in line with a meta-analysisand a population based birth cohort study, together with other prospective studies that have identified PM 2.5 as a potential risk factor for asthma in children. Notably, two of the mentioned studies even observed an increased risk of asthma at PM 2.5 levels lower than the ones reported in our study (overall mean 12.2 µg/m 3 (SD 1.5) in our study). The pollution levels in Denmark are lower than in, for example, highly populated regions in central Europe, but are higher than, for example, the rest of Scandinavia. The proposed annual limit in Europe for PM 2.5 is 20 µg/m 3; however, further reductions in PM 2.5 might reduce the number of children developing asthma and having persistent wheezing.

Traffic related air pollution has been suggested to influence the development of asthma, and besides exposure to PM 2.5, the effects on asthma in children have been observed for exposure to nitrogen dioxide, even at current low European levels. This is in accordance with our findings, which showed a general pattern of positive associations for elemental carbon, organic carbon, PM 2.5, PM 10, sulphur dioxide, combined nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide with asthma and persistent wheezing. This indicates that for asthma onset, local sources of air pollution (eg, traffic) might be more of a factor than long distance sources. In line with this, the observed inverse associations of ozone and sea salt with asthma and persistent wheezing could reflect the more rural distribution pattern of these pollutants and that ozone is negatively correlated with concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and combined nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide that are increased in urban areas. More long term studies are needed to explore and confirm the role of primary and secondary air pollution emissions and to explore both short term and long term exposure to identify the critical exposure window. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the association between air pollution and asthma have not been fully clarified. The present experimental studies have, however, proposed that oxidative stress and tissue damage, airway modelling, inflammatory pathways, and immunological responses might play a key role in combination with genetic susceptibility.

### Impact of urban biodiversity and climate change on children's health and well being [^843c2347]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Air pollution

Air pollution is closely linked to biodiversity loss because different species withstand pollution differently, and because many pollutants that spread in air, eventually will accumulate in soil. Together with consequences of climate change, such as stressful heat waves, air pollution risks are particularly felt among vulnerable populations that are unable to live outside polluted areas. According to the WHO, at least 1.5 million children under the age of 5 years die annually due to air and water pollution and exposure to toxic substances. Air pollution has been linked to the development of several non-communicable diseases in childhood, such as asthma. Children's frequent hand-to-mouth behavior contributes to their increased risk of exposure to pollutants. As children drink, eat, and breathe more than adults relative to their body weight, they ingest a higher proportion of pollutants and toxins found in food, air, and water. Also, children's increased longitudinal exposure to environmental pollutants, due to their younger age and longer lifetime exposure, results in greater health complications as compared to adults. Further, their immune and hepatorenal systems are still developing, making them more susceptible to pollutants while being less able to excrete toxins. Toxins such as lead, mercury, and others are known to have negative, long-term impacts on developing organ systems. For example, in utero exposure to wildfire smoke has been associated with decreased birth weight and preterm birth. Maternal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are attributed to the burning of biomass and fossil fuels, vehicular emissions, and wildfires, have been associated with in utero epigenetic effects on the fetus that later predisposes the child to asthma. Similarly, exposure to PAHs negatively impacts IFN-γ, a gene strongly correlated with a protective mechanism associated with allergy and asthma.

### Indoor endotoxin exposure and ambient air pollutants interact on asthma outcomes [^ae050d53]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

It is now quite well established that ambient (outdoor) air pollution is a health risk and contributes substantially to the global burden of disease. The mortality and morbidity burden resulting from ambient air pollution has increased during the last 2 decades. Human populations breathe complex mixtures of air pollutants, allergens, and irritants. It has been known for some years from small controlled clinical trials that ambient air pollutants such as ozone (O 3), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and combinations of these gaseous pollutants interact with allergens on physiological outcomes in people with allergic asthma. Much more has been learned in recent years about the effects of fine particles (particulate matter < 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter [PM 2.5]) on asthma and other chronic diseases. A major constituent of PM 2.5 in urban environments is diesel exhaust particles, which have been shown to bind the major grass pollen allergen.

However, in Western societies, most people spend the vast majority of their time indoors, where the mix of air pollutants, allergens, and irritants is different. The predominant indoor allergens include those derived from house dust mites, pets, cockroaches, and molds. Endotoxin is a constituent of gram-negative bacteria, often found in house dust and some occupational settings, which increases the risks for asthma and chronic bronchitis, but perhaps paradoxically also appears to confer some protection against the development of asthma in children.

In this issue of the Journal, Mendy and colleagues (pp.) report a large cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This paper presents some novel findings of synergistic interactions between house dust endotoxin and ambient air pollutants on asthma in both children and adults. The participants in dust sampling were reasonably representative of the US population, although the Midwest region was slightly oversampled. A well-standardized, highly sensitive endotoxin assay was used.

### Association of improved air quality with lung development in children [^3ecb3e61]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Air-pollution levels have been trending downward progressively over the past several decades in southern California, as a result of the implementation of air quality-control policies. We assessed whether long-term reductions in pollution were associated with improvements in respiratory health among children.

Methods

As part of the Children's Health Study, we measured lung function annually in 2120 children from three separate cohorts corresponding to three separate calendar periods: 1994–1998, 1997–2001, and 2007–2011. Mean ages of the children within each cohort were 11 years at the beginning of the period and 15 years at the end. Linear-regression models were used to examine the relationship between declining pollution levels over time and lung-function development from 11 to 15 years of age, measured as the increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) during that period (referred to as 4-year growth in FEV1 and FVC).

Results

Over the 13 years spanned by the three cohorts, improvements in 4-year growth of both FEV1 and FVC were associated with declining levels of nitrogen dioxide (P < 0.001 for FEV1 and FVC) and of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (P = 0.008 for FEV1 and P < 0.001 for FVC) and less than 10 μm (P < 0.001 for FEV1 and FVC). These associations persisted after adjustment for several potential confounders. Significant improvements in lung-function development were observed in both boys and girls and in children with asthma and children without asthma. The proportions of children with clinically low FEV1 (defined as < 80% of the predicted value) at 15 years of age declined significantly, from 7.9% to 6.3% to 3.6% across the three periods, as the air quality improved (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

We found that long-term improvements in air quality were associated with statistically and clinically significant positive effects on lung-function growth in children. (Funded by the Health Effects Institute and others.).

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^d1b9ddf7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The added value of this study includes cohorts that were specifically focused on measuring outcomes related to childhood asthma, with multiple decades of recruitment, varying in terms of the population selection criteria (general and high risk), and with socioeconomic, racial and ethnic, geographic and temporal diversity, and with a wide distribution of state-of-the-art modeling for spatio-temporally-resolved estimation of pollutants.

In Europe, a multicity studydid not find significant association between air pollution exposure and childhood asthma. These cohorts were recruited in the late 1990s, and air pollution exposure was determined with land use regression models. In CREW, collecting and harmonizing data from each cohort enabled us to examine early and middle childhood onset of asthma as well as examine whether the associations differed by both individual-level and area-level factors in urban US settings. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, we were able to examine incident cases instead of a prevalence. The use of the DeGAUSS approach, a software containerization platform, enabled individual sites to geocode their birth addresses and then assign tract-level and exposure variables to those geocodes, so that all individual study sites had identically constructed data sets. Examining modification of air pollution on asthma by COI and SVI (indexes used in previous studies, on body mass index and cardiometabolic risk) enabled us to characterize how composite, as well as individual metrics of community resources and risk were associated with worse pollution effects on childhood asthma.

Limitations

This study had limitations. While the census variables are available every 10 years and have been merged to the nearest year of birth, SVI was available for the years 2000 and 2010 and COI only for 2010; therefore, some misclassification is possible. In these analyses, we examined NO 2 and PM 2.5, although other pollutants common in urban environments like ozone and other traffic-related air pollution may also contribute to asthma and interact with NO 2 and PM 2.5. Similarly, we do not have information about the contribution of pollution from indoor environments. While our analysis focused on early life exposures, future studies could test whether exposures in later life add cumulatively to lifetime risk of asthma.

### Examining the impact of air pollution, climate change, and social determinants of health on asthma and environmental justice [^cf7c4749]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, we discuss the current literature examining the impact air pollution and climate change has on asthma onset, control, and exacerbation. This review also addresses the risk of exposure to specific disproportionately affected communities, highlighting health disparities in exposure and asthma outcomes.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shifted from highlighting the associations between asthma exacerbations and indoor and outdoor air pollution. Studies are now focused on confirming the association of asthma incidence from these same exposures. Many studies have linked particulate matter to adverse asthma outcomes, however, the pollutant exposures that pose the greatest risk and the effect of natural disasters fueled by climate change are under current study. Some studies have observed that the true burden that pollutant exposures have on asthma outcomes occurs at the intersection of exposure and vulnerability. Future studies in this area will address social determinants of health, societal factors such as redlining and other systemic racism practices.

Summary

Although decades of research support the causal link between gaseous and particulate air pollution and the exacerbation of preexisting asthma, recent studies suggest air pollution can cause incident (new onset) asthma. Studies have started to focus on the underlying drivers of poor outcomes in asthma. Many of the structural impediments to high quality asthma care at the society level (e.g. poverty, redlining, systemic racism) also are risk factors for worsened climate events and air pollution exposure. The individuals in these disproportionately affected groups are doubly affected by worsened exposure and worsened access to care for the resultant asthma exacerbations or incident asthma. More research is needed to understand the specific climate and air pollution mitigation efforts where disproportionately affected communities would derive the most benefit.

### Indoor pollutant exposures modify the effect of airborne endotoxin on asthma in urban children [^f1218d61]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

The effect of endotoxin on asthma morbidity in urban populations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine if indoor pollutant exposure modifies the relationships between indoor airborne endotoxin and asthma health and morbidity.

Methods

One hundred forty-six children and adolescents with persistent asthma underwent repeated clinical assessments at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Home visits were conducted at the same time points for assessment of airborne nicotine, endotoxin, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations. The effect of concomitant pollutant exposure on relationships between endotoxin and asthma outcomes were examined in stratified analyses and statistical models with interaction terms.

Measurements and Main Results

Both air nicotine and NO2 concentrations modified the relationships between airborne endotoxin and asthma outcomes. Among children living in homes with no detectable air nicotine, higher endotoxin was inversely associated with acute visits and oral corticosteroid bursts, whereas among those in homes with detectable air nicotine, endotoxin was positively associated with these outcomes (interaction P value = 0.004 and 0.07, respectively). Among children living in homes with lower NO2 concentrations (< 20 ppb), higher endotoxin was positively associated with acute visits, whereas among those living in homes with higher NO2 concentrations, endotoxin was negatively associated with acute visit (interaction P value = 0.05). NO2 also modified the effect of endotoxin on asthma symptom outcomes in a similar manner.

Conclusions

The effects of household airborne endotoxin exposure on asthma are modified by coexposure to air nicotine and NO2, and these pollutants have opposite effects on the relationships between endotoxin and asthma-related outcomes.

### Childhood asthma, asthma severity indicators, and related conditions along an urban-rural gradient: a cross-sectional study [^030fba33]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found a dose response association with lower risk of asthma among rural dwelling children. While the prevalence of asthma was lower in rural areas, it was still relatively high. As such, we emphasize the importance of focusing on asthma among rural dwellers, especially given the evidence showing that among those with asthma, living in a rural area is associated with more severe symptoms. There should be continued investigation of environmental factors in relation to asthma presence and morbidity but we must also consider other directions of research including the study of patient presenting and diagnostic labeling patterns, more in-depth analysis of which characteristics explain the observed associations, and further clinical investigation including objective lung health measures, phenotyping, and the use of biomarkers. This future research will assist in furthering the understanding of asthma etiology as well as identifying populations who require additional attention and management.

### Outdoor air pollution and asthma in children [^d8820856]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, is associated with reversible airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness to triggers; clinical symptoms include wheezing, episodic cough, shortness of breath, and increased mucous production. Ambient or outdoor environmental exposure to ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides has been well documented to exacerbate asthma. Children appear to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects of ambient air pollutants. As their lungs are not completely developed, children may experience greater exposure to environmental pollutants than adults and the higher doses of varied composition may remain in their lungs for a greater duration. Altogether, the negative effects of air pollutants on pulmonary function place children at a greater risk of air pollutant-induced exacerbation of asthma for the duration of their lives.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess recently published literature regarding the influence of air pollution on asthma in children.

Methods

For this work, we reviewed articles found in PubMed using the key words "outdoor air pollution, asthma, and children" which were published between 2006 and 2009. Only those articles that had a full version available in PubMed were analyzed.

Results

We reviewed studies published between 2006 and 2009 examining the effect of outdoor air pollution on asthma in children. In total, we evaluated 25 articles; of these, 9 were published in 2006, 3 in 2007, 8 in 2008, and 5 in 2009. Of these 25 studies, 1 was a clinical trial, 6 were cross-sectional, 4 were case-control (2 with a case-crossover design), 12 were cohort prospective, and 2 were cohort retrospective studies with varied follow-up times ranging from 10 days to 7 years. The ages of children also differed, ranging from birth to 18 years of age.

Conclusions

All studies reviewed in this work indicate that outdoor air pollution affects the appearance and exacerbation of asthma in children. Although these findings are of great interest, the limitations of noted works make future investigations of the effect of air pollution on asthma in children essential.

### Childhood asthma epidemiology: insights from comparative studies of rural and urban populations [^fdd0210b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory disorders. Many epidemiology studies have suggested an increasing trend of asthma in many different regions of the world but the exact reasons explaining such trend remain unclear. Nevertheless, changing environmental factors are most likely important in explaining the trend of asthma. Studies in the past decade have clearly shown a mark difference in the prevalence between urban and rural regions. The consistent findings of a markedly lower prevalence of asthma in children and adults who have been brought up in a farming environment clearly indicate the importance of environmental influence of asthma development. Although the exact protective environmental factors in the rural region remain to be defined, there have been many studies suggesting that early exposure to microbes or microbial products may play a role in modulating the immune system so as to reduce the future risk of asthma and allergies. Advances in the understanding of the genetic predisposition and how these genetic factors may interact with specific environment factors are of paramount importance for the future development of primary preventive strategies for asthma.

### Advancing environmental exposure assessment science to benefit society [^1169c34c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Of the health problems known to be worsened by air pollution, asthma is among the most widespread, especially among the children. A study looking at asthma prevalence and health care in the U.S. found that, in 2008, persons with asthma missed 10.5 million school days and 14.2 million work days due to their asthma and that, in 2007, there were 1.75 million asthma-related emergency department visits and 456,000 asthma hospitalizations. A majority of childhood asthma is estimated to be induced by environmental exposures. In 1 year alone, the cost of childhood exposure to environmental contaminants resulting in asthma was estimated to be close to 2 billion USD. Several recent reviews have found evidence for a link between air pollution and incidence of new cases of child and adult asthma, however, the evidence has still been considered by some as yet insufficient proof of a causal link.

Poverty is known to be a critical factor in susceptibility to pollution-related asthma; a 1999 study in Los Angeles found that the air pollution-related asthma admissions were higher for families of lower income, independent of health insurance coverage. Similarly, an analysis of records of daily hospital admissions and air pollution in New York City (NYC), established that an apparent difference between the races in the risk of hospital admissions was explained by consideration of lower SES, where the poor and the working poor were found to have higher risks per amount of pollution exposure than wealthier individuals, irrespective of race. Also, a recent US study of some 60 million older adults found that the mortality effects from long-term air pollution exposure in the elderly Medicare population was greater amongst those eligible for Medicaid (i.e. those with lower income) than others in that population, again indicating that SES is a primary risk factor that increases susceptibility to adverse health outcomes of air pollution.

### Timing and duration of traffic-related air pollution exposure and the risk for childhood wheeze and asthma [^84826294]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

The timing and duration of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure may be important for childhood wheezing and asthma development.

Objectives

We examined the relationship between TRAP exposure and longitudinal wheezing phenotypes and asthma at age 7 years.

Methods

Children completed clinical examinations annually from age 1 year through age 4 years and age 7 years. Parental-reported wheezing was assessed at each age, and longitudinal wheezing phenotypes (early-transient, late-onset, persistent) and asthma were defined at age 7 years. Participants' time-weighted exposure to TRAP, from birth through age 7 years, was estimated using a land-use regression model. The relationship between TRAP exposure and wheezing phenotypes and asthma was examined.

Measurements and Main Results

High TRAP exposure at birth was significantly associated with both transient and persistent wheezing phenotypes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–2.57 and aOR = 2.31; 95% CI, 1.28–4.15, respectively); exposure from birth to age 1 year and age 1 to 2 years was also associated with persistent wheeze. Only children with high average TRAP exposure from birth through age 7 years were at significantly increased risk for asthma (aOR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01–2.88).

Conclusions

Early-life exposure to TRAP is associated with increased risk for persistent wheezing, but only long-term exposure to high levels of TRAP throughout childhood was associated with asthma development.

### Relationship between air quality and asthma-related emergency hospital admissions in Mexico city 2017–2019 [^cb47b9a0]. Thorax (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is defined as inflammation of the airways associated with wheeze, chest tightness, coughing and breathlessness. Moderate or severe asthma exacerbations, an important health outcome for individuals with asthma, typically require attendance at a hospital emergency department (ED) and/or hospital admission. Asthma is a leading cause of emergency hospitalisation in children aged less than 5 years and its prevalence has increased over the last 20 years, especially in developing countries.

Previous research has suggested that outdoor air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma exacerbations in childrenand adults, although the evidence remains equivocal.

Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) are widely used by international bodies as indicators of air pollution. Several previous studies from a range of different settings have reported that higher levels of PM 2.5, PM 10 and NO 2 are associated with poor respiratory health in both children and adults and are positively associated with asthma-related ED visits. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that PM 2.5 and NO 2, but not PM 10 show significant associations with asthma exacerbations.

Previous work has also demonstrated the role of meteorological factors in exacerbations of asthma. For example, it has been reported that asthma admissions increase in cold temperaturesand both high and low humidity are associated with an increase in asthma admissions.

A recently published study demonstrated that respiratory health (defined as respiratory ED visits) was associated with levels of PM 2.5, O 3 and NO 2 in Mexico City in the period 2010–2015. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between PM 2.5, PM 10 and NO 2 and asthma-related emergency hospital admissions (AREHA) for children aged less than 5 years and adults aged greater than 18 years, in Mexico City between 2017 and 2019. This was of particular interest in the context of city-wide interventions to improve air quality (AQ), including the recent introduction of a health-based AQ index to communicate information on levels of pollution to the population, to explore if this relationship still persisted.

### Climate change and children's health: building a healthy future for every child [^275d7d9a]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Air quality — ambient air pollution and pediatric risk: Air pollution and climate change are intimately linked, and children are particularly vulnerable because of developing lungs, small airway size, increased respiratory rates, and greater time outdoors; ambient air pollution exposure is a leading contributor to global burden of disease and is associated with numerous diseases in children, including asthma, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders, with disparities notable in part due to the inequitable location of polluting facilities. Disease burden attributable to particulate matter of 2.5 µm or less in diameter (PM2.5) is higher in communities of lower educational attainment and income and a higher proportion of people of color, and although PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by approximately 70% since 1981 and gaps in exposure have narrowed, relative disparities in exposure in US census tracts have remained persistent.

### Outdoor air pollution and the risk of asthma exacerbations in single lag0 and lag1 exposure patterns: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0b945c15]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: To synthesize evidence regarding the relationship between outdoor air pollution and risk of asthma exacerbations in single lag0 and lag1 exposure patterns. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials, China National Knowledge Internet, Chinese BioMedical, and Wanfang databases. Articles published until August 1, 2020 and the reference lists of the relevant articles were reviewed. Two authors independently evaluated the eligible articles and performed structured extraction of the relevant information. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of lag0 and lag1 exposure patterns were estimated using random-effect models. Results: Eighty-four studies met the eligibility criteria and provided sufficient information for meta-analysis. Outdoor air pollutants were associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbations in both single lag0 and lag1 exposure patterns [lag0: RR (95% CI) (pollutants), 1.057(1.011, 1.103) (air quality index, AQI), 1.007 (1.005, 1.010) (particulate matter of diameter ≤ 2.5μm, PM 2.5), 1.009 (1.005, 1.012) (particulate matter of diameter, PM 10), 1.010 (1.006, 1.014) (NO 2), 1.030 (1.011, 1.048) (CO), 1.005 (1.002, 1.009) (O 3); lag1:1.064(1.022, 1.106) (AQI), 1.005 (1.002, 1.008) (PM 2.5), 1.007 (1.004, 1.011) (PM 10), 1.008 (1.004, 1.012) (NO 2), 1.025 (1.007, 1.042) (CO), 1.010 (1.006, 1.013) (O 3)], except SO 2 [lag0: RR (95% CI), 1.004 (1.000, 1.007); lag1: RR (95% CI), 1.003 (0.999, 1.006)]. Subgroup analyses revealed stronger effects in children and asthma exacerbations associated with other events (including symptoms, lung function changes, and medication use). Conclusion: Outdoor air pollution increases the asthma exacerbation risk in single lag0 and lag1 exposure patterns. Trial registration: PROSPERO, CRD42020204097. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/.

### Roles of pollution in the prevalence and exacerbations of allergic diseases in Asia [^26695ede]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases has been found to be increasingly rapidly, especially in developing countries. Environmental factors have been found to be important contributors to the manifestations of allergic diseases. Air pollution has been extensively studied in different regions of the world. The levels of ambient air pollutants in many Asian countries are very high when compared with those in developed Western countries. However, the prevalence of asthma was relatively low across many Asian countries. Many studies have clearly documented that environmental air pollution is an important factor resulting in exacerbations of asthma. In particular, levels of traffic-related pollutants are increasing rapidly across many Asian countries in parallel with the level of urbanization and economic development. The loss of protective factors associated with a rural environment will further contribute to the adverse effect on patients with allergic diseases such as asthma. In this review the roles of air pollution were examined in relation to the inception and exacerbations of allergic diseases in Asia.

### Acute respiratory health effects of air pollution on children with asthma in US inner cities [^d5ab6135]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Children with asthma in inner-city communities may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects of air pollution because of their airways disease and exposure to relatively high levels of motor vehicle emissions.

Objective

To investigate the association between fluctuations in outdoor air pollution and asthma morbidity among inner-city children with asthma.

Methods

We analyzed data from 861 children with persistent asthma in 7 US urban communities who performed 2-week periods of twice-daily pulmonary function testing every 6 months for 2 years. Asthma symptom data were collected every 2 months. Daily pollution measurements were obtained from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. The relationship of lung function and symptoms to fluctuations in pollutant concentrations was examined by using mixed models.

Results

Almost all pollutant concentrations measured were below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. In single-pollutant models, higher 5-day average concentrations of NO2, sulfur dioxide, and particles smaller than 2.5 microm were associated with significantly lower pulmonary function. Higher pollutant levels were independently associated with reduced lung function in a 3-pollutant model. Higher concentrations of NO2 and particles smaller than 2.5 microm were associated with asthma-related missed school days, and higher NO2 concentrations were associated with asthma symptoms.

Conclusion

Among inner-city children with asthma, short-term increases in air pollutant concentrations below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were associated with adverse respiratory health effects. The associations with NO2 suggest that motor vehicle emissions may be causing excess morbidity in this population.

### Urbanisation is associated with prevalence of childhood asthma in diverse, small rural communities in Ecuador [^7f04a96e]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

The lifestyle index that showed the strongest association with the prevalence of asthma was also strongly associated with the other urbanisation indices. These relationships suggest that the growing influence of urban lifestyle on rural societies may explain at least partly the increase in asthma prevalence in rural populations and the declining gap between urban and rural asthma prevalence. This is illustrated in the present study by the high rates of television viewing, consumption of soft drinks and presence of material goods in some of the communities. The weak associations between the infrastructure index (and most indicators that constituted this index) with asthma prevalence might be related to the fact that in communities undergoing transition in developing countries some elements of the urbanisation process develop less faster than others changes (eg, social and consumption changes). For example, a high proportion of communities lacked basic services but had a high percentage of television ownership. The implementation of basic infrastructure and basic services tends to lag behind other urbanisation processes because of a lack of economic resources from highly centralised political establishments that are reluctant to invest in populations that do not represent their primary political constituencies. The disparities in the levels of urbanisation in developing countries could help explain the variation of asthma prevalence between and within countries of Latin America.

Our study findings from an ecological analysis are subject to some limitations. First, the associations observed at the community level may not reflect associations at the individual level (ecological fallacy). Despite the fact that we collected detailed information on urbanisation indicators, other data that are likely to be important (eg, environmental sampling for air pollution) were not available. Smoking was not included in our analysis because in the study area, a widespread traditional lifestyle habit is to smoke a traditional cigarette, 'cachimba', and thus smoking in the context of this study, given that we did not collect data to distinguish smoking of traditional versus modern cigarettes, is unlikely to be a useful explanatory variable for urbanisation. We defined asthma as having a wheeze in the previous 12 months. This is a widely used definition and has the advantage of simplicity, but of course not all wheezing is asthma. However, we believe that this definition is likely to be less subject to misclassification compared with other definitions (such as doctor diagnosis of asthma) used in rural populations with limited access to healthcare. Our analysis is limited in degree to which we can attribute urbanisation as being a causal factor for asthma prevalence — many of the variables included in our analysis are markers of lifestyle and while being associated with asthma prevalence may not necessarily be causal.

### Asthma trajectories in a population-based birth cohort. impacts of air pollution and greenness [^33ca3b08]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes may explain inconsistencies in observed associations with environmental exposures.

Objectives

To identify trajectories of childhood asthma and to characterize the potential impact of residential greenness and air pollution on asthma trajectory subgroups.

Methods

Linked administrative databases of medical visits were used to define the occurrence and recurrence of asthma over a 10-year follow-up period within a population-based birth cohort of more than 65,000 children. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify unique asthma trajectories. Weighted multinomial regression was used to assess the relationship between asthma trajectories and risk factors, including environmental exposures.

Measurements and Main Results

Group-based trajectory modeling distinguished four trajectories: one with no asthma representing 88.8% of the cohort, one with transient asthma (5.6% of the cohort), and two trajectories with chronic asthma with early (< 1 yr; 1.5%) and late (< 3 yr; 4.1%) onset during early childhood. These trajectories differed with respect to socioeconomic markers and modifiable risk factors, including maternal smoking and breastfeeding initiation. After accounting for sex, parity, breastfeeding, term birth weight, household income, maternal education, delivery mode, and smoking, an interquartile increase in nitrogen dioxide exposure increased the risk of membership in the early and late-onset chronic asthma trajectories, relative to subjects without asthma, by 50% and 20%, respectively (weighted risk ratio, 1.5 and 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–1.9 and 1.0–1.4). Greenness was not associated with any of the asthma trajectories.

Conclusions

Traffic-related air pollution increased the probability of a chronic asthma trajectory.

### How infections and immune development relate to preschool recurrent wheezing and asthma [^abb05c87]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The relationship between infections, immune development, and preschool recurrent wheezing and asthma is complex and multifaceted. RSV and RV are significant early-life triggers for wheezing, with differing immunologic and genetic associations. RV, especially RV-C, has been closely linked to asthma development, particularly allergic asthma. RSV wheezing illnesses can identify susceptible children and are linked to nonallergic asthma. Ongoing studies using broader RSV prevention (vaccines, monoclonal antibodies) in full-term infants may further clarify these relationships. Both RSV and RV infections are associated with changes in bacterial abundance. The timing of these changes and the bacterial strains that are altered are likely important factors in asthma development that are continually being investigated. Beyond viral triggers, asthma and recurrent wheeze in preschoolers result from a complex interplay of microbial (urban vs. rural living), environmental (e.g. air pollution levels, diet) and host immune factors. Strategies focusing on microbiome modulation (e.g. bacterial lysate ingestion), pollution reduction, increasing biodiversity, and nutritional support (e.g., vitamin D) may offer promising paths for prevention and improved management.

### Dietary fat intake, particulate matter exposure, and asthma severity [^e9f5b8bc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

It seems intuitive that exposure to combustion-related particulate matter would worsen asthma symptoms, given the known proinflammatory effects of combustion-related byproducts and deposition in the lungs. A great deal of research during the past several decades has been performed to establish this link. On the whole, the findings from these studies have generally supported the connection between combustion-related air pollution and asthma severity. However, collectively, the associations shown to date have been relatively modest. For example, in the randomized crossover study of exposure to high–vehicle traffic areas in London, United Kingdom, although adult patients with asthma had modestly lower lung function (∼6% lower) after walking in an area of London with high truck traffic than after walking in Hyde Park, there was no effect on asthma symptoms. Also, the timing of the large population increase in asthma prevalence in places such as urban communities of the United States, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, does not coincide with dramatic increases in combustion-related air pollutants. A study of sediments from a lake in Central Park in New York City lake found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from air pollution sources peaked in the 1910s–1920s and then decreased during the remaining century as the city transitioned from coal to petroleum fuel and then to cleaner-burning petroleum under tighter environmental regulations in the 1970s. This suggests that if air pollution is important in asthma development and exacerbation on a population level, that factors or exposures influencing susceptibility to combustion byproducts must have changed in urban US communities in the latter half of the 20th century.

In this issue of the Journal, the article by Brigham and colleagues (pp.) could offer some insight into one of those possible effect modifiers. In a panel study, they followed 135 predominantly African-American children from low-income households. The children were followed for three 1-week periods during a year, during which domestic particulate matter was measured and dietary intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and asthma symptoms were assessed. Notably, the researchers found that associations between particulate matter exposure and lung function and symptoms were modified by reported intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Higher omega-6 fatty acid intake was associated with an increased association between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter and asthma symptoms, whereas higher omega-3 fatty acid intake was associated with a reduced association between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic and asthma symptoms.

### Association of changes in air quality with incident asthma in children in California, 1993–2014… [^831538f4]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

8Quiz Ref ID Leveraging this unique data resource, the study examined whether observed reductions in regional air pollutants, specifically ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and PM less than 10 μm or less than 2. 5 μm, were associated with asthma incidence rates within these CHS communities. To assess association between changes in regional air quality and asthma incidence in children within community over the course of follow-up for these 3 cohorts, we fitted multilevel Poisson regression models to estimate asthma incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs associated with exposure to regional air pollution. 10, 14, 15 Models included an offset term for person-time and a fixed effect for community. Reductions in air pollution were larger in communities with higher 1993 concentrations.

Plots of the unadjusted community-level data, along with community-specific regression lines, comparing asthma incidence rates with regional air pollution concentrations across the 3 cohorts are shown in Figure 2. Greater reductions in asthma incidence rates were observed in communities with larger decreases in either nitrogen dioxide or PM2. 5 concentrations. Results were less consistent for ozone and PM10. Quiz Ref IDReductions in levels of regional nitrogen dioxide from 1993 to 2014 were statistically significantly associated with improvements in asthma incidence rates in Southern Californian children. These results were independent of changes in exposure to near-roadway pollution. Findings from this study also suggested a potential association with regional PM2. 5; these results, however, were less robust to sensitivity analyses. One CHS study, using data from the 2006–2014 cohort only, reported an association between exposure to nitrogen dioxide and asthma incidence.

6, 23 Ambient nitrogen dioxide measured at community central sites was associated with increased asthma risk, although this association was attenuated after accounting for traffic-related pollutions. the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants identified 4 mechanisms for how air pollution might contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma: oxidative stress and damage, including the depletion of antioxidants; airway wall remodeling, leading to structural changes in the airways; inflammatory pathways and immunological effects, including effects on the expression of inflammatory mediators; and enhancement of respiratory sensitization to allergens. 34.

### Associations between ozone and fine particulate matter and respiratory illness found to vary between children and adults. implications for U.S. air quality policy [^ea24430a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Exposure to particulate matter and ozone has severe repercussions on public health in the United States and globally. Fine particulate matter (or PM 2.5, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less) has been associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and lung cancer. Ozone exposure has been linked to increased risks for asthma exacerbations and other respiratory illnesses, as well as to cardiovascular disease mortality. Fossil fuel combustion–related emissions of particulate matter and precursors of ozone have been estimated to cause approximately 210,000 premature deaths annually in the United States. Further, combustion-related emissions that affect air quality also are the major drivers of climate change. There is new evidence that the effect of climate change on wildfires could double the numbers of premature deaths resulting from fine particulate matter exposure by 2100.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act, are the federal standards for air quality levels that are designed to protect the health of even the most vulnerable populations with a margin of safety. As part of the process for establishing the NAAQS, the U.S. EPA reviews and evaluates the "most policy-relevant science, including key science judgments that are important to inform the development of the risk and exposure assessments", in a process called an Integrated Science Assessment.

U.S. EPA review of the science has relied on investigations such as the Six Cities Study, which initially found that exposure to fine particulate matter was associated with premature mortality and later found that reductions in fine particulate matter concentrations with EPA enforcement were associated with a decrease in mortality. The U.S. EPA estimated in 2011 that control of particulate matter will result in 230,000 adult lives saved by 2020.

### Advancing environmental exposure assessment science to benefit society [^b7f4c648]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Improving air pollution policy at the local level

While there have been striking air quality policy successes in the past, such as the US Clean Air Act, there are limitations as to what can be achieved when relying only on traditional central-site air quality measurements that often deliver only infrequent measures of just a few select pollutants. It is now known that air pollution, and its composition, often varies dramatically over short distances and periods of time. Likewise, awareness has grown regarding the links between pollution and poverty. The geographic link between asthma and poverty in NYC is one example, as indicated in Fig. 1, showing: (a) the spatial distribution of asthma admissions rates by children aged 5–14 (per 10,000 population) across the 59 Community Districts in NYC during 2010–2014; and (b) the percent of poverty in the population in each of the same Districts in the same time period. The spatial correlation between poor health and poverty is apparent; a statistical analysis of these data also indicates a significant association between health and wealth in this case (r = 0.35, p = 0.01).

Fig. 1
NYC 2014 Community District Data for: (left) Children's Asthma Admissions per 10,000 persons; and, (right) percent poverty in the same period. Green shaded areas represent parks, airports, etc. Figure rendered using data from NY State DOH

In Fig. 1, note that the asthma admissions rates vary dramatically across New York City. This suggests that it is important to understand local patterns of pollution exposures. Unfortunately, it has been common to measure pollutant exposure levels to represent large and highly heterogeneous areas (e.g. city or county-wide). The fixed monitoring stations that are used in the U.S. mainly for regulatory purposes are often sparsely located, and elevated on buildings. New York City, for example, has 13 high-performance regulatory air monitoring stations. While this level of instrumentation has been of great value, and has resulted in positive action, differences in air quality across individual neighborhoods, and at ground-level, are not captured by such coarsely distributed and elevated air monitors.

### The effect of air pollution on inner-city children with asthma [^3a500aaa]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The effect of daily ambient air pollution was examined within a cohort of 846 asthmatic children residing in eight urban areas of the USA, using data from the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study. Daily air pollution concentrations were extracted from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System database from the Environment Protection Agency in the USA. Mixed linear models and generalized estimating equation models were used to evaluate the effects of several air pollutants (ozone, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 microm (PM10) on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and symptoms in 846 children with a history of asthma (ages 4–9 yrs). None of the pollutants were associated with evening PEFR or symptom reports. Only ozone was associated with declines in morning % PEFR (0.59% decline (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13–1.05%) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in 5-day average ozone). In single pollutant models, each pollutant was associated with an increased incidence of morning symptoms: (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16 (95% CI 1.02–1.30) per IQR increase in 4-day average ozone, OR = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03–1.70) per IQR increase in 2-day average SO2, OR = 1.48 (95% CI 1.02–2.16) per IQR increase in 6-day average NO2 and OR = 1.26 (95% CI 1.0–1.59) per IQR increase in 2-day average PM10. This longitudinal analysis supports previous time-series findings that at levels below current USA air-quality standards, summer-air pollution is significantly related to symptoms and decreased pulmonary function among children with asthma.

### Impact of weather and climate change with indoor and outdoor air quality in asthma: a work group report of the AAAAI environmental exposure and respiratory health committee [^f5891a41]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Asthma — air pollution health effects and asthma/COPD overlap (ACO) risk — Air pollution can increase the frequency of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma, increase the incidence and development of asthma, and act as an adjuvant to potentiate the development of pollen allergy. Pollutant exposures can also alter mucus production, damage the airway epithelium, impair mucociliary ciliary clearance, and trigger airway hyperreactivity, and ambient air pollution and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure has also been shown to impair regulatory T-cell function in asthmatic patients. Air pollution might also be an important risk factor affecting the progression of asthma to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is referred to as asthma/COPD overlap (ACO), with adjusted hazard ratios for cumulative exposure to PM2.5 and ozone of 2.78 (95% CI, 1.62–4.78) and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.71–2.39), respectively.

### Effects of wintertime ambient air pollutants on asthma exacerbations in urban minority children with moderate to severe disease [^8878fb21]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Urban minority children with asthma are at higher risk for severe exacerbations leading to hospitalizations and deaths. Because multiple studies have reported associations between air pollution and asthma worsening, elevated levels of air pollution are cited as a possible trigger for increased asthma morbidity in urban areas. Few studies have prospectively followed panels of urban children with asthma to determine whether air pollution levels are associated with clinically relevant outcomes such as asthma exacerbations.

Objective

To determine the association between levels of ambient air pollutants and asthma exacerbations in urban poor children with moderate to severe asthma.

Methods

A school-based panel of children with difficult-to-control disease was followed over a period of 3 consecutive winters in Denver, Colo. The panel consisted of predominantly urban African American children with moderate to severe asthma. Levels of Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants were measured on a daily basis with concurrent monitoring of lung function, bronchodilator use, symptoms, and asthma exacerbations.

Results

After controlling for time-varying factors such as upper respiratory infections and meteorologic factors, a weak association was found between ambient carbon monoxide levels and bronchodilator use. Ozone levels were associated with daytime symptoms only. No association was observed between daily air pollution concentrations and daily levels of FEV 1, peak flow, nighttime symptom scores, or asthma exacerbations over the 3-year period.

Conclusion

Ambient levels of Environmental Protection Agency criteria air pollutants in Denver do not lead to clinically significant asthma worsening in urban children with moderate to severe asthma during winter months when children are primarily indoors.

### Early-life ozone exposure and asthma and wheeze in children [^70d3aece]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, impacting 6.5% of children living in the US in 2021. Without a cure, research on causative agents is particularly important to prevent lifelong morbidity. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and other modifiable early-life environmental exposures has been associated with the development of asthma and wheeze during childhood and provides targets for preventive efforts.,

Short-term exposure to ozone (O 3), a criteria air pollutant regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, is consistently associated with acute asthma exacerbation, although the role of long-term exposure on childhood asthma and wheeze development remains unclear. Animal toxicological studies support the biological plausibility of O 3 developmental toxicity, and indicate a more pronounced effect from O 3 exposures during early life. This period coincides with immense immune and respiratory development among children, that supports a critical window for O 3 exposures during early life. The epidemiologic literature is mixed, with some linking long-term exposure to O 3 with asthma exacerbations, or diagnosed asthma, while others report null associations, or lower risk of current asthma and wheeze. The literature lacks adequate consideration of multipollutant effects and often relies on nonstandardized windows of exposure that obscure relevant periods for chronic airway disease development.

We extend the existing literature by investigating the association of O 3 exposure during the first 2 years of life with odds of current asthma and wheeze using a well-characterized and geographically diverse pooled prospective cohort with low annual ambient O 3 exposures. We additionally explore the association of O 3 in a multipollutant mixture on asthma and wheeze at age 4 to 6 years as well as examine wheezing trajectories between ages 4 to 6 years and 8 to 9 years. We hypothesized that higher exposures to ambient O 3 in both single and multipollutant models would be associated with higher odds of asthma and wheezing phenotypes across all ages.

### Early-life exposure to air pollution and childhood asthma cumulative incidence in the ECHO CREW consortium [^b733af85]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Table 3.
PM 2.5 and NO 2 by Individual Characteristics and Selected Neighborhood Characteristics a

Abbreviations: COI, Child Opportunity Index; HR, hazard ratio; NO 2, nitrogen dioxide air pollution; PM 2.5, fine particulate matter air pollution.

When we examined effect modification of air pollution averaged over the first 3 years of life by neighborhood factors (Table 3; eFigures 6 and 7 in Supplement 1), we found that for an IQR increase in PM 2.5, children who resided in areas with lower education and health and environment opportunity had higher asthma incidence in the first 4 and 11 years of life. For an IQR increase in NO 2, children who resided in areas with higher proportion of Black population and more urban areas had higher asthma incidence through the first 4 and 11 years of life. (Table 3)

In sensitivity analyses, the results were similar when we restricted analyses to those with documented wheeze symptoms during middle childhood following an asthma diagnosis by age 4 years (eFigure 8 in Supplement 1). In mixed-effect models with a random intercept for census tract in addition to cohort, the results did not change (eFigure 9 in Supplement 1). The multinomial regression results (eFigure 10 in Supplement 1) showed similar associations between PM 2.5 and NO 2 and asthma by age 4 years. The associations were weaker with asthma between ages 5 and 11, mostly for PM 2.5.

### The influence of childhood traffic-related air pollution exposure on asthma, allergy and sensitization: a systematic review and a meta-analysis of birth cohort studies [^706c6c4b]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The impact of early childhood traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure on development of asthma and allergies remains unclear. Birth cohort studies are the best available study design to answer this question, but the evidence from such studies has not been synthesized to date. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of published birth cohort studies to understand the association between early childhood TRAP exposure, and subsequent asthma, allergies and sensitization. Increased longitudinal childhood exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon was associated with increasing risk of subsequent asthma in childhood (PM2.5: OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.30 per 2 μg/m(3) and black carbon: OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.38 per 1 × 10(-5) m(-1)). Also, early childhood exposure to TRAP was associated with development of asthma across childhood up to 12 years of age. The magnitude of these associations increased with age, and the pattern was prominent for PM2.5. Increasing exposure to PM2.5 was associated with sensitization to both aero- and food allergens. There was some evidence that TRAP was associated with eczema and hay fever. In summary, exposure to TRAP was related to asthma and allergic diseases. However, the substantial variability across studies warrants long-term birth cohort studies with regular repeated follow-ups to confirm these findings.

### Childhood asthma, asthma severity indicators, and related conditions along an urban-rural gradient: a cross-sectional study [^041de8bd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Reasons for the observed patterns are difficult to explain. There is a great deal of variation in personal characteristics and environmental characteristics as well as differences in access and health systems between urban and rural settings as well as between regions. In addition to this, some previous work has showed that associations may vary depending on phenotype and specific exposures. Future work should focus on these issues as well to better disentangle these complex relationships.

We must consider limitations of our study. First, this was a cross-sectional study and comes with limitations inherent in this design including lack of temporality. However, because we were examining prevalence across regions, a cross-sectional study is an appropriate design. Second, our data was collected from proxy (parental) completed questionnaire. This can result in potential recall bias. Despite this, survey responses regarding asthma have been shown to be relatively accurate and are often the methods of choice in large epidemiological studies due to practical constraints such as cost and efficiency. A limitation of our study could be that we collected data in spring when outdoor allergens and seasonal allergies are most common which could results in asthma symptoms. Despite this, if symptoms occurred due to the season, report on the questionnaire would likely be more accurate than recall in the past 12 months during a time when seasonal exposures were low and related symptomology not present. There are a great deal of potential predictors and confounders that may explain the observed associations and investigation of these relationships goes beyond the current analysis. Future work should focus on these associations. Finally, the participation rate we experienced was moderate and somewhat higher in the rural population. Because of this, we cannot exclude the possibility that there may be response bias in our sample such as more participation from those with asthma or asthma-like symptoms. While this may inflate our levels of prevalence, we would expect that this would occur non-differentially between locations allowing our interpretation of the results comparing regions to remain valid. Also, the levels of prevalence we report herein, are similar to those reported previously from the province including one study with over 90% response rate. In addition to this, our sex distribution for this age group is similar to that for each region under study (large urban: 49%; small urban: 49%; rural: 48%). Because of the higher prevalence of asthma in males in this age group, if there was a biased sample, we would expect a higher proportion of males taking part. We do not see this, increasing our confidence in the external validity of the results.

### Air pollution contributes to asthma deaths [^db252532]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to the large population size, this study's strengths include the wide coverage of air pollution monitors in the region. The exposure assessment included daily measurements for all six pollutants at 57 government-controlled air-quality monitoring stations. The authors estimated exposures for the day of death and the control days by calculating the inverse distance weighted average of the concentrations from all of the monitoring stations within 50 km of the home address. This extensive network of air-quality monitoring stations captured air pollutant concentrations that ranged over two orders of magnitude for most pollutants over the 5-year period and a wide range of weather conditions. The authors used several cross-validation techniques and explored multiple lag days. One of the remarkable findings is that there appears to be no threshold, as the associations are linear. Multiple pollutant models also did not significantly change the associations between PM 2.5, O 3, and NO 2 exposures and asthma mortality.

A limitation of this exposure assessment technique is the buffer size. Approximately 40% of the death cases were not included in the analyses because the subjects lived more than 50 km away from an air pollution monitor. Not much information is provided about why so many of the subjects lived outside of the monitoring network. It is possible that these individuals lived in rural areas of the province, and perhaps their deaths would be less likely to be associated with air pollution. It is also possible that their air pollution exposures are representative of the cases included, and they just happened to not be near a monitoring station. The latter is probably more likely, as the study seems to include a wide range of air pollution concentrations, and a sensitivity analysis using only those monitors within 25 km of the subjects' addresses did not change the results substantially.

### Impact of weather and climate change with indoor and outdoor air quality in asthma: a work group report of the AAAAI environmental exposure and respiratory health committee [^3ae28651]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Air pollution, climate change, and clinical actions — Air pollution and climate change are closely related, with air pollutants contributing to atmospheric temperature and increasing temperatures from climate change leading to increases in natural VOC emissions, and CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels being an important driver of climate change and a major source of air pollutants. The allergy and scientific community should be knowledgeable on how atmospheric conditions affect air pollutants and aeroallergens and how such exposures can be meaningfully reduced, and should continue to adapt practices for patients as disease patterns change with weather and climate. The report notes that we can take steps to expand coordinated research monitoring of climate's effect on pollen trends, allergic sensitization, and asthma severity, and that we can also advocate for prevention measures and become involved in policy debates. A recent review suggested that dietary and/or nutritional supplements might be somewhat beneficial in helping protect against air pollution–induced respiratory damage; however, more robust evidence is needed, and a Lancet article describes current climate change trends as the "biggest global health threat of the 21st century".

### Lung health and exposure to air pollution in Malawian children (CAPS): a cross-sectional study [^7d879f53]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-communicable lung diseases are major global health priorities across the life course. Asthma is the the most common chronic disease of childhood and one of the the most common chronic diseases of adulthood, affecting around 358 million people while COPD affects 174 million people, worldwide.

Although most of the children and adults with these conditions live and die in low-income countries and middle-income countries (LMICs), the majority of the research into these conditions is done in high-income countries. Research is especially scarce in the LMICs of sub-Saharan Africa where limited studies suggest the prevalence of childhood asthma is increasing in urban settings, and that children with symptoms of asthma are likely to be severely symptomatic. In adult populations, Burden of Obstructive Lung Diseases (BOLD) studies from countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including sites in urban and rural Malawi, have found a high burden of impaired lung function — particularly low forced vital capacity (FVC) — which is concerning given the association between low FVC and mortality in other populations.

In these same sub-Saharan African populations, there is widespread reliance (by around 700 million people) on inefficiently burned solid fuels for cooking, heating and lighting. Studies in rural Malawi report exclusive biomass fuel use (wood, crop waste and charcoal) with households using traditional 'open-fire' cooking methods. The widespread exposure of children to pollutants such carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter, resulting from incomplete fuel combustion, is particularly concerning. Household air pollution has been suggested as a potential contributing factor in the development of non-communicable lung diseases in low-income countries. However, the links between household air pollution exposure, new-onset asthma in children and obstructive lung disease in adults, are unclear, with controversy over the interpretation of available data. Environmental exposures, including inhaled pollutants, during periods of lung growth and development may lead to irreversible long term deficits in adult lung function.

### Effect of traffic pollution on respiratory and allergic disease in adults: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses [^5a976b10]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that home proximity to major roads is a major determinant of the risk of asthma, COPD or allergic disease, or progression of obstructive lung disease in adults. However, because of relatively high levels of background pollution in our study area and possible misclassification of exposure, we cannot completely rule out an adverse effect, and further study is needed which incorporate life-time exposure to pollution in populations with wide variation in exposure.

### Association between air pollution and asthma admission among children in Hong Kong [^e0ca2389]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is substantial epidemiological evidence indicating a link between asthma morbidity including deterioration in lung functions, emergency department visits and hospital admission with outdoor air pollution levels. Although it was generally believed that children are more vulnerable and susceptible than adults to air pollution exposure, the PEACE project which studied children aged 6–12 years in 28 regions of Europe, did not show any effects of particle matter, black smoke, sulphur dioxide (SO 2) or nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) on lung function, respiratory symptoms and bronchodilator use. The major limitation of the PEACE study has been the short observation period and it was suggested that increasing the length of the observation period, preferably including several seasons or years might provide better opportunities to tease out the relatively small effects of air pollution from the background noise in respiratory health indicators. Hong Kong, one of the largest metropolitans in the world, is a good candidate for studying the health effects of air pollution with its dense population, detailed monitoring of air quality and hospital admissions. Since 1990s, there has been rapid decline in the air quality in Hong Kong attributed to vibrant economic activities in the region and nearby cities including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. In tune with the findings in PEACE, our previous prevalence study using International Study of Asthma and Related Allergies (ISAAC) methodology did not show a rise in prevalence of asthma in Hong Kong despite deteriorating air quality in past decades. However, there was significant increase in prevalence of severe asthma symptoms including nocturnal awakenings by wheeze and nocturnal cough. We, therefore, performed a population-based time series analysis on daily hospital admission for asthma, a proxy for severe asthma attack in children less than 18 years old, with ambient air pollutants concentrations from 10 air quality-monitoring stations over Hong Kong. The result of the study may have important implication for health care policy in the region and may provide more evidences to support or dispute the acute effect of air pollutants in children with asthma.

### Exposure to air pollution and development of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis throughout childhood and adolescence: a population-based birth cohort study [^f615a9c5]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous published analyses have focused on the effect of air pollution on asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis throughout early and middle childhood. However, the role of exposure to air pollution in the development of childhood and adolescent asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis remains unclear. We aimed to assess the longitudinal associations between exposure to air pollution and development of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis throughout childhood and adolescence.

Methods

We did a population-based birth cohort study of 14126 participants from four prospective birth cohort studies from Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands with 14–16 years of follow-up. We linked repeated questionnaire reports of asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis with annual average air pollution concentrations (nitrogen dioxide [NO2], particulate matter [PM] with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5], less than 10 μm [PM10], and between 2.5 μm and 10 μm [PMcoarse], and PM2.5 absorbance [indicator of soot]) at the participants' home addresses. We analysed longitudinal associations of air pollution exposure at participants' birth addresses and addresses at the time of follow-up with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis incidence and prevalence in cohort-specific analyses, with subsequent meta-analysis and pooled analyses.

Findings

Overall, the risk of incident asthma up to age 14–16 years increased with increasing exposure to NO2 (adjusted meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] 1.13 per 10 μg/m3 [95% CI 1.02–1.25]) and PM2.5 absorbance (1.29 per 1 unit [1.00–1.66]) at the birth address. A similar, albeit non-significant, trend was shown for PM2.5 and incident asthma (meta-analysis OR 1.25 per 5 μg/m3 [95% CI 0.94–1.66]). These associations with asthma were more consistent after age 4 years than before that age. There was no indication of an adverse effect of air pollution on rhinoconjunctivitis.

Interpretation

Exposure to air pollution early in life might contribute to the development of asthma throughout childhood and adolescence, particularly after age 4 years, when asthma can be more reliably diagnosed. Reductions in levels of air pollution could help to prevent the development of asthma in children.

Funding

The European Union.

### Early-life ozone exposure and asthma and wheeze in children [^95164684]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This analysis has several strengths. Use of a well-characterized, multisite population with geographic and socioeconomic diversity allowed robust control for confounding and enhances generalizability of results. Additionally, we used a fine-scale spatiotemporal model to estimate ambient O 3 concentrations at participant residences, reducing exposure misclassification compared with previous work relying on spatial-only measures. We additionally explored associations with standardized exposure and outcome windows defined on biologically relevant periods that offer insight on potentially vulnerable windows of exposure. Finally, this analysis contributes to the limited literature regarding ambient air pollutant mixtures on asthma and wheeze development in early childhood.

This analysis has several important limitations. While the use of spatiotemporal derived O 3 estimates is an improvement within the field, no personal or indoor measurements were available. However, assessing ambient concentrations is informative for policy and regulation of outdoor pollutants. Outcomes were derived from the widely-used ISAAC surveybut relied on caregiver report. There is the potential for unmeasured confounding from the indoor environment as well as incomplete adjustment of spatially-varying socioeconomic and ambient environmental factors that may have biased estimates.

### The effects of air pollution on the development of atopic disease [^ebf6241d]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Air pollution is defined as the presence of noxious substances in the air at levels that impose a health hazard. Thus, there has been long-standing interest in the possible role of indoor and outdoor air pollutants on the development of respiratory disease. In this regard, asthma has been of particular interest but many studies have also been conducted to explore the relationship between air pollution, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Traffic-related air pollutants or TRAP refers to a broad group of pollutants including elemental carbon, black soot, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO 2). In this review, we aim to examine the current literature regarding the impact of early childhood exposure to TRAP on the development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Although there is growing evidence suggesting significant associations, definitive conclusions cannot be made with regard to the effect of TRAP on these diseases. This conundrum may be due to a variety of factors, including different definitions used to define TRAP, case definitions under consideration, a limited number of studies, variation in study designs, and disparities between studies in consideration of confounding factors. Regardless, this review highlights the need for future studies to be conducted, particularly with birth cohorts that explore this relationship further. Such studies may assist in understanding more clearly the pathogenesis of these diseases, as well as other methods by which these diseases could be treated.

### EAACI guidelines on environmental science for allergy and asthma: the impact of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants on asthma-related outcomes and recommendations for mitigation measures [^0030de42]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

The EAACI Guidelines on the impact of short-term exposure to outdoor pollutants on asthma-related outcomes provide recommendations for prevention, patient care and mitigation in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management and for policymakers and regulators as an evidence-informed reference to help setting legally binding standards and goals for outdoor air quality at international, national and local levels. The Guideline was developed using the GRADE approach and evaluated outdoor pollutants referenced in the current Air Quality Guideline of the World Health Organization as single or mixed pollutants and outdoor pesticides. Short-term exposure to all pollutants evaluated increases the risk of asthma-related adverse outcomes, especially hospital admissions and emergency department visits (moderate certainty of evidence at specific lag days). There is limited evidence for the impact of traffic-related air pollution and outdoor pesticides exposure as well as for the interventions to reduce emissions. Due to the quality of evidence, conditional recommendations were formulated for all pollutants and for the interventions reducing outdoor air pollution. Asthma management counselled by the current EAACI guidelines can improve asthma-related outcomes but global measures for clean air are needed to achieve significant impact.

### Early-life ozone exposure and asthma and wheeze in children [^47239897]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

We emphasized exposure during a critical period of development, and asthma at ages when diagnostic certainty is greater (above 4 years) and into school age (8–9 years) when current asthma and persistent wheeze may reflect a more sustained airway disease. Among prior studies, a small number investigated this early exposure window and child asthma assessment beyond the preschool period. To et alconducted a large administrative cohort in Ontario, Canada, reporting a suggested effect of O 3 averaged between ages 0 to 3 years on asthma-related health care utilization at 5 to 9 years. After adjustment for NO 2, PM 2.5, and normalized difference vegetation index, they report a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.97–1.31) compared with an estimate of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.90–1.14) in O 3 only models. Nishimura et alconducted a case-control study among African American and Latino children recruited in urban areas across the US and Puerto Rico aged 8 to 21 years. No association was observed between daily maximum O 3 exposure averaged over ages 0 to 3 years and physician-diagnosed asthma with symptoms in the past 2 years (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84–1.13).

### Ambient air pollution and asthma onset in Taiwanese adults [^4946f884]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ambient nitrogen dioxide is associated with asthma occurrence in adults in Western countries. However, two recent large-scale studies have provided inconclusive results regarding this association. Moreover, the association remains unknown in an Asian population.

Objective

We aimed to investigate the association between ambient air pollution exposure and incident adult asthma.

Methods

From 2016 to 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey with retrospective follow-up of incident asthma cases among schoolchildren's parents from 41 schools within 1 km of air monitoring stations distributed throughout the main island of Taiwan. To estimate participants' exposure, air pollution data of air monitoring stations within 1 km of schools from where participants were sampled were inputted into the proximity model. We used mixed logistic regression models to determine the association between air pollution exposure and asthma onset within five years prior to the survey.

Results

The questionnaire was completed for a total of 11 585 participants out of 13 424 candidates (response rate, 86.3%). Among 9131 participants aged from 26 to 50 years, 101 were diagnosed with asthma within the five years prior to the survey. The prevalence of incident asthma cases was 2.2 per 1000 person-years. Those exposed to higher ambient nitrogen dioxide (odds ratio = 1.20 per interquartile [5.7 ppb] of nitrogen dioxide, 95% CI = 1.02–1.42) were more likely to develop adult-onset asthma.

Conclusion

In an Asian population, exposure to higher ambient nitrogen dioxide is associated with increased prevalence of incident asthma cases among adults aged 26–50 years.

### The urban environment and childhood asthma (URECA) birth cohort study: design, methods, and study population [^86ade4ef]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence and morbidity of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma is especially high in poor urban areas. This paper describes the study design, methods, and population of the Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA) study, which was established to investigate the immunologic causes of asthma among inner-city children.

Methods and Results

URECA is an observational prospective study that enrolled pregnant women in central urban areas of Baltimore, Boston, New York City, and St. Louis and is following their offspring from birth through age 7 years. The birth cohort consists of 560 inner-city children who have at least one parent with an allergic disease or asthma, and all families live in areas in which at least 20% of the population has incomes below the poverty line. In addition, 49 inner-city children with no parental history of allergies or asthma were enrolled. The primary hypothesis is that specific urban exposures in early life promote a unique pattern of immune development (impaired antiviral and increased Th2 responses) that increases the risk of recurrent wheezing and allergic sensitization in early childhood, and of asthma by age 7 years. To track immune development, cytokine responses of blood mononuclear cells stimulated ex vivo are measured at birth and then annually. Environmental assessments include allergen and endotoxin levels in house dust, pre- and postnatal maternal stress, and indoor air nicotine and nitrogen dioxide. Nasal mucous samples are collected from the children during respiratory illnesses and analyzed for respiratory viruses. The complex interactions between environmental exposures and immune development will be assessed with respect to recurrent wheeze at age 3 years and asthma at age 7 years.

Conclusion

The overall goal of the URECA study is to develop a better understanding of how specific urban exposures affect immune development to promote wheezing illnesses and asthma.

### Ambient air pollution exposure and incident adult asthma in a nationwide cohort of U.S. women [^19f086ca]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Limited prior data suggest an association between traffic-related air pollution and incident asthma in adults. No published studies assess the effect of long-term exposures to particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) on adult incident asthma.

Objectives

To estimate the association between ambient air pollution exposures (PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide, NO2) and development of asthma and incident respiratory symptoms.

Methods

The Sister Study is a U.S. cohort study of risk factors for breast cancer and other health outcomes (n = 50,884) in sisters of women with breast cancer (enrollment, 2003–2009). Annual average (2006) ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were estimated at participants' addresses, using a national land-use/kriging model incorporating roadway information. Outcomes at follow-up (2008–2012) included incident self-reported wheeze, chronic cough, and doctor-diagnosed asthma in women without baseline symptoms.

Measurements and Main Results

Adjusted analyses included 254 incident cases of asthma, 1,023 of wheeze, and 1,559 of chronic cough. For an interquartile range (IQR) difference (3.6 μg/m(3)) in estimated PM2.5 exposure, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.99–1.46, P = 0.063) for incident asthma and 1.14 (95% CI = 1.04–1.26, P = 0.008) for incident wheeze. For NO2, there was evidence for an association with incident wheeze (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00–1.17, P = 0.048 per IQR of 5.8 ppb). Neither pollutant was significantly associated with incident cough (PM2.5: aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88–1.03, P = 0.194; NO2: aOR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.93–1.07, P = 0.939).

Conclusions

Results suggest that PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of developing asthma and that PM2.5 and NO2 increase the risk of developing wheeze, the cardinal symptom of asthma, in adult women.

### Impact of air pollution on respiratory diseases in children with recurrent wheezing or asthma [^91d11652]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Air pollution has many negative health effects on the general population, especially children, subjects with underlying chronic disease and the elderly. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of traffic-related pollution on the exacerbation of asthma and development of respiratory infections in Italian children suffering from asthma or wheezing compared with healthy subjects and to estimate the association between incremental increases in principal pollutants and the incidence of respiratory symptoms.

Methods

This prospective study enrolled 777 children aged 2 to 18 years (375 with recurrent wheezing or asthma and 402 healthy subjects). Over 12 months, parents filled out a daily clinical diary to report information about respiratory symptoms, type of medication used and healthcare utilization. Clinical data were combined with the results obtained using an air pollution monitoring system of the five most common pollutants.

Results

Among the 329 children with recurrent wheezing or asthma and 364 healthy subjects who completed follow-up, children with recurrent wheezing or asthma reported significantly more days of fever (p = 0.005) and cough (p < 0.001), episodes of rhinitis (p = 0.04) and tracheitis (p = 0.01), asthma attacks (p < 0.001), episodes of pneumonia (p < 0.001) and hospitalizations (p = 0.02). In the wheezing/asthma cohort, living close to the street with a high traffic density was a risk factor for asthma exacerbations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–2.84), whereas living near green areas was found to be protective (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.80). An increase of 10 μg/m3 of particulates less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) increased the onset of pneumonia only in wheezing/asthmatic children (continuous rate ratio [RR] = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00–1.17 for PM10; continuous RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01–1.17 for NO2).

Conclusions

There is a significant association between traffic-related pollution and the development of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections in children born to atopic parents and in those suffering from recurrent wheezing or asthma. These findings suggest that environmental control may be crucial for respiratory health in children with underlying respiratory disease.

### Early-life ozone exposure and asthma and wheeze in children [^503311fa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Ozone (O3) is the most frequently exceeded air pollutant standard in the US. While short-term exposure is associated with acute respiratory health, the epidemiologic evidence linking postnatal O3 exposure to childhood asthma and wheeze is inconsistent and rarely evaluated as a mixture with other air pollutants.

Objectives

To determine associations between ambient O3 and subsequent asthma and wheeze outcomes both independently and in mixture with fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide in regions with low annual O3 concentrations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study consisted of a pooled, multisite analysis across 6 US cities using data from the prospective ECHO-PATHWAYS consortium (2007–2023). Included children had complete airway surveys, complete address histories from age 0 to 2 years, and a full term birth (≥ 37 weeks). Logistic regression and bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) mixture analyses were adjusted for child anthropomorphic, socioeconomic, and neighborhood factors.

Exposures

Exposure to ambient O3 in the first 2 years of life derived from a validated point-based spatiotemporal model using residential address histories.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was asthma and wheeze at ages 4 to 6 years; the secondary outcome was asthma and wheeze at ages 8 to 9 years. Outcomes were based on caregiver reports derived from a validated survey.

Results

The analytic sample of 1188 participants had a mean (SD) age of 4.5 (0.6) years at the age 4 to 6 years visit and consisted of 614 female participants (51.7%) and 663 mothers who had a bachelor's degree or higher (55.8%). The mean (SD) O3 concentration was 26.1 (2.9) parts per billion (ppb). At age 4 to 6 years, 148 children had current asthma (12.3%) and 190 had current wheeze (15.8%). The odds ratio per 2 ppb higher O3 concentration was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.02–1.68) for current asthma and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05–1.64) for current wheeze at age 4 to 6 years; null associations were observed for outcomes at age 8 to 9 years, and for sensitivity covariate adjustment. BKMR suggested that higher exposure to O3 in mixture was associated with current asthma and wheeze in early childhood.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study with relatively low ambient O3 exposure, early-life O3 was associated with asthma and wheeze outcomes at age 4 to 6 years and in mixture with other air pollutants but not at age 8 to 9 years. Regulating and reducing exposure to ambient O3 may help reduce the significant public health burden of asthma among US children.

### Global, regional, and national epidemiology of allergic diseases in children from 1990 to 2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^f0b447a4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The marked regional variations in childhood asthma prevalence reflect a complex interplay of multiple factors. In High-income North America, the elevated prevalence of childhood asthma can be attributed to several region-specific factors. First, the high degree of urbanization and industrialization has led to increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution, with studies showing that children living within 75 m of major roadways have a 29% higher risk of asthma development. Second, the widespread adoption of 'Western lifestyle' factors, including reduced outdoor activity (average of only 30 min per day compared to 2 h in many European countries), high rates of obesity (affecting 19.7% of U.S. children), and increased indoor allergen exposure due to tighter building insulation and greater time spent indoors, has created an environment conducive to asthma development. Additionally, the region's unique allergenic plant species, particularly ragweed which is more prevalent in North America than other continents, contributes to higher sensitization rates. The interaction of these environmental factors with genetic susceptibility, particularly variants in the 17q21 locus which are more common in populations of European descent, further amplifies asthma risk in this region. Conversely, the lower prevalence observed in Sub-Saharan Africa likely results from a multifaceted interaction between environmental, socioeconomic, and biological factors. Beyond the previously noted lower industrialization levels, research has identified protective effects of helminth infections, different patterns of microbial exposure, and distinct genetic factors. However, it's important to note that prevalence data in this region may be influenced by underdiagnosis due to limited healthcare access and different diagnostic practice. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that rapid urbanization in certain African regions is associated with increasing asthma rates, particularly in urban centers.

### The "envirome" and what the practitioner needs to know about it [^cfd5ceb3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review on the "envirome" focuses on pollution, microbial, and social stressor elements of the environment that may impact development or expression of allergic diseases.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed publications on the impact of environmental factors indexed in PubMed were the primary data source for this review.

Study Selections

The primary search strategy for this review employed cross-referencing asthma, atopic dermatitis, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) against pollution (ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, tobacco smoke), microbial exposures (farm exposure, microbiome, infection, antibiotic use) and psychosocial stressors, with emphasis on results in the past 5 years, with inclusion of key seminal articles or comprehensive reviews.

Results

Air pollution is a clear cause of allergic disease exacerbation, with increasing recognition that pollutant exposure increases risk of allergic disease. Microbial exposures and maternal and child stress also modulate development and expression of allergic disease. Early life exposures are especially critical periods during which all of these factors have notable impacts on allergic disease.

Conclusion

Nonallergenic environmental factors are important modulators and adjuvants for development of allergic disease, with early life exposures being especially important. Development and validation of interventions directed toward these factors during early life is a significant opportunity for primary prevention of allergic disease.

### Air pollution and inflammatory skin disease… [^9c1aaac4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that exposure to air pollution resulted in 103. 1 million lost years of healthy life in 2015, primarily due to the impact of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than
2. 5 μm on cardiovascular and respiratory disease. 1 While these impacts are well established, additional research on other health effects remains important to inform regulatory thresholds by governing bodies. The authors found that long-term exposure to air pollutants, including PM2. 5, particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 μm, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, was associated with a 34% to 121% increased risk of incident psoriasis when comparing individuals in the highest quartile of exposure with those in the the lowest quartile of exposure. Even in areas where air pollutant levels were lower than the 2005 World Health Organization global guidelines, 3 of the 4 pollutants were found to be associated with 60% to 103% increased risk of incident psoriasis for those in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile of exposures. For example, racial and ethnic minoritized populations are disproportionately exposed to PM2. 5 and other pollutants across states, urban and rural areas, and income levels.
3. Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory condition driven by T-helper 17 immune pathways triggered by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, social, and environmental factors. In the study by Wu et al, 2 the authors found an interaction with genetic risk of psoriasis: there was a 144% to 329% increased risk of incident psoriasis among those with the high genetic risk living in areas with higher air pollution levels in comparison with those with low genetic risk living in areas with lower air pollution levels.

Basic research has shown that after exposure to air pollution, AhR acts as a transcription factor and can cause an atopic dermatitis–like phenotype in mouse models. 5 A population-based study found that minor allele carriers of the AhR variant rs2066853 had an elevated risk of atopic dermatitis with exposure to air pollution. 6 Notably, topical tapinarof, an AhR agonist, has shown efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials for atopic dermatitis and is already US Food and Drug Administration–approved for the treatment of psoriasis.
