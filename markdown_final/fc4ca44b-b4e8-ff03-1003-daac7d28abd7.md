## Question

my vaginal dryness after childbirth i want a typical lubricant what do i do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting and using a typical vaginal lubricant for postpartum vaginal dryness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely causes of postpartum dryness and whether lubricants are appropriate. Then, I should verify the difference between lubricants and moisturizers and when to use each. Next, I will review lubricant types, condom compatibility, and formulation features like pH and osmolality. After that, I should check safety in breastfeeding and postpartum healing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with product examples and counseling points, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and whether lubricants are appropriate. Postpartum vaginal dryness is common and often multifactorial, with breastfeeding-associated hypoestrogenism, perineal trauma, and psychosocial contributors all playing roles; importantly, evaluation and management of postpartum sexual dysfunction follow general principles with modifications to avoid therapies contraindicated in breastfeeding, so nonhormonal lubricants are a reasonable first step while we address reversible drivers and healing status [^d473669a] [^f18e3257].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between lubricants and moisturizers because I need to ensure I'm recommending the right product for the right problem. Lubricants are used at the time of sexual activity to reduce friction and dyspareunia, whereas moisturizers are applied regularly to restore vaginal hydration and tissue integrity; guidelines consistently position lubricants and moisturizers as complementary, nonhormonal first-line options for genitourinary symptoms, with moisturizers used proactively and lubricants used as needed during sex [^e6dbcd3a] [^478243b9] [^5c9233d7].

> I will now examine lubricant types and compatibility, and I should double-check condom issues. Water-based lubricants are widely available, easy to clean, and compatible with condoms, but they can dry out and may require reapplication; silicone-based lubricants last longer, are also condom-compatible, and are less likely to cause dryness with repeated use; oil-based lubricants are not compatible with latex condoms and can increase breakage risk, so I should avoid recommending oils if condoms are used or if there is concern for barrier integrity [^5c9233d7] [^e6dbcd3a] [^706540ec].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation quality features that affect comfort and safety. The WHO-aligned guidance supports lubricants with osmolality less than 1,200 mOsm/kg and pH around 4.5–7.0 to minimize mucosal irritation; a randomized trial of five water-based lubricants showed that products meeting these criteria improved sexual function and were well tolerated, reinforcing the value of choosing formulations with appropriate osmolality and pH when possible [^e6dbcd3a] [^36c38269].

> Let me consider safety in breastfeeding and postpartum healing, and I need to ensure I don't overstep. Nonhormonal lubricants are generally considered safe during breastfeeding and postpartum, and there is no evidence that water- or silicone-based lubricants adversely affect infant feeding; however, I should still screen for open wounds, infection, or severe dyspareunia that might warrant delayed sexual activity or additional evaluation, and I should tailor recommendations to healing status and comfort [^d473669a].

> Next, I should review how to apply lubricant and integrate it with sexual activity. A practical approach is to apply a generous amount to the vulva and vaginal introitus, and to the partner's genitals or condom as needed; reapplication during longer encounters is common with water-based products, and experimenting with amount and timing can optimize comfort; I should also remind that lubricants do not treat the underlying cause, so if dryness persists beyond the early postpartum period or is severe, we should reassess for ongoing hypoestrogenism, pelvic floor dysfunction, or other contributors and consider adding a moisturizer or escalating therapy as appropriate [^5c9233d7] [^e6dbcd3a].

> But wait, what if the user is trying to conceive or using fertility-focused intercourse timing. I initially thought lubricants might impair fertility, but I should double-check that; a prospective study found lubricant use during the fertile window did not reduce fecundability, suggesting that typical water- or silicone-based lubricants are acceptable when trying to conceive, though I should still prefer products with appropriate pH and osmolality and avoid spermicidal agents if fertility is the goal [^6734b486].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise recommendation, and I will make sure each element is evidence-linked. First, confirm there are no contraindications to sexual activity or lubricant use and screen for ongoing healing or infection. Second, choose a water- or silicone-based lubricant with pH around 4.5–7.0 and osmolality less than 1,200 mOsm/kg when possible, avoiding oil-based products if condoms are used. Third, apply liberally before and during intercourse, and reapply as needed. Fourth, if dryness persists beyond the early postpartum months or is moderate to severe, add a vaginal moisturizer used several times weekly and reassess for additional causes or therapies. Fifth, if breastfeeding and symptoms persist despite optimized nonhormonal measures, consider a cautious, shared decision-making discussion about localized estrogen after lactation, recognizing that many guidelines prioritize nonhormonal options first in breastfeeding patients [^5c9233d7] [^e6dbcd3a] [^478243b9] [^d473669a].

> I should confirm concrete product examples while emphasizing that brand endorsement is not the goal. Examples of water-based lubricants that often meet WHO-aligned parameters include Good Clean Love BioNude, Slippery Stuff, and some formulations from major brands like KY or Durex; silicone-based options such as Pjur Original or Uberlube are long-lasting and condom-compatible; I need to ensure users check labels for osmolality and pH when available and avoid products with fragrances, dyes, or spermicides if they have sensitive mucosa or are trying to conceive [^e6dbcd3a] [^36c38269].

> Finally, I need to ensure counseling addresses expectations and follow-up. Lubricants provide short-term symptom relief and do not reverse underlying atrophic or hormonal changes, so persistent or severe symptoms warrant reassessment of contributing factors and consideration of moisturizers or, when appropriate, local therapies; I should also screen for postpartum mood changes, dyspareunia, and relationship factors that can compound sexual dysfunction, aligning with postpartum sexual health principles and ensuring a holistic plan [^d473669a] [^5c9233d7].

For postpartum vaginal dryness, **water-based lubricants** are the first-line choice because they are safe, effective, and compatible with condoms and sex toys [^5c9233d7] [^e6dbcd3a]. Silicone-based lubricants are a good alternative for longer-lasting lubrication, but avoid oil-based products as they can damage condoms and irritate sensitive tissues [^5c9233d7] [^706540ec]. Use lubricant liberally during sex and reapply as needed; if dryness persists, add a vaginal moisturizer 2–3 times weekly [^0d6f4a62]. If symptoms continue beyond 3–6 months or are severe, discuss options with your clinician, including low-dose vaginal estrogen if nonhormonal measures are insufficient [^bfe07b7c].

Lubricants and moisturizers — use, compatibility, and selection: Lubricants and moisturizers do not cure underlying causes of female sexual dysfunction, but they may help reduce or alleviate dyspareunia that is due to vaginal dryness. These products are classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics and may contain skin irritants; commonly used moisturizers include hyaluronic-based and polycarbophil products recommended for regular use two to three times per week. Oils are not compatible with condoms, water-based lubricants may dry out more quickly causing friction and discomfort, silicone-based lubricants do not cause dryness and are compatible with condoms, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend one product type over another, so condom compatibility and patient sensitivities and preferences should be considered.

Cervical cancer and breast cancer screening according to local and international guidelines should be encouraged.

Treatment‐induced premature ovarian insufficiency extends beyond menopausal symptoms and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Menopausal hormone therapy is often not contraindicated in many cancer survivors and is effective in treating vasomotor symptoms. Hormone therapy, however, may be contraindicated following breast cancer, especially in estrogen receptor‐positive disease and women over 50 years. Cognitive behavioral therapy, where available, offers a non‐pharmacological management strategy for menopausal symptoms and is effective in improving sleep and depressive symptoms and reducing bother due to vasomotor symptoms.

Non‐hormonal options for managing vasomotor symptoms include antidepressants and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, oxybutynin and clonidine. Vaginal lubricants are recommended to alleviate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Low‐dose vaginal estrogen may be safely offered to patients with persistent genitourinary symptoms of menopause, after robust discussion on risks and benefits.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^e6dbcd3a]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Non-hormonal interventions for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — vaginal moisturizers and lubricants — are recommended to manage vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, with product selection considering osmolality and pH. Clinicians should recommend the use of vaginal moisturizers and/or lubricants, either alone or in combination with other therapies, to improve vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia in patients with GSM. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The World Health Organization recommends lubricants have an osmolarity of less than 1,200Osm/kg and a pH between 5.0–7.0, and lubricants have both been recommended to help alleviate several symptoms of GSM; regular use has been associated with increase in pleasure and ease of orgasm. Both lubricants and moisturizers can be used in combination with hormonal therapies, and moisturizers are gel products applied regularly while lubricants are used at the time of sexual activity and can be water, silicone, or oil based. The guideline's systematic review looked at six heterogeneous trials compared with placebo or lubricant gels, and all moisturizers, including hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers, were grouped together.

### Impact of contraception on female sexual function [^3783e25b]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sexual dysfunction is common among US women of reproductive age, many of whom use contraception. Various contraceptive methods have been associated with changes in sexual function.

Methods

In this narrative review, we selected key articles based on our collective clinical experience. We summarized findings and best practice recommendations for addressing a woman's contraception and its potential relationship to sexual function.

Results

Although some hormonal contraception is associated with sexual dysfunction, studies show mixed results based on route of administration and progestin component. Interestingly, nonuse of contraception also appears to be associated with sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction. Low-dose vaginal estrogen, lubricants, and moisturizers may be used for treating vaginal dryness in the setting of hypoestrogenic states in reproductive-age women.

Conclusion

A review of current contraception is appropriate for women presenting with sexual health concerns. Sexual dysfunction chronologically associated with a contraceptive may be addressed by trial of an alternative method. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment is recommended, including sex therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, and consultation with a women's health specialist as needed.

### A randomized trial on the effectiveness and safety of 5 water-based personal lubricants [^36c38269]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A range of personal lubricants with different formulations and subsequent properties are available for relief of discomfort associated with vaginal dryness; however, there are limited clinical data to support the efficacy and safety of many commercially available lubricants.

Aim

To determine the effectiveness and safety of 5 water-based personal lubricants for the relief of intimate discomfort associated with vaginal dryness in pre- and postmenopausal women: 4 that were formulated to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for osmolality and pH and 1 preexisting lubricant of higher osmolality and pH.

Methods

An open-label, parallel-design study was performed in women aged 18 to 65 years with mild-to-moderate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 lubricants (A-E) from 3 brands (Durex, KY, Queen V). They were instructed to use their allocated lubricants during vaginal intercourse at least once a week over a 4-week period. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) measured sexual functioning after 4 weeks of use as an indicator of lubricant performance.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was change from baseline in total FSFI score after 4 weeks of product use.

Results

A total of 174 women completed the study. The primary end point-a prespecified increase in FSFI ≥ 4 points from baseline after 4 weeks of use-was met by all 5 lubricants tested. A statistically significant improvement was observed across all 6 domains of the FSFI from baseline to 4 weeks of use with all 5 lubricants (P < .0001 for lubrication and pain reduction and P < .05 for all other domains). No serious adverse events occurred in the study, and the tolerance of all 5 lubricants was good/very good.

Clinical Implications

The efficacy and safety of the tested lubricants are not compromised when formulated to meet the WHO criterion of osmolality ≤ 1200 mOsm/kg. The lubricants tested in this investigation can be used not only to relieve symptomatology of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia but also to enhance overall sexual satisfaction.

Strengths and Limitations

This study provides clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of 5 lubricants, including those formulated to meet WHO guidelines, in relieving symptoms of vaginal dryness and improving the overall sexual experience. The open-label design may have introduced bias into the study.

Conclusion

All 5 lubricants, including those formulated to be compliant with guidelines on pH and osmolality, can be considered effective and well tolerated for the relief of discomfort associated with vaginal dryness.

### A randomized trial on the safety and efficacy of sensate water-based and silicone-based personal lubricants for relief of intimate discomfort associated with vaginal dryness [^8cb7060a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Personal lubricants with different formulations and properties, including ingredients designed to enhance sensation or feeling, can be used to alleviate vaginal dryness and affect sexual function. Clinical data to support their safety and efficacy are limited.

Aim

Determine safety and efficacy of two sensate personal lubricants for relief of discomfort associated with vaginal dryness in female participants, and report the impact on sexual satisfaction in female participants and male partners.

Methods

A two-arm, parallel design study was performed in women (18–65 years) experiencing vaginal dryness. Participants were randomized to one of two sensate lubricants (water-based [tingling] or silicone-based [warming]), which had to be used during vaginal intercourse at least once a week over a 4-week period.

Outcomes

Primary outcome: change from baseline in total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score after 4 weeks of lubricant use. Secondary outcomes: change from baseline in FSFI domain scores; adverse events (AE); vulvovaginal and oral tolerance; female participant and male partner perception of lubricants; improvement in sexual intimacy (assessed using Subject Perceived Questionnaires [SPQ] and Patient Global Impression of Change).

Results

Sixty-six female participants completed the study. The primary endpoint (prespecified increase in FSFI ≥ 4 points from baseline) was achieved for both lubricants. A positive change was observed across all six FSFI domains. All AEs were mild in severity; no serious AEs were reported; the discontinuation rate was 1.5% (one female participant; warming lubricant). For both lubricants, vulvovaginal tolerance was "good/very good" and oral tolerance was generally "very good" ("acceptable" for one participant in each treatment arm). For both lubricants, most female participants and their male partners agreed that first penetration during vaginal sex was smoother, and there was an improvement in sexual intimacy.

Clinical Implications

Safety and efficacy of both lubricants containing sensate ingredients was demonstrated, giving reassurance that they can be safely recommended by healthcare professionals to relieve vaginal dryness and enhance sexual pleasure.

Strengths/Limitations

Evidence is provided for the safety and efficacy of two sensate lubricants for relieving vaginal dryness and improving sexual pleasure in healthy participants across a wide age range. The SPQ is not a clinically validated tool, and the sample of participants was not diverse, which may limit the generalizability of data.

Conclusions

The use of sensate lubricants showed significant improvement in sexual function coupled with improved satisfaction for both male and female participants. No severe or serious AE were reported during the study period.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^7a9fd90a]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The reduced estrogen levels that occur after menopause are associated with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), a chronic condition that leads to increased vaginal pH, thinning of the vaginal and lower genitourinary epithelial lining, and loss of vaginal elasticity. - Symptoms include dyspareunia, dysuria, and vaginal or vulvar dryness, itching, irritation, and burning, any of which can negatively impact sexual health and quality of life. In the large US REVIVE survey of postmenopausal women, the most commonly reported VVA symptoms were vaginal dryness (55%) and dyspareunia (44%). In addition to these vulvovaginal symptoms, lower urinary tract symptoms can also occur after menopause onset; this led to the 2014 proposal to replace VVA with the more inclusive term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). For the purposes of this article, the term VVA will be used to avoid inconsistencies in terminology as US prescribing inserts of treatments discussed herein commonly refer to vulvar and vaginal atrophy rather than GSM.

Although there is a high prevalence of VVA (over 50% of postmenopausal women report symptoms), it is typically underdiagnosed and undertreated, with only 56% of postmenopausal survey participants with vulvovaginal symptoms reporting a discussion of their problem with a healthcare provider. Although other bothersome symptoms of menopause — such as flushes, hot flashes, and night sweats — can wane over time, vulvovaginal symptoms are chronic and can intensify if untreated. Nonhormone moisturizers and lubricants can relieve mild symptoms, but have a brief window of effectiveness (< 24 h per use) and fail to reverse many atrophic signs. In the 2017 position statement from The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), it is recommended that estrogen treatment for vulvovaginal symptoms be individualized by offering the most appropriate dose, route of administration, regimen, and duration of use that results in maximal benefits with minimal risk. For example, lower-dose vaginal estrogen is recommended for vulvovaginal symptoms that fail to respond to nonhormone measures or are moderate–severe in their intensity. Using appropriately low vaginal estrogen doses is consistent with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on estrogen treatment for menopause symptoms. Topical, localized estrogen treatments via vaginal tablets, rings, or creams reduce systemic estrogen exposure.

Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH. Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated.

Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms < 2 months after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested.

Healthcare professionals should discuss issues related to sexual function, sexual activity, and sexuality with their patients while respecting professional boundaries and considering the individual's interest.

Recommendation: Individuals with neurological diseases having sexual problems should be informed about factors that can impact sexual activity and intimacy. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 32. Should Lubricants Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. no Treatment?

When suggesting the use of lubricants, it is important to consider compatibility with condoms, individual sensitivity, and the presence of possible skin irritants. There are several available products on the market, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend using one product type over another.

Recommendation: Vaginal lubricants may be considered for female individuals with neurological diseases who experience dyspareunia or vaginal dryness. The benefits and potential risks/burdens should be discussed. (Consensus‐based recommendation; Consensus: 97%).

Clinical Question 33. Should Vibrators Be Used for Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems vs. no Treatment?

Evidence on the use of vibrators for individuals with neurological disease is limited, primarily based on expert opinion without randomised controlled trials. Individuals should consult trained healthcare professionals to select suitable vibrators and consider contraindications and risks.

### Recommendations on pregnancy, childbirth and aftercare in epidermolysis bullosa: a consensus-based guideline [^1c16c0c1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

A: Preconception and antenatal management

Pregnancies have been reported in women with all EB subtypes. Fertility is not typically affected in milder forms of EB; however, comorbid medical problems in severe EB subtypes, for example nutritional compromise and low body mass index (BMI), may have an impact on ovulation.

As medical supportive care improves and patients transition into adulthood, more women are able to make decisions about starting a family. However, in severe EB subtypes complicated by mucosal fragility (e.g. RDEB, JEB and KEB), vulvovaginal involvement may result in pain during sexual intercourse and, rarely, vaginal stenosis; these factors may impact on sexual function. Use of water‐based lubricants may be helpful for women with vulvovaginal involvement. Vaginal dilators are occasionally prescribed.

R1 ↑↑ Discuss and evaluate vulvovaginal manifestations of EB, where appropriate and dependent on EB subtype, as part of routine care. For women with severe vaginal stenosis and dyspareunia, consider referral to an assisted conception unit.

A.1 Access to diagnostics, genetic counselling and prenatal testing

R2 ↑↑ Offer standard preconception care to women with EB, and provide access to genetic counselling where available. Depending on the inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant) the risk assessment for the pregnancy can be estimated and prenatal testing offered. Couples at reproductive risk of severe forms of EB may wish to pursue prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing, accounting for family preferences, religious/cultural beliefs and national regulations. Carrier screening of an unaffected and unrelated partner may be offered according to the individual situation and national regulations, after genetic counselling.

R23 ↑↑ Ensure lubrication of the speculum and/or gloves when carrying out speculum or VEs. Internal examinations should only be performed when absolutely necessary.

R24 ↓↓ Unless the baby is known to be unaffected by EB, avoid fetal scalp electrodes and fetal blood sampling.

B.4 Skincare management during labour and birth

R25 ↑↑ Offer the following skincare adaptations during labour and birth:
staff to be made aware of patient's skin fragility;
CTG may be used, but skin should be protected beneath the strap with Softban bandaging, cotton padding or a towel;,
stirrups, where used, should be well padded;
avoid prolonged pressure/immobility and back rubbing, as these may lead to blistering and wounds on the lower back, buttocks and arms;
encourage self‐positioning, mobilizing and independent movement of the patient where possible;
pad the table and ensure a smooth surface;
pad the skin beneath the blood pressure cuff;
remove the adhesive part of electrocardiogram electrodes and secure with silicone tape (see Appendix S4).

B.5 Pressure relief

R26 ↑↑ Offer pressure relief adaptations throughout labour. Frequent position changes will reduce potential pressure damage to the skin. Consider use of pressure‐relieving mattresses or pillows (e.g. Repose or international alternative); portable and inflatable options are available for the patient to bring in. To minimize perspiration, the labour room should be kept cool, particularly if the patient is lying on an occlusive surface. Air conditioning or fans may help, but can worsen dryness of the eyes.

B.6 Catheterization

R27 ↓↓ Avoid unnecessary urinary catheterization, which may damage the urethral lining of patients with severe EB subtypes. If needed, the smallest possible silicone urinary catheter should be selected. This should be well lubricated prior to insertion.

### Women's perceptions about lubricant use and vaginal wetness during sexual activities [^38452bf0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Exogenous lubricant use in the United States is common among women; however, there is little empirical research describing women's perceptions of lubricants, lubricant use, and vaginal wetness or dryness during penile-vaginal intercourse or other sexual behaviors.

Aims

To assess women's perceptions about lubricant use, women's perceptions about vaginal wetness during sexual activities, lubricant purchasing and application patterns, and the relationship of age to women's perceptions of lubricants and vaginal wetness.

Methods

Cross-sectional baseline data from an online daily diary study of 2,451 women enrolled in a study of lubricant use were analyzed.

Main Outcome Measures

Demographic items, women's lubricant purchasing patterns, lubrication use, perceptions about lubrication, and perceptions about vaginal wetness.

Results

Overall, women felt positively about lubricant and lubricant use, preferred sex to feel more wet, felt that they were more easily orgasmic when sex was more wet, and thought their partner preferred sex to feel more wet than dry. Perceptions varied by age group with women in their forties reporting more positive perceptions of lubricants than women under the age of 30.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that women generally feel positively about lubricants and lubricant use and prefer vaginal-penile intercourse to feel more wet. Such insights into women's perceptions of lubricants and lubricant use can be helpful to medical and other health professionals as well as sexual health educators, who routinely make recommendations to women about ways to incorporate products, such as lubricants, into their sexual activities.

### Efficacy and safety of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^4fa44683]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design

This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at 68 study centers in the United States between January 2016 and July 2017 (NCT02638337). After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to daily ospemifene 60 mg (Osphena, Shionogi Inc, Florham Park, NJ) or matching placebo for up to 12 weeks based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by an independent statistician before study start. Randomization was stratified by moderate or severe vaginal dryness and the presence or absence of a uterus (limited to 60% of participants without a uterus in each group), so that similar proportions of women in each category were in each treatment group. All study staff and participants were blinded throughout the study; ospemifene 60 mg and placebo tablets were identical in appearance and packaging. Women were instructed to take study drug once daily with food at approximately the same time each day. Study participants were provided with a nonhormone, water-based lubricant (K-Y Jelly, Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, England) to use as needed during sexual activity. Lubricant use was recorded by participants in a daily diary. Two weeks after the last dose of study drug, women had a follow-up visit/telephone contact to assess adverse events (AEs) and use of concomitant therapy.

The protocol was reviewed and approved by a central institutional review board, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and current Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was provided by all participants before initiating the study.

### Efficacy and safety of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^75cd7239]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common, chronic, and bothersome condition that results from declining estrogen levels during and after the menopausal transition, and is part of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Physiologic changes of VVA include the thinning and drying of the vaginal epithelium, which can result in symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, burning, and dyspareunia, all of which can have a substantial impact on quality of life and sexual health. - Of the 40% to 60% of women in the United States and international surveys who reported VVA symptoms, approximately 50% to 60% rated their symptoms as moderate to severe. The most commonly reported symptom in surveys was vaginal dryness, reported by up to 85% of women with VVA. -, The recent cross-sectional, observational, multicenter Atrophy of the vaGina in womAn in posT-menopause in ItAly study (N > 900) also found that vaginal dryness was the most frequently reported VVA symptom. Despite the significant detrimental impact of VVA symptoms, few women seek medical attention. One reason women cite for not discussing VVA symptoms with a healthcare professional is a lack of awareness about available treatment options.

Current treatment options for VVA include nonhormone, over-the-counter lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen therapies (creams, tablets, rings), vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone treatment, and systemic hormone therapy. These treatment options, however, have limitations. Concerns about incorrect dose administration, leakage, and mess of vaginal formulationsmay affect the use of creams, moisturizers, and lubricants, and some women may prefer oral treatments over vaginal therapies due to ease of use. These challenges may be reflected in the low rates of satisfaction with vaginal prescription therapies, lubricants, and moisturizers. A recent survey found that women who were most satisfied with their VVA treatment were those who took an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). In addition, concerns regarding the risks of long-term use of systemic hormone therapy may limit its use in the management of VVA, particularly in the absence of other menopausal symptoms. Moreover, many of the systemic and local therapies prescribed for VVA have not been formally evaluated for vaginal dryness.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^7046824a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonhormonal therapies for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia emphasize topical products, stating that vaginal lubricants are intended to relieve friction and dyspareunia and are applied before intercourse, while vaginal moisturizers trap moisture and provide long-term relief; prospective studies have demonstrated that vaginal moisturizers improve vaginal dryness, pH balance, and elasticity and reduce vaginal itching, irritation, and dyspareunia, and many women have found nonhormonal vaginal lubricants and moisturizers to be effective, whereas there are insufficient data to support herbal remedies or soy products for vaginal symptoms.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^9d2024d2]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

While the prevalence of postmenopausal women experiencing VVA is over 50%, only 56% of postmenopausal participants with vulvovaginal symptoms in the REVIVE survey reported a discussion of their problem with a healthcare provider, demonstrating that these symptoms are typically underdiagnosed and undertreated. The frequency of vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, flushes, and night sweats declines over time without treatment, but vulvovaginal symptoms are chronic and progressive. Nonhormonal treatments such as moisturizers and lubricants can relieve mild symptoms, but fail to reverse many atrophic signs and have a brief window of effectiveness (< 24 hours per use). The 2017 position statement from the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) recommends that estrogen for vulvovaginal symptoms be individualized, offering the most appropriate dose, regimen, duration of use, and route of administration, maximizing benefit and minimizing risk. This approach is consistent with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on estrogen treatment for menopause symptoms that recommends using appropriately low vaginal doses. Topical, localized estrogen treatments using delivery modalities such as vaginal tablets, rings, or creams reduce systemic estrogen exposure. Estradiol vaginal cream 0.01% (Estrace [Allergan USA, Inc. Irvine, CA], 0.1 mg estradiol/g) is an FDA-approved topical treatment for postmenopausal VVA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a very low-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003% estradiol; 15 μg estradiol in 0.5 g cream) compared with placebo vaginal cream (consisting of the same ingredients as above with the exception of estradiol) dosed two times per week in postmenopausal women with VVA signs and vaginal dryness.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^4aa62b5d]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — vaginal and systemic testosterone: There was insufficient evidence to support clinical recommendations of vaginal and systemic testosterone for GSM symptoms. Trials of testosterone therapy (n = 7) included fewer than 100 participants and systemic testosterone was associated with little or no improvements in dyspareunia or vulvovaginal dryness/lubrication. In two vaginal testosterone trials, Fernandes et al. showed FSFI orgasm improvements versus lubricant (3.3 vs 1.8 at 12 weeks (p < 0.001) compared to 1.1 vs 1.7 at baseline), while Davis et al. reported sexual function gains (FSFI satisfaction p = 0.043, FSDS-R p = 0.02, sexual concerns p = 0.001, sexual responsiveness p = 0.001) with no change in serum sex steroid levels. Dyspareunia results varied by follow-up length (12 or 26 weeks): a 12‑week benefit in one study was no longer significant after baseline adjustment, whereas another study showed a statistically significant improvement over 26 weeks using the PFSF 4‑point severity scale. For dryness/lubrication, vaginal testosterone improved vaginal dryness (p = 0.009) with no significant FSFI lubrication change (p = 0.12), while the testosterone arm improved from 1.6 to 3.9 (p = 0.03) versus lubricant 1.9 to 2.9 at week 12. Given these mixed findings, clinicians may choose to offer patients, in the context of SDM, vaginal testosterone, but the Panel cannot recommend this treatment due to the small number of trials.

### Prevalence of and risk factors associated with sexual health issues in primiparous women at 6 and 12 months postpartum; a longitudinal prospective cohort study (the MAMMI study) [^f18e3257]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Little has been published on the influence of breastfeeding on postpartum sexual health, with many studies choosing to focus on breastfeeding as a means of contraception or the influence of breastfeeding on resumption of sexual activity and frequency of sexual activity. In our study, breastfeeding, in association with other related factors, remained significantly present for all three of the outcomes of dyspareunia, a lack of vaginal lubrication and a loss of interest in sexual activity 6 months postpartum. This finding highlights the potential for cognitive dissonance to occur. Cognitive dissonance occurs when people experience inconsistency between cognitions or between cognitions and behaviour. In a professional or practice context that emphasises women-centred care and disclosure, and a policy context that promotes breastfeeding, there is potential for internal conflict to arise. Practitioners may struggle with the professional imperative to inform women of the impact of breastfeeding on sexual activity, dyspareunia and vaginal lubrication at the same time as fearing a decrease in women's willingness to breastfeed if impact is known. However, information regarding breastfeeding needs to take account of these findings, if care is to be 'woman-centred' as opposed to 'breast-feeding centred'. Without this information women may blame themselves for their loss of sexual interest, or struggle alone without information on the array of vaginal lubricants available to alleviate vaginal dryness.

### Sexual health after childbirth in Dutch women: prevalence, associated factors and perceived need for information: a cross-sectional study [^91664880]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual health can be described as physical, emotional, mental and social wellbeing in respect to sexuality and contributes to general wellbeing and (mental) health ‎. Life-events, physical or psychological conditions, and various medical interventions can affect sexual health. Poor sexual health affects not only women's general wellbeing and health but also the quality of their partner relationship. Moreover, sexual health problems negatively affect women's quality of life.

An Australian cross-sectional study of 489 postpartum women showed that 64.3% experienced sexual dysfunction in the first year postpartum. Among those experiencing sexual dysfunction, the most common problems included disruption of sexual desire (81.2%), orgasmic problems (53.4%), and loss of sexual arousal (52.3%) 5. A longitudinal cohort study among 832 primiparous women demonstrated that approximately half of these women had self-perceived sexual health problems at six months postpartum. In this study, the most prevalent sexual problems included loss of interest in sexual activity up to one year after giving birth (39.8%) and pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) six months postpartum (37.5%). Until now, the prevalence of sexual health problems among Dutch postpartum women has been unknown.

Studies suggest that several medical and postpartum psychosocial factors are related to the development of postpartum sexual problems. Khajehei et al. reported that primiparity and reduced sexual activity, depression and relationship dissatisfaction in the postpartum period are associated with sexual health problems. Breastfeeding is associated with vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and loss of interest in sexual activity. Third-degree tears are related to dyspareunia. The main reasons women reported for not having continued sexual intercourse were not being interested, being too tired, fearing pain, dyspareunia and decreased vaginal lubrication. Some studies report no direct link between mode of birth and perineal trauma and sexual health, however a recent systematic review reported that sexual function can be affected by mode of birth, especially assisted vaginal birth was associated with worse sexual function. More research into associated factors for postpartum sexual health problems is needed as this can offer opportunities to improve the early identification of these problems and to develop and/or optimise timely preventative interventions addressing this matter.

### Vaginal dryness: a comparison of prevalence and interventions in 11 countries [^50190ca7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is limited research comparing cross-cultural differences in women's experiences of vaginal dryness.

Aim

To examine international differences in the prevalence of vaginal dryness, the degree to which it is experienced as problematic or bothersome, the use of lubricants to alleviate it, and women's discussion of this problem with physicians.

Main Outcome Measures

Questionnaire measuring the level of vaginal dryness and degree to which it is perceived as bothersome.

Methods

The Global Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Practices was administered to 6,725 women from 11 countries: UK, Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Thailand.

Results

Prevalence of self-reported vaginal dryness varied from a minimum of 5.8% in Italy to a maximum of 19.7% in Brazil. The proportion of women with self-reported vaginal dryness who found it very bothersome varied as well (e.g., 5.6% UK, 26.4% Germany). Pain during intercourse ranged from a reported low of 3.6% in Australia to 18.6% in Brazil. Older women (50–65 years) as compared with younger women (18–34 years) reported significantly more vaginal dryness in the UK, Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Thailand (P values < 0.02). The majority of women under 50 attributed vaginal dryness to inadequate sexual arousal while women over 50 believed it was because of aging or menopause. Cross-culturally, women differed substantially in the likelihood of discussing their sexual life/concerns with a physician.

Conclusion

Women from different countries differ substantially in their experiences, concerns, and reports of vaginal dryness/sexual pain, as well as their familiarity with personal lubricants as a treatment. Researchers should assess the prevalence and degree of the bother of vaginal dryness in order to make international comparisons of the burden of this condition.

### The genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^5a8c27a4]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) refers to a collection of symptoms resulting from diminished hormonal, primarily estrogenic stimulation to the vulvovaginal or lower urinary tract and may affect up to 50% of postmenopausal women. Symptoms, which are typically progressive and unlikely to resolve spontaneously, may include, but are not limited to, vulvovaginal dryness, burning or irritation, dyspareunia, or urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria or recurrent urinary tract infection. These symptoms are typically progressive and unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Diagnosis is clinical. Telemedicine may play a role in diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and follow-up of women with GSM. Effective treatments include moisturizers and lubricants, local hormonal therapy with estrogen or dehydroepiandrosterone, and oral selective estrogen receptor agonists. Laser or radiofrequency procedures, although currently utilized, are being studied to comprehensively understand their overall effectiveness and safety. Additionally, the influence and effect of the vaginal microbiome, as well as potential of treatment via its manipulation, is being studied. We performed a literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid with search terms of vulvovaginal atrophy and GSM and reviewed major US Society Guidelines to create this narrative review of this topic. The literature suggests that healthcare providers can make a significant impact of the health and quality of life of women by being proactive about discussing and providing interventions for GSM. A systematic approach with consideration of current guidelines and attention to developing protocols for interventions should be employed.

### To lube or not to lube: experiences and perceptions of lubricant use in women with and without dyspareunia [^de5fbe4a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are few studies examining the relationship between lubricant use and sexual functioning, and no studies have examined this relationship in women with dyspareunia. Vaginal dryness is a prevalent complaint among women of all ages. There is an association between vaginal dryness and painful intercourse; therefore, women with dyspareunia represent a particularly relevant sample of women in which to investigate lubricant use.

Aim

The aim of this study was to examine differences between women with and without dyspareunia in self-reported natural lubrication and attitudes toward and use of personal lubricants.

Methods

Respondents completed an online survey including questions on demographics, gynecological/medical history, sexual functioning, and lubricant use and attitudes.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measures used were the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and questions regarding attitudes toward and use of lubricants.

Results

Controls scored higher on the lubrication subscale of the FSFI than women with dyspareunia (P < 0.001). Women with dyspareunia reported greater frequency of lubricant use during sexual activity over the last year (P < 0.01). They were also more likely to use lubricant prior to penetration (P < 0.05). The most common use for controls was to enhance sexual experiences. This was also a common answer for women with dyspareunia; however, in this group, the most common reason was to reduce/alleviate pain. Lubricants were rated as less effective among women with dyspareunia vs. controls across all reported reasons for use. Nevertheless, lubricant use was still rated as being moderately effective in alleviating pain for women with dyspareunia.

Conclusions

Women with dyspareunia have more difficulty with natural lubrication; it is consequently not surprising that they reported using lubricant more frequently than control women. Women with dyspareunia reported using lubricants more often than controls to try to prevent or alleviate pain and reported this as being a moderately effective strategy, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for some women with dyspareunia.

### Menopause, skin and common dermatosis. part 3: genital disorders [^12c9e446]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Topical nonhormonal therapy

Lubricants/moisturizers

Vaginal and vulval lubricants and moisturizers are important first‐line management options to relieve the symptoms of GSM. They help to reduce the friction and discomfort caused by the dryness and atrophy of the genital tissues. A water‐based lubricant is generally preferred with minimal excipients to reduce vulval irritation.

Hyaluronic acid

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important component of the extracellular matrix, and plays a role in the repair of the epidermis and dermis. Menopause causes a reduction of collagen and water retention of the vaginal epithelium. HA is available in various formulations, including gel, vaginal tablets, pessaries and oral tablets. It can be an option for women who do not want or have contraindications to receiving topical hormonal treatment.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^875a6a21]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Perimenopausal care — counseling, testing, and treatment: Providers should be able to offer basic guidance about what to expect during perimenopause, counsel on lifestyle changes to help mitigate symptoms, and therapeutic options, either directly or by referral, and should advise that pregnancy can still occur during perimenopause; patients wishing to avoid pregnancy should be offered contraceptive counseling. Perimenopause lasts four years on average and is often associated with irregular menses, vaginal dryness, vasomotor instability, sleep disturbances, mood changes, and other symptoms. Laboratory testing, including testing for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, is not helpful in diagnosing menopause or determining fertility and should be avoided. Lifestyle changes include smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, and using non-estrogen water- or silicone-based vaginal lubricants. Systemic hormone therapy with estrogen, with or without progestin, has been shown to be the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, as well as protecting against bone loss; any patient with a uterus who uses systemic estrogen therapy should also use progestin to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Progestin can be administered continuously or intermittently through a variety of delivery systems, including orally or via intrauterine device. Local estrogen is the most effective treatment for genitourinary symptoms of menopause, and clinicians should consider non-hormonal medical management of vasomotor symptoms with medications like paroxetine and fezolinetant for patients who prefer non-hormonal management or those ineligible for hormone therapy. Both NAMS and ACOG also offer fact sheets and other information for patients.

### Efficacy and safety of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^0a774d22]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Endometrial safety is an important consideration for products that have estrogenic effects. Endometrial thickness and histology found in this study is consistent with that noted in other studies in which ospemifene was not associated with clinically significant changes in endometrial tissue or other estrogenic effects after 12 or 52 weeks of therapy. No endometrial hyperplasia or cancer was observed in this study. Two 52-week endometrial safety studies, confirmed that ospemifene was associated with minimal endometrial stimulation, with only one case of simple hyperplasia observed, representing a rate (0.3%) substantially lower than the FDA requirement of less than 1%.

This current study has several limitations. First, the duration of the trial was relatively short, but was as per regulatory guidance for efficacy and safety studies for moderate to severe vaginal symptoms. In addition, although all endometrial changes occurred in the active group mostly at 12 weeks, two 52-week endometrial safety studies confirmed that ospemifene was associated with minimal endometrial stimulation. Another limitation is that the study's inclusion criteria were narrowly defined, suggesting that the population in this study may not be entirely representative of the general population of postmenopausal women. Most of the women in the study were white, in good health, and had a mean body mass index of 27 kg/m 2. Moreover, many women who have vaginal dryness may have other vaginal symptoms that could potentially worsen over the course of the study. Thus, studies that use MBS — an FDA recommended endpoint for clinical trials — may not adequately evaluate or address the multiple symptoms associated with VVA in postmenopausal women. In addition, MBS is a subjective, patient-reported endpoint that may be influenced by a greater placebo effect than more objective endpoints. Women were also given a nonhormone lubricant to be used as needed throughout the current study and in the previous phase 3 trials of ospemifene. - Such as-needed use of lubricant in these studies may confound the assessment of the subjective symptom of vaginal dryness with treatment. Furthermore, the placebo-treated group (essentially an as-needed, lubricant-treated group) may make it more difficult to observe a statistically significant difference when assessing vaginal dryness versus ospemifene, as demonstrated by a previously reported higher placebo effect with this endpoint (−1.1 ± 1.02). Nonetheless, statistically and clinically significant beneficial effects on the signs and symptoms of VVA were observed with ospemifene in this study.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause — moisturizers/lubricants for urinary symptoms: To the Panel's knowledge, there are no studies showing that vaginal lubricants or moisturizers improve urinary frequency, urgency, leakage, or prevent recurrent urinary tract infections; data do not support their use as preventative interventions for urinary symptoms of GSM and they should not be considered first line therapy; the Panel therefore recommends that moisturizers and lubricants should be used synergistically with hormonal therapies to treat or to prevent urinary symptoms related to GSM.

Purpose

Female cancer survivors often experience sexual dysfunction, which is a significant and increasingly recognized aspect of survivorship. This review compares guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European School of Oncology-European Society of Medical Oncology (ESO-ESMO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) for managing sexual health symptoms.

Methods

The most recent guidelines from ASCO, ESO-ESMO, NCCN, and SOGC were examined and compared. The recommendations were grouped by type of sexual dysfunction: vaginal dryness, low sex drive, pain, orgasmic dysfunction, and psychological concerns.

Results

All guidelines strongly recommend non-hormonal therapies (i.e., lubricants or moisturizers) as first-line treatments for managing vaginal dryness. If unsuccessful, there is consensus for low-dose estrogen creams, tablets, capsules, or rings as second-line treatments. Multidisciplinary care is also recommended by all, including psychosocial and relationship counselling, specialist referrals, and cognitive behavioral therapy to address psychological concerns. ASCO, NCCN, and SOGC recommend vaginal dilators, and pelvic physical therapy for relieving pain. ASCO recommends any kind of stimulation (including masturbation) to improve sexual response, while NCCN and SOGC recommend the use of sexual aids (e.g., vibrators) to enhance arousal. Although all guidelines, except ESO-ESMO, include recommendations for androgens, bupropion, flibanserin, bremelanotide, and buspirone for low sex drive, there is limited data.

Conclusion

There is consensus among guidelines on certain sexual health recommendations, with some variation. Additional research is needed on pharmacological interventions and types of counselling to strengthen their evidence.

### Diagnosis and management of vulvar skin disorders: ACOG practice bulletin, number 224 [^6eacf468]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Patient counseling for prevention and control of vulvar disorders — behavioral care instructions: Box 3 lists the following directives verbatim for patients — "Avoid vulvar irritants and allergens. Use mild soaps, but avoid use on the vulva. Cleanse the vulva with water only. Gently pat the vulva dry after bathing. Apply preservative-free, unscented or fragrance-free emollient to hold moisture in the skin and improve barrier function. Use PeriCare bottle to rinse after urination. Use 100% cotton, unscented or fragrance-free menstrual pads. Use adequate lubrication for intercourse (unscented or fragrance-free silicone-based lubricants recommended)".

### Vaginal estrogens for the treatment of dyspareunia [^c84c192d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal atrophy, which is associated with vaginal itching, burning, dryness, irritation, and pain, is estimated to affect up to 40% of postmenopausal women. Estrogens play a key role in maintaining vaginal health; women with low serum estradiol are more likely to experience vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and reduced sexual activity compared with women who have higher estradiol levels.

Aims

The purpose of this review is to assess the prevalence and impact of dyspareunia, a symptom of vaginal atrophy, on the health of postmenopausal women and to evaluate treatment options using vaginal estrogens (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved).

Methods

Relevant published literature was identified by searching Index Medicus using the PubMed online database. The search terms dyspareunia, vaginal estrogen, vaginal hormone therapy, vaginal atrophy, and atrophic vaginitis were the focus of the literature review.

Results

Current treatment guidelines for vaginal atrophy recommend the use of minimally absorbed local vaginal estrogens, along with non-hormonal lubricants or moisturizers, coupled with maintenance of sexual activity. Vaginal estrogen therapy has been shown to provide improvement in the signs and symptoms of vaginal or vulvar atrophy. Vaginal tablets, rings, and creams are indicated for the treatment of vaginal atrophy, and the FDA has recently approved a low-dose regimen of conjugated estrogens cream to treat moderate-to-severe postmenopausal dyspareunia. The use of low-dose vaginal estrogens has been shown to be effective in treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy without causing significant proliferation of the endometrial lining, and no significant differences have been seen among vaginal preparations in terms of endometrial safety.

Conclusion

Women should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of the treatment options available, and with the help of their healthcare provider, choose an intervention that is most suitable to their individual needs and circumstances.

### Simple strategies for vaginal health promotion in cancer survivors [^a58303c0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

With the population of cancer survivors nearing 12 million, an ever-increasing number of women will face vaginal health issues related to their disease and/or treatment. Abrupt menopause triggered by cancer treatment, for example, can cause intense and prolonged estrogen deprivation symptoms, including vaginal dryness and discomfort. Simple strategies to promote vaginal health are available.

Aims

To provide a comprehensive overview of vaginal health issues caused by estrogen deprivation in female cancer patients/survivors and provide recommendations to identify, treat, and promote vaginal health.

Methods

We describe a treatment algorithm, based on scientific literature and supported by clinical experience, found to be effective in treating these patients at two major cancer centers. We also provide examples of handouts for patient education on vaginal health promotion.

Main Outcome Measures

Evidence-based medicine and psychosocial literature, in addition to clinical experience at two major cancer centers.

Results

Simple, non-hormonal interventions for sexual dysfunction are often overlooked. Several studies show that education on vaginal lubricants, moisturizers, and dilator use (as needed) can decrease the morbidity of vaginal atrophy. These studies also provide support for our clinical treatment recommendations. Our goal in this article is to increase awareness of these strategies and to provide assistance to general gynecologists and oncologists caring for cancer patients and survivors.

Conclusions

Dedicating a small amount of time to educate female cancer survivors about methods to promote vaginal health can result in the reduction or elimination of vaginal discomfort. Non-hormonal vaginal health strategies often appear sufficient to remedy these issues. However, large randomized trials are needed, varying the format and components of the treatment program and exploring efficacy in various groups of female cancer survivors.

### Factors associated with developing vaginal dryness symptoms in women transitioning through menopause: a longitudinal study [^faea3c2e]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with incident self-reported vaginal dryness and the consequences of this symptom across the menopausal transition in a multiracial/ethnic cohort of community-dwelling women.

Methods

We analyzed questionnaire and biomarker data from baseline and 13 approximately annual visits over 17 years (1996–2013) from 2,435 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a prospective cohort study. We used discrete-time Cox proportional-hazards regression to identify predictors of incident vaginal dryness and to evaluate vaginal dryness as a predictor of pain during intercourse and changes in sexual intercourse frequency.

Results

The prevalence of vaginal dryness increased from 19.4% among all women at baseline (ages 42–53 years) to 34.0% at the 13th visit (ages 57–69 years). Advancing menopausal stage, surgical menopause, anxiety, and being married were positively associated with developing vaginal dryness, regardless of partnered sexual activity. For women not using hormone therapy, higher concurrent levels of endogenous estradiol were inversely associated (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.94 per 0.5 standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval: 0.91–0.98). Concurrent testosterone levels, concurrent dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and longitudinal change in any reproductive hormone were not associated with developing vaginal dryness. Both vaginal dryness and lubricant use were associated with subsequent reporting of pain during intercourse, but not with a decline in intercourse frequency.

Conclusion

In these longitudinal analyses, our data support many clinical observations about the relationship between vaginal dryness, menopause, and pain during intercourse, and suggest that reporting of vaginal dryness is not related to androgen level or sexual intercourse frequency.

### Genitourinary syndrome of menopause: a systematic review on prevalence and treatment [^67bbc746]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) consists of genitourinary tract symptoms that occur due to physical changes caused by estrogen concentrations decline after menopause. Unlike menopausal symptoms, which subside with time, GSM symptoms persist throughout a woman's life.

Objective

This article aimed to systematically review the literature to investigate the prevalence of GSM and its treatment.

Evidence Review

The search was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, CENTRAL, and EMBASE until October 2020. Eligible for the systematic review were studies and surveys conducted via questionnaires or medical interviews evaluating the existence of GSM symptoms with or without gynecological examination in postmenopausal women or women > 40years of age.

Findings

After the application of predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, 27 studies were included in the systematic review. The prevalence of GSM-related symptoms, such as vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, and dyspareunia, ranged from 13% to 87%. The use of GSM-specific treatment varied from 13% to 78%. Over-the-counter lubricants and moisturizers were the most popular therapeutic options (24.0%-85.5%), followed by low-dose vaginal estrogens (4.8%-35.0%). Vaginal health is not frequently discussed during doctor visits and awareness about the condition and the number of treatment options is low. Women are concerned about the long-term safety and side effects of hormonal treatment. The majority of women who suffer from genitourinary symptoms are dissatisfied by the treatment they have used.

Conclusions and Relevance

GSM is a highly prevalent condition among women. Nevertheless, women are frequently not aware of its cause and its treatment options. The findings of this review underline the need for education of patients and healthcare professionals regarding GSM diagnosis and treatment options.

### Patient acceptability and satisfaction with a low-dose solubilized vaginal estradiol softgel capsule, TX-004HR [^d88036d2]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) often results from a decline in circulating estrogen levels experienced at the onset of menopause. VVA is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including dyspareunia; vaginal dryness, irritation, soreness, stinging pain, and discharge; and dysuria. In 2014, the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health and The North American Menopause Society adopted genitourinary syndrome of menopause as a medically more accurate and all-encompassing term for describing VVA and its urogenitary symptoms; however, this term has yet to be adopted by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

The North American Menopause Society recommends nonhormonal lubricants and vaginal moisturizers as first-line therapies for women with symptomatic VVA and low-dose vaginal estrogens for those with moderate-to-severe VVA or who have failed to respond to lubricants and moisturizers, which do not address the underlying physiological condition. The vaginal route of administration allows for localized treatment with low-dose estrogens to relieve symptoms with little to no systemic estrogen exposure. Potential benefits of vaginal versus oral administration are avoidance of gastrointestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass effects, which allows for lower dosing and lower systemic exposure, and potentially a lower incidence of adverse effects.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^224905e9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — therapeutic options and mechanisms summarize that the range of GSM treatments has increased substantially in recent years, with traditional therapies such as vaginal estrogen, moisturizers, and lubricants joined by a broader set of therapeutic options, both hormonal and nonhormonal. Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH; vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water-, silicone-, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity, and lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone; DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells, vaginal oxytocin gel has been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies, and among SERMs, ospemifene has unique estrogen receptor agonist activity in vaginal tissue.

### Vaginal cancer, version 5.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^f4abc971]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Vaginal cancer — gynecologic survivorship care notes that treatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, RT, and/or immunotherapy, which may cause acute, short term, and long-term toxicities, and that use of immunotherapy agents in gynecologic cancers is emerging with long-term effects unknown. Following completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic diseases, monitoring cardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle. To assess the late and long-term effects, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient's history and conduct a thorough physical examination followed by necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing; all patients should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness; post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended; and patients should be referred to appropriate specialty providers as needed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^5607aae7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause — vaginal moisturizers: 5.1a For postmenopausal women with symptoms of VVA, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly. (2|⊕⊕○○) Vaginal moisturizers, when used regularly (at least twice weekly), may provide an effective nonhormonal approach to alleviating symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but studies have been small, mostly open-labeled, and limited to 12 weeks. Although helpful, these approaches are not likely as effective as vaginal ET. Vaginal moisturizers have not been shown to reduce urinary tract symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, and use of a vaginal moisturizer may not eliminate the need for a vaginal lubricant during intercourse.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^1d3e3dc3]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The NCCTG N10 C1 (Alliance) was a randomized trial showing improvement in symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone use without significantly raising serum estradiol levels. The 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline Summary recommends that patients whose symptoms do not respond to non-hormonal treatment may attempt a transient trial of vaginal DHEA or estrogen after a thorough discussion regarding risk versus benefits. Additionally, a gynecologic evaluation to assess for pelvic floor spasm and vaginal stenosis should be strongly considered. Pelvic therapists often are a great resource in assisting with biofeedback, exercise, and manual therapy. The use of vaginal laser for GSM is an area with a paucity of evidence to support benefit. While some previous single-arm cohort studies and recent systemic review suggested some improvement in vaginal symptoms, a randomized double-blind clinical trial showed no significant improvement after laser therapy Currently, there is an ongoing Alliance REVITALIZE study evaluating laser therapy for vaginal dryness and sexual dysfunction in survivors.

In summary, a multimodal approach minimizing the use of irritants, regular moisturization, using lubricants during sexual activity, utilization of resources such as pelvic floor and sexual therapists, and the judicious use of DHEA or low dose vaginal estrogen can help address this issue.

### Efficacy, tolerability, and endometrial safety of ospemifene compared with current therapies for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^dedc99d2]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is caused by hypoestrogenism during menopause. A wholly contained subgroup within GSM, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) describes the changes in appearance and physiological functions of the genital tissues that may cause vulvovaginal symptoms of GSM, including vaginal dryness, burning, irritation, and sexual symptoms such as lack of lubrication, discomfort, pain, and impaired sexual function. Vulvovaginal symptoms occur in 39% to 51% of women, with 55% to 62% of symptoms categorized as moderate or severe, the most frequent being vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (ie, pain during intercourse).

Treatment goals include symptom relief and restoration of the vaginal environment to a healthy state. Nonhormone lubricants and moisturizers provide short-term relief but do not treat nor reverse the underlying condition. Considering the pathophysiology of VVA (ie, hypoestrogenism), hormonal therapy is common, which includes local estrogen therapy (ET) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) when systemic therapy is unnecessary.

Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator or estrogen agonist/antagonist indicated for treating moderate to severe dyspareunia and/or vaginal dryness. Unlike other selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene), which have no reproducible estrogenic effects on the vagina, ospemifene binds to estrogen receptors in the vulvovaginal squamous epithelium resulting in activation of their estrogenic pathways. Ospemifene, which is approved by Health Canada, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, increases superficial cells, while decreasing parabasal cells, vaginal pH, and the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, all hallmarks of an estrogenic effect. - The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada and The North American Menopause Society guidelines recommend lubricants and moisturizers as first-line and local ET, DHEA, and ospemifene as second-line therapies. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate ospemifene for VVA due to menopause.

### Atrophic vaginitis [^48f41570]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

With the loss of estrogen that occurs with menopause, physiologic and structural changes occur within the vulvovaginal mucosa that lead to a condition commonly called atrophic vaginitis. Although mild genital changes occur in most women, 10–47% of postmenopausal women will develop one or more debilitating symptoms that include vulvovaginal dryness, dyspareunia, vulvar itching or pain, recurrent urinary tract infections, as well as abnormal vaginal discharge. Topical estrogen replacement therapies reverse these mucosal changes and are effective treatments for the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Vaginal moisturizers and lubricants also provide symptomatic relief for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, respectively.

Cervical cancer survivorship — education, sexual health, and vaginal dilator use after radiation therapy (RT) — Education of patients regarding symptoms suggestive of recurrence is recommended, and patients should also be counseled on healthy lifestyle, obesity, nutrition, exercise, sexual health, hormone replacement therapy, and potential long-term and late effects of treatment; smoking cessation and abstinence should be encouraged. Patients who have received RT for cervical cancer may experience vaginal stenosis and dryness and should receive education on important issues regarding sexual health and vaginal health, and providers should inform patients about regular vaginal intercourse and/or vaginal dilator use and on the use of vaginal moisturizers/lubricants. Anecdotal evidence suggests that vaginal dilators may be used to prevent or treat vaginal stenosis, and dilator use can start 2 to 4 weeks after RT is completed and can be performed indefinitely.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^d473669a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 213 — Pregnancy-related sexual dysfunction highlights that any type of sexual dysfunction before pregnancy is a key risk factor for postpartum difficulties, and obstetric trauma such as cesarean delivery, instrumented delivery, episiotomy, and perineal tears increases the risk of postpartum genito–pelvic pain and penetration disorder and related sexual interest and arousal difficulties. Breastfeeding can cause vaginal dryness and thus symptoms of genito–pelvic pain/penetration disorder, and obstetric factors appear to be more significant drivers of postpartum female sexual dysfunction than maternal factors like chronic disrupted sleep, role changes, relational issues, newborn health issues, psychosocial adjustment to parenthood, and body changes. Postpartum depression is associated with decreased sexual desire and sexual frequency and presents a potentially grave health risk that warrants early recognition and intervention, and intimate partner violence that can escalate during pregnancy is a serious risk and is also associated with postpartum sexual dysfunction. Evaluation and management of postpartum female sexual dysfunction are similar to nonpostpartum approaches, with modifications to avoid medical therapies that are contraindicated in a woman who is breastfeeding.

### A novel technique combining human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) and enriched platelet therapy (EPT) for the treatment of vaginal laxity: a single-arm, observational study [^0ed78488]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vaginal hyperlaxity syndrome (VHS) is a new concept related to excess looseness of the vaginal walls, and rejuvenation techniques are gaining popularity among women to correct this condition. It may develop after pregnancy and vaginal delivery, or by prior pelvic surgery, menopause, and aging. Till date, there is no conclusive definition or diagnostic criteria available for vaginal laxity. In a survey of physician members of the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA), it was revealed that vaginal laxity is under reported by 83% of 563 respondents. Nonrelaxing pelvic floor dysfunction is caused by relaxed muscles and may lead to pelvic organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. This results in pain and problems with defecation, urination, and sexual function adversely affecting quality of life. Therefore, in patients with vaginal constriction, strengthening of pelvic floor muscles is very important to improve vaginal contraction and enhance sexual function.

Surgical methods, namely vaginoplasty and perineoplasty, have been used traditionally for wound repair after childbirth. Recently, these techniques have been increasingly used for vaginal laxity and aesthetic treatment. Fibrillar collagens (collagen types I, II, and III) are the predominant matrix components that play an important role in maintenance of vaginal support by maintaining its tensile strength. Moreover, total collagen is decreased in women with pelvic organ prolapse and hence normal secretory function is not maintained. The goblet cells of vaginal mucosa are reduced, and the mucosal fold wall tends to be flat or even disappear due to aging or childbirth. This vaginal atrophy may result in thinning of the epithelium, the smoothing of mucous folds, reduced blood flow, decreased epithelial glycogen content, reduced lubrication, and dryness thereby affecting sexual life. Thus it can be confirmed from the above literature that vaginal lubrication is essential for sexual arousal, thereby facilitating intercourse. In the present study, it was found that patients complained of vaginal dryness, especially in the early 1–3 months after vaginal constriction surgery. This dryness is attributed to stress mucosal injury caused by surgery, slow recovery of submucous wound and psychological factors impacting the vaginal secretion, leading to dry discomfort. To address this issue, the present technique has been modified to include EPT after HADM implantation to preserve the vaginal mucosa so as to retain good secretion and sensitivity in the early postoperative period.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause

The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes vaginal and vulvar dryness, decreased lubrication, vaginal narrowing or shortening, and urinary symptoms. GSM is common in patients who are affected by cancer and is caused by cancer treatments and menopause. Non-hormonal moisturizers, lubricants, and low-dose local vaginal hormones are used to treat GSM. Use of a vaginal moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid three to five times per week can improve vulvovaginal tissue and sexual function. Patients should be educated about the appropriate use of vaginal lubricants, including recommendations of products with the appropriate pH of around 4.5 for vaginal products and osmolality of < 1200 mOsm/kg as recommended by the World Health Organization, as well as the differences between water and silicone-based lubricants. The use of local vaginal hormones in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is included in all the noted guidelines after a discussion of risks and benefits with the patient. Both a cohort study and a nested case-control study did not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence in patients with breast cancer on endocrine therapy who used vaginal estrogen when comparing quantity of use to non-use respectively. The Danish observational cohort study reported that while, overall, women with breast cancer who used local estrogen did not have an increased risk of cancer recurrence, the subgroup of patients on aromatase inhibitors did have an increased risk of cancer recurrence (1.39 [95% CI = 1.04–1.85), without an increase in mortality. Limitations of this study include that the doses of vaginal estrogen were not reported and may have been higher than the currently used low-dose vaginal estrogen, the study period pre-dated HER2 testing, which significantly affects the risk of recurrence, and that many patients were treated without any endocrine therapy. Another more recent retrospective study evaluated a group of 42 113 women diagnosed with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) following a breast cancer diagnosis, of which 3.9% utilized prescriptions for vaginal estrogen. The risk of recurrence was comparable between vaginal estrogen and the control group. Among the 10 584 patients with documented estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, 3.9% used vaginal estrogen, and the risk of recurrence was similar. In a very small subgroup of patients identified to have concurrent prescriptions for vaginal estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor, there was an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence; however, results were not controlled for stage, grade, or nodal status. Lastly, a recent study of 49 237 women with breast cancer with 5% of patients using vaginal estrogen therapy found no increased risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.94).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: cervical cancer, version 1.2024 [^3a96cfed]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Gynecologic survivorship — post-treatment care emphasizes that treatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy (RT), and/or immunotherapy, which may cause acute, short term, and long-term toxicities. Following completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic diseases, monitoring cardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle. To assess the late and long term effects, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient's history and conduct a thorough physical examination followed by necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing, and because most treatments will cause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed. All patients, whether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness, and post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended. Patients should be referred to appropriate specialty providers as needed, communication and coordination with all clinicians is critical, providing survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow up is also recommended, and the SGO has developed templates for survivorship care plans.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^bfe07e7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) management — For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly, and for women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone-(estrogen) dependent cancers whose GSM symptoms, including vulvovaginal atrophy, persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer whose symptomatic GSM does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop GSM symptoms that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, and for women using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). For women using vaginal estrogen therapy who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology.

Materials and Methods

This study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP guidelines and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, parts 50, 56, and 312. The protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards and all participants provided written informed consent.

Study design

This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in postmenopausal women reporting vaginal dryness due to VVA as the most bothersome symptom. Following screening and baseline assessments, participants were randomized (1:1) to estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% (15 μg estradiol; 0.5 g of cream) or placebo cream (0.5 g of cream). During the 2-week initial treatment period, estradiol and placebo creams were applied vaginally every day for 2 weeks to rapidly maximize the vaginal response. Dosages for both treatments were then reduced to two maintenance applications per week for 10 weeks. After completing the 12-week trial, those participants who had an intact uterus at baseline were provided a progestin for 14 days; the type and dose of progestin were determined at the discretion of the investigator.

### Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (annovera) [^7d81c066]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use with Vaginal Products

Water-based vaginal lubricants have no effect on the vaginal system; however, oil-based (including silicone-based) vaginal lubricants will alter the vaginal system and/or exposure to EE and SA and should not be used [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Need for Additional Contraception

Use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when:

Enzyme inducers are used with CHCs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

ANNOVERA has been out for more than 2 hours cumulative during the 21 days of continuous use or the vaginal system-free interval exceeds 7 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Postpartum females who have not yet had a period should use an additional method of contraception until ANNOVERA has been in place for 7 consecutive days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Lactation

ANNOVERA may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established. Females who are breastfeeding should not use ANNOVERA until after weaning [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Amenorrhea and Possible Symptoms of Pregnancy

Amenorrhea may occur. Consider pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea and rule out pregnancy if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Fertility Following Discontinuation of ANNOVERA

Resumption of fertility after discontinuation of ANNOVERA is expected. All women followed for return of fertility experienced a return of fertility by 6 months after discontinuing ANNOVERA [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Prevalence of and risk factors associated with sexual health issues in primiparous women at 6 and 12 months postpartum; a longitudinal prospective cohort study (the MAMMI study) [^8ba87d50]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The findings from this large prospective cohort study of nulliparous demonstrates that women experience considerable sexual health issues after pregnancy and childbirth. Dyspareunia, lack of vaginal lubrication and loss of interest in sexual activity at 6 months postpartum were all significantly associated with pre-existing dyspareunia and breastfeeding. Additionally dyspareunia was associated with 3rd degree tears, lack of vaginal lubrication was associated with being overweight, obese and dissatisfaction with body image was a risk factor for a lack of vaginal lubrication and a loss of interest in sexual activity. Preparing women and their partners for this during the antenatal period and advising on simple measures, such as use of lubrication to avoid issues, could potentially remove stress, anxiety and fears regarding intimacy after birth. Pregnancy and the frequent interactions it brings with health professionals provide an ideal opportunity to discuss pre-existing sexual health issues with women and their partners and suitable care pathways can be put in place with appropriate referrals made.

Over-the-counter vaginal lubricants have been shown to negatively affect in vitro sperm motility. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of vaginal lubricant use during procreative intercourse on natural fertility.

Methods

Women aged 30–44 years with no history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months completed a baseline questionnaire on vaginal lubricant use. Subsequently, women kept a diary to record menstrual bleeding, intercourse, and vaginal lubricant use and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. Diary data were used to determine the fertile window and delineate lubricant use during the fertile window. A proportional hazards model was used to estimate fecundability ratios with any lubricant use in the fertile window considered as a time-varying exposure.

Results

Of the 296 participants, 75 (25%) stated in their baseline questionnaire that they use vaginal lubricants while attempting to conceive. Based on daily diary data, 57% of women never used a lubricant, 29% occasionally used a lubricant, and 14% used a lubricant frequently. Women who used lubricants during the fertile window had similar fecundability to those women who did not use lubricants (fecundability ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.59–1.85) after adjusting for age, partner race, and intercourse frequency in the fertile window.

Conclusion

Lubricants are commonly used by couples during procreative intercourse. Lubricant use during procreative intercourse does not appear to reduce the probability of conceiving.

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^4e7d68ea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Nonhormonal approaches — Nonhormonal methods should be considered first-line treatment for urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Gynecologists should be familiar with different nonhormonal treatment options because trials of multiple options may be needed to find effective treatment for any individual patient. Nonhormonal treatments that have been reported to be effective in treating vulvovaginal symptoms include silicone-, polycarbophil-, and water-based lubricants; hyaluronic acid; polyacrylic acid; and vitamin E and D vaginal suppositories. There are insufficient data to indicate that one approach is superior to others.

8. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms outside the eyes and mouth, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

Topical treatments for vaginal dryness

Vaginal dryness is a common symptom in SD. One study recorded self-reported vaginal dryness in 53% compared with 28% of controls P = 0.005. Despite this there are no published studies of treatment of vaginal dryness specifically in SD.

A Cochrane review of topical oestrogens for vaginal atrophy in post-menopausal women included 30 RCTs (6235 women) and found low to moderate quality evidence of benefit vs placebo. There was no difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal preparations.

Topical oestrogen use is regarded as safe and no association was found between vaginal oestrogen use and multiple health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, cancers and hip fracture in a cohort of nearly 900 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study — a large population based cohort involving > 50 000 individuals studied over 18 years of follow-up. Topical oestrogens are not recommended for use in children or adolescents.

Non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief of vaginal dryness in normal post-menopausal women and are routinely recommended in guidelines. They are available over the counter. Two studies found vaginal HA to be as effective as vaginal estriol in post-menopausal women (not SD) for the treatment of vaginal dryness and associated symptoms of itching, burning and dyspareunia.

Recommendations

Consider advising topical non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers plus oestrogen creams/pessaries in peri- or post-menopausal women with significant vaginal dryness (2, C) (SOA 97.5%).

### Efficacy and safety of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^0a30b81a]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Results reported here are consistent with the findings from previous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with VVA. - Indeed, in previous studies ospemifene 60 mg daily statistically and clinically significantly improved vaginal physiology including increases in the percentage of superficial cells, decreases in the percentage of parabasal cells, and reductions in vaginal pH. - This study also confirms the onset of effect on these objective coprimary endpoints as 4 weeks of treatment, also as demonstrated in previous studies. - Subjective measures of the MBS of vaginal dryness and the MBS of dyspareunia were also shown here to significantly improve in the ITT and/or PP populations consistent with the previous studies. - A previous study of the MBS of vaginal dryness did not demonstrate significant improvement when ospemifene use was analyzed in women with an MBS of dryness in the ITT population. This may be due to differences in power to detect improvements in vaginal dryness with ospemifene versus placebo between that previous study, which enrolled women with an MBS of vaginal dryness or dyspareunia, and our study, in which all enrolled women had an MBS of vaginal dryness. Different statistical analyses (last observation carried forward) compared with the MMRM approach and GEE modeling of this study may also have contributed to the different ITT results between studies. In addition, a large placebo effect observed by Portman et alwith a similar magnitude of ospemifene effect as the significant improvements reported by Bachmann and Komi, may have also been confounding. Here we report significant improvements in vaginal dryness in women with a vaginal dryness MBS, even with allowing lubricant use, which was similar between the ospemifene and placebo groups.

### Efficacy and safety of ospemifene in postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness: a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^07cf3303]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

The four co-primary efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline to week 12 in the percentages of parabasal cells and superficial cells, vaginal pH, and severity of the self-reported MBS of vaginal dryness. Vaginal smears were taken from the middle third of the lateral vaginal wall and proportions of parabasal and superficial cells were determined at a central laboratory. Vaginal pH was measured by pressing a pH indicator strip against the vaginal wall. Severity of the MBS was assessed with the same patient self-assessment of VVA questionnaire used at baseline.

Among the secondary endpoints were changes in percentages of parabasal and superficial cells, vaginal pH, and severity of vaginal dryness at weeks 4 and 8. Other secondary endpoints collected at weeks 4, 8, and 12 were changes from baseline in VVA symptoms other than vaginal dryness such as vaginal and/or vulvar irritation or itching, dyspareunia, and vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse; change from baseline in maturation value (MV; MV = [S × 1] + [I × 0.5] + [P × 0], where S = percentage of superficial cells, I = percentage of intermediate cells, P = percentage of parabasal cells); and the proportion of responders (defined as those with improvements from baseline in the MV of ≥ 10 points, in vaginal pH of ≥ 0.5, and in the MBS of vaginal dryness of ≥ 1 point). Changes from baseline in the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores were also secondary endpoint collected at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The FSFI is a brief, validated, self-report instrument for assessing sexual function during the past 4 weeks, and consists of 19 questions categorized into 6 domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Overall satisfaction at each week of the study (very satisfied, moderately satisfied, equally satisfied/dissatisfied, moderately dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied) and frequency of lubricant use and sexual activity (recorded in daily electronic diaries) were also secondary endpoints.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: uterine neoplasms, version 3.2025 [^67bbef3c]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Gynecologic survivorship — treatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, RT, and/or immunotherapy, which may cause acute, short-term, and long-term toxicities. Following completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic diseases, monitoring cardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle. In order to assess the late and long-term effects, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient's history and conduct a thorough physical examination followed by necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing. As most treatments for gynecologic cancers will cause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed, and all patients, whether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness; post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended. Patients should be referred to appropriate specialty providers as needed, communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors is critical, providing survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is also recommended, and the SGO has developed templates for gynecologic cancer-specific Survivorship Care Plans to aid in summarizing history, treatments, possible side effects, and recommended follow-up.

### WISDOM survey: attitudes and behaviors of physicians toward vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) treatment in women including those with breast cancer history [^f6f6fd06]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 41.7 million women were reaching or were currently of menopausal age in 2010. Menopausal symptoms are common, affecting up to 75% of menopausal women, and can negatively impact women's quality of life, personal and intimate relationships, and productivity. Of the women afflicted with menopausal symptoms, up to 45% experience symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), such as vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and pain or bleeding with sexual activity. VVA, a component of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), can be progressive and may not resolve without treatment.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in US women with an estimated 250,000 women diagnosed in 2017. Most diagnoses of breast cancer are in postmenopausal women, with a median age of 62 years at diagnosis, and are hormone receptor-positive breast tumors. More than 60% of postmenopausal breast cancer patients report symptoms of VVA, notably vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. These VVA symptoms are often the most poorly addressed side-effects of women on adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. Aromatase inhibitors). Aromatase inhibitors, a standard treatment for many postmenopausal breast cancer patients, reduce breast cancer recurrence by inducing a profound estrogen-deficiency state prevented by the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Such a low estrogen state can lead to VVA due to a lack of estrogen in the vaginal tissues.

Vulvar and vaginal atrophy symptoms can be managed successfully with over-the-counter (OTC) products or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription therapies, such as local estrogen therapy (ET). In women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing significant VVA, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), and the International Menopause Society (IMS) recommend the short-term use of vaginal low-dose ET in those who are unresponsive to lubricants and moisturizers, a recommendation which should be made in coordination with their oncologist.

In the past decade, many international, large-scale surveys have been aimed towards understanding the attitudes of menopausal women regarding hormone therapy (HT) use,- whereas few physicians have been surveyed. - The aim of the WISDOM survey was to evaluate and compare physicians' behaviors and attitudes regarding VVA treatment in menopausal women, with a focus on women with an elevated risk or personal history of breast cancer.

### Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in female cancer patients: a focus on vaginal hormonal therapy [^69b7d93e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a condition describing the hypoestrogenic effects on the female genitals and lower urinary tract leading to symptoms such as vaginal dryness, vulvar and vaginal burning, dyspareunia and dysuria. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is experienced by over half of postmenopausal women, and is even more pervasive in women with cancer. Due to treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy, women may experience early menopause resulting in earlier and more severe symptoms. Understanding the scope of this issue in female breast and gynecologic cancer survivors and identifying treatment options for this complex patient population are paramount. Tailored patient treatments include nonhormonal therapies (vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor physical therapy, dilator therapy, counseling), systemic and local hormonal therapies. Consensus recommendations by medical societies and associated evidence are reviewed, with emphasis on safety and efficacy of local vaginal hormonal therapies, and management variations noted depending on cancer type and characteristics. With knowledge and understanding of the unmet need associated with under-recognition and under-treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, providers caring for women with cancer are in a position to improve the quality of life of their patients by providing safe and effective treatments.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^c5a5a0cb]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Assessments

Vaginal dryness severity was determined by a self-assessment 4-point scale: 0 = none (symptom is not present); 1 = mild (symptom is present but may be intermittent and does not interfere with activities/lifestyle); 2 = moderate (symptom is present and only occasionally interferes with activities/lifestyle); and 3 = severe (symptom is present and bothersome and activities/lifestyle have been modified because of it). Vaginal pH was measured via pH paper (values < 4 or > 7 were recorded as 4 or 7, respectively) at screening and Week 12; participants were asked to abstain from sexual intercourse for 48 hours before assessment. Vaginal cytology was assessed at screening and Week 12 to determine the percentage of superficial and parabasal cells. Vaginal and/or vulvar itching and dysuria were participant assessed on a 4-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe), and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity was classified as present, not present, or not applicable due to lack of sexual activity. Extent of vaginal atrophy, pallor, vaginal dryness, friability, and petechiae was determined by the investigator via visual examination using a four-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). These assessments occurred at screening and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

Safety was evaluated throughout the study, including via adverse event (AE) reporting and vital signs at each visit and at baseline and Week 12 via clinical laboratory tests and physical and gynecological examinations.

Outcomes

The coprimary outcomes of this study were change from baseline to final assessment (defined as the last available postbaseline assessment) in self-assessed severity of vaginal dryness, vaginal cytology (percentage of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells), and vaginal pH. Secondary outcomes comprised change from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 in severity of vaginal dryness, and change from baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and final assessment in severity of vaginal/vulvar itching, dysuria, dyspareunia, and the number of participants with sexual activity-related vaginal bleeding at each visit. Change from baseline to Week 12 and final assessment in vaginal atrophy, pallor, dryness, friability, and petechiae were scored and analyzed.

Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause: AUA/SUFU/AUGS Guideline — evidence certainty and interventions with or without observed benefit are as follows: the certainty of evidence for most intervention-comparison-outcome combinations was low or very low; COE was moderate or high for only a few comparisons, and the EPC concluded that vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, vaginal moisturizers, and oral ospemifene, may all improve at least some GSM symptoms, primarily vulvovaginal dryness and, to a lesser extent, dyspareunia. No treatment significantly improved vaginal discomfort/irritation or dysuria, the placebo effect was high with lubricating gel or cream placebos, and evidence does not demonstrate the efficacy of energy-based therapies (carbon dioxide [CO2] or Er:YAG laser), vaginal or systemic testosterone, vaginal oxytocin, oral raloxifene, or bazedoxifene for any GSM symptoms.

### The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^0b291bc8]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the 2013 position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component.

Methods

A Panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies as well as on other management options available or in development for GSM. A search of PubMed was conducted identifying medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The Panel revised and added recommendations on the basis of current evidence. The Panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene. Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and ospemifene are lacking. There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations.

Conclusions

Clinicians can resolve many distressing genitourinary symptoms and improve sexual health and the quality of life of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing GSM. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of treatments for the individual patient, and patient preference. Nonhormone therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. Low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA, systemic estrogen therapy, and ospemifene are effective treatments for moderate to severe GSM. When low-dose vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene is administered, a progestogen is not indicated; however, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data at present to confirm the safety of vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene in women with breast cancer; management of GSM should consider the woman's needs and the recommendations of her oncologist.

Principles of gynecologic survivorship — clinical approach and supportive care specify that all gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic disease, monitoring cardiovascular risk factors, providing recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle. To assess late and long-term effects, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient's history, conduct a thorough physical examination, and provide any necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing, and all patients, whether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Referral to appropriate specialty providers is recommended. Post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended, and local vaginal estrogen may be considered if symptomatic. For treatment-related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered. Communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors is critical, and providing cancer survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is recommended.

### Management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy: 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^49bee96c]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the previous position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms.

Conclusions

Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^141ecfd9]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Vaginal symptoms management during endocrine therapy — women should avoid potential irritants and regularly use vaginal moisturizers; options include coconut oil and hyaluronic acid products, and if these are inadequate, patients can consider vaginal estrogen or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). While one longitudinal study showed increased breast cancer recurrence risk with vaginal estrogen for women on aromatase inhibitors (AIs), most data show no impact on cancer recurrence or circulating estrogen levels. The preparation and application of vaginal estrogen can impact systemic absorption, with higher systemic absorption seen with creams, application in the upper 2/3 of the vagina, and with poorer tissue quality; the lowest systemic absorption is seen with 10 mcg estradiol tablets and estradiol vaginal rings. Estrogen deprivation-related changes in pelvic anatomy can be addressed with vaginal dilators, biofeedback, and pelvic floor physical therapy. Lubricants are used on an as-needed basis for sexual intercourse and can be water-, silicone-, or oil-based, and patients using condoms for contraception or infection prevention should confirm compatibility between their lubricant and condom material.

### Local oestrogen for vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women [^d38672b5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal atrophy is a frequent complaint of postmenopausal women; symptoms include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort and painful intercourse. Systemic treatment for these symptoms in the form of oral hormone replacement therapy is not always necessary. An alternative choice is oestrogenic preparations administered vaginally (in the form of creams, pessaries, tablets and the oestradiol-releasing ring). This is an update of a Chochrane systematic review; the original version was first published in October 2006.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations in relieving the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases and trials registers to April 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Register of trials, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, DARE, the Web of Knowledge, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of oestrogenic preparations administered intravaginally in postmenopausal women for at least 12 weeks for the treatment of symptoms resulting from vaginal atrophy or vaginitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were improvement in symptoms (participant-assessed), and the adverse event endometrial thickness. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptoms (clinician-assessed), other adverse events (breast disorders e.g. breast pain, enlargement or engorgement, total adverse events, excluding breast disorders) and adherence to treatment. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) (dichotomous outcomes) and mean differences (MDs) (continuous outcomes) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 30 RCTs (6235 women) comparing different intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations with each other and with placebo. The evidence was low to moderate quality; limitations were poor reporting of study methods and serious imprecision (effect estimates with wide confidence intervals)1. Oestrogen ring versus other regimensOther regimens included oestrogen cream, oestrogen tablets and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in improvement in symptoms (participant assessment) either between oestrogen ring and oestrogen cream (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.19, two RCTs, n = 341, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence) or between oestrogen ring and oestrogen tablets (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15, three RCTs, n = 567, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence). However, a higher proportion of women reported improvement in symptoms following treatment with oestrogen ring compared with placebo (OR 12.67, 95% CI 3.23 to 49.66, one RCT, n = 67). With respect to endometrial thickness, a higher proportion of women who received oestrogen cream showed evidence of increase in endometrial thickness compared to those who were treated with oestrogen ring (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.94, two RCTs, n = 273; I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence). This may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. 2. Oestrogen tablets versus other regimensOther regimens in this comparison included oestrogen cream, and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement in symptoms between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.01, two RCTs, n = 208, I(2) = 0% low-quality evidence). A higher proportion of women who were treated with oestrogen tablets reported improvement in symptoms compared to those who received placebo using a fixed-effect model (OR 12.47, 95% CI 9.81 to 15.84, two RCTs, n = 1638, I(2) = 83%, low-quality evidence); however, using a random-effect model did not demonstrate any evidence of a difference in the proportions of women who reported improvement between the two treatment groups (OR 5.80, 95% CI 0.88 to 38.29). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with increase in endometrial thickness between oestrogen tablets and oestrogen cream (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.60, two RCTs, n = 151, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence).3. Oestrogen cream versus other regimensOther regimens identified in this comparison included isoflavone gel and placebo. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and isoflavone gel (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.08 to 53.76, one RCT, n = 50, low-quality evidence). However, there was evidence of a difference in the proportions of women with improvement in symptoms between oestrogen cream and placebo with more women who received oestrogen cream reporting improvement in symptoms compared to those who were treated with placebo (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.88 to 8.93, two RCTs, n = 198, I(2) = 50%, low-quality evidence). None of the included studies in this comparison reported data on endometrial thickness.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between the various intravaginal oestrogenic preparations when compared with each other. However, there was low-quality evidence that intra-vaginal oestrogenic preparations improve the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. There was low-quality evidence that oestrogen cream may be associated with an increase in endometrial thickness compared to oestrogen ring; this may have been due to the higher doses of cream used. However there was no evidence of a difference in the overall body of evidence in adverse events between the various oestrogenic preparations compared with each other or with placebo.

### Association of lubricant use with women's sexual pleasure, sexual satisfaction, and genital symptoms: a prospective daily diary study [^526ee785]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although lubricant use is commonly recommended to women for solo and partnered sexual activities, little is known about women's use of lubricant or their relationship to sexual pleasure and satisfaction.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess: (i) how adult women used lubricant during partnered and solo sexual activities; (ii) relations between women's reports of sexual pleasure and satisfaction and their use of a lubricant during a particular sexual event; and (iii) to what extent lubricant use was associated with subsequent genital symptoms.

Methods

A total of 2,453 women completed a 5-week internet-based, double-blind prospective daily diary study in which they were assigned to use one of six water- or silicone-based lubricants.

Main Outcome Measures

Baseline data included demographics, contraceptive use, and sexual behavior during the 4 weeks prior to study enrollment. Daily diary data included reports of penile-vaginal sex, penile-anal sex, solo sex, lubricant use, lubricant application, ratings of sexual pleasure and satisfaction, and genital symptoms.

Results

Water-based lubricants were associated with fewer genital symptoms compared with silicone-based lubricants. In addition, the use of a water-based or silicone-based lubricant was associated with higher ratings of sexual pleasure and satisfaction for solo sex and penile-vaginal sex. Water-based lubricant use was associated with higher ratings of sexual pleasure and satisfaction for penile-anal sex as compared with no lubricant use.

Conclusion

The water- and silicone-based lubricants used in this study were associated with significantly higher reports of sexual pleasure and satisfaction and rarely associated with genital symptoms.

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^dae66415]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Nonhormonal topical treatments — Among breast cancer survivors with urogenital symptoms, a small tamoxifen trial (N = 52) found polyacrylic acid decreased sexual dysfunction from 96% to 24% versus 88.9% to 55.6% with standard lubricant; hyaluronic acid has demonstrated relief, particularly when dosed three to five times per week; a randomized trial (N = 64) reported vitamin D and E suppositories improved urogenital symptoms and lowered vaginal pH versus placebo; and in a double-blind trial of 46 survivors, applying 4% aqueous lidocaine to the introitus for 3 minutes before intercourse reduced dyspareunia 88% versus 38% with saline. Oil-based lubricants should not be used with condoms, whereas most water-based and silicone-based lubricants can be used effectively with barrier methods, and patients should review product package inserts; additional studies report a polycarbophil-based lubricant was superior to water-based for dyspareunia (N = 45) and a silicone-based lubricant provided greater symptomatic relief than water-based (N = 38).

### Swedish validation of the pelvic floor questionnaire for pregnant and postpartum women [^5c379961]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Out of six women, four commented on the answer options for question 1 in the sexual domain. They felt that the option "sometimes" was missing for the question about vaginal lubrication. To avoid changes in the scoring system, "usually" was added to the wording of the question.

Regarding question 2 in the sexual domain, a question about vaginal sensation during intercourse, women commented that option 1, "feel a lot", can also mean "feel a lot of pain", which corresponds to option 4, "feel pain". The wording was changed to "normal/pleasant", which also matches the wording in the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire.
