## Question

A patient comes to the hospital with AMI. What drugs do they need to leave on?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications patients with acute myocardial infarction should leave the hospital on. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core guideline-directed medical therapy classes that reduce recurrent events and mortality. Then, I should verify antiplatelet choices and durations based on whether the patient had PCI or is medically managed. Next, I will review dosing intensity for statins and the role of renin–angiotensin system blockade, including when to add mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism. After that, I need to check the evolving evidence and indications for beta-blockers, especially in patients with preserved LV function. Finally, I should consider special populations, contraindications, and practical adherence strategies that improve persistence and outcomes, and I will double-check any areas where practice has shifted recently, like beta-blocker duration and early discharge criteria.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: every post-AMI patient should be discharged on a combination of antiplatelet therapy, a high-intensity statin, renin–angiotensin system inhibition, and a beta-blocker when not contraindicated, because this constellation reduces recurrent MI, heart failure, and mortality. I should verify that contemporary guidelines still endorse this "core four" framework and that adherence to all components confers additive benefit, which they do, with cumulative adherence linked to substantial mortality reductions at 30–90 days and beyond [^111HwoDc] [^114Gu7KH] [^114oicdb].

> Now, antiplatelet therapy: I need to ensure dual antiplatelet therapy is prescribed when there is no excessive bleeding risk, typically aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, and I should confirm duration by strategy. For PCI-treated patients, 12 months of DAPT is standard, though I must remember that duration can be shortened to 6 months if bleeding risk is high or extended beyond 12 months if ischemic risk is high and bleeding risk is acceptable, whereas for medically managed patients, 12 months of DAPT is reasonable, and aspirin should be continued lifelong if tolerated. Wait, I initially thought to extend DAPT for everyone to 30 months, but I should correct that — extension is selective and must balance ischemic versus bleeding risk profiles rather than being universal [^111XknwM] [^116qkLd9].

> Next, statin therapy: I should confirm high-intensity statin is the default at discharge for adults ≤ 75 years unless contraindicated, because this is a performance measure and is associated with improved survival. If high-intensity is not tolerated, moderate-intensity with documented reason is acceptable, and I need to ensure we do not underdose or omit this therapy given its robust secondary prevention benefit [^113pqCxa] [^114a2Riw] [^1129wKTA].

> For renin–angiotensin system blockade, let me think about ACE inhibitors versus ARBs and dose intensity. ACE inhibitors should be started in essentially all post-AMI patients without contraindications, with ARBs as alternatives if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, and I should double-check that dose titration toward target doses confers greater benefit. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40% and either heart failure symptoms or diabetes, I need to add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as eplerenone, provided there is no advanced CKD or hyperkalemia, because this reduces mortality and MACE in EPHESUS-era evidence and contemporary guidance [^116CCaJm] [^112VRSY6] [^113a4Jyv].

> Hold on, beta-blockers are the area where I should be most cautious and evidence-aligned. Historically, beta-blockers were routine for all post-MI patients, but I need to check the contemporary signal: in the reperfusion era, routine long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with preserved LV function and no heart failure, ischemia, or arrhythmias has uncertain incremental benefit, so I should individualize. That said, ESC 2023 still supports considering routine beta-blocker initiation in ACS broadly, whereas ACC/AHA guidance reflects more uncertainty and supports use particularly when there is LV dysfunction, heart failure, ongoing ischemia, or arrhythmias. Practically, I will start a beta-blocker in most patients who are hemodynamically stable, favoring carvedilol or metoprolol succinate when LV dysfunction is present, and reassess continuation beyond one year in those with preserved LV function and no ongoing indications. I should also remember that underdosing is common, so titration matters even if the absolute mortality effect size is modest in preserved EF cohorts [^115ejtnx] [^113WN5fs] [^112EESgH] [^115qDEyt].

> I will now examine special populations and contraindications so I do not overgeneralize. In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or hyperkalemia, I should avoid mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and in those with hemodynamic instability, severe bradycardia, or decompensated heart failure, I need to delay or adjust beta-blocker initiation. In the oldest old, I should still offer guideline-directed therapy when feasible, recognizing that functional status and goals of care may modify intensity. In nursing home residents, initiation rates are often suboptimal, so I should proactively address barriers. And I need to remember that women and underrepresented minorities are less likely to receive combination evidence-based therapy, so equity checks at discharge are essential [^116CCaJm] [^1128aWrg] [^116wh6u8] [^114XpGpa].

> Next, I should review adherence and systems strategies because prescribing alone is insufficient. Medication nonadherence is common and worsens outcomes, with adherence around 60% by one year across classes, and early follow-up within 6 weeks improves adherence, so I need to ensure timely cardiology or primary care visits, patient education with written and verbal instructions, and consider longer initial prescriptions when feasible. Scalable interventions like mail plus phone outreach can improve cardiac rehabilitation completion, though medication adherence may require more intensive approaches, and I should double-check that discharge education explicitly covers purpose, dosing, side effects, and refill plans to mitigate preventable discontinuations [^113Luf1F] [^116oATaD] [^115EeeS9] [^1144Mu9W].

> But wait, what about early discharge and ensuring the medication plan is sustainable? For low-risk STEMI patients after primary PCI, early discharge at 48–72 hours can be safe when using validated tools like the Zwolle score and ensuring stability, access to medications, and reliable follow-up, so I should confirm that the discharge medication regimen is complete, affordable, and reconciled with preadmission drugs before sending patients home [^113bYSBc] [^115Rryry].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final "leave-on" package: aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor with duration tailored to PCI versus medical management and bleeding/ischemic risk, a high-intensity statin unless contraindicated, an ACE inhibitor or ARB with titration toward target doses, a beta-blocker initiated when stable and continued with reassessment if LV function is preserved and there are no ongoing ischemic or arrhythmic indications, and add eplerenone for LVEF ≤ 40% with heart failure or diabetes in the absence of CKD or hyperkalemia. I need to ensure each element is justified, contraindications screened, and a follow-up plan is in place to sustain adherence and adjust therapy over time [^111XknwM] [^116CCaJm] [^115ejtnx].

At discharge after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), patients should be on **dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor)** [^111XknwM] for 12 months unless contraindicated, a **high-intensity statin** [^113pqCxa] regardless of LDL, a **beta-blocker** [^111xoJvV] if no contraindications, and an **ACE inhibitor or ARB** [^116CCaJm] — adding an aldosterone antagonist if LVEF ≤ 40% with heart failure or diabetes [^112VRSY6]. These therapies reduce recurrent MI, stroke, and mortality [^114Gu7KH] and should be continued long term unless adverse effects occur. Duration of antiplatelet therapy may be shortened to 6 months if bleeding risk is high, and extended beyond 12 months if ischemic risk remains high and bleeding risk is low [^111XknwM].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

### Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

- **Aspirin**: 75–100 mg daily indefinitely unless contraindicated.
- **P2Y12 inhibitor**: clopidogrel 75 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for 12 months [^111XknwM].
- **Duration**: 12 months is standard; shorten to 6 months if bleeding risk is high, or extend beyond 12 months if ischemic risk is high and bleeding risk is low [^111XknwM].

---

## Statin therapy

High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) is recommended for all patients after AMI, regardless of baseline LDL [^notfound], to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality [^1129wKTA].

---

## Beta-blocker therapy

Beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol, or bisoprolol) are indicated after AMI unless contraindicated (e.g. severe bradycardia, heart block, or active bronchospasm) [^115ejtnx] to reduce recurrent MI, arrhythmias, and mortality [^111xoJvV].

---

## Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors

### ACE inhibitors or ARBs

ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be initiated in all patients after AMI unless contraindicated, with ARBs used when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated [^111q19so]. They reduce mortality, heart failure, and recurrent MI [^111q19so].

---

### Aldosterone antagonists

Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) are indicated for patients with LVEF ≤ 40% and heart failure or diabetes, provided there is no hyperkalemia or significant renal impairment [^116CCaJm] [^112VRSY6].

---

## Duration of therapy

| **Medication class** | **Duration of therapy** |
|-|-|
| Antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) | 12 months (6 months if high bleeding risk; > 12 months if high ischemic risk) |
| Statin therapy | Lifelong |
| Beta-blocker therapy | ≥ 3 years (lifelong if LV dysfunction or arrhythmias) |
| ACE inhibitor or ARB | Lifelong |
| Aldosterone antagonist | Lifelong (if indicated) |

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Tailor antiplatelet therapy duration to individual bleeding risk [^111XknwM].
- **Renal function**: Adjust RAAS inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists based on renal function and potassium levels [^116CCaJm].
- **Patient adherence**: Emphasize adherence to reduce recurrent events and mortality [^113V5KoR].

---

Patients should leave the hospital after an AMI on **DAPT, a high-intensity statin, a beta-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor or ARB**, with an aldosterone antagonist added if indicated. These therapies should be continued long term unless contraindications or adverse effects arise.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Postdischarge follow-up and systems of care coordination — transition risk and supportive interventions: Transition from the hospital to home is a critical period for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because approximately 1 in 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services during their index hospitalization are particularly at risk for readmission. Quality improvement programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative or the AMI Toolkit provide resources to assist clinicians decrease readmission rates and improve medication and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) adherence through increased provider communication and care coordination. Hospital-initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year and with a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Multicomponent integrated care (≥ 2 quality improvement strategies targeting different domains of the health care system, health care professionals, or patients) as compared with usual care has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause hospitalization, and emerging digital health interventions hold promise to improve the transition from hospital to home.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and data collection

The study is a multicenter, prospective, cohort, observational registry project with clinicaltrials. gov identifier NCT04564365. We observed the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. All study procedures were approved by the local ethics committee (approval number 2020‐607).

We enrolled patients hospitalized for AMI from five hospitals between April 2019 and April 2021. The baseline characteristics of the patients were collected through the medical record. The epidemiological data, risk factors, comorbidities, treatments, and prescribed medication information of the patients were recorded. During follow‐up, the information on patient survival status and hospitalization events was collected through telephone interviews and medical documents.

2.2 Population

Patients diagnosed with AMI from five hospitals were recruited consecutively from April 2019 to April 2021. This study initially enrolled 2218 patients with AMI. Patients with a history of HF (N = 46), AMI or reperfusion therapy (N = 107), patients with contraindications to beta‐blocker use (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, second‐degree/third‐degree atrioventricular block, and sick sinus node syndrome, N = 94), patients with symptoms of HF at discharge (N = 93), patients without information on LVEF or with LVEF < 40% (N = 217), and patients died in hospital (N = 44) were excluded from the study. In addition, 32 patients died within 6 months and 102 patients lacked information on medication prescriptions or lost interviews, all of whom were also excluded. Ultimately, 1483 patients were included. This study included two groups, the continuous beta‐blocker therapy group (N = 1001) and the discontinuous beta‐blocker therapy group (N = 356, consisting of the no‐beta‐blocker therapy group and the beta‐blocker therapy < 6 months group; Figure 1).

### Practical algorithms for pharmacologic management of the post myocardial infarction patient [^111q19so]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction ≤ 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to patients with stress cardiomyopathy, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate conventional agents (ACEis, β-blockers, aspirin, and diuretics) as otherwise indicated if hemodynamically stable.

### Temporal trends and predictors in the use of aldosterone antagonists post-acute myocardial infarction [^113a4Jyv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study explored temporal trends in the use of aldosterone antagonist therapy among eligible patients with post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and reduced ejection fraction and characteristics associated with use in clinical practice.

Background

Current guidelines recommend initiation of aldosterone antagonist therapy post-AMI for patients with an ejection fraction ≤ 40% and heart failure or diabetes before hospital discharge, in the absence of contraindications.

Methods

Data from the American Heart Association's Get with the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease national database were analyzed for 81,570 post-AMI patients from 219 hospitals between 2006 and 2009, of whom 11,255 (13.8%) were eligible for aldosterone antagonist therapy.

Results

Among eligible patients, 1,023 (9.1%) were prescribed an aldosterone antagonist at discharge. Aldosterone antagonist use varied from 0% to 40% among hospitals. Patient and hospital characteristics independently associated with prescription of aldosterone antagonists were a history of diabetes, heart failure, coronary revascularization, and larger hospital size. Those with a history of kidney dysfunction, tobacco abuse, and higher ejection fraction were less likely to be prescribed an aldosterone antagonist. From 2006 to 2009, the use of aldosterone antagonists increased from 6.0% to 13.4% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although rates of aldosterone antagonist use are increasing slightly over time, the vast majority of AMI patients eligible for treatment fail to receive it at hospital discharge. The reason for this discrepancy between guideline-based therapy and actual prescribing patterns is unclear and should be further studied.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^112KbtXM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical data strongly supported the benefits of beta-blocker therapy following a myocardial infarction (MI) for its efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, in the context of the progressive evolution of treatment strategies for MI patients, the apparent benefit of beta-blocker therapy is becoming less clear. In particular, its effectiveness in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction is currently being challenged. Consequently, contemporary guidelines are now varying in their recommendations regarding the role of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients. This review aims to summarize and compare the largest and most influential studies from the prereperfusion era to modern practice regarding different health outcomes while highlighting the need for further research to clarify beta-blocker therapy's place in contemporary post-MI management.

### Long-term compliance with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins after acute myocardial infarction [^111MiMq9]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To study initiation, dosages, and compliance with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, and statins in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify likely targets for improvement.

Methods and Results

Patients admitted with first AMI between 1995 and 2002 were identified by linking nationwide administrative registers. A total of 55 315 patients survived 30 days after discharge and were included; 58.3% received beta-blockers, 29.1% ACE-inhibitors, and 33.5% statins. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 78, 64, and 58% of survivors who had started therapy were still receiving beta-blockers, 86, 78, and 74% were receiving ACE-inhibitors, and 85, 80, and 82% were receiving statins, respectively. Increased age and female sex were associated with improved compliance. The dosages prescribed were generally 50% or less of the dosages used in clinical trials, and dosages did not increase during the observation period. Patients who did not start treatment shortly after discharge had a low probability of starting treatment later.

Conclusion

The main problem with underuse of recommended treatment after AMI is that treatment is not initiated at an appropriate dosage shortly after AMI. A focused effort in the immediate post-infarction period would appear to provide long-term benefit.

### Examining guideline-concordant care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI): the case of hospitalized post-acute and long-term care (PAC / LTC) residents [^115GHCRs]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have examined differences in care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) according to patient characteristics such as age, gender, or insurance, but little attention has been given to whether admission source is related to guideline adherence.

Objective

To investigate: (1) the use of aspirin and reperfusion in the care of post-acute/long-term care (PAC/LTC) patients who are hospitalized for AMI, and (2) 30-day mortality associated with these treatments.

Design

Secondary examination of data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) national baseline data.

Setting

A total of 4013 U.S. hospitals.

Subjects

Patients hospitalized with a confirmed AMI admitted from PAC/LTC (n = 8151) or community-dwelling (n = 120,032) settings.

Measurements

Early administration of aspirin and reperfusion via either thrombolysis or percutaneous intervention.

Results

PAC/LTC patients were less likely to receive treatment for AMI, even after adjustment for multiple variables associated with treatment choice. Differences persisted with additional econometric adjustment using seemingly-unrelated regression. Multivariable logistic regression results indicated that aspirin was related to improved 30-day survival for both PAC/LTC and community admissions (odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–0.58 for PAC/LTC, and OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.54–0.60 for community). Reperfusion was associated with higher ORs for mortality for eligible patients admitted from community setting (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13–1.35), but ideally-eligible candidates had lower ORs for mortality (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35–0.95 for PAC/LTC, and OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68–0.81 for community).

Conclusions

Patients transferred from PAC/LTC settings were less likely to receive early treatment for AMI than other patients. Future trials should inform which guidelines are applicable to PAC/LTC patients.

### Use of lipid-lowering medications at discharge in patients with acute myocardial infarction: data from the national registry of myocardial infarction 3 [^113nnr4c]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The present study aimed to assess use of lipid-lowering medication at discharge in a current national sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and to evaluate factors associated with prescribing patterns.

Methods and Results

Demographic, procedural, and discharge medication data were collected from 138 001 patients with acute myocardial infarction discharged from 1470 US hospitals participating in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 3 from July 1998 to June 1999. Lipid-lowering medications were part of the discharge regimen in 31. 7%. Among patients with prior history of CAD, revascularization, or diabetes, less than one half of the patients were discharged on treatment. In multivariate analysis, factors independently related to lipid-lowering use included history of hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR] 4.93; 95% CI 4.79 to 5.07), cardiac catheterization during hospitalization (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.34), care provided at a teaching hospital, (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.32), use of ss-blocker (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.39 to 1.48), and smoking cessation counseling (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.59). Lipid-lowering medications were given less often to patients who were older (65 to 74 versus < 55 years of age; OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.86), those with a history of hypertension (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.95), and those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.60).

Conclusions

Analysis of current practice patterns for the use of lipid-lowering medications in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction reveals that a significant proportion of high-risk patients did not receive treatment at time of discharge.

### Incidence, predictors, and prognostic impact of recurrent acute myocardial infarction in China [^113QLKyH]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study results need to be interpreted in the context of certain limitations. First, similar to other longitudinal observational studies, the study could only include patients who consented to participate. Our findings therefore may not generalise to all patients with AMI. Second, although multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for baseline mortality risk and recurrent AMI was modelled as a time-varying covariate, there might be unmeasured confounders that affect the observed association between recurrent AMI and 1-year mortality. Thus, one cannot directly infer from these analyses that the observed associations establish a causal link between recurrent AMI and mortality. Third, we did not have health information preceding the recurrent AMI event such as triggering events, adherence to secondary prevention medications which limit our understanding of the mechanisms by which these recurrent AMI events occurred. Fourth, we did not have information about the quality of care during the recurrent AMI hospitalisation which has important implications for subsequent outcome. This an important area for future study especially as our results suggest a particularly poor prognosis for recurrent AMI events in China, far greater than that observed in the West. Fifth, in the present study, we only focused on the prescription of five guideline-based medications recognised as performance measures by the AHA/ACC. Additional research is needed to assess the impact of adherence to other secondary prevention therapies such as aldosterone antagonists.

In conclusion, our analysis from the China PEACE-Prospective AMI study demonstrates that the rate of recurrent AMI within 1 year after discharge is low with more than one-third occurring within the first 30 days after discharge. Recurrent AMI is strongly associated with 1-year mortality, particularly if occurring within the first 30 days. Improvements in prescription of guideline-directed discharge therapies, care coordination and increasing surveillance especially in the 30 days post-AMI may reduce the risk of these events.

### Antiplatelet therapy for postdischarge medical management of acute coronary syndrome [^1133KfG8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Postdischarge management of patients with acute coronary syndrome is often suboptimal, despite their high risk of a subsequent event. Updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the need for aggressive modification of risk factors and treatment with antiplatelet, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering agents commenced in-hospital and continued long-term. Antiplatelet therapy involving aspirin and clopidogrel is the mainstay of secondary risk reduction. Increased adherence to medication and risk factor modification at discharge has been demonstrated with acute care quality improvement initiatives. Extension of these initiatives to postdischarge care will provide data on medication adherence post acute coronary syndrome and functional outcomes in the community setting. Successful secondary prevention of cardiovascular events requires implementation of evidence-based guidelines by physicians, and adherence to pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications by patients. Primary care physicians are well placed to influence adherence through their ongoing relationships with patients and can save lives by implementing secondary risk reduction measures after discharge.

### Ten-year trends of cardiovascular drug use after myocardial infarction among community-dwelling persons ≥ 65 years of age [^114XpGpa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Guidelines for post-myocardial infarction (MI) management emphasize treatment with statins, beta blockers (BBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Little is known about the temporal trends and racial differences in such use after discharge. This study assessed temporal trends and racial differences in the use of statins, BBs, and ACEIs or ARBs after MI discharge in community-dwelling seniors. Administrative data from pharmacy assistance programs and Medicare in 2 states (1995 to 2004) were used to identify all patients hospitalized for MI who survived ≥ 90 days after discharge. Age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and MI-specific procedures during hospitalization were assessed. The study outcomes were filled prescriptions for any statin, BB, or ACEI or ARB < 90 days after discharge. Multivariate regression was used for trend and racial difference analyses. Of 19,368 patients identified, 6,577 (34.0%) filled prescriptions for statins, 12,387 (64.0%) for BBs, and 9,934 (51.3%) for ACEIs or ARBs < 90 days after MI discharge. The use of these drugs increased from 1995 to 2004, most steeply for statins (11% to 61%), less so for BBs (47% to 80%), and least for ACEIs or ARBs (46% to 58%) (all p for trend < 0.001). Black patients were 14% and 5% less likely to receive statins and BBs, respectively (all p < 0.05). No evidence of an interaction between race and time trend was found. In conclusion, the use of cardiovascular medications after discharge from MI hospitalization in older patients may still be inadequate but has increased over time. The underuse of statins and BBs was marked in black patients and did not improve over time.

### The reliability of in-hospital diagnoses of diabetes mellitus in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction [^111cZaNC]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Key messages

In a large, multicenter US cohort, we identified two potential selective screening methods for the detection of diabetes in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction using blood glucose levels collected as part of routine clinical care.
These screening protocols required testing glycosylated hemoglobin in only 40–50% of patients with myocardial infarction and yet identified the vast majority of those with incident diabetes — an attractive strategy for clinical and economic reasons.
Since patients with both myocardial infarction and diabetes are at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and the microvascular complications of diabetes, identification of patients with diabetes during the acute hospitalization is important, so these individuals can be targeted for more intensive lifestyle and medical interventions.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is present in approximately one-third of patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI)and is associated with an increased risk of short-term and long-term mortality. Furthermore, approximately one-quarter of patients with coronary artery disease have undiagnosed DM. Recognizing these patients is important, as identification of metabolic abnormalities at the time of AMI may allow for initiation of lifestyle modification, DM education, pharmacological therapy prior to discharge or referral to endocrinologists for outpatient follow-up. In addition, the presence of DM informs clinical decision making for cardiovascular care, such as revascularization options and selection and titration of selected cardiovascular medications. Introducing care strategies at the time of discharge may have the greatest likelihood of being implemented by the patient.

### Secondary prevention medication use after myocardial infarction in U.S. nursing home residents [^1128aWrg]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Secondary prevention medications are recommended for older adults after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but little is known about whether nursing home (NH) residents receive these medications. The objective was to evaluate new use of secondary prevention medications after AMI in NH residents who were previously nonusers and to evaluate what factors were associated with use.

Design

Retrospective cohort using linked national Minimum Data Set assessments; Online Survey, Certification and Reporting records; and Medicare claims.

Setting

U.S. NHs.

Participants

National cohort of 11,192 NH residents aged 65 and older who were hospitalized for an AMI between May 2007 and March 2010, had no beta-blocker or statin use for 4 months or longer before the hospitalization, and survived 14 days or more after NH readmission.

Measurements

The outcome was the number of secondary prevention medications initiated within 30 days of NH readmission.

Results

Thirty-seven percent of residents had no secondary prevention medications initiated after AMI, 41% had 1 initiated, and 22% had 2 initiated. After covariate adjustment, fewer secondary prevention medications were used in older residents (proportional odds ratio (POR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40–0.57 for ≥ 95 vs 65–74); women (POR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80–0.96); and those with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order (POR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83–0.98), functional impairment (dependent or totally dependent vs independent to limited assistance, POR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.69–0.86), and cognitive impairment (moderate to severe vs no impairment, POR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.70–0.89).

Conclusion

More than one-third of older NH residents in the United States do not have any secondary prevention medications initiated after AMI, with fewer medications initiated in older residents; women; and those with, DNR orders, poor physical function, and cognitive impairment. A lack of evidence about the safety and effectiveness of secondary preventions medications in the NH population and unmeasured person-centered goals of care are plausible explanations for these findings.

### Medication-taking for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction: a thematic meta-synthesis of patient experiences [^112BqCMp]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To collate existing qualitative research examining patients' medication-taking experiences in secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and produce new knowledge, a systematic review and meta-synthesis of patient qualitative studies was conducted.

Method

A systematic review found nine reports suitable for inclusion. Themes found by the report authors and report characteristic data were extracted. Reports were assessed for quality. A meta-synthesis using thematic coding and constant comparison method produced higher order themes, and these were used to construct a statement organised by theme using specific examples from the included studies.

Results

All patients discussed their medication-taking in thematic categories of beliefs about medication and illness, personal ability and interpersonal factors. Themes differed between classes of medication and between patients, suggesting tailored interventions to medications and individual patients would be appropriate. Some themes overlapped with those discussed by the broader group of cardiovascular patients, but some themes were unique to this myocardial infarction patient group, again indicating that a tailored approach is appropriate for this patient group.

Conclusion

The themes of beliefs about medication and illness, personal ability and interpersonal support provide tangible starting points for addressing adherence issues. The concept of medication-taking had unique elements within the post-AMI group of patients, and between classes of medication. While these themes were grouped into more generalised higher-order constructs, there were differences between patients within the themed group, indicating that themes are useful as a guide, but individual-level patient support is appropriate.

### Suboptimal use of evidence-based medical therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction from the Korea acute myocardial infarction registry: prescription rate, predictors, and prognostic value [^116RRkfA]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Only limited data are available for the recent trend of optimal evidence-based medical therapy at discharge after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Asia. We evaluated the predictors for the use of optimal evidence-based medical therapy at discharge and the association between discharge medications and 6-month mortality after AMI.

Methods

Between November 2005 and January 2008, we evaluated the discharge medications among 9,294 post-MI survivors who did not have any documented contraindications to antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or statins in the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. Optimal evidence-based medical therapy was defined as the use of all 4 indicated medications.

Results

Of these patients, 4,684 (50.4%) received all 4 medications at discharge. The discharge prescription rates of antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, ACE-Is/ARBs, and statins were 99.0%, 72.7%, 81.5%, and 77.2%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, advanced age, lower systolic blood pressure, higher Killip class at admission, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, higher blood creatinine level, lower total cholesterol levels, and coronary artery bypass grafting during hospitalization were independently associated with less use of optimal evidence-based medical therapy. In contrast, patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention were more likely to use optimal medications. In Cox proportional hazards model, optimal evidence-based medical therapy was an independent predictor of 6-month mortality after adjusting clinical characteristics and angiographic and procedural data.

Conclusions

The optimal evidence-based medical therapy is prescribed at suboptimal rates, particularly in patients with high-risk features. New educational strategies are needed to increase the use of these secondary preventive medical therapies.

### Acute myocardial infarction [^112X6vZR]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction has traditionally been divided into ST elevation or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; however, therapies are similar between the two, and the overall management of acute myocardial infarction can be reviewed for simplicity. Acute myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite substantial improvements in prognosis over the past decade. The progress is a result of several major trends, including improvements in risk stratification, more widespread use of an invasive strategy, implementation of care delivery systems prioritising immediate revascularisation through percutaneous coronary intervention (or fibrinolysis), advances in antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, and greater use of secondary prevention strategies such as statins. This seminar discusses the important topics of the pathophysiology, epidemiological trends, and modern management of acute myocardial infarction, focusing on the recent advances in reperfusion strategies and pharmacological treatment approaches.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

### Prophylactic treatment after myocardial infarction in primary care: how far can we go? [^1148AsTH]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite best practice, it may not be achievable in some patients to reach the optimal goals of secondary prevention recommendations for various reasons, such as co-morbidity, contraindications for some drugs or side effects.

Objective

Our aim was to estimate the achievable standards for audit purposes in primary care for prophylactic treatment of secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.

Methods

We conducted a survey of consecutive patients with a hospital diagnosis of first acute myocardial infarction during 1997 who were identified from discharge books from four hospitals and interviewed at their primary health centre 2 years after admission. The achievable standard for a prophylactic drug was then defined as the proportion of patients that could benefit from the treatment excluding those that for one justified reason or another were off medication.

Results

Three hundred and sixty-nine patients were interviewed in the follow-up. Aspirin or another antiplatelet regimen was prescribed in 86.9 patients, beta-blockers in 50.2%, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in 32.5% and lipid-lowering drugs in 52%. The estimated achievable standards for those prescribed drugs were 94.5, 71,8, 50.5 and 69.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

There is an underuse of prophylactic drug therapies after myocardial infarction. The standards established in this study for secondary preventive drug treatment might be achieved through a reasonable effort by GPs working in primary care committed to improving the quality of care.

### Interventions supporting long term adherence and decreasing cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction (ISLAND): pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^115EeeS9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test a scalable health system intervention to improve long term adherence to secondary prevention treatments among patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction.

Design

Three arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment.

Setting

Nine cardiac centres in Ontario, Canada.

Participants

2632 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease after a myocardial infarction, identified from a centralised cardiac registry.

Interventions

Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive usual care, five mail-outs developed through a user centred design process, or mail-outs plus phone calls. The phone calls were delivered first by an interactive automated system to screen for non-adherence to treatment. Trained lay health workers followed up as necessary. Interventions were coordinated centrally but delivered from each patient's hospital site.

Main Outcome Measures

Co-primary outcomes were completion of cardiac rehabilitation and adherence to recommended medication. Data were collected by blinded assessors through patient report and from administrative health databases at 12 months.

Results

2632 patients (mean age 66, 71% male) were randomised: 878 to the full intervention (mail plus phone calls), 878 to mail only, and 876 to usual care. Of the respondents, 174 (27%) of 643 in the usual care group, 200 (32%) of 628 in the mail only group, and 196 (37%) of 531 allocated to the full intervention completed cardiac rehabilitation (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.03). In the mail plus phone group, 11.7%, 6.0%, 14.4%, 32.9%, and 35.0% reported adherence to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 drug classes after one year, respectively, in comparison with 12.5%, 6.8%, 13.6%, 30.2%, and 36.8% in the mail only group, and 12.2%, 8.4%, 13.1%, 30.3%, and 36.1% in the usual care group, respectively (mail only v usual care, odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.19; full intervention v usual care, 0.99, 0.82 to 1.20).

Conclusions

Scalable interventions delivered by mail plus phone can increase completion of cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction but not adherence to medication. More intensive interventions should be tested to improve adherence to medication and to evaluate the association between attendance at cardiac rehabilitation and adherence to medication.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02382731, registered 9 March 2015 before any patient enrolment.

### Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs after acute myocardial infarction [^112h3won]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Many older patients undergo therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), medications that produce effects on platelets and inflammation similar to those produced with aspirin. The impact of these agents on mortality after acute myocardial infarction is not known. We sought to determine whether the use of NSAIDs alone, or in addition to aspirin, is associated with a lower 1-year mortality rate in elderly patients after acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

We performed an analysis of the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, a retrospective medical record review that included demographic and clinical information for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction during 1994 and 1995. The cohort included 48,584 elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction without contraindications to NSAID or aspirin therapy. There were 736 patients (1.5%) who were prescribed NSAIDs alone, 36,211 (74.5%) prescribed aspirin alone, 2096 (4.3%) prescribed both NSAIDs and aspirin, and 9541 (19.6%) prescribed neither medication at discharge.

Results

Compared with patients discharged with neither medication, prescriptions of NSAID therapy alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.90), aspirin alone (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77–0.86), and both medications (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69–0.88) were associated with lower adjusted 1-year mortality rates. Compared with patients prescribed NSAID therapy at discharge, there was no significant benefit associated with the addition of aspirin, and the benefit of NSAID therapy was not significantly different from that of aspirin alone.

Conclusion

The prescription of NSAID therapy at hospital discharge for elderly Medicare beneficiaries who survived acute myocardial infarction was associated with similarly lower 1-year mortality rates as compared with aspirin therapy. The addition of aspirin to NSAID therapy was not associated with an additional survival benefit.

### Use of aldosterone antagonists at discharge after myocardial infarction: results from the national cardiovascular data registry acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network (ACTION) registry-get with the guidelines (GWTG) [^112VRSY6]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Aldosterone antagonists (AldA) improve survival after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] < 40%) concomitant with either clinical heart failure (HF) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Although current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines provide a class I recommendation for AldA therapy in such patients, how US practice reflects these recommendations is unclear.

Methods

Using data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ACTION Registry-GWTG, we describe contemporary discharge AldA prescription patterns among 202,213 patients discharged after acute MI from 526 US sites participating in ACTION Registry-GWTG between January 2007 and March 2011.

Results

Overall, 10.0% of patients were eligible for AldA without documented contraindication, with only 14.5% of eligible patients receiving AldA at discharge. Among the subset of AldA-eligible patients discharged on otherwise optimal medical therapy (68.9%), AldAs were prescribed to 16.1%. Aldosterone antagonist use was higher in patients with EF < 40% and clinical HF with or without DM (17.7% and 16.6%, respectively), compared with patients with EF < 40% and DM without clinical HF (7.8%, P < .001 for each). Fewer than 2% of participating centers used AldA in ≥ 50% of eligible patients.

Conclusions

Despite clinical outcome evidence and class I guideline recommendations, AldAs are underused in the United States, with only 1 in 7 eligible patients prescribed AldA at discharge after MI. This contrasts with high use of other evidence-based post-MI medications and identifies a specific gap in translation of evidence into clinical practice.

### Association of sociodemographic factors and comorbidity with non-receipt of medications for secondary prevention: a cohort study of 12, 204 myocardial infarction survivors [^115R5dik]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Following myocardial infarction (MI), patients have a high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and death. Secondary prevention in these patients requires multiple components, including the use of medications. Clinical guidelines recommend antiplatelet, beta blocker (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), and lipid-lowering medications following MI, unless contraindicated, as they have been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in clinical trials. Nonetheless, the proportion of people receiving secondary prevention medication, as recommended by guidelines, has been found to be low, irrespective of drug class. In a previous study, following treatment guidelines was associated with lower 1-year mortality following acute coronary syndromes (ACS), but was only achieved by 40% of patients. Factors shown to be associated with guideline-directed prescribing have included comorbidities (chronic lung disease, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and renal impairment), MI classification, and the administration of reperfusion therapy. Failure to prescribe medication can be due to real or perceived contraindications. For example, beta blockers were historically contraindicated for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but, whilst modern therapies have been shown to be safe, they remain under-prescribed. Conversely, certain diagnoses or treatments may increase adherence to guideline-recommended prescribing; such as beta blockers being initiated to treat hypertension prior to the MI. However, whether, and to which extent, variations in receipt of recommended treatment are associated with mortality has not been reported.

In this study, we assessed whether sociodemographic and comorbid factors were associated with receipt of recommended secondary prevention medication among MI survivors, and whether that was, in turn, associated with all-cause mortality, overall and by comorbidity subgroup.

### Appropriate statin use in patients with newly diagnosed acute ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction at a tertiary county teaching hospital [^114SZg8G]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are the mainstay of therapy in patients suffering an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or myocardial infarction (MI); however, several studies have shown that prescribing is not optimal.

Objective

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the percentage of patients prescribed appropriate statin therapy upon discharge after an AIS or MI.

Methods

This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary, county, teaching hospital in patients aged 18 to 89 years who were newly diagnosed with AIS or MI, from September 2017 to September 2022.

Results

Six hundred thirty-six individuals were hospitalized for AIS or MI according to ICD-10 codes. Of these, 389 patients were excluded, and 247 were included in the analysis. Although 85% of AIS and MI patients were at very high risk of future ASCVD events, over 25% were not discharged on appropriate statin therapy. Patients who had been taking high-intensity statins or were statin-naïve prior to admission (156/194, 80.4%) were significantly more likely to be discharged with appropriate statin therapy compared to those who had been taking low or moderate-intensity statins at home (27/53, 50.9%, p < 0.0001, OR = 3.41, 95% CI = 1.71 to 6.79).

Conclusion and Relevance

The treatment of patients with statin therapy following an AIS and MI remains suboptimal, despite most of these patients being at very high risk for further ASCVD events. Significantly more patients on high-intensity statins or were statin naïve on admission were discharged on appropriate therapy.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1144Mu9W]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Patient education components at hospital discharge — essential elements include the reason for hospitalization (reason for admission, diagnostic tests, procedural results), tailored discussion of lifestyle modifications (AHA's Life's Essential 8), medication instructions (purpose, dose, frequency, potential adverse effects, refill instructions, changes to prehospital regimen, importance of adherence), symptom management guidance (what to monitor and actions to take, including whom to call), plans for returning to daily routine (resuming physical and sexual activity, work, and travel), psychosocial considerations (open dialogue about symptoms of depression and anxiety), and follow-up care (future appointments with cardiology, CR, and additional testing postdischarge).

### Beta-blockers for suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction [^111xoJvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization, 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart diseases in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Acute myocardial infarction is caused by blockage of the blood supplied to the heart muscle. Beta-blockers are often used in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results ranging from harms, neutral effects, to benefits. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methodology has assessed the effects of beta-blockers for acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention in people with suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded and BIOSIS Citation Index in June 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Turning Research into Practice, Google Scholar, SciSearch, and the reference lists of included trials and previous reviews in August 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention in people with suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction. Trials were included irrespective of trial design, setting, blinding, publication status, publication year, language, and reporting of our outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed the Cochrane methodological recommendations. Four review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events according to the International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP), and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction during follow-up). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. Our primary time point of interest was less than three months after randomisation. We also assessed the outcomes at maximum follow-up beyond three months. Due to risk of multiplicity, we calculated a 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the primary outcomes and a 98% CI for the secondary outcomes. We assessed the risks of systematic errors through seven bias domains in accordance to the instructions given in the Cochrane Handbook. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed by GRADE.

Main Results

We included 63 trials randomising a total of 85,550 participants (mean age 57.4 years). Only one trial was at low risk of bias. The remaining trials were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence according to GRADE ranged from very low to high. Fifty-six trials commenced beta-blockers during the acute phase of acute myocardial infarction and seven trials during the subacute phase. At our primary time point 'less than three months follow-up', meta-analysis showed that beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risk of a reinfarction during follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 98% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.91; 67,562 participants; 18 trials; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.5% and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 196 participants. However, we found little or no effect of beta-blockers when assessing all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 97.5% CI 0.90 to 1.00; 80,452 participants; 46 trials/47 comparisons; high-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.4% and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; 45,852 participants; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.4%. Regarding angina, it is uncertain whether beta-blockers have a beneficial or harmful effect (RR 0.70, 98% CI 0.25 to 1.84; 98 participants; 3 trials; very low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 7.1%. None of the trials specifically assessed nor reported serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP. Only two trials specifically assessed major adverse cardiovascular events, however, no major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in either trial. At maximum follow-up beyond three months, meta-analyses showed that beta-blockers versus placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.93, 97.5% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 25,210 participants; 21 trials/22 comparisons; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.1% and a NNTB of 91 participants, and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 98% CI 0.83 to 0.98; 22,457 participants; 14 trials/15 comparisons; moderate-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% and a NNTB of 83 participants. However, it is uncertain whether beta-blockers have a beneficial or harmful effect when assessing major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 0.81, 97.5% CI 0.40 to 1.66; 475 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.7%; reinfarction (RR 0.89, 98% CI 0.75 to 1.08; 6825 participants; 14 trials; low-quality evidence) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.9%; and angina (RR 0.64, 98% CI 0.18 to 2.0; 844 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). None of the trials specifically assessed nor reported serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP. None of the trials assessed quality of life. We identified two ongoing randomised clinical trials investigating the effect of early administration of beta-blockers after percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis to patients with an acute myocardial infarction and one ongoing trial investigating the effect of long-term beta-blocker therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Our present review indicates that beta-blockers for suspected or diagnosed acute myocardial infarction probably reduce the short-term risk of a reinfarction and the long-term risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Nevertheless, it is most likely that beta-blockers have little or no effect on the short-term risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Regarding all remaining outcomes (serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP, major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction during follow-up), the long-term risk of a reinfarction during follow-up, quality of life, and angina), further information is needed to confirm or reject the clinical effects of beta-blockers on these outcomes for people with or suspected of acute myocardial infarction.

### Decade-long trends in 30-day rehospitalization rates after acute myocardial infarction [^112LUEt7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Trained nurses and physicians abstracted information on patient demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical data, and treatment practices through the review of hospital medical records. These factors included patient's sociodemographic characteristics (eg, age, sex, race, marital status), year of hospitalization, hospital length of stay, history of previously diagnosed comorbidities (eg, stroke, diabetes, heart failure), AMI order (initial versus prior) and AMI type (ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] versus non‐STEMI [NSTEMI]). 14, 15 Information on the development of important in‐hospital complications including atrial fibrillation, 16 cardiogenic shock, 17 heart failure, 18 and stroke 19 was also collected.

Data on the receipt of thrombolytic therapy and 3 coronary diagnostic and interventional procedures (cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) during hospitalization, and pharmacotherapies at the time of hospital discharge, including the prescribing of 4 effective cardiac medications (angiotensin converting inhibitors [ACEIs]/angiotensin type II receptor blockers [ARBs], aspirin, β‐blockers, and lipid‐lowering agents), were obtained.

A rehospitalization was defined as the patient's first admission to a study hospital within 30 days of discharge after their index hospitalization for AMI during the years under study. Two of the study investigators adjudicated whether the principal reason for readmission was due to either an AMI, cardiovascular disease (CVD) (excluding AMI)‐related, or non–CVD‐related readmission based on the review of information contained in hospital medical records. Indications for CVD‐related hospitalizations included unstable angina, heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic ischemic heart disease. Examples of non–CVD‐related hospitalizations included urinary tract infections, hemorrhage, osteoarthritis, and bone fractures.

### Improved long-term survival in patients on combination therapies following an incident acute myocardial infarction: a longitudinal population-based study [^111UUBed]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the single and combined effectiveness of commonly prescribed secondary preventive medications (post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI)) in reducing overall all-cause mortality and by gender.

Design

Population-based longitudinal cohort study.

Setting

Western Australia, Australia.

Participants

9580 individuals aged 65 years to 84 years who were admitted to hospital with their first AMI diagnosis between 1 January 1995 and 1 January 2006.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to death from any cause out to 11 years after first AMI, identified from registry data, was the primary outcome measure. Cardiovascular drugs dispensed within 28 days following hospital discharge were identified as main exposure categories.

Results

In total, 975 deaths occurred during 1 year follow-up, culminating to 3247 by 11 years. 1-year risk of death was significantly reduced for all drug combinations, but not for drugs dispensed in isolation. Out to 11 years, only combinations of 'β-blockers and statins' (with or without ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB)) provided significant reductions in risk of all-cause mortality. In men, the greatest reduction in risk was associated with being dispensed 'β-blockers and statins' (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.58), whereas women benefited most from being dispensed 'β-blockers, statins and ACEi/ARBs' (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99).

Conclusions

The combination of 'β-blockers and statins' (with or without ACEi/ARB) dispensed within 28 days postdischarge was associated with the greatest long-term survival following an AMI. Our observations of significantly reduced mortality risk in men (compared with women) who were dispensed 'β-blockers and statins', or 'β-blockers and ACEi/ARBs', warrants further investigation.

### Decade-long trends (2001 to 2011) in the use of evidence-based medical therapies at the time of hospital discharge for patients surviving acute myocardial infarction [^114a9V2g]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Optimization of medical therapy during discharge planning is vital for improving patient outcomes after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, limited information is available about recent trends in the prescribing of evidence-based medical therapies in these patients, especially from a population-based perspective. We describe decade-long trends in the discharge prescribing of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β blockers, and statins in hospital survivors of AMI. The study population consisted of 5,253 patients who were discharged from all 11 hospitals in central Massachusetts after AMI in 6 biennial periods from 2001 to 2011. Combination medical therapy (CMT) was defined as the prescription of all 4 cardiac medications at hospital discharge. The average age of this patient population was 69.2 years and 57.7% were men. Significant increases were observed in the use of CMT, from 25.6% in 2001 to 48.7% in 2011, with increases noted for each of the individual cardiac medications examined. Subgroup analysis also showed improvement in discharge prescriptions for P2Y12 inhibitors in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. Presence of a do-not-resuscitate order, before co-morbidities, hospitalization for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, admission to a nonteaching hospital, and failure to undergo cardiac catheterization or a percutaneous coronary intervention were associated with underuse of CMT. In conclusion, our study demonstrates encouraging trends in the prescribing of evidence-based medications at hospital discharge for AMI. However, certain patient subgroups continue to be at risk for underuse of CMT, suggesting the need for strategies to enhance compliance with current practice guidelines.

### Secondary prevention therapies in real-world patients with myocardial infarction: eligibility based on randomized trials supporting European and American guidelines [^1163QU2a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the applicability of the eligibility criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited in guideline recommendations in a real-world cohort of patients receiving secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction from the EPICOR registries.

Methods

Recommendations provided by American and European guidelines for acute myocardial infarction were classified into general (applying to all patients) and specific (applying to patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure). Randomized controlled trials cited in these recommendations were selected, and their entry criteria were applied to our international cohort of 18,117 patients.

Results

There were 91.5% patients eligible for beta blockers (84.6% for general, and 5.9% for specific recommendations), 97.7% eligible for renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ACEI/ARB]) recommendations (69.9% for general, 27.9% for specific) and 4.1% eligible for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (only specific recommendations). The percentages of patients with eligibility criteria who were discharged with a prescription of the recommended therapies were 80%-85% for beta blockers, 70%-75% for ACEI/ARB, and 29% for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. There were large regional variations in the percentage of eligible patients and in those receiving the medications (eg, 95% in Northern Europe and 57% in Southeast Asia for beta blockers).

Conclusion

Most real-world acute myocardial infarction patients are eligible for secondary prevention therapy in both general and specific guideline recommendations, and the percentage of those on beta blockers and ACEI/ARB at hospital discharge is high. There are large regional variations in the proportion of patients receiving recommended therapies. Local targeted interventions are needed for quality improvement.

### Cumulative adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^114Gu7KH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large, demographically diverse, community‐based population eligible for secondary prevention after AMI, we found that cumulative adherence to: (1) guideline‐recommended medical therapy, (2) optimal cardiovascular risk factor control, and (3) lifestyle interventions at 30 and 90 days after the event was associated with significantly lower long‐term mortality. We also observed that while achieving any individual secondary prevention guideline recommendation after AMI is associated with modest benefits, the favorable association of adherence to multiple guideline recommendations with longer survival is both statistically and clinically significant. For example, adherence to 1 additional guideline was associated with lower adjusted rates of death by 8% to 11%, but there was a 39% to 43% lower mortality rate in patients meeting all guideline‐recommended treatments. These beneficial associations were observed even within a cohort demonstrating high levels of adherence to each individual guideline recommendation. Further, full adherence to all guideline‐recommended treatments was associated with an additional 12% to 21% improvement in long‐term survival compared with those achieving 1 less than full adherence (ie, comparing results for 6 versus 5 and 7 versus 6 in 30‐ and 90‐day models, respectively). Our findings provide support for providers and healthcare delivery systems to systematically and aggressively promote comprehensive secondary prevention efforts across multiple avenues of care. Patients and providers can use this information to understand the incremental and cumulative benefits of achieving the maximum number of guideline‐recommended strategies possible.

### Medication-taking for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction: a thematic meta-synthesis of patient experiences [^111zx7QW]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), medical treatment includes a life-long regime of taking five medications, risk factor control and lifestyle changes in order to prevent secondary myocardial infarction or further cardiac events. However, medication adherence has been measured to be around 60% in this patient group, showing a similar pattern across drug classes and falling as treatment duration continues. Poor adherence leads to increased risk of mortality and shortened patient survival, re-hospitalisation, and incurs increased healthcare costs.

A Cochrane Review of medication adherence interventions concluded that they are often complex and of little effect. Within the larger group of cardiovascular secondary prevention patients, the use of short message service (SMS) texts, a combined pill and healthcare professional support have been found to be beneficial to adherence. In the post-AMI patient group, interventions have assisted adherence to cardiac rehabilitation course completion, but not medication adherence, while telephone or web-based prompts have a positive effect on adherence. The patient perspective of this phenomena is under-researched, and validated theory does not exist, so current interventions to assist medication adherence are based on presumed principles. Qualitative methods are underused in cardiovascular research, but could assist in creating a theoretical model and developing an appropriate intervention, the effectiveness of which could then be assessed using quantitative instruments.

This systematic review and meta-synthesis will provide a new account of this phenomena, by organising existing knowledge through comparison and thematic grouping. The aim is to investigate the existing qualitative research of medication-taking post-AMI and summarise themes across all studies, the differences and scope of our present knowledge. To date, this is the first systematic review of medication-taking in secondary prevention of AMI and makes an important contribution to understanding the issues faced by patients in order to develop appropriate interventions to assist their medication-taking.

Risk ratios for statin initiation associated with the predictors included in the multivariable model are shown in Table 7. In a model adjusted for age, sex, race, and calendar year, patients were less likely to initiate statins if they were older; received a low‐income subsidy for Medicare Part D premiums; were dual Medicare or Medicaid eligible; had diabetes, strokes, renal disease, depression, or a higher Charlson comorbidity index; were hospitalized for any cause during baseline; were nursing home residents; had a skilled nursing home stay; had cardiologist care 31 to 365 days prior to the index event; took nonstatin lipid‐lowering medications; or had an index hospitalization of > 7 days. After full multivariable adjustment, patients were less likely to initiate statins within 90 days of discharge if they were aged > 85 years, had a higher Charlson comorbidity index, were nursing home residents, had cardiologist care 31 to 365 days prior to the index event, did not use any medication during baseline, or took nonstatin lipid‐lowering medications.

### Secondary prevention for patients following a myocardial infarction: summary of NICE guidance [^113iocEP]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Mortality from coronary heart disease has been falling in the UK since the 1970s, but remains higher than in most other Western countries. Most patients receive some treatment for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, but not all patients are offered the most effective secondary prevention package. The recently published NICE guideline for secondary prevention in patients after myocardial infarction, summarised in this article, makes clear recommendations for management of patients after myocardial infarction, based on best available evidence. The guidelines update the 2001 NICE guideline, and have expanded and emphasised the recommendations for physical activity, dietary and other lifestyle changes, and cardiac rehabilitation, and updated the recommendations for drug therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — early discharge and risk stratification after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are characterized as follows: available data suggest that an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality for low-risk patients after STEMI who have undergone PCI; the Zwolle score has been recommended to identify low-risk patients after primary PCI (PPCI) in STEMI, with low-risk patients, score ≤ 3, who can potentially be discharged earlier from the hospital (48 to 72 hours); small retrospective studies have suggested safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative; patients being considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support, and hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

Results

Study Cohort and Follow‐Up

We identified 25 788 and 24 200 eligible adults hospitalized with AMI between 2008 and 2014 surviving to 30 and 90 days postdischarge, respectively (Figure 1). Patients were older (mean age 68 years), predominantly men (64%), and had broad racial/ethnic diversity (Table 1). For > 90% of patients, the index AMI was their first documented AMI in our system. The proportion of patients already taking guideline‐directed secondary prevention medications at the time of the AMI admission was highest for statins (51%) and lowest for nonaspirin antiplatelet agents (10%). Among patients with available outpatient BP measurements, one fifth were not controlled at baseline (> 140/90 mm Hg) and slightly more than half (52%) had LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL before the index AMI. Patients eligible for 30‐day analyses were followed for a median of 2.8 years after index AMI (interquartile range 1.0–4.3 years); those eligible for 90‐day analyses had similar follow‐up. During follow‐up, 4590 (17.8%) and 3916 (16.2%) patients died among those eligible for 30‐ and 90‐day analyses, respectively.

Cumulative and Individual Adherence to Guidelines

We observed relatively few patients in the lowest categories of guideline adherence (5% adhered to 0–2 guidelines and 10% to 0 to 3 guidelines in 30‐ and 90‐day analyses) (Table 2). A modest number of patients achieved a moderate number of guidelines (7% and 19% adhered to 3 or 4 guidelines in 30‐day analyses, respectively; 12% and 23% adhered to 4 or 5 guidelines in 90‐day analyses, respectively), and a larger proportion of patients adhered to all or nearly all guideline recommendations at 30 or 90 days (35% and 34% adhered to 5 or 6 guidelines in 30‐day analyses; 31% and 23% adhered to 6 or 7 guidelines in 90‐day analyses). Most patients adhered to each individual guideline metrics (Table 2).

### Trends in longer-term survival following an acute myocardial infarction and prescribing of evidenced-based medications in primary care in the UK from 1991: a longitudinal population-based study [^115yZA3d]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2011). Low credibility.

Implications

The results suggest that longer-term case-fatality rates following an MI, in patients who have survived 3 months, have declined by one quarter in 12 years. Over the same period substantial increases in prescribing of relevant evidenced-based medications have occurred. The rapid rise in prescribing of the four medication types reflects the increasing evidence-base for these medications over this period. In particular, statin use was negligible before 1995, a period pre-dating publication of the results of the major statin trials, whereas a rapid increase in statin prescribing followed thereafter. Nevertheless, in the last year of this study, appreciable proportions of MI patients were still not receiving evidenced-based medication (21% in the case of lipid-lowering drugs, 30% for beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors) in line with earlier findings. Even more recently, appreciable proportions of post-MI patients in the UK have not been receiving preventive medications. The question remains as to what factors may explain the improvement in survival. In terms of short-term case fatality, the WHO MONICA study found that 18% of the variation in 28-day case fatality trends in an earlier era from 1980 to 1995 between 31 different populations could be explained by differences in the trends in the use of beta-blockers, 31% by anti-platelet use and 32% by ACE inhibitors. The concurrent trends in medication prescribing and survival observed in our study suggests medication prescribing in primary care may also have played a role in the decline in longer-term case fatality. However, medication prescribing alone is unlikely to be a complete explanation. The decline in longer-term case death could also reflect improved intervention in hospital during the acute phase (eg, surgical interventions, rescue coronary angioplasty, thrombolytic agents). In Perth, Western Australia the 12-year case-fatality rate among patients who had an MI in 1991–3 and had already survived one year, was 28% lower than that of their counterparts who had an MI in 1984–7. This RR reduction did not persist after adjustment for treatment with thrombolysis, anti-platelets, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and lipid-regulating drugs in hospital and prescribed on discharge, as well as coronary artery revascularisation within 12 months of the incident acute MI, suggesting that the increased use of these interventions has contributed to the improvement in survival in this population. In addition, favourable changes in risk factors, in particular a fall in smoking prevalence, and nutritional improvement, both in the general population and in patients with established cardiovascular disease, are likely to have played a role, as well as improved emergency response, for example through increased cell phone use.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with heart failure (HF) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — either an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be initiated in appropriate patients with AMI, and in patients with AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist reduced all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and should be given in the absence of advanced chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or other contraindication. In patients early after MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril-valsartan did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident HF compared with an ACEi, hypotensive events were more common, and initiation of this combination agent early after MI appears safe if treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction is planned. Concomitant initiation of both an ACEi and ARB in patients with AMI should be avoided due to an increase in adverse events without added benefit compared with either drug alone. In EPHESUS, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone reduced both all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in patients with AMI with LVEF < 40% who also had symptoms of HF and/or diabetes mellitus; evidence-based therapy use at enrollment was 86% for ACEi or ARB and 75% for a beta blocker, and patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L were excluded. Supporting evidence includes an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 patients with AMI reporting a 30-day mortality rate of 7.1% with ACEi compared with 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), and a trial of 1012 patients with acute STEMI without a history of HF in which eplerenone reduced the primary end point but the benefit was largely driven by a reduction in natriuretic peptides.

The direct adjusted survival curves for all‐cause mortality stratified by post‐AMI statin adherence (Figure 4 A) showed a dose–response‐type relationship; patients who were severely nonadherent to statin therapy had the lowest probability of survival (12‐month survival 0.853 [95% CI: 0.847–0.859]), while patients who were adherent had the highest probability of survival (12‐month survival 0.879 [0.876–0.882]).

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^1173teWu]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Medication adherence has been defined as the extent to which a patient takes medications as prescribed by their healthcare providers. In clinical practice, medication nonadherence is one of the main factors that reduce the effectiveness of drug therapies. However, a previous study reported that almost 40% of the patients who initiated the use of ACEIs/ARBs, beta‐blockers, or statins following hospitalization for MI became nonadherent during the first treatment year. Moreover, many patients seemed to do so already during the first 6 months. Therefore, better adherence to cardiovascular treatment should be highlighted in the clinical secondary prevention in patients with CAD.

We subsequently found the inverse association between cardiovascular medication adherence and outcomes in patients with CAD risk was found. A 20% improvement in cardiovascular medication adherence was associated with an 8% reduction in cardiovascular case risk. In addition, this cardiovascular event risk reduction would be translated into a reduction of all‐cause mortality (decreased by 12%). However, this benefit was not observed in good beta‐blocker adherence. This reason might be the majority of the included sample were patients with post‐MI. Recently, several studies reported that beta‐blocker might have no benefit on post‐AMI patients without heart failure or ventricular dysfunction (so‐called reperfusion era). Actually, the evidence of benefits associated with beta‐blocker use is mostly from trials predating the advent of the era of early revascularization. A meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials also showed that beta‐blocker use has no mortality benefit for patients without heart failure. Another study also showed patients adherent to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and statins only had similar mortality rates as those adherents to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and statins and beta‐blocker, suggesting a limited additional benefit for beta‐blockers in patients with post‐MI. By combining evidence from observational studies, a systematic review suggested that the majority of the included studies failed to demonstrate a benefit in survival or cardiovascular events with long‐term beta‐blockers in post‐MI patients with normal left ventricular function. However, because of a lack of or limited data, subgroup analysis by subtypes of heart failure was not available. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of beta‐blockers adherence on the outcomes in post‐MI patients (especially in patients with normal left ventricular function).

### Targeting inflammation after acute myocardial infarction [^111b1YTz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in secondary prevention, adverse cardiovascular events still occur after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Contributing to residual cardiovascular risk, acute and persistent inflammation is a stronger predictor of recurrent events and mortality than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The inflammatory response following AMI is a finely regulated, multiphase process, beginning with a proinflammatory phase followed by a reparative phase. Disruptions in its regulation lead to persistent low-grade inflammation and worse clinical outcomes. Modulating inflammation has emerged as a promising secondary prevention strategy, with several drugs being tested with conflicting results regarding their efficacy and safety. Recently, novel approaches have reignited the interest in anti-inflammatory strategies after AMI. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding potential class effects, drug choice, patient selection, and the optimal administration timing. This review provides an updated and comprehensive overview of inflammatory mechanisms after AMI and critically appraises the evolving clinical evidence surrounding anti-inflammatory therapies for secondary cardiovascular prevention.

### Intervention to improve adherence to ACC / AHA recommended adjunctive medications for the management of patients with an acute myocardial infarction [^116ZeG4q]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The most recent published guidelines regarding management of patients surviving an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) advocate the administration of aspirin (ASA), beta blockers (BB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and discourages the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCB). Previous data collected in our region from the National Registry (NR) showed a dismal compliance with these guidelines. In an attempt to increase physician awareness and to optimize implementation of recommended guidelines, a cardiac and pharmacy steering committee was created.

Methods

The pharmacist assigned to the project identified all patients admitted with an AMI using troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) reports. The pharmacist then contacted physicians to make recommendations if an adjunctive medication was not prescribed for a patient with no apparent contraindications. Administration rates for ASA, BB, ACEi, and CCB were then assessed and compared with the previously obtained baseline data from the NR.

Results

At admission, the use of ASA increased from 70 to 72%, BB from 45 to 72%, and ACEi from 12 to 44%. In terms of medications at discharge, ASA use increased from 74 to 88%, BB from 55 to 76%, and ACEi from 30 to 40%. In addition, the prescription rates for CCB at discharge decreased from 36 to 21%.

Conclusions

An interdisciplinary approach for disease management is an effective method for improving adherence to treatment guidelines simply with pharmacy intervention. The percentage of patients receiving the recommended adjunctive medications increased significantly. We propose that these guidelines should be periodically inserviced to physicians. Furthermore, patient counseling sessions should also be instituted to help reinforce the importance of compliance with the medications after discharge, as well as lipid management and smoking cessation.

### Preventive drug use in patients with a history of nonfatal myocardial infarction during 12-year follow-up in the Netherlands: a retrospective analysis [^116gN3t6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common cause of death in developed countries. Long-term preventive pharmacotherapy has been shown to decrease mortality and morbidity after MI. Based on a literature search, studies of these therapies to date have estimated the use of monotherapy, whereas many patients are prescribed combination therapy. Thus, assessment of long-term combination drug use after MI is timely.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the use of oral antithrombotics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ("statins"), and their combinations after MI at discharge and during 12-year follow-up.

Methods

This community-based, retrospective data analysis was conducted at Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Data from patients aged ≥ 18 years at hospital admission who experienced nonfatal acute MI between 1991 and 2000 and had a duration of follow-up ≥ 30 days were included in the analysis. Data were retrieved from the Pharmo Record Linkage System database, which links pharmacies' dispensation records to hospitals' discharge records on an individual patient level, allowing the investigator to observe individual patients' medication use over time. Primary outcome measures were the use of preventive medicines (oral antithrombotics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins) at discharge, overall use, and persistence during 12-year follow-up.

Results

Of 330,000 patients in the database, 4007 were included in the analysis (2828 men, 1179 women; mean [SD] age, 63.5 [12.5] years). Use at discharge and overall use of oral antithrombotics and statins increased significantly between 1991 and 2000, whereas use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors increased mainly in patients discharged in the latter years of the follow-up period. Therapy with any combination of drugs increased strikingly from 1991 to 2000, from 47% to 90%. At 1 year after discharge, 32% of patients had discontinued their first-prescribed combination treatments. At 5 years after discharge, this rate increased to 57%, suggesting a low rate of persistence

Conclusions

Based on the results of this retrospective data analysis, the use of MI-preventive drug treatment at and after discharge increased significantly in this population in The Netherlands during the 1990s. Combination therapy increased strikingly. However, persistence with combination therapy was low.

### Cumulative adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^115VRWnG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomized trials have shown that secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reduces mortality and cardiovascular events, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 improves quality of life, and is generally considered cost‐effective. 9, 10 Subsequent evidence‐based guidelines have been developed, 11 and both payer and healthcare quality organizations require that secondary prevention metrics are met to receive payment and quality designations. 12, 13 Although various studies in "real‐world" populations have described adherence rates and associated outcomes of specific guideline recommendations, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 few studies have investigated the cumulative adherence and potential clinical impact of meeting multiple secondary prevention guideline recommendations across varying domains of care, at different time points after AMI, and in diverse community‐based populations.

To address this, we examined adherence to: (1) guideline‐recommended medical therapy, (2) optimal risk factor control, and (3) recommended lifestyle interventions at 30 and 90 days after AMI and the associations of cumulative and individual guideline adherence with all‐cause mortality.

### Optimal secondary prevention medication use in acute myocardial infarction patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease is modified by management strategy: insights from the TRIUMPH registry [^117HwMc1]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (nonobCAD) may be perceived to be at lower risk for cardiac events, relative to those with obstructive CAD (obCAD), and thus less likely to receive optimal preventive medications in the year following AMI.

Hypothesis

We aimed to determine if AMI patients with nonobCAD, compared to obCAD, received lower rates of prevention medications in the year following AMI.

Methods

We compared optimal prevention medication use at hospital discharge, 1, 6, and 12 months after hospitalization. Optimal medication use was defined as the receipt of all prevention medications for which that patient was eligible (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, β-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the association between nonobCAD to medication use and adjusted for potential confounders.

Results

Three thousand six hundred thirty AMI patients were studied, of whom 200 (5.2%) had nonobCAD. Fewer nonobCAD patients received optimal medication use compared to obCAD patients at discharge (31% vs 65%, P < 0.001), driven primarily by lower rates of clopidogrel use (40.5% vs 83.3%, P < 0.001). After adjustment for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), differences in medication use were similar at discharge and 1 year after hospitalization. Stratified analyses by receipt of PCI suggested patients confined to medical management had less optimal medication use, regardless of their CAD burden.

Conclusions

Lower rates of unadjusted optimal medication use were seen in nonobCAD patients, driven by low clopidogrel use among medically managed patients, suggesting improvement efforts should focus on these patients.

### Adherence to guideline medication recommendations to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease progression among adults with prior myocardial infarction [^113V5KoR]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

With improvements in acute care, most patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) now survive the index event but remain at risk of recurrent events, thereby making secondary prevention therapies critical. Prior studies, have examined in-patient and discharge medications after MI, but few have examined postdischarge treatment. For secondary prevention medications, adherence over time can markedly reduce the risk of recurrent MI, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. We describe the use of evidence-based therapies for secondary prevention in a large contemporary US cohort of patients with prior MI and elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

### Evaluation of sex-based differences in the prescription of the combination of evidence-based medicine after the occurrence of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^111atbgy]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Worldwide, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and a major cause of morbidity, for both men and women. The most severe type of acute coronary syndrome is acute ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Patients who have experienced STEMI benefit from pharmacological treatment to reduce the risk of subsequent ischemic events. This strategy is known as secondary prevention therapy. For five medicine classes, the independent clinical benefit is supported by evidence. The European and American guidelines recommend the combination of these five evidence‐based medicine (cEBM) groups which includes dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (acetylsalicylic acid and a P2Y12‐inhibitor), lipid‐lowering therapy (statin and/or ezetimibe), a beta‐blocker, and an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensinogen‐II receptor blocker (ARB) regardless of sex. This combination is recommended for all STEMI patients if not contra‐indicated.

Women with STEMI have a higher mortality rate than men. This could be attributed to differences between men and women in pathophysiology, clinical presentation and treatment. Moreover, women tend to receive less evidence‐based medicine post hospital discharge. Among studies, disparities are observed concerning which medicine classes (DAPT, statin, beta‐blocker, or ACEi/ARB) are less prescribed to women than men. However, literature about sex differences in cEBM defined as the combination of the five medicine groups after a STEMI is scarce, while the combination of drugs is associated with a reduced mortality risk. Just one Portuguese study reported on cEBM and showed that only 63.9% of the men versus 53.0% of the women were discharged with cEBM. Although multiple studies described a difference in prescription of evidence based medicine between men and women, sex disparities in cEBM at discharge has not yet been studied within the Dutch population. Moreover, determinants for cEBM in STEMI patients remain unknown and, thus, whether sex remains an independent factor in explaining the absence of cEBM is less clear.

### Statin use following hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries with a secondary discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^112ZxEJD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Registries and other observational studies suggest that > 80% of patients are discharged on a statin following hospitalization for a coronary heart disease (CHD) event –; however, most data on prescriptions for statins following CHD events are derived from patients whose primary reason for hospitalization was acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]). For many hospitalizations, AMI is listed as a secondary diagnosis. American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) guidelines recommend statins for secondary prevention for patients with AMI who do not have contraindications or documented adverse effects from statins. – The guidelines do not address the issue of whether secondary prevention treatment should differ based on the precipitating cause of AMI. Patients who have an AMI during a hospitalization for another reason may have multiple competing priorities on discharge, and the provision of cardioprotective treatment may be overlooked.

The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with AMI during a hospitalization for another reason who filled a statin prescription following discharge. For our primary analyses, we assessed the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries who initiated statins within 90 days following discharge for a hospitalization with AMI as a secondary diagnosis compared with their counterparts with AMI as the primary listed diagnosis or those who underwent coronary revascularization. In a secondary analysis, we studied patients taking statins prior to their CHD hospitalization and investigated whether differences in the proportion of patients who continued taking statins following discharge differed for beneficiaries with AMI as a secondary diagnosis versus other CHD‐related hospitalizations.

### Cumulative adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^114oicdb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings demonstrated a high degree of adherence to secondary prevention guidelines after AMI including medication use, cardiovascular risk factor control, and lifestyle intervention — a combination of measures beyond that observed in other registries 33, 34, 35 and at rates consistent with pooled analyses of large clinical trials. 36 In addition to aggressive primary prevention efforts, 37 these may help to explain the significant reductions in AMI rates and heart disease mortality within KPNC, which have surpassed national rates over the past decade. 20, 38 Although our findings are observational and not considered causal, it is helpful for both providers and patients to know that adherence to each additional guideline by 90 days is associated with an 8% lower adjusted rate of long‐term mortality, with an overall 43% lower mortality rate if all guideline metrics are achieved.

Improving adherence to secondary prevention measures will require systematic, multipronged, coordinated programs that use technology‐based tools for population‐level outreach and patient management, leverage the full spectrum of physician and nonphysician providers, reduce barriers for patients, and apply validated clinical algorithms to improve adherence to recommended therapies. 37, 39

### Incident heart failure and recurrent coronary events following acute myocardial infarction [^112Atf9n]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients who develop post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure (HF) have a high risk for mortality and rehospitalizations. Reducing the risk of recurrent ischaemic events after an acute MI is a major therapeutic goal and has led to significant advances in systems of care, revascularization strategies, and drug therapy targeting secondary prevention. New onset HF is another adverse consequence complicating MI. Estimates from over a decade ago suggest that 20%–25% of patients develop HF during an MI admission or after discharge. Several therapies have shown risk reduction for death or HF in high-risk patients following an MI, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). It has been two decades, however, since a drug therapy was shown to reduce the risk for HF after an acute MI. Herein, we leveraged an integrated healthcare system's data to evaluate contemporary trends in patient characteristics, and risks and outcomes related to the development of incident HF and recurrent MI in patients post-MI, to inform the need for clinical and research priorities.

### Β-blocker use following myocardial infarction: low prevalence of evidence-based dosing [^115qDEyt]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Quality improvement programs have shown increased use of beta-blockers post-myocardial infarction (MI), but there are no data on whether appropriate doses are administered.

Methods

In a prospective registry that enrolled consecutive patients with MI, we evaluated beta-blocker dosing at discharge after MI and 3 weeks later and assessed clinical predictors for treatment with very low doses. We studied 1,971 patients (70.8% male) with a mean age of 63.9 ± 13.7 years, of whom 48.2% had an ST-elevation MI.

Results

beta-Blocker utilization rates following MI were 93.2% at discharge: 20.1% received < 25% of target dose, 36.5% received 25% of target dose, 26.4% received 26% to 50% of target dose, and 17.0% received > 50% of target dose. Between discharge and 3 weeks, 76.4% had no change in beta-blocker dose, with 11.9% and 11.6% having their dose reduced and increased, respectively. Absence of hypertension, acute percutaneous coronary intervention, older age, and no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy were consistent predictors of treatment with very low beta-blocker doses.

Conclusions

Underdosing of beta-blockers is highly prevalent among patients post-MI. This represents an important opportunity in quality improvement for the care of patients who have suffered an MI.

### Non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute myocardial infarction: a network meta-analysis [^111XknwM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the death of the myocardial tissue due to ischaemia. AMI occurs secondary to an obstruction in one or more coronary arteries due to a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. AMI is divided into ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), according to the electrocardiographic appearance of the lesion.

Despite therapy, AMI remains a life‐threatening disease: up to one in five affected people either die, suffer recurrent myocardial infarction, or develop a stroke within one year (Jernberg 2015). The estimated global incidence of AMI is 10 to 15 million episodes per year (James 2018; Vos 2016). AMI has a considerable economic burden: in the USA, hospitalisation due to AMI costs USD 14.3 billion each year (Liang 2020), while the annual medical costs of ischaemic heart disease in Europe are estimated at EUR 59 billion (Wilkins 2017). The economic burden associated with AMI in China is higher than in some high‐income economies (Jan 2018).

The prognosis of AMI has improved markedly since the early 2000s because of advancements in treatment strategies (Ibanez 2018; Roffi 2016). One key contributor to improved outcomes is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. DAPT has significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, including stent thrombosis, particularly in people undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; Leon 1998; Valgimigli 2017).

While DAPT reduces the incidence of stent thrombosis in the first few months after PCI, the impact of DAPT on late and particularly very late stent thrombosis is less certain (Garg 2015). Generally, the recommended strategy after AMI is DAPT for at least 12 months, followed by life‐long single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT; Amsterdam 2014; Collet 2020; Ibanez 2018; O'Gara 2013; Roffi 2016). However, DAPT duration can be shortened or lengthened (beyond 12 months) according to each person's ischaemic or bleeding risk profile (Bonaca 2015; Kikkert 2018).

### Evidence-based optimal medical therapy and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention [^111HwoDc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background The secondary prevention with pharmacologic therapy is essential for preventing recurrent cardiovascular events in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction. Guideline-based optimal medical therapy (OMT) for patients with acute myocardial infarction consists of antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers, and statins. We aimed to determine the prescription rate of OMT use at discharge and to evaluate the impact of OMT on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in the drug-eluting stent era using nationwide cohort data. Methods and Results Using the National Health Insurance claims data in South Korea, patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent between July 2013 and June 2017 were enrolled. A total of 35972 patients were classified into the OMT and non-OMT groups according to the post-percutaneous coronary intervention discharge medication. The primary end point was all-cause death, and the 2 groups were compared using a propensity-score matching analysis. Fifty-seven percent of patients were prescribed OMT at discharge. During the follow-up period (median, 2.0years [interquartile range, 1.1–3.2years]), OMT was associated with a significant reduction in the all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76–0.90]; P < 0.001) and composite outcome of death or coronary revascularization (aHR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.85–0.93]; P < 0.001). Conclusions OMT was prescribed at suboptimal rates in South Korea. However, our nationwide cohort study showed that OMT has a benefit for long-term clinical outcomes on all-cause mortality and composite outcome of death or coronary revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention in the drug-eluting stent era.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113WN5fs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-recommended therapy for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and beta-blockers (BBs). BBs are a cornerstone of treatment for ischemic heart disease in the acute phase because they inhibit the physiological sympathetic activation, reduce myocardial workload, reduce infarct size, and have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. BB also have a well-defined role in long-term therapy of patients with persistent reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the role of longer-term BB treatment when AMI course is not complicated by heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, recurrent ischemia, or arrhythmia is not well established. Most guidelines recommend BB use in the absence of contraindications with grade 1B evidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and grade 2A in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The recommendation for BB use after AMI predominately comes from studies that predate routine implementation of a contemporary strategy of early reperfusion and medical therapy. Recent guidelines report uncertainty in the strength of the evidence for long-term use of BB post revascularization with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Observational studies that have evaluated the duration of BB use and outcomes after AMI have several limitations, including incomplete ascertainment or heterogeneous definitions of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction, inclusion of patients with independent indications or contraindications to BB, lack of longitudinal prescription data, and relatively short durations of follow-up. Two recently published open-label randomized clinical trials have added to this literature but have not completely resolved the dilemma. The REDUCE AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial found that initiating BBs in MI survivors with preserved LVEF at the time of discharge did not reduce the incidence of death from any cause or recurrent AMI, whereas the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta-Blocker Interruption 1 Year after an Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction on Safety and Symptomatic Cardiac Events Requiring Hospitalization) trial failed to find that interrupting BBs a mean of 2.9 years after MI was noninferior to continuing them, for a composite primary endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. We sought to assess the association between discontinuation of newly prescribed BB within 180 days after AMI and long-term cardiovascular outcomes among a well-characterized, population-based cohort of AMI survivors without definite indications for long-term BB therapy.

### Cumulative adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^1116LAhp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Within a large real‐world population eligible for secondary prevention after AMI, we found that cumulative adherence to guideline‐recommended medical therapies, cardiovascular risk factor control, and lifestyle modification at 30 and 90 days after discharge was associated with significant long‐term reductions in mortality. The associated benefit continued to accrue all the way to full adherence of the examined guideline metrics, without significant diminishing returns. Future research should examine the population‐, system‐, and individual‐level barriers to achieving full adherence to guideline‐recommended therapy to optimize secondary prevention after AMI.

### Improving the management of patients after myocardial infarction, from admission to discharge [^117Bnqim]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent developments in pharmacologic and device therapy, as well as initiatives to increase the use of standard orders and promote in-hospital communication, have improved the care of patients with myocardial infarction (MI). The increased presence of hospitalists, physicians who provide in-hospital care as a specialty, promises to provide further improvements.

Objective

This article reviews current information on evidence-based care of the hospitalized MI patient, with a particular emphasis on identifying left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and appropriate treatments.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for all large-scale clinical trials providing information on the care of post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or heart failure (HF), with no limit on time period. The search terms were post-myocardial infarction, large-scale, randomized, clinical trial, left ventricular dysfunction, and/or heart failure. All trials investigating therapies currently recommended in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ST-elevation MI (ACC/AHA STEMI) guidelines and including post-MI patients with or without LVD and/or HF, as indicated by signs and symptoms of HF or Killip class, were included.

Results

In the acute setting, the ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated), and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (if the patient is undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention). The guidelines recommend use of aldosterone antagonists and statins at discharge, in addition to continuation of all acute therapies. The ACC/AHA guidelines apply to all patients after MI and do not specify whether the recommended therapies are effective in post-MI patients with LVD or HE Reviewing the trials that included post-MI patients with LVD and/or HF, it appears that in some cases, only certain agents within a class have been evaluated (eg, post-MI beta-blocker trials often excluded patients with LVD, and the efficacy of atenolol has not been evaluated in post-MI patients with LVD or HF), and some agents have not shown as much efficacy as others in this high-risk patient population (eg, metoprolol appeared to be associated with poorer outcomes in this population than carvedilol). Rather than recommending an entire class, hospital care maps and critical-care pathway tools should incorporate the use of evidence-based agents.

Conclusions

The use of evidence-based care in the hospital has the potential to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients with LVD and/or HE The hospitalist can facilitate the best practices and best care of the post-MI patient through the use of in-hospital critical-care pathway tools.

### Length of initial prescription at hospital discharge and long-term medication adherence for elderly, post-myocardial infarction patients: a population-based interrupted time series study [^116oATaD]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend long-term use of the following cardiac medication classes for secondary prevention in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients: antiplatelets (aspirin plus a secondary antiplatelet); statins; beta blockers; and angiotensin system inhibitors (i.e. an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]). These medications are associated with a relative risk reduction of 60% for major cardiovascular events. However, prior research has shown that post-discharge cardiac medication adherence often declines progressively over time. Multiple studies have shown an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with medication non-adherence in patients with coronary artery disease.

Observational studies have demonstrated that post-MI patients receiving longer initial prescriptions have greater long-term adherence to cardiac medications. Providing longer prescriptions for post-MI patients at the time of discharge could address barriers to medication adherence including prescription refill burden and unintentional forgetfulness due to lack of habituation. Unfortunately, health system policies promote shorter prescriptions, with compensation for up to a maximum of 5 refills in 1 year, likely contributing to the fact that only a minority of post-MI patients in Ontario–Canada's most populous province–receive longer initial prescriptions that cover ≥ 90 days. Therefore, while medication non-adherence is a complex issue, this relatively simple intervention could have significant implications at the population level.

In the present study, our objectives were to evaluate the effects of two hospital-based interventions implemented in Ontario, Canada, between September 2017 and August 2018 — (1) standardized prolonged discharge prescription forms (with 90 days and 3 repeats per recommended cardiac medication class) in combination with on-site clinician education about the potential benefits of prolonged prescriptions and (2) on-site clinician education only — on long-term cardiac medication adherence among post-MI patients. We hypothesized that, in comparison to usual care (no intervention), implementation of the study interventions — which promote increased duration of initial discharge prescriptions — would result in a greater proportion of post-MI patients with long-term cardiac medication adherence over time.

Patient Characteristics

Other patient characteristics of interest that were measured fell into the following categories: (1) sociodemographic characteristics, (2) baseline clinical conditions and medication use, (3) characteristics of the index AMI hospitalization, and (4) postdischarge events and medication use.

Sociodemographic characteristics were measured from enrollment summary files and included age at index AMI admission, sex, race/ethnicity, dual eligibility in Medicare and Medicaid, and median household income. Dual eligibility was measured in the 3 months pre‐AMI. Median household income was calculated for individuals ≥ 65 years old at the US Census block group level.

Baseline comorbidities and recent cardiovascular procedures were measured in the 12 months before the index AMI admission from inpatient and outpatient medical claims. Comorbidities included previous AMI, dementia/Alzheimer's disease, depression, ischemic heart disease, unstable angina, lipid abnormalities, and rhabdomyolysis/myopathy. A modified Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated that excluded AMI and dementia. 5 Recent cardiovascular procedures included coronary artery bypass surgery and stent/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Baseline use of secondary prevention medications was measured in the 6 months pre‐AMI from prescription claims (having at least 1 prescription claim for the medication class in the 180 days pre‐index AMI admission). Medications of interest included angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, β‐blockers, P2Y 12 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists. Finally, we identified whether patients were "new users" of statins, defined as having their first prescription claim for a statin within 6 months before the index AMI.

### How do cardiologists select patients for dual antiplatelet therapy continuation beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction? Insights from the EYESHOT post-MI study [^116qkLd9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current guidelines suggest that continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for longer than 12 months should be considered in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) who have tolerated DAPT without bleeding complications. 1, 2 This recommendation is based on recent randomized clinical trials suggesting that DAPT prolongation reduces the rate of recurrent ischemic events in post‐MI patients, compared with aspirin alone. 3, 4 However, these benefits come at the cost of increased risk of bleeding, raising the question about how to identify the ideal patient profile who could safely prolong DAPT. 1, 2, 5, 6 Although predictors of DAPT interruption have been already identified in large international registries, 7, 8, 9 specific appraisals underlying the decision on the extension of DAPT have been poorly investigated. 10, 11

Using data from the EYESHOT (EmploYEd antithrombotic therapies in patients with acute coronary Syndromes HOspitalized in iTaly) Post‐MI study 12 we sought to evaluate the criteria used by cardiologists in daily clinical practice for selecting post‐MI patients eligible for DAPT continuation beyond 1 year.

### Medication-taking for secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction: a thematic meta-synthesis of patient experiences [^111acShe]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To collate existing qualitative research examining patients' medication-taking experiences in secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and produce new knowledge, a systematic review and meta-synthesis of patient qualitative studies was conducted.

Method

A systematic review found nine reports suitable for inclusion. Themes found by the report authors and report characteristic data were extracted. Reports were assessed for quality. A meta-synthesis using thematic coding and constant comparison method produced higher order themes, and these were used to construct a statement organised by theme using specific examples from the included studies.

Results

All patients discussed their medication-taking in thematic categories of beliefs about medication and illness, personal ability and interpersonal factors. Themes differed between classes of medication and between patients, suggesting tailored interventions to medications and individual patients would be appropriate. Some themes overlapped with those discussed by the broader group of cardiovascular patients, but some themes were unique to this myocardial infarction patient group, again indicating that a tailored approach is appropriate for this patient group.

Conclusion

The themes of beliefs about medication and illness, personal ability and interpersonal support provide tangible starting points for addressing adherence issues. The concept of medication-taking had unique elements within the post-AMI group of patients, and between classes of medication. While these themes were grouped into more generalised higher-order constructs, there were differences between patients within the themed group, indicating that themes are useful as a guide, but individual-level patient support is appropriate.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^113pqCxa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction — performance measure defines the measure as the percentage of patients 18–75 y of age with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who were offered moderate- to high-intensity statin at hospital discharge. The numerator includes patients who at hospital discharge have been offered high-intensity statin or have been offered moderate-intensity statin with documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing high-intensity statin, with "offered" meaning it is prescribed or a patient reason exception is documented. The denominator is all patients 18–75 y of age discharged following a hospitalization for AMI, where AMI refers to discharges with an ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM Principal Diagnosis Code for AMI. Denominator exclusions are patients who died, left against medical advice, were discharged to hospice or had a comfort only–measures order documented, or were transferred to another hospital for inpatient care. Denominator exceptions are documentation of medical reason(s) for not prescribing a statin such as allergy or intolerance to statins.

### Contemporary patterns of discharge aspirin dosing after acute myocardial infarction in the United States: results from the national cardiovascular data registry (NCDR) [^114ghnkj]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Accumulated data suggest that low-dose aspirin after myocardial infarction (MI) may offer similar efficacy to higher dose aspirin with reduced risk of bleeding. Few data are available on contemporary aspirin dosing patterns after MI in the United States

Methods and Results

Aspirin dosing from 221 199 patients with MI (40.2% ST-segment-elevation MI) from 525 US hospitals enrolled in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's (NCDR's) Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get with the Guidelines were described, overall and in clinically relevant subgroups. High-dose aspirin was defined as 325 mg and low dose as 81 mg. Between January 2007 and March 2011, 60.9% of patients with acute MI were discharged on high-dose aspirin, 35.6% on low-dose aspirin, and 3.5% on other doses. High-dose aspirin was prescribed at discharge to 73.0% of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and 44.6% of patients managed medically. Among 9075 patients discharged on aspirin, thienopyridine, and warfarin, 44.0% were prescribed high-dose aspirin. Patients with an in-hospital major bleeding event were also frequently discharged on high-dose aspirin (56.7%). A 25-fold variation in the proportion prescribed high-dose aspirin at discharge was observed across participating centers.

Conclusions

Most US patients with MI continue to be discharged on high-dose aspirin. Although aspirin dosing after percutaneous coronary intervention largely reflected prevailing guidelines before 2012, high-dose aspirin was prescribed with similar frequency in medically managed patients and to those in categories expected to be at high risk for bleeding. Wide variability in the proportional use of high-dose aspirin across centers suggests significant influence from local practice habits and uncertainty about appropriate aspirin dosing.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117HGRAQ]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Postdischarge follow-up and systems of care in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — transition from hospital to home is described as high risk because approximately 1 in 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge; hospital-initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year as well as a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and multicomponent integrated care with ≥ 2 quality improvement strategies has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause hospitalization. Populations particularly at risk for readmission include women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services, and transition care interventions and programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative or the AMI Toolkit provide resources to decrease readmission rates and improve medication and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) adherence through increased provider communication and care coordination.

### Associations of kidney function with cardiovascular medication use after myocardial infarction [^116ByTWZ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

It is unknown whether adherence to recommended medications after myocardial infarction (MI) differs by kidney function.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a retrospective cohort study of older patients who were discharged after MI in two Eastern states between 1995 and 2004. Patients were categorized as having ESRD, having chronic kidney disease (CKD), and being free from diagnosed CKD. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta blockers (BB), and statins was assessed within 30 d after discharge. Good adherence was defined as proportion of days covered > 80% during the first year after discharge.

Results

Compared with patients with no CKD, patients with CKD had 22% lower adjusted use of ACEI/ARB but similar rates of BB and statin use. Patients with ESRD experienced 43% lower ACEI/ARB and 17% lower statin use. Only 64% (BB), 57% (statins), and 54% (ACEI/ARB) of patients had good 1-yr adherence. Adherence was similar between patients with CKD and with no CKD for all study drugs. Fewer patients with ESRD had good adherence to BB.

Conclusions

With the exception of lower ACEI/ARB use in patients with CKD, we found no differences between patients with CKD and with no CKD in their use of and adherence to these cardiovascular medications after MI. Patients with ESRD experienced lower use of ACEI/ARB and statins and lower adherence to BB regimens. Postulated differences in medication use after MI across levels of kidney function are unlikely to explain the observed differences in long-term outcomes.

### Cumulative adherence to secondary prevention guidelines and mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^113TcW41]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

As an observational study, there is the potential for residual confounding that may influence our results. However, we present both unadjusted and fully adjusted models that controlled for observed baseline and time‐updated comorbidities, laboratory results, prescriptions and vital signs, recurrent AMI events, and a high‐dimensional propensity score. Our comprehensive electronic medical record system allows for complete follow‐up for these patient‐related factors, providing the opportunity to adjust for potential confounders across many clinical care domains at baseline and during follow‐up. After adjustment, our results make clear that the monotonic relationship between achieving each additional guideline recommendation and mortality, although attenuated, remains both clinically and statistically significant across the entire range of adherence.

Previous studies have examined whether guideline metrics at AMI admission, such as door‐to‐balloon time and other acute interventions, affect long‐term outcomes, 29 but little evidence exists about postdischarge adherence to multiple diverse elements of guideline‐directed therapy. Prior work has focused on the impact of limited specific medications or classes but has not examined risk factor control or lifestyle interventions, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 30 have relied on self‐reported outcomes rather than clinical data from electronic medical records, 31 or have examined international settings, which may not be generalizable to the United States. 31 To our knowledge, none have examined the association of combining multiple elements of guideline recommendations across varied clinical domains with long‐term mortality. Furthermore, since our source population included > 4.4 million people (≈1.5% of the US population) receiving care within a large integrated healthcare delivery system, our findings are more likely to be representative of real‐world outcomes compared with those in clinical trial volunteer samples, select patient registries, or tertiary care/referral practice settings.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^115YPDAK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Population 2 and 3 Outcomes: β‐Blocker at 1 and 3 Years

At 1 year, the data of 1946 patients were available. Of the patients, 69% received β‐blockers at 1 year, and again, they had more favorable clinical characteristics that slightly differed from those at discharge (Table 1). In the Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis, the patients with β‐blockers at 1 year had lower 5‐year all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths (Figure 3 B and 3 E). However, in the Cox model, β‐blocker prescription was not associated with survival after adjustment for significant covariates; RAS inhibitors and statins were beneficial, and hypertension was hazardous.

At 3 years, the data of 1179 patients were available. Similarly, patients with β‐blocker prescription (63.8%) had better clinical characteristics than those without β‐blocker prescription (Table 1). However, the difference between the groups was markedly smaller than that at discharge or 1 year. Once again, patients with β‐blocker prescription at 3 years had a lower 5‐year all‐cause mortality in the Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis (Figure 3 C and 3 F). Nevertheless, in the Cox model after adjustment, β‐blocker use was not associated with reduced all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, whereas hypertension, RAS inhibitors, and statins were a significant predictor of 5‐year mortality.

Subgroup Analysis

The effect of β‐blockers may be dependent on comorbidities, such as LV dysfunction and hypertension; thus, we performed an exploratory subgroup analysis. We found no significant interaction between β‐blockers and various subgroups at discharge. In population 2, among the patients < 65 years and those who were receiving RAS inhibitors, the β‐blocker prescription seemed to be beneficiary. In population 3, β‐blockers showed a protective effect only in the patients < 65 years (Figure 4).

### Adherence tradeoff to multiple preventive therapies and all-cause mortality after acute myocardial infarction [^114wEfAM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers and statins are recommended after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients may adhere to some, but not all, therapies.

Objectives

The authors investigated the effect of tradeoffs in adherence to ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins on survival among older people after AMI.

Methods

The authors identified 90,869 Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years of age who had prescriptions for ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins, and survived ≥ 180 days after AMI hospitalization in 2008 to 2010. Adherence was measured by proportion of days covered (PDC) during 180 days following hospital discharge. Mortality follow-up extended up to 18 months after this period. The authors used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios of mortality for groups adherent to 2, 1, or none of the therapies versus group adherent to all 3 therapies.

Results

Only 49% of the patients adhered (PDC ≥ 80%) to all 3 therapies. Compared with being adherent to all 3 therapies, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for mortality were 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.21) for being adherent to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and beta-blockers only, 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91 to 1.07) for ACEI/ARBs and statins only, 1.17 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.25) beta-blockers and statins only, 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.32) for ACE inhibitors/ARBs only, 1.32 (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.44) for beta-blockers only, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.15 to 1.38) statins only, and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.54 to 1.76) for being nonadherent (PDC < 80%) to all 3 therapies.

Conclusions

Patients adherent to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and statins only had similar mortality rates as those adherent to all 3 therapies, suggesting limited additional benefit for beta-blockers in patients who were adherent to statins and ACE inhibitors/ARBs. Nonadherence to ACE inhibitors/ARBs and/or statins was associated with higher mortality.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112EESgH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) ongoing therapy and risk modification — For patients with known or newly diagnosed CAD or ischemia, "secondary prevention therapies, including aspirin and lipid-lowering therapy, should be initiated", and "Beta-blockers may be beneficial, particularly among patients with angina, tachyarrhythmias, and confirmed CAD". In those with symptoms, "antianginal medications should be adjusted", and "Treatments for cardiovascular comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, should also be optimized according to prevention guidelines". In obstructive CAD, "revascularization may be considered on a case-by-case basis", while if CAD or ischemia is excluded, "aspirin and lipid-lowering therapy should be implemented in those who meet treatment indications… ", and broader "cardiovascular risk factors… should be addressed and optimized".

### Association between medication adherence and 1-year major cardiovascular adverse events after acute myocardial infarction in China [^113iCceM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study also identified potential for improved quality of care at the hospital level. There were 6.1% of patients who were not prescribed any of the 5 targeted medications at discharge or during the follow‐up period. The observed rate of postdischarge major cardiovascular adverse events was 3 times higher for these patients when compared with those prescribed at least 1 of the 5 targeted medications. Although many of the patients who were not prescribed medications died shortly after discharge, the 75th percentile of survival time was 59 days postdischarge for these patients, indicating potential to prescribe secondary preventive medications up to 2 months after discharge. It is possible that some of the events could have been delayed or prevented if the patients had been provided with guideline‐directed medications. Overall, the process of care can be improved for patients with AMI in China. For example, a study of 1663 AMI patients discharged from 13 hospitals in Beijing in 2005 found that in‐hospital mortality was 8.2%; the rates of guideline‐based medications for AMI at discharge were 93.6% for aspirin, 78.7% for β‐blockers, 85.4% for low molecular weight heparin, 85.1% for ACEIs/ARBs, and 74.7% for statins. 26 Another study that included 2128 AMI patients across 20 tertiary hospitals in Heilongjiang Province in 2009 to 2010 found that in‐hospital mortality was 7.7%, and the rates of guideline‐based medications for AMI were 71.6% for aspirin, 41.3% for β‐blockers, 82.5% for clopidogrel, 63.5% for ACEIs/ARBs, and 80.4% for statins. 27 It is clear that national efforts are needed to improve quality of care and increase the rates of guideline‐recommended medications at the hospital level.

### Pharmacological treatment following myocardial infarction: how large is the gap between guideline recommendations and routine clinical care? [^111bNSTM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

By now, more than one decade has passed since publication of guideline‐relevant landmark studies investigating the prognostic role of important pharmacotherapies (ie, beta blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [MRA]) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. However, because of improvement of the nationwide healthcare supply, revascularization strategies of coronary artery disease, and increasing supply of invasive cardiac devices (such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy), mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have significantly decreased. As a consequence, characteristics and comorbidities of patients admitted to hospital have changed, leading to a higher number of older patients with increasing rates of progressive heart failure, complex coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Curiously, whether one of these established pharmacotherapies may still affect prognosis in patients with current complex heart failure syndromes has not yet been reevaluated within further randomized controlled trials. Therefore, European guidelines demand registry data to reassess the prognostic impact of established pharmacotherapies nowadays. To further close this gap in literature, Goldberger et al and Wong et al investigated the prognostic impact of beta blockers and their appropriate dose, as well as the current use and guideline adherence of MRA treatment in patients with AMI within this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA). Goldberger et al analyzed retrospectively more than 3,000 patients originally enrolled in the OBTAIN (Outcomes of Beta‐blocker Therapy After Myocardial Infarction) registry (2007–2011) using propensity score matched cohorts. They demonstrated lowest mortality rates in the presence of beta blocker intake of at least 12.5% to 25% of recommended target dosages at a median follow‐up of one year. Their findings are in line with results from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web‐System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry (2006–2015) demonstrating target dosages at more than 50% than recommended were not associated with improved freedom from re‐infarction or all‐cause mortality. Despite the utmost importance of the findings by Goldberger and colleagues further studies will be necessary to provide robust data on the best duration of beta blocker therapy, especially in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The common indications for heart failure pharmacotherapies are based on the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and patients' symptoms. However, one may wonder whether this still appropriate in the complex heart failure patient with different underlying aetiologies and multi‐modal treatments.

### New recommendations from the 1999 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines [^113wPcCs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113bYSBc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Early discharge after myocardial infarction — among low-risk ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality; the Zwolle score has been recommended as a clinical tool to help identify low-risk patients (score ≤ 3) who can potentially be discharged earlier (48 to 72 hours). Small retrospective studies suggest safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative, and patients considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support; hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Risk factor management after myocardial infarction: reported adherence and outcomes [^111tuNRe]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Providing patients with documented discharge instructions is a performance measure of health care quality. It is not well known how often cardiac patients comply with the list of instructions or what their association is with health status outcomes after an acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

Acute myocardial infarction patients (N = 2,498) were prospectively enrolled into a 19-center study and asked, at 1 month, if they had recalled receiving instructions at discharge on any of the 13 secondary prevention behaviors (eg, exercise, medications, diet, and smoking). Adherence, defined as the percentage of relevant activities patients reported adhering to at 1 month, was grouped into 4 categories: poor (0%-49%), partial (50%-74%), careful (75%-99%), and very careful (100%).

Results

A total of 2,046 patients completed 1-month interviews and received instruction on at least 1 risk factor management (RFM) behavior. Very careful adherence at 1-month was reported most frequently with "taking medications as prescribed" (94%). In multivariable-adjusted models, patients who reported being poorly adherent were 58% more likely to report angina at 1 year as compared with those who very carefully followed RFM (relative risk 1.58, 95% CI 1.05–2.37). There was no independent association between RFM behavior and quality of life, physical functioning, rehospitalization, or mortality.

Conclusions

There is substantial variation in the types of RFM to which acute myocardial infarction patients adhere. In aggregate, stronger adherence was associated with less angina at 1 year. More research is needed to understand adherence patterns and its association with outcomes.

### Timing of postdischarge follow-up and medication adherence after MI… [^113Luf1F]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Medication adherence was defined as the proportion of days with more than 80% coverage using Medicare Part D prescription fill records and was examined at 90 days and 1 year after discharge for β-blockers, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Approximately 1 million Americans are hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction annually; of these, 470 000 are expected to have a recurrent major adverse cardiovascular event. 1 Current guidelines recommend secondary prevention with aspirin, β-blockers, statins, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, all of which have demonstrated long-term survival benefits for post-AMI patients. 2 However, nonadherence to these medications following AMI occurs frequently and is associated with increased risks of mortality and hospital readmission. 3, 4.

Using Medicare Part D prescription filling data, which includes drug name, dosage, date dispensed, and days supplied, we assessed adherence to the following guideline-recommended secondary prevention medication classes among those prescribed at index AMI discharge: β-blocker, statin, platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and ACEI or ARB. As shown in Figure 1, even when the medications were prescribed at discharge, adherence to each of the evidence-based medications was low. Adherence rates at 90 days and 1 year after discharge were 68. 7% and
61. 1%, respectively, for β-blockers, 63. 8% and
54. 4% for ACEIs or ARBs, 63. 4% and
55. 8% for statins, and 64. 2% and
63. 5% for platelet P2Y12 inhibitors. Lower adherence for patients with follow-up more than 6 weeks after discharge was observed for all medication classes included in our study.

A prior study29 showed that patients with AMI whose follow-up visits were within 30 days of hospital discharge had higher usage rates of β-blockers at 6 months compared with those who did not have a follow-up visit within this period, but usage rates of statins, aspirin, and ACEIs or ARBs were similar. In our study, Medicare Part D prescription-filling data provided a more objective quantification of post-AMI medication adherence — more than just patient self-reported use.

### The association between guideline-based treatment instructions at the point of discharge and lower 1-year mortality in Medicare patients after acute myocardial infarction: the American college of cardiology's guidelines applied in practice (GAP) initiative in Michigan [^114b4vuu]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology's Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP) initiative for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been shown to increase the use of guideline-based therapies and improve outcomes in patients with AMI. It is unknown whether hospitals that are more successful in using the standard discharge contract — a key component of GAP that emphasizes guideline-based medications, lifestyle modification, and follow-up planning — experience a proportionally greater improvement in patient outcomes.

Methods

Medicare patients treated for AMI in all 33 participating GAP hospitals in Michigan were enrolled. We aggregated the hospitals into 3 tertiles based on the rates of discharge contract use: 0% to 8.4% (tertile 1), > 8.4% to 38.0% (tertile 2), and > 38.0% to 61.1% (tertile 3). We analyzed 1-year follow-up mortality both pre- and post-GAP and compared the mortality decline post-GAP with discharge contract use according to tertile.

Results

There were 1368 patients in the baseline (pre-GAP) cohort and 1489 patients in the post-GAP cohort. After GAP implementation, mortality at 1 year decreased by 1.2% (P = 0.71), 1.2% (P = 0.68), and 6.0% (P = 0.03) for tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, discharge contract use was significantly associated with decreased 1-year mortality in tertile 2 (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.22–0.84) and tertile 3 (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.27–0.75).

Conclusions

Increased hospital utilization of the standard discharge contract as part of the GAP program is associated with decreased 1-year mortality in Medicare patient populations with AMI. Hospital efforts to promote adherence to guideline-based care tools such as the discharge contract used in GAP may result in mortality reductions for their patient populations at 1 year.

### Clopidogrel discontinuation after acute coronary syndromes: frequency, predictors and associations with death and myocardial infarction – a hospital registry-primary care linked cohort (MINAP-GPRD) [^111KBrto]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Patients

The patient flow diagram (Figure 1) shows the number of patients included in the study, with reasons for exclusion. A total of 23 740 patients in the linked MINAP–GPRD dataset included those with non-ACS diagnoses and those outside the study period, and those not meeting the inclusion criteria (Figure 1): 7543 met inclusion criteria for this study. Specifically, these were patients aged ≥ 40, discharged from hospital to home from 2003 onwards with a diagnosis of NSTEMI or STEMI. Patient characteristics, stratified by discharge diagnosis and receipt of a primary care prescription for clopidogrel within 3 months of discharge, are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Only 68.6% of patients with NSTEMI, and 62.8% of patients with STEMI, received a primary care clopidogrel prescription in the first 3 months. Clopidogrel discontinuation, after the first prescription, was substantially more frequent compared with statins, both for NSTEMI and for STEMI (Figure 2).

Clopidogrel prescription within first 3 months: temporal trends

The adjusted odds of receiving a primary care clopidogrel prescription (Figure 3) in the first 3 months increased from 1.45 (95% CI, 1.11–1.89) in 2004 to 5.78 (95% CI, 4.20–7.96) in 2009. The odds were higher in younger age groups, and decreased progressively with advancing age: age 70–79 years, 0.64 (95% CI, 0.47–0.85); 80+ years, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.39–0.71) compared with age 40–49 years. In patients managed with percutaneous intervention during the hospital admission, the odds of receiving a clopidogrel prescription were substantially higher, 6.19 (4.80–7.99), compared with patients in whom no coronary intervention was performed. Clopidogrel prescribing increased over time from 35% in 2003 to 79% in 2009.

Table 2
Crude Rates of Initiation of ACE-Inhibitors, Beta-Blockers, Statins and All Three Medicines in the 120 Days Post-Discharge from Hospital for AMI

Tables 3 and 4 present adjusted odds ratios modeling the relationship between income quintile and likelihood of initiation of treatment with ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins and all three medicines in the 120 days post-discharge from hospital after first AMI in men and women, respectively. After age, general health status and urban residence were accounted for, men in the third income quintile or higher were significantly more likely to initiate ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins than men in the first income quintile. Men in the fifth income quintile had 37%, 50% and 71% higher odds of initiating ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, respectively, than those in the lowest income quintile [OR = 1.37 95% CI (1.24, 1.51); OR = 1.50 95% CI (1.35, 1.68); and OR = 1.71 95% CI (1.53, 190)]. Adhering with treatment guidelines and initiating all three medicines was significantly more likely for men in the 4th and 5th income quintiles [OR = 1.12 95% CI (1.02, 1.24) and OR = 1.30 95% CI (1.18, 1.43)].

### Clinical use and effectiveness of colchicine for secondary prevention following acute myocardial infarction [^117WrA2v]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials investigating colchicine for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have yielded conflicting results, and the real-world use and effectiveness of colchicine in this context remains unknown. As such, we sought to evaluate the use of colchicine following AMI in clinical practice and the associated outcomes. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with AMI and longitudinally followed in a large academic health system between 2018–2024 to describe the clinical use of colchicine for secondary prevention following AMI, as well as patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics associated with colchicine use. Next, using both multivariable logistic regression models with and without propensity matching, we examined the association between colchicine prescription following AMI and composite cardiovascular outcomes (comprised of recurrent AMI, any revascularization, stroke, and death). Kaplan-Meier Event-free Survival Analysis and Cox Proportional Hazards Models were performed. Of 1,796, 126 (7.0%) were prescribed colchicine after AMI. There was no association between use of colchicine and the composite cardiovascular events in either standard multivariable adjusted (Odds Ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.66–1.50, P = 0.99) or propensity matched models (0.98, 0.57–1.66, P = 0.93). There was no difference in event-free survival between patients who were prescribed colchicine and those who were not. In summary, we report the first real-world data on the use and effectiveness of colchicine for prevention of cardiovascular events after AMI. Colchicine was infrequently prescribed for this indication and was not associated with lower rates of subsequent cardiovascular events.

### It's not too late to improve statin adherence: association between changes in statin adherence from before to after acute myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality [^1119x9La]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of the index AMI included type of AMI (subendocardial or transmural), procedures (coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent, cardiac catheterization, angiocardiography, and infusion of platelet inhibitors), and complications (cardiogenic shock, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, acute renal failure, and heart failure). Additionally, length of the index hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit and/or coronary care unit, and consultation from a cardiologist were measured.

Outpatient follow‐up with a cardiologist and/or primary care provider was measured in the 30 days after hospital discharge. 5 Hospitalizations for AMI and stroke were also measured from the index discharge date for 6 months. Use of secondary prevention medications during this same 6‐month period was also assessed, including measures for ACE inhibitors/angiotensinreceptor blockers, β‐blockers, P2Y 12 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists (having at least 1 prescription claim for the medication class during the index AMI hospital stay or within 180 days after discharge). Finally, change in the simvastatin‐equivalent average daily dose was calculated (6‐month post‐AMI average daily dose minus 6‐month pre‐AMI average daily dose). 5

Statistical Analyses

Distributions of patient characteristics were described. Additionally, the distribution of changes in statin adherence — stratified by pre‐AMI statin adherence — was described. All multivariable analyses (survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models) assessing the association between change in statin adherence and all‐cause mortality were adjusted for all variables described in the Patient Characteristics section above; multivariable analyses assessing the association between post‐AMI statin adherence and all‐cause mortality were adjusted for these same variables, as well as pre‐AMI statin adherence.

To visualize the association of statin adherence and all‐cause mortality after an AMI hospitalization in a familiar way, direct adjusted survival curves 8 for the outcome of all‐cause mortality were plotted, stratified by post‐AMI statin adherence (3 curves). To show the importance of changes in statin adherence on this association, another set of direct adjusted survival curves was plotted, stratified by change in statin adherence from pre‐ to post‐AMI (9 curves). The adjusted survival probabilities with 95% CIs at 1‐year of follow‐up were also estimated for both sets of survival curves.

### Impact of in-hospital quality of care improvement initiative on secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome in six months after patient discharge: a large stepped wedge-and cluster-randomized controlled trial [^111S9EKm]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The main outcomes in the present study include a patient-level composite preventive medications use score at discharge, the preventive medications use score at 6 months after discharge and the 6-month risk of MACE. The patient-level composite persistent preventive medications use score was derived as an exploratory outcome. Preventive medications considered in the present study include aspirin, clopidogrel, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins. The composite preventive medications use score at discharge and at 6 months after discharge were calculated as the number of secondary prevention medications from each class (maximum 5) that were actually taken by the patient divided by the number of guideline-recommended secondary medications – at the specified time point, then multiplied by 100. The persistent preventive medications use score was defined as number of preventive medications that were taken by the patient at both discharge and 6 months, divided by the number of guideline-recommended secondary medications, then multiplied by 100. MACE was defined as a composite outcome including all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. Nonfatal myocardial infarction was defined as re-hospitalization due to myocardial infarction diagnosed on symptoms/signs and at least one of electrocardiographic or cardiac biomarker change. Nonfatal stroke after discharge was defined as re-hospitalization due to stroke diagnosed on symptoms/signs and brain computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. All reported MACEs were adjudicated by an independent committee masked to the hospital's randomization status.

Data Quality Control

A trained hospital staff member who was not involved in treating patients with ACS was responsible for collecting and entering data into a dedicated web-based data management system. Follow-up data were collected by trained staff using a standard questionnaire, referring to the medical charts if the patient was hospitalized, and blinded to hospital randomization. Data quality was maintained through in-person and online study monitoring activities.

### Identification of hospital cardiac services for acute myocardial infarction using individual patient discharge data [^114QfkZ6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Data Sources

We derived administrative data from the Premier Healthcare Database, which contains data on more than 585 million cumulative discharges (75 million cumulative hospital inpatient discharges and 510 million outpatient discharges). There are ≈850 hospitals in Premier's research database, which vary in geography, bed size, and teaching status. In addition to information available in the standard hospital discharge file, the Premier database contains a date‐stamped log of all billed items at the patient level, including diagnostic tests, medications, and therapeutic services. This database has been used in previous studies to determine outcomes (costs, length of stay, mortality, and readmission) and treatment use at hospitals. 7, 8, 9, 10

In addition, we used data from the 2010 AHA annual survey. This data source is updated annually and contains over 1000 data fields that include self‐reported descriptions of hospital organizational structures and services. 5

Study Design

We included Premier hospitals with at least 25 AMI inpatient cases in a 3‐year period (2009–2011). AMI patients were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) codes 410.xx, excluding those with 410.x2 (AMI, subsequent episode‐of‐care), from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011.

To identify essential services, we first determined the services required to deliver AMI care by reviewing class I, IIa, and IIb American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology clinical guidelines for ST segment elevated myocardial infarction and Non‐ST‐elevation acute coronary syndromes. 11 Any service that was deemed necessary to provide each guideline recommendation was included in the analysis. The resulting 35 services were then grouped into the following 4 service categories: acute care, diagnostic and procedural care, inpatient management, and secondary prevention. Any prehospital services were excluded from the analysis.

### Improving medication optimisation in left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction [^111n68D5]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Fifty-seven patients with moderate or severe post-MI LVSD were identified. Baseline overall use of ACEI (or ARB) was 89% (n = 51/57). The mean percentage of ACEI (or ARB) target dose was 44%, with 21% (n = 12/57) of patients achieving the full target dose. Baseline use of beta-blocker was 82% (n = 47/57). The mean percentage of beta-blocker target dose was 31%, with 7% (n = 4/57) of patients achieving the full target dose.

The Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Time-limited aim of our programme was to improve the use and target dosing of ACEI (or ARB) and beta-blocker in all patients with LVSD secondary to incident acute MI across a large regional health authority by the end of a patient's cardiac rehabilitation programme, typically within 4 months of discharge from hospital, through pharmacist-led clinics and cardiology multidisciplinary team collaboration.

### Rationale and design of the affordability and real-world antiplatelet treatment effectiveness after myocardial infarction study (ARTEMIS): a multicenter, cluster-randomized trial of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor copayment reduction after myocardial infarction [^113qKVif]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction (MI) can reduce risks of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of all-cause death, recurrent MI, and stroke), yet medication persistence is suboptimal. Although copayment cost has been implicated as a factor influencing medication persistence, it remains unclear whether reducing or eliminating these costs can improve medication persistence and/or downstream clinical outcomes.

Design

ARTEMIS is a multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial designed to examine whether eliminating patient copayment for P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy affects medication persistence and clinical outcomes. We will enroll approximately 11,000 patients hospitalized for acute ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation MI at 300 hospitals. Choice and duration of treatment with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor will be determined by the treating physician. Hospitals randomized to the copayment intervention will provide vouchers to cover patients' copayments for their P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for up to 1 year after discharge. The coprimary end points are 1-year P2Y12 receptor inhibitor persistence and major adverse cardiovascular events. Secondary end points include choice of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, patient-reported outcomes, and postdischarge cost of care.

Conclusion

ARTEMIS will be the largest randomized assessment of a medication copayment reduction intervention on medication persistence, clinical outcomes, treatment selection, and cost of care after acute MI.

3 Results

3.1 Baseline Characteristics

The study population consisted of 1467 patients with STEMI, of whom 1070 (73%) were men and 397 (27%) women. Women were older as compared to men (74 years vs. 65 years, p < 0.001), and had lower haemoglobin levels than men (8.0 vs. 8.9 mmol/l, p < 0.001). Women more often had hypertension and heart failure. In addition, a higher percentage of women had a prior stroke, and less often had an out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest than men. During hospitalisation, they were less likely to undergo coronary angiography, PCI and CABG than men, see Table 1.

Table 1
Patient characteristics.

3.2 Primary Outcome

Women were significantly less often prescribed cEBM post‐discharge than men (66.0% vs. 72.8%, p = 0.013). Specifically, ACEi or ARB (82.1% vs. 87.8% of men, p = 0.007) and statins or ezetimibe (90.2% vs. 95.2%, p < 0.001) were less often prescribed to women compared to men. Among women and men, non‐statistically significant differences were found in the prescription of acetylsalicylic acid, P2Y12 inhibitors and beta‐blockers at discharge, see Figure 1.

### Encouraging trends in acute myocardial infarction survival in the oldest old [^115XbGHR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data informing the optimal treatment strategy for acute myocardial infarction in the oldest old (aged ≥ 85 years). The study aim was to examine whether decade-long increases in guideline-based cardiac medication use mediate declines in post-discharge mortality among oldest old patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

The study sample included 1137 patients aged ≥ 85 years hospitalized in 6 biennial periods between 1997 and 2007 for acute myocardial infarction at all 11 greater Worcester, Massachusetts, medical centers. We examined trends in 90-day survival after hospital discharge and guideline-based medication use (aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents) for acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization and at discharge. Sequential multivariable Cox regression models examined the relationship among guideline-based medication use, study year, and 90-day post-discharge survival rates.

Results

Patients hospitalized between 2003 and 2007 experienced higher 90-day survival rates than those hospitalized between 1997 and 2001 (69.1% vs 59.8%, P < .05). Between 1997 and 2007, the average number of guideline-based medications prescribed at discharge increased significantly (1.8 to 2.9, P < .001). The unadjusted hazard ratio for 90-day post-discharge mortality in 2003–2007 compared with 1997–2001 was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.89); after adjustment for patient characteristics and guideline-based cardiac medication use, this relationship was no longer significant (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.58).

Conclusions

Between 1997 and 2007, 90-day survival improved among a population-based sample of patients aged ≥ 85 years hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction. This encouraging trend was explained by increased use of guideline-based medications.

### Evidence-based optimal medical therapy and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention [^115wfXeK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The secondary prevention with pharmacologic therapy is essential for preventing recurrent cardiovascular events in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction. Guideline‐based optimal medical therapy (OMT) for patients with acute myocardial infarction consists of antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, β‐blockers, and statins. We aimed to determine the prescription rate of OMT use at discharge and to evaluate the impact of OMT on long‐term clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in the drug‐eluting stent era using nationwide cohort data.

Methods and Results

Using the National Health Insurance claims data in South Korea, patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug‐eluting stent between July 2013 and June 2017 were enrolled. A total of 35 972 patients were classified into the OMT and non‐OMT groups according to the post–percutaneous coronary intervention discharge medication. The primary end point was all‐cause death, and the 2 groups were compared using a propensity‐score matching analysis. Fifty‐seven percent of patients were prescribed OMT at discharge. During the follow‐up period (median, 2.0 years [interquartile range, 1.1–3.2 years]), OMT was associated with a significant reduction in the all‐cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76–0.90]; P < 0.001) and composite outcome of death or coronary revascularization (aHR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.85–0.93]; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

OMT was prescribed at suboptimal rates in South Korea. However, our nationwide cohort study showed that OMT has a benefit for long‐term clinical outcomes on all‐cause mortality and composite outcome of death or coronary revascularization after percutaneous coronary intervention in the drug‐eluting stent era.

### Longitudinal persistence with secondary prevention therapies relative to patient risk after myocardial infarction [^1126MH1s]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prior studies have demonstrated that patients with high-risk acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are less likely to receive guideline-directed medications during hospitalisation. It is unknown if this paradox persists following discharge. We aimed to assess if persistence with guideline-directed medications post discharge varies by patients' risk following AMI.

Methods

Data were analysed from two prospective, multicentre US AMI registries. The primary outcome was persistence with all prescribed guideline-directed medications (aspirin, β-blockers, statins, angiotensin-antagonists) at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge. The association between risk and medication persistence post discharge was assessed using multivariable mixed-effect models.

Results

Among 6434 patients with AMI discharged home, 2824 were considered low-risk, 2014 intermediate-risk and 1596 high-risk for death based upon their Global Registry of Acute Coronary Event (GRACE) 6-month risk score. High-risk was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving all appropriate therapies at discharge compared with low-risk patients (relative risk (RR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.94). At 12 months, the rate of persistence with all prescribed therapies was 61.5%, 57.9% and 45.9% among low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, high-risk was associated with lower persistence with all prescribed medications (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.92) over follow-up. Similar associations were seen for individual medications. Over the 5years of the study, persistence with prescribed therapies post discharge improved modestly among high-risk patients (RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.08 per year).

Conclusions

High-risk patients with AMI have a lower likelihood of persistently taking prescribed medications post discharge as compared with low-risk patients. Continued efforts are needed to improve the use of guideline-directed medications in high-risk patients.

### Association between preadmission functional status and use and effectiveness of secondary prevention medications in elderly survivors of acute myocardial infarction [^1137M49L]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether function-related indicators (FRIs), derived from preadmission claims data, help explain the frequent practice of forgoing secondary prevention medications observed in Medicare.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

National Medicare data.

Participants

Elderly Medicare beneficiaries discharged alive from an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalization in 2007–2008 (N = 184,156).

Measurements

Study outcomes were number of guideline-recommended secondary prevention medications (statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) used after discharge and 12-month survival. Preadmission data (FRIs, cardiovascular conditions, comorbid conditions), type of AMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, anterior, other), and procedures and complications during the hospitalization were from claims data.

Results

Function-related indicators (FRIs) were common before admission; 50% of individuals had at least one (range 0–11). After discharge, 85.8% used at least one class of guideline medication, and 30.2% used all three; 19.6% died within 12 months. Each additional FRI reduced the likelihood of receiving all three medication classes by 5% (adjusted odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94–0.96) and increased 12-month mortality by 20% (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.19–1.21). Individuals taking all three classes of medication were 30% less likely to die within 12 months than those not taking guideline medications (aHR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.67–0.73). Similar survival benefit was observed in individuals with and without functional impairments.

Conclusion

Greater impairment in preadmission functional status, using a measure derived from claims data, was associated with less use of secondary prevention medications after AMI. Survival benefits of taking these medications were consistent across functional impairment levels.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^113eYSs7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Population 1 Outcomes: β‐Blocker at Hospital Discharge

Overall, 320 patients died during a median follow‐up of 1364 days (interquartile range, 784–2190 days). The mortality rate for each time point is presented in Table 2. The patients who were receiving β‐blockers at discharge had lower 5‐year all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality than those without β‐blocker prescription (Figure 3 A and 3 D). In the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis after adjustment for significant covariates, β‐blocker use was associated with a 29% reduced risk of 5‐year all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–0.91; P = 0.008) and 36% reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P = 0.035) (Table 3). Body mass index, the use of RAS inhibitors, statins, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery were associated with reduced mortality, whereas advanced age, diabetes mellitus, previous cardiovascular disease, low LV dysfunction, and creatinine level were associated with increased mortality.

### Myocardial infarction: contemporary management strategies [^117TefNj]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common clinical diagnosis, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, not only in the short term, but also years following the index event. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MI has ushered the era of multipronged treatment approach, with a combination of goal-directed revascularization, a broad adjunctive pharmacological therapy and aggressive secondary prevention measures. The goals of this article are to review the basic pathophysiological processes, which lead up to a clinical diagnosis of MI, to highlight the essential elements of clinical presentation and to summarize the evidence for comprehensive therapy. Emphasis has been placed on the choice of primary reperfusion therapy for ST-elevation MI, on risk-stratification of patients with non-ST elevation MI, and on rationale behind the selection of anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, evidence-based approach to secondary prevention is outlined.

### Comparing clinical and administrative data for profiling hospitals on postdischarge medication use by patients with acute myocardial infarction [^1154sTdT]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postdischarge medication use is frequently used as a measure of hospital performance, with many reports produced using clinical data obtained from chart reviews. The introduction of a drug benefit program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services presents an opportunity to use administrative data for routine reporting on hospital performance. We determined the concordance between hospital-specific prescribing rates of evidence-based medical therapies obtained from clinical and administrative data in Ontario, Canada.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study using data on patients discharged from 102 hospitals in Ontario, Canada with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between April 1, 1999, and March 31, 2001. We compared hospital-specific rates of discharge prescribing in AMI patients, determined using clinical data obtained using retrospective chart review with hospital-specific rates of prescriptions filled within 30 days of hospital discharge in elderly patients using administrative data.

Results

There was a moderate agreement between hospital-specific rates of discharge prescriptions written for AMI patients in clinical data with hospital-specific rates of prescriptions filled using administrative data. Although differences in rates were, on average, small between the 2 data sources, there was moderate variation in the differences between these 2 rates across hospitals. There was very strong agreement between rates of discharge prescribing in all patients and in ideal patients with no contraindications, both determined using clinical data.

Conclusions

Post-AMI discharge prescribing in all patients determined using clinical data is an excellent proxy for prescribing in ideal patients using clinical data. However, there is weaker agreement between administrative and clinical data.

### Association of hyperlipidaemia with 5-year survival after hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction: a propensity score matched analysis [^1129wKTA]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Main findings

Our main findings in patients hospitalised for AMI were as follows: concomitant HLP, compared with no HLP was associated with higher rates of survival to hospital discharge and survival to 5 years controlling for patient-level characteristics. We also obtained precise estimates of the association between HLP and survival to determine the absolute difference in 5-year survival after AMI in patients with HLP versus no HLP. The analysis showed an absolute increase in survival and a gain in life years over 5 years among patients with HLP versus no HLP after AMI. These survival benefits of having HLP at baseline were observed in both STEMI and NSTEMI and also in patients with a prescription statin versus no prescription stain at discharge. The results were consistent across study subgroups: age, gender, race, normal versus low LVEF, revascularisation versus no revascularisation with PCI. The findings of narrow 95% CIs represent a strong prognostic significance of baseline HLP for 5-year survival. The results of this study also reaffirm the benefits of statins in secondary prevention after AMI. A third of patients with AMI were discharged with no statin prescription and only 1 in 10 received high-intensity statin therapy attributable to multiple factors. In 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III guideline recommended treating to specific LDL-C targets. However, in 2013, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) expanded statin treatment to all adults with AMI regardless of LDL-C targets. Subsequently, rates of overall and high-intensity stain prescription in rates substantially increased in the post ACC/AHA guideline period in particular. In an analysis of filled statin prescription of a large US population (> 1 million) in post ACC/AHA guideline period, only 62% had their prescription filled after a recent acute coronary syndrome. Physician and patient preferences and then practice patterns might be accountable for lower rates of statin prescription among patients with AMI between 2001 and 2011. Furthermore, in the USA, the prescription pattern of statin and statin by intensity varies with the geographical region, with current trends approaching those of continental Europe. We found that less than a third of study population had high adherence rate to statins (MPR ≥ 80%). Patients who were adherent to prescription statins 80% or more days during the 5-year of follow-up period were at lower risk of death than those with lower rates of adherence to stain. In further data analysis with other lipid fractions for 5-year mortality after index hospitalisation for AMI, only non-HDL-C, similar to LDL-C, was found to have an inverse association.
