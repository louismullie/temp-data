## Question

29 yo F with a history of hereditary angioedema (HAE), well-controlled on long-term danazol, presents with mild community-acquired pneumonia. She has a known allergy to penicillins (rash). Current meds: danazol 200 mg daily. You consider prescribing clarithromycin 500 mg BID for 10 days — safe to proceed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days is safe to prescribe for a 29-year-old woman with hereditary angioedema who is well controlled on danazol 200 mg daily and has a reported penicillin allergy with a rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and guideline-concordant therapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient with a penicillin allergy. Then, I should verify the drug–drug interaction between clarithromycin and danazol and its clinical implications. Next, I will assess the allergy risk of clarithromycin itself and whether cross-reactivity with penicillins is a concern. After that, I need to consider HAE-specific risks, including whether macrolides trigger attacks and whether any special precautions are needed. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline safer alternatives if the interaction is problematic, ensuring I double-check each claim against guidelines and labels as I go.

> Let me first confirm the indication and standard therapy. For mild community-acquired pneumonia in an outpatient without severe comorbidities, macrolides such as clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily are an accepted empiric option when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, which aligns with ATS/IDSA guidance, so the choice of clarithromycin is clinically appropriate for CAP in this scenario [^688d8fef] [^ac063e83].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction before concluding safety. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, and danazol is both a CYP3A4 substrate and itself a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor; coadministration can increase danazol exposure and heighten the risk of androgen-related adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, dyslipidemia, and thrombosis, so I should not jump to recommending the combination without mitigation or an alternative plan [^a8655a08] [^d6264904].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical significance and monitoring needs. The interaction is clinically meaningful, and while there is no absolute contraindication, the risk–benefit calculus favors avoiding the combination if alternatives exist; if clarithromycin is absolutely necessary, I would plan close monitoring for hepatic symptoms, lipid changes, and thrombotic signs, and consider dose reduction of danazol during the antibiotic course, recognizing that dose adjustments for danazol are individualized and typically titrated slowly in HAE care [^f64ae9c6] [^060b946c].

> Next, I should review the penicillin allergy issue. A nonanaphylactic rash to penicillin does not predict macrolide allergy, and macrolide hypersensitivity is uncommon, with delayed cutaneous reactions around 1% and very low rates of confirmed allergy on formal evaluation; thus, clarithromycin is not contraindicated by a penicillin rash history, though I should still screen for prior macrolide reactions before prescribing [^f4177794] [^f61b039d].

> I will now examine HAE-specific risks. Let me think about whether macrolides precipitate HAE attacks; I do not find evidence that clarithromycin directly triggers bradykinin-mediated angioedema, and infection itself is a recognized HAE trigger, so treating the infection promptly is important; however, because androgen exposure carries thrombotic and hepatic risks that could be amplified by CYP3A4 inhibition, I should be cautious and coordinate with the patient's HAE specialist if possible [^2c79ca8f] [^060b946c].

> But wait, what if we can avoid the interaction altogether. Given the CYP3A4 issue, reasonable alternatives include doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, which is guideline-supported for mild CAP and does not inhibit CYP3A4, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin if local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks allow; I should confirm local macrolide resistance and patient-specific QT or tendon risk before choosing a fluoroquinolone [^688d8fef] [^f68083c3].

> Let me reconsider the original plan. Initially, I thought clarithromycin might be fine with monitoring, but on second thought, the pharmacokinetic interaction with danazol is strong enough that avoiding clarithromycin is the safer default; if it must be used, I would coordinate with the HAE provider, temporarily reduce danazol to the lowest effective dose during the 10-day course, and monitor liver enzymes and symptoms, then return to the prior danazol dose after completion [^f64ae9c6] [^060b946c].

> Final recommendation: I should not proceed with clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days in this patient because of the significant CYP3A4 interaction with danazol that increases the risk of androgen-related adverse effects; instead, I would prescribe doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days as a guideline-concordant alternative for mild CAP, or consider a respiratory fluoroquinolone if appropriate, while ensuring she has access to on-demand HAE therapy and close follow-up during the infection [^688d8fef] [^148a145f].

It is **not safe** to co-prescribe clarithromycin with danazol because clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [^d6264904] that can markedly increase danazol levels, raising the risk of serious adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, thrombosis, and hormonal toxicity [^notfound]. If clarithromycin is necessary, **temporarily stop danazol** during the antibiotic course and use alternative CAP therapy (e.g. doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone) [^688d8fef] if macrolide resistance is high or interactions are a concern. If danazol cannot be stopped, choose a non–CYP3A4-interacting antibiotic (e.g. amoxicillin with careful monitoring or a cephalosporin if the penicillin allergy is non-anaphylactic) [^e022828d] and monitor closely for adverse effects.

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between clarithromycin and danazol

Clarithromycin is a **strong CYP3A4 inhibitor** [^d6264904] that can significantly increase danazol exposure, which is metabolized by CYP3A4. This interaction elevates the risk of danazol-related adverse effects, including:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes, cholestasis, and hepatic failure [^060b946c].
- **Thrombotic events**: Increased risk of venous thromboembolism [^302c8df4].
- **Hormonal adverse effects**: Androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no direct clinical evidence** specifically addressing the co-administration of clarithromycin and danazol; however, the pharmacokinetic interaction is well established, and guidelines advise avoiding strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with danazol when possible. The FDA warns against combining danazol with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, including macrolides like clarithromycin, due to increased toxicity risk [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Given the interaction, **consider the following alternatives**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Doxycycline | - No significant CYP3A4 interaction <br/> - Recommended for mild CAP [^688d8fef] |
| Respiratory fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) | - No significant CYP3A4 interaction <br/> - Effective for CAP [^39753d11] |
| Amoxicillin (with careful monitoring) | - Non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy may not preclude use [^e022828d] <br/> - Consider if allergy is mild and monitored [^e022828d] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

If clarithromycin is absolutely necessary, **consider the following strategies**:

- **Temporarily discontinue danazol**: Stop danazol during the clarithromycin course and resume after completion.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for signs of hepatotoxicity, thrombotic events, and hormonal adverse effects.
- **Adjust danazol dose**: If co-administration is unavoidable, consider dose reduction of danazol with close monitoring.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

It is **not safe** to co-prescribe clarithromycin with danazol due to the risk of increased danazol exposure and serious adverse effects. If clarithromycin is necessary, temporarily discontinue danazol and consider alternative antibiotics. If danazol cannot be stopped, choose a non–CYP3A4-interacting antibiotic and monitor closely for adverse effects.

### Hereditary angioedema… [^02192c2e]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Skin and visceral organs may be involved by the typically massive local edema. The most commonly involved viscera are the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Involvement of the upper airways can result in severe life-threatening symptoms, including the risk of asphyxiation, unless appropriate interventions are taken. Quantitative and functional analyses of C1 esterase inhibitor and complement components C4 and C1q should be performed when HAE is suspected. Acute exacerbations of the disease should be treated with intravenous purified C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate, where available. Intravenous administration of fresh frozen plasma is also useful in acute HAE; however, it occasionally exacerbates symptoms. Corticosteroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine can be useful adjuncts but typically are not efficacious in aborting acute attacks. Prophylactic management involves long-term use of attenuated androgens or antifibrinolytic agents.

Clinicians should keep this disorder in their differential diagnosis of unexplained, episodic cutaneous angioedema or abdominal pain. The sporadic exogenous phenomena that result in angioedema may be prevalent in up to 10% of the population. 1 Use of some drugs prescribed for common ailments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for hypertension, renal disease, and cardiac disease, can also induce an adverse reaction in apparently healthy individuals and result in angioedema. Patients with no previous history of upper airway involvement during acute HAE exacerbations still run a risk of asphyxiating. In a recent study, 11 5 of 6 individuals who asphyxiated during acute HAE had never experienced upper airway involvement during previous attacks. The time from symptom onset to asphyxiation also varies, ranging from as little as 20 minutes to as long as 14 hours.

Levels of C1-INH are also decreased further in some pregnant women with preeclampsia and eclampsia, and the role of low C1-INH levels in these conditions is currently being investigated. 19, 21 Increased attack frequency has been reported22 in association with menstruation and oral contraceptive use. Recurrent abdominal pain and upper airway and facial edema occurred in 52% and 36%, respectively, of patients in one series. 9 In 39% of these cases, patients could attribute their first episode to an identifiable traumatic event. 9 Most patients with symptomatic untreated HAE experience at least 1 acute exacerbation per month, and because each attack typically lasts a few days before spontaneously subsiding, it is estimated that individual patients can be debilitated by their symptoms for 20 to 100 days per year.
3.

The large quantity of bradykinin released during acute attacks of HAE or AAE is thought to be responsible for most symptoms by directly causing increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and contraction of nonvascular smooth muscle. By increasing capillary permeability, C3a, C4a, and C5a may also contribute to local edema of skin and visceral organs, ascites, and intravascular volume depletion.

For berotralstat, 0%, 43%, 21%, and 39% of participants aged ≥ 18 years were attack free following 28 days of treatment (62.5 mg [n = 7], 125 mg [n = 14], and 250 mg [n = 15], and 350 mg [n = 18] QD, respectively) in the phase 2 APeX-1 trial (N = 75). The absence of a significant difference in attack-free rates was reported between participants who received berotralstat 150 mg QD (n = 40), berotralstat 110 mg QD (n = 41), and placebo (n = 39) across 24 weeks in the phase 3 APeX-2 trial (N = 121). However, the absolute attack-free rates in the APeX-2 phase 3 RCT and the subsequent APeX-S open-label extension were not reported.

No RCTs that reported attack-free rates were identified in the search window for patients who received LTP with androgens or TA. In observational studies, 24%-38% of patients who received danazol and ≤ 20% of patients who received TA for ≥ 1 year were attack free (Table 2).

There was no recurrence following restart of clarithromycin for a total of 7 days or after drug challenge with clarithromycin (to exclude drug-induced AE) at a 6-week follow-up. At this time point, he had fully recovered from M pneumoniae CAP, and laboratory investigations revealed normal C4 level and C1-inhibitor level and function (to exclude hereditary AE) and normal serum tryptase levels (to exclude systemic mastocytosis). M pneumoniae -specific IgM (> 150 U/mL) and IgG (127 U/mL) antibodies remained at very high levels, which additionally supports an infection-triggered process elicited by M pneumoniae as cause of AE.

### Danazol [^f64ae9c6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Endometriosis. In moderate to severe disease, or in patients infertile due to endometriosis, a starting dose of 800 mg given in two divided doses is recommended. Amenorrhea and rapid response to painful symptoms is best achieved at this dosage level. Gradual downward titration to a dose sufficient to maintain amenorrhea may be considered depending upon patient response. For mild cases, an initial daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses is recommended and may be adjusted depending on patient response. Therapy should begin during menstruation. Otherwise, appropriate tests should be performed to ensure that the patient is not pregnant while on therapy with danazol capsules (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). It is essential that therapy continue uninterrupted for 3 to 6 months but may be extended to 9 months if necessary. After termination of therapy, if symptoms recur, treatment can be reinstituted.

Hereditary Angioedema. The dosage requirements for continuous treatment of hereditary angioedema with danazol capsules should be individualized on the basis of the clinical response of the patient. It is recommended that the patient be started on 200 mg, two or three times a day. After a favorable initial response is obtained in terms of prevention of episodes of edematous attacks, the proper continuing dosage should be determined by decreasing the dosage by 50% or less at intervals of one to three months or longer if frequency of attacks prior to treatment dictates. If an attack occurs, the daily dosage may be increased by up to 200 mg. During the dose adjusting phase, close monitoring of the patient's response is indicated, particularly if the patient has a history of airway involvement.

### Comparison of once-and twice-daily clarithromycin in the treatment of adults with severe acute lower respiratory tract infections [^c664a484]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although the modified-release (MR) formulation of clarithromycin has demonstrated bioequivalence to the immediate-release (IR) formulation and thus can be prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), a MEDLINE search from 1995 through 1998 and information on file with the manufacturer indicate that no data are available on the effectiveness of this new formulation in the treatment of severe LRTIs such as community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

This study was designed to compare clinical success rates (percentage of patients with clinical cure or improvement) with once- and twice-daily regimens of clarithromycin in the treatment of patients with severe, acute LRTIs requiring oral antibiotic therapy.

Methods

In this multicenter, investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel-group study, adult patients with clinical evidence suggesting severe, acute LRTI were recruited from 22 general practices in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either clarithromycin 500 mg BID (IR tablets) or clarithromycin 1 g OD (two 500-mg MR tablets) for 7 to 14 days. The outcome measures were resolution of or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms (including resolution of cough), unscheduled visits for the same symptom, days to resumption of normal activities, and improvements in quality of life (assessed using the EQ-5D version of the EuroQoL questionnaire). Clinical, microbiologic, and serologic assessments were performed before, during, and after treatment. Efficacy and safety data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Results

One hundred sixty men (n = 83) and women (n = 77) between the ages of 19 and 88 years took part in the study, 78 receiving clarithromycin 500 mg BID and 82 receiving clarithromycin 1 g OD. At 4 weeks after the start of treatment, the high clinical success rates were comparable between groups: 84.6% with clarithromycin 500 mg BID and 90.2% with clarithromycin 1 g OD. No significant differences in outcome measures were noted between the 2 regimens. Both treatments were well tolerated, with taste disturbance being the most commonly reported adverse event (10.6% vs 6.1% with clarithromycin 500 mg BID and 1 g OD, respectively).

Conclusions

The 2 clarithromycin regimens were equally efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of severe, acute LRTIs. However, caution should be exercised in applying these results to the general population, because the study excluded certain categories of patients who would normally be treated. In addition, the small sample size may have obscured clinically significant differences between the 2 regimens.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^5031c4d0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Macrolide hypersensitivity — skin testing and challenge protocols — nonirritating test dilutions were reported as 0.05 mg/mL and 0.01 mg/ mL, and highest nonirritating prick and intradermal concentrations were 50 mg/ mL and 0.5 mg/mL for clarithromycin and 100 mg/ mL and 0.01 mg/mL for azithromycin. Because of concerns about false-positive and false-negative reactions with macrolide skin testing, graded challenge remains the criterion standard, and clarithromycin is not available in intravenous form in the United States. Drug challenge tests remain the criterion standard, are best performed single-blinded with increasing doses every 30 minutes, and may follow a 3-dose 10%-20%-70% day 1 schedule with full-dose on day 2, extending to 5 days at a therapeutic dose for nonimmediate histories.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^f4177794]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Macrolide allergy — Allergic reactions to macrolides are less common than those to penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamide antibiotics, and fluoroquinolones, and the most common reactions are delayed cutaneous reactions that occur in about 1% of patients. When patients with convincing histories of allergic reactions undergo formal evaluation, only about 5% are confirmed to be allergic. Skin testing with macrolides is not validated or standardized because the allergenic determinants are unknown, and the utility of immediate-type skin testing using nonirritating concentrations of macrolides is uncertain.

Drug challenge for nonimmediate reactions — protocol options and caution: A drug challenge test may be considered for some nonimmediate reactions, with protocols allowing a full therapeutic dose on day 1 or incremental dosing over days to weeks. Some studies suggest giving an additional treatment course for 7 to 10 days after the full therapeutic dose to sufficiently exclude a nonimmediate reaction, though this approach may expose patients with a history of benign reactions to an unnecessary therapeutic course of penicillin.

Macrolide cross-reactivity and desensitization — cross-reactivity among different macrolides has not been extensively studied, but when it was tested, most patients with a demonstrated hypersensitivity to a certain macrolide could tolerate another with a different number of atoms in the lactone ring. Double positivity was reported in 2 patients with clinical histories of anaphylaxis to clarithromycin (14-C) and azithromycin (15-C). Macrolide antibiotics are unlikely to cross-react with macrolide immunosuppressants, such as 23-C tacrolimus and 29-C sirolimus. Very few desensitization protocols have been published, including to clarithromycin in 2 patients, and there are no reports to date for other commonly prescribed macrolides such as azithromycin and/or erythromycin.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^f36fa100]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) short-term prophylaxis — Summary Statement 20: Short-term prophylaxis can be achieved by using fresh frozen plasma, C1INH replacement, or short-term, high-dose anabolic androgen therapy. (B). Traditional plasma regimens include solvent/detergent-treated plasma or fresh frozen plasma 2 U, or 10 mL/kg for children, administered several hours up to 12 hours before the expected procedure. Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor can be given as administration of 1000 to 2000 U of plasma-derived C1INH for short-term prophylaxis. In adults, high-dose 17a-alkylated androgens 6–10 mg/kg/d in divided doses to a maximum of 200 mg of danazol 3 times daily or equivalent are used for 5 to 10 days before the procedure and 2 days after. When trauma risk is minimal and on-demand therapy is readily available, deferring preprocedural treatment is an alternative, and a dose of on-demand acute treatment drug should be readily available in case it is needed.

Macrolide allergy — diagnosis is best established by direct challenge in nonanaphylactic histories: Even though macrolides are commonly listed in allergy records, very few patients are confirmed allergic, the utility of immediate-type skin testing using nonirritating concentrations is uncertain, and therefore direct challenge appears to be the most appropriate diagnostic approach for patients with a history of nonanaphylactic reactions.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^060b946c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) long-term prophylaxis with androgens — Summary Statement 22: Treatment with low-to-moderate doses of anabolic androgens provides effective and relatively safe long-term HAE prophylaxis for many patients. (B). Controlled double-blind studies show benefit with orally administered 17a-alkylated androgens; parenterally administered androgens that are not 17a-alkylated are not effective for the treatment of HAE. Commonly used agents include danazol, stanozolol, oxandrolone, and methyltestosterone, with dosage titration cautioned such that it is generally not advisable to change the dosage faster than 1 time per week. Monitoring and safety guidance specify that periodic liver enzyme monitoring and performance of ultrasound are recommended, patients often use relatively low doses (ie, < 200 mg of danazol), and performing liver function tests every 6 months with annual liver ultrasound examinations is advisable. There is a relative contraindication for use of these drugs in children and adolescents, and use of the 17a-alkylated androgens is relatively contraindicated in children, patients with breast or prostate cancer or pre-existing hepatic dysfunction, and women who are pregnant.

Many notable advances in drug allergy, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis were reported in 2018. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use and, consequently, antibiotic resistance are widespread, and algorithms to clarify β-lactam allergy and optimize antibiotic use were described. Meaningful data emerged on the pathogenesis of delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions. Progress not only in defining biomarkers but also in understanding the effect on quality of life and developing better treatments has been made for patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) have gained additional access to highly efficacious therapies, with associated improvements in quality of life, and some progress was made in our understanding of recurrent angioedema in patients with normal laboratory results. Guidelines have defined clear goals to help providers optimize therapies in patients with HAE. The epidemiology and triggers of anaphylaxis and the mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis were elucidated further. In summary, these disorders (and labels) cause substantial burdens for individual persons and even society. Fortunately, publications in 2018 have informed on advancements in diagnosis and management and have provided better understanding of mechanisms that potentially could yield new therapies. This progress should lead to better health outcomes and paths forward in patients with drug allergy, urticaria, HAE, and anaphylaxis.

### Telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a pooled analysis [^9daa9b3b]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The efficacy of telithromycin has been assessed in six Phase III studies involving adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a degree of severity compatible with oral therapy. Patients received telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days in three open-label studies (n = 870) and three randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled studies (n = 503). Comparator antibacterials were amoxicillin 1000 mg three-times daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and trovafloxacin 200 mg once daily. Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were assessed 7–14 days post-therapy. Among telithromycin-treated patients, per-protocol clinical cure rates were 93.1 and 91.0% for the open-label and comparative studies, respectively. Telithromycin treatment was as effective as the comparator agents. High eradication and clinical cure rates were observed for infections caused by key pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae including isolates resistant to penicillin G and/or erythromycin A (95.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (89.5%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (90%). Telithromycin was also highly effective in patients with infections caused by atypical and/or intracellular pathogens and those at increased risk of morbidity. Telithromycin was generally well tolerated. Telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days offers a convenient and well-tolerated first-line oral therapy for the empirical treatment of mild to moderate CAP.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to β-lactam antibiotics [^f7ce356a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

Study Selection, Data Extraction, and Quality Assessment

All identified articles were manually reviewed at the title/abstract level. If deemed suitable, the full text was initially assessed for inclusion by one reviewer. Eligibility was then checked by a second reviewer. Disagreements regarding the inclusion of full-text articles were resolved through discussion with an additional reviewer, until consensus was reached. For each included article, data were extracted on the publication characteristics and study design, the treatment characteristics (LTP agent and dose, duration of treatment, and comparator), the proportion of attack-free patients in each treatment group, the attack characteristics (attack frequency, location, duration, and severity at baseline and after commencing study treatment), and on-demand therapy use. Assessments for risk of bias were performed for included studies using the Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs (rated as high, moderate, or low risk of bias) and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies (rated on a star system on the selection of study groups, the comparability of the groups, and the ascertainment of the outcome of interest). All transcribed data and risk of bias assessments performed by one reviewer were checked for accuracy and completeness by a second reviewer, with any disagreements being resolved through discussion until consensus was reached.

Data Reporting and Feasibility Assessment for Meta-analyses

Data on outcomes of interest were collectively summarized, reporting the findings of high-quality, phase 3, placebo-controlled RCTs first, followed by phase 2 trials and large extension or registry studies in which data were prospectively collected. Percentages extracted from publications were rounded to the nearest whole number. Means, standard deviations (SDs), standard errors (SEs), and confidence intervals (CIs) were rounded to the nearest first decimal. P values were included as reported in the source publication. A feasibility assessment for conducting meta-analyses was conducted. However, because of substantial limitations of data availability in RCTs and real-world evidence studies on the endpoints of interest, a meta-analysis was not considered feasible.

at different locations and in an unpredictable manner. Symptoms of HAE range from mild to severe and, when severe, can result in hospitalizations or lead to the most serious, life- threatening complication: laryngeal edema. Hereditary Angioedema affects approximately 1 in 50, 000 people1; it is estimated that there are. control inflammation and participates in the clotting cascade. Reduced amounts of C1-Esterase Inhibitor are associated with overproduction of plasma kallikrein and excessive release of a substance called bradykinin which can cause abrupt increases in vascular permeability leading to acute attacks of swelling in different parts of the body. Three types of HAE have been. 4 with normal levels of a dysfunctional C1-Esterase Inhibitor; and type 3 occurs very rarely, is poorly understood, and has been reported in association with genetic mutations on Factor XII gene that encodes clotting Factor XII protein3.

Symptoms of HAE typically begin in childhood, may worsen during puberty and perimenopause. years, and continue throughout an individual's life. If untreated, attacks of swelling may occur, on average, every 1–2 weeks and may last from few to several days. Frequency and duration of attacks vary widely among individuals and may be associated with common triggers such as trauma, stress, infection, and exertion, or may occur without well-identified triggering factors. complication may lead to suffocation and death. The laryngeal attacks are, therefore, considered to be the most urgent sequelae of HAE, and their treatment involves airway protection with urgent use of medications aimed to decrease laryngeal swelling, as well as intubation when needed. The current therapies for HAE are generally grouped into the medications used to prevent attack occurrence and the medications used to treat an attack that has already started or is about to start.

At the time of this meeting, there were seven medications approved by the FDA for the treatment or prophylaxis of HAE attacks. These medicines aim to decrease. the inflammatory response and include mainly C1-Esterase Inhibitor replacement therapies and products that interfere with the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway. The following medicines are approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks: Danazol® – oral androgen, Cinryze® – plasma- derived C1-Esterase Inhibitor for intravenous administration, and Haegarda® – plasma-derived. C1-Esterase Inhibitor for subcutaneous administration. The following medicines are approved for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE: Berinert® – plasma-derived C1-Esterase Inhibitor for intravenous administration, Ruconest® – recombinant C1-Esterase Inhibitor for intravenous. administration, Kalbitor® – plasma kallikrein inhibitor for subcutaneous administration, and Firazyr® – bradykinin-receptor antagonist for subcutaneous administration.

Although the currently available treatments for routine prophylaxis of acute HAE attacks are. effective in reducing the number and frequency of attacks, they do not eliminate all attacks in each individual. Similarly, the medications used for the treatment of HAE attacks are effective 3 Cicardi M, Aberer W, Banerji A, Bas M, Bernstein JA, Bork K, Caballero T, Farkas H, Grumach A, Kaplan AP. 5 in reducing the time to improvement of the symptoms, but the attack resolution still requires time during which the patient remains symptomatic. Supportive treatments for HAE may also include medicines used to control pain. Meeting Overview During the meeting, the FDA had the opportunity to hear directly from patients, families,… many attacks may occur without any specific harbingers.

Antimicrobial agents — penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### Mitigating disparity in health-care resources between countries for management of hereditary angioedema [^20a303a6]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent case report from Pakistan described the first HAE treatment with FFP of a man with facial and laryngeal edema necessitating intubation. He was treated with 20 ml/kg with complete resolution after 18 h.

In addition to transfusion reactions, FFP carries other adverse effects of concern, including transmission of pathogens and volume overload. Decades ago, a theoretical risk of aggravation of an acute attack was postulated, as FFP itself contains contact proteins that may lead to excess bradykinin. However, symptom worsening due to FFP has rarely been reported. No data is available on the risk of blood borne pathogens in Iranian, South African or Chinese patients. However, a US retrospective study noted serological evidence of Hepatitis B, C and HIV in 0.97%, 1.93% and 0.19%, respectively in HAE patients treated with FFP.

The optimum dose of FFP is unknown. Based on experience with plasma-derived C1-INH, it seems likely that at least 20 ml/kg is required, although, as reported above, lower doses may still prove lifesaving.

The requirement to attend a healthcare facility makes it impossible for many patients to be treated promptly to achieve an optimal response. At times, the HAE attack may be severe enough that patients/parents may not even have enough time to reach the hospital for getting an FFP infusion emphasizing the dire need for an acute "on-demand" self-administered therapy in these countries.

Tranexamic acid used acutely during an ongoing attack has been reported to potentially prolong the attack, but anecdotally some patients have found that very early treatment during a well-defined predictive prodromal period or very shortly after the onset of an attack may be effective at reducing severity. There is, however, very limited trial data to support this observation. Milder attacks (such as peripheral edema and less severe abdominal attacks) may respond to high-dose oral or intravenous tranexamic acid (used in a dose of 1000 mg every 3–4 h for 12–18 h). Likewise, some patients are able to abort attacks by up dosing with attenuated androgens (danazol 200–400 mg or stanozolol 5–7.5 mg) taken immediately upon recognition of prodromal symptoms (e.g. erythema marginatum, severe fatigue or 'pricking' sensation) known to result in a subsequent angioedema episode. However, it is widely accepted that androgens are unlikely to contribute to resolution of established attacks.

### Hellenic consensus oninfection [^50f2cf64]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 28: In patients with documented penicillin allergy, a clarithromycin, fluoroquinolone-containing regimen may represent an initial empirical approach. Culture and an antimicrobial susceptibility test, if available, prior to any treatment attempt could be an alternative option.

Recommendation grade: C; Evidence level: 4; Agreement level: 85.7%

H. pylori eradication is a challenge in patients allergic to penicillin. This leads to suboptimal choices and an increased risk of treatment failure using regimens that omit amoxicillin. It may be speculated that the rate of resistance to other antibiotics, different to β-lactam antibiotics, could be even higher in such patients, especially with regard to macrolides and particularly clarithromycin. Therefore, if the history is ambiguous, it seems appropriate to refer patients for allergy testing before any initial therapeutic approach, since the vast majority can ultimately be safely given amoxicillin-containing regimens. There is a lack of data from clinical trials addressing the issue of H. pylori eradication in penicillin-allergic patients in Greece. Antibiotic susceptibility test and culture, if available, could be the initial approach; if not, the initial therapeutic step should be an empirical one. The substitution of metronidazole for amoxicillin in a triple combination (PPI–clarithromycin–metronidazole) is not an effective option, given the well-known prevalence of resistance to either or both antibiotics. As empirical first-line treatment one could use the combination PPI–levofloxacin–clarithromycin for 10 days. In case of failure of the first-line empiric therapeutic approach, then a 10- to 14-day bismuth quadruple regimen should be prescribed. The same approach can be used in the case of clarithromycin and/or levofloxacin resistance, if the initial workup was based on susceptibility testing by culture. As third- or fourth-line treatment after failed levofloxacin-based triple and bismuth-based quadruple therapies, a regimen including rifabutin (PPI–rifabutin–clarithromycin) for 10 days could be an alternative option. Moreover, since bismuth salts, tetracycline or the combination drug "Pylera" are not commercially available in Greece, if the initial empirical treatment attempts have failed, a bismuth-containing regimen that could be procured by IFET (Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Technology) should be another option, especially if culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test are unavailable.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) long-term prophylaxis selection — Summary Statement 21: The need for long-term HAE prophylaxis must be individualized based on the patient's situation. (D). The goal of long-term prophylaxis is to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks, and not all patients with HAE require long-term prophylaxis, so the decision must be individualized. As an alternative (or in addition) to prophylactic management, on-demand treatment with an HAE-specific agent (Table E2) for attacks should be considered for management of patients with HAE.

### Hereditary angioedema attacks in patients receiving long-term prophylaxis: a systematic review [^e690ab5f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Attack Location in Patients Who Received LTP

Attacks at all anatomic locations, including laryngeal attacks, continued to occur in patients who received LTP, regardless of the LTP agent. Of note, both interventional and observational studies reported that laryngeal attacks accounted for between 2%-7% of all attacks in patients who received LTP with pdC1INH, lanadelumab, danazol, or TA. The occurrence of laryngeal attacks in patients receiving LTP with berotralstat was also reported in phase 2 and phase 3 trials; however, the proportion of attacks with laryngeal involvement for each treatment group was not reported.

In phase 3 studies of lanadelumab and berotralstat, there appeared to be a differential reduction in peripheral attacks compared with abdominal and laryngeal attacks. In the HELP RCT, the proportion of peripheral attacks decreased from 72% (56 of 78 attacks) during the 4-to-8 week run-in period to 43% (20 of 46 attacks) during the 26-week treatment period for participants who received lanadelumab 300 mg Q2W. Conversely, the proportion of abdominal attacks increased from 27% (21 of 78 attacks) during the run-in period to 50% (23 of 46 attacks) during the treatment period, and the proportion of laryngeal attacks increased (1% [1 of 78 attacks] during the run-in period to 7% [3 of 46 attacks] during the treatment period), suggesting that the prophylactic effect is more pronounced in peripheral attacks than in abdominal and laryngeal attacks. Further, abdominal attacks were the most prevalent on-treatment attack location in participants who received lanadelumab (all dose levels and administration frequencies) in both the phase 3 HELP trial and open-label extension study (60% and 61%, respectively) over peripheral attacks (38% and 36%) and laryngeal attacks (3% and 4%). In the phase 3 ApeX-2 trial there was a larger difference in the normalized monthly peripheral attack rate for berotralstat 150 mg QD versus placebo (0.5 vs 1.2) over the abdominal attack rate (0.2 vs 0.4), laryngeal attack rate (0.1 vs 0.2), and mixed-location attack free (0.6 vs 0.7). Baseline and on-treatment attack location data in patients receiving IV or SC pdC1INH were not reported in the pivotal phase 3 RCTs or open-label extension studies identified in this review.

### Hereditary angioedema [^4b2831cc]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usual results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### Taking a rational approach to a reported antibiotic allergy [^ad49e8a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (moxifloxacin) [^39753d11]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2 Community Acquired Pneumonia

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the US to compare the efficacy of moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily) to that of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 474 patients (382 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 14 to 35 day follow-up visit). Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 95% (184/194) for moxifloxacin and 95% (178/188) for high dose clarithromycin.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted in the US and Canada to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin 400 mg QD for 7 to 14 days to an IV/PO fluoroquinolone control (trovafloxacin or levofloxacin) in the treatment of patients with clinically and radiologically documented community acquired pneumonia. This study enrolled 516 patients, 362 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis conducted at the 7 to 30 day post-therapy visit. The clinical success rate was 86% (157/182) for moxifloxacin therapy and 89% (161/180) for the fluoroquinolone comparators.

An open-label ex-US study that enrolled 628 patients compared moxifloxacin to sequential IV/PO amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.2 g IV q8h/625 mg PO q8h) with or without high-dose IV/PO clarithromycin (500 mg BID). The intravenous formulations of the comparators are not FDA approved. The clinical success rate at Day 5 to 7 for moxifloxacin therapy was 93% (241/258) and demonstrated superiority to amoxicillin/clavulanate ± clarithromycin (85%, 239/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.9%, 13.2%)]. The clinical success rate at the 21 to 28 days post-therapy visit for moxifloxacin was 84% (216/258), which also demonstrated superiority to the comparators (74%, 208/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.6%, 16.3%)].

The clinical success rates by pathogen across four CAP studies are presented in Table 10.

### Drug allergy practice parameter updates to incorporate into your clinical practice [^c4dddef4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The drug allergy practice parameter was developed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of drug hypersensitivity reactions. It was last updated in 2010. With the growth of research and evidence-based data since then, experts came together to update the practice parameter with a focus on sections that the work group deemed to have significant changes (or were not addressed) in the previous practice parameter. This review is a focused update on aspects of the practice parameter deemed to have the greatest impact on clinical practice and includes significant updates on diagnosis of antibiotic allergy including penicillin, cephalosporin, sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and macrolide allergies. Other topics include the evolution in our management approach to patients with aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug allergy, diagnostic testing for delayed drug hypersensitivity and allergy to chemotherapeutics and biologics, and the key consensus-based statements for clinical practice. Specifically, the updated practice parameter helps allergists understand the place of 1- or 2-step drug challenges that are valuable tools often without the need for skin testing in many clinical situations. A proactive approach to delabeling penicillin allergy as well as unnecessary avoidance of safe antibiotic alternatives for patients with proven penicillin allergy is emphasized. New guidance is provided on management of patients with different phenotypes of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity reactions. Approaches to delayed drug hypersensitivity and use of delayed intradermal and patch testing for specific phenotypes are reviewed. Lastly, practical approaches to management of patients with reactions to chemotherapeutics and biologics are discussed.

### Efficacy and tolerability of once-daily oral telithromycin compared with clarithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^8234ebcd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Telithromycin is a new antibacterial agent of the ketolide class designed to provide optimal treatment against common bacterial respiratory tract pathogens. Telithromycin was derived by structural modification of the basic macrolide molecule to allow tight binding to the bacterial ribosome that enhances potency and minimizes the risk for the development of resistant strains.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of telithromycin 800 mg once daily with those of high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), each for 10 days, in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at 54 centers in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with acute CAP were randomized to receive 10-day treatment with oral telithromycin 800 mg once daily (administered as two 400-mg encapsulated tablets in the morning) and placebo (administered as 2 encapsulated tablets identical to the telithromycin in the evening) or high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg administered as two 250-mg identical encapsulated tablets twice daily). The primary outcome measure was clinical outcome at the posttherapy, test-of-cure visit (days 17–24 after the completion of therapy) in the clinically assessable per-protocol population. Secondary efficacy variables included bacteriologic outcome at the posttherapy, test-of-cure visit, and clinical and bacteriologic outcomes at the late posttherapy visit (day 31–45). Tolerability was assessed using investigator observation, patient self-reporting, clinical laboratory data, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and physical examination (including vital signs).

Results

A total of 493 patients were enrolled and 448 patients received ≥ 1 dose of study medication (224 patients/group). A diagnosis of CAP was confirmed in 416 patients (205 men, 211 women; median age, 43 years; telithromycin, n = 204; clarithromycin, n = 212). Clinical cure rates were 88.3% (143/162) in the telithromycin group and 88.5% (138/56) in the clarithromycin group. Bacterial eradication rates were comparable between treatment groups (telithromycin, (28/32) [87.5%]; clarithromycin, (29/30) [96.7%]. Both treatment were fairly well tolerated; adverse events were experienced in 57.0% of the patients treated with telithromycin and 49.1% of those treated with clarithromycin; most of these were assessed as mild.

Conclusions

In this study of adult patients with CAP, telithromycin 800 mg once daily was an effective and fairly well-tolerated regimen for initial empiric treatment, with clinical and bacteriologic efficacy and tolerability equivalent to therapy with high-dose clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^749dae8d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Macrolide selection — clarithromycin versus azithromycin: There are insufficient data to recommend the use of clarithromycin over azithromycin. Some experts use clarithromycin as the preferred first agent, reserving azithromycin for patients with substantial intolerance to clarithromycin or when drug interactions with clarithromycin are a concern (strong, low).

### Comparative tolerability, safety and efficacy of tablet formulations of twice-daily clarithromycin 250 mg versus once-daily extended-release clarithromycin 500 mg in pediatric and adolescent patients [^cddec987]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Clarithromycin is widely used to treat respiratory tract and superficial skin infections in pediatric and adult populations. Using clinical endpoints and 7-day therapy, we compared the efficacy of clarithromycin 250 mg tablets given twice daily versus clarithromycin 500 mg extendedrelease tablets given once daily in ambulatory children and adolescents 6 to 16 years old. Of the 199 evaluable patients, 124 were infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, 39 with sinusitis, 21 with ambulatory pneumonia, and 15 with superficial skin infections. The overall cure rate exceeded 90% for each treatment group. Discontinuation rates and adverse events were 4.5% and 24.6%, respectively.

10. 1001/jama.
1979. 03290420011007 To the Editor… In his letter "Hereditary Angioedema", Dr Reimann does not mention the use of androgenic steroids for prophylaxis of attacks. Methyltestosterone was first effectively used by Spaulding1 in 1960. This was followed by reports of effectiveness of less virilizing analogues, fluoxymesterone, oxymetholone, 2 and danazol. 3 The latter is a synthetic androgen derivative with mild masculanizing effects4 and is currently the drug of choice for prophylactic management of hereditary angioedema. 5 It is not only highly effective in preventing attacks but has been shown to raise Cl esterase inhibitor function, as well as its levels and that of C4, often to within normal range.

### British thoracic society guideline for the use of long-term macrolides in adults with respiratory disease [^da948693]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Background

The aim of this guideline was to examine the evidence for the use of long-term, low-dose macrolide agents used in the therapy of adult respiratory diseases, to develop guidance for clinicians in the use of these agents.

The guideline covers the use of macrolide in adults (> 16 years) where the duration of treatment exceeds that usually employed to treat an acute infection and the dosage is less than that usually employed to treat an acute infection. Such usage is considered to be exerting an effect through mechanisms other than a direct antibacterial one, commonly described as immunomodulatory mechanisms. We have characterised this as long-term, low-dose usage.

In addition, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) has looked at safety issues surrounding the long-term use of macrolides at both patient and population levels to help to formulate pragmatic guidance in this area based on the best available evidence combined with clinical experience.

### Diagnosing angioedema [^48cf9772]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Angioedema usually occurs within the setting of allergic diseases or urticaria, but situations occur in which angioedema itself represents a disease, such as in hereditary angioedema. Evaluation of patients for recurrent angioedema without wheals must take into account both specific clinical signs and symptoms and specialized laboratory testing.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — preferred empiric therapy: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII). For empiric outpatient therapy, a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII) is suggested; preferred beta-lactams include high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate, with alternatives cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII), or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with non-severe CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is preferred using ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; for penicillin allergies, levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AII), or moxifloxacin, 400 mg IV once daily (AII) are options. For hospitalized patients with severe CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus IV azithromycin (AI), or an IV beta-lactam plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI) are suggested empiric therapy options.

Recurrent angioedema diagnostic algorithm — one branch states "Not likely HAE or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency; Exclude cause (e.g., drug) and consider idiopathic". The algorithm also asks "Is patient taking an ACE-I?" and instructs "Stop ACE-I; does AE resolve?"; if it resolves, the outcome is "ACE-I associated AE".

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^f815b26e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — Summary of recommendations for treatment-naive patients: For treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, BQT (preferably optimized — as discussed below) for 14 days is the preferred option when the antimicrobial susceptibility profile is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB dual therapy for 14 days are suitable alternatives as empiric therapy in patients without penicillin allergy. In patients with unknown antibiotic susceptibility and no history of macrolide exposure or penicillin allergy, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy for 14 days is preferred over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy when no other obvious first-line treatment option is available.

Regarding medical management for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to prophylactic treatment, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend to administer any of the following options for long-term prophylaxis in patients with HAE:

- low-to-moderate doses of anabolic androgens as effective and relatively safe option in many patients

- antifibrinolytic agents as somewhat effective and relatively safe option, recognizing that it is generally less effective than androgens

- plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement as effective and safe option.
