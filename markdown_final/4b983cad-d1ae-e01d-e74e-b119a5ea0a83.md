## Question

A 67-year-old postmenopausal woman presents for her annual check-up. She has no history of fractures, but her mother sustained a hip fracture at age 75. Her medical history is significant for hypertension, well-controlled on medication. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her physical exam is unremarkable. Her most recent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan shows a T-score of -2.7 at the femoral neck. Her FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) score estimates a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture at 24% and hip fracture at 5.2%.

Based on current ACOG guidelines, should this patient be started on pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis? Justify your answer using the guideline recommendation.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 67-year-old postmenopausal woman with a femoral neck T-score of -2.7 and FRAX risks of 24% for major osteoporotic fracture and 5.2% for hip fracture should start pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis, and how to justify this using current ACOG guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether she meets diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis. Then, I should verify whether she meets ACOG's treatment thresholds based on T-score and FRAX. Next, I will consider secondary causes and pre-treatment evaluation. Finally, I will outline first-line therapy and monitoring, and confirm that the recommendation aligns with ACOG's strength and quality grading.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. A femoral neck T-score of -2.7 meets the WHO/ACOG definition of osteoporosis, which is a T-score of -2.5 or lower at the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, or distal one-third radius, so she has osteoporosis by BMD criteria even without a fragility fracture history.

> Wait, let me verify the treatment thresholds so I don't jump to conclusions. ACOG recommends pharmacotherapy for patients who meet any of the following: T-score -2.5 or lower, history of fragility fracture, or T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 with increased fracture risk by a formal risk tool, specifically FRAX thresholds of 10-year hip fracture risk ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥ 20% [^fdf57cf0]. Here, her T-score is -2.7, which alone meets the first criterion, and her FRAX risks of 24% for major osteoporotic fracture and 5.2% for hip fracture also exceed the FRAX thresholds, so she qualifies on two independent grounds [^efc8b7f0].

> Hold on, I should verify the pre-treatment steps. ACOG advises evaluating for secondary causes of bone loss before initiating pharmacotherapy, so I need to ensure we check for contributors such as hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption, liver disease, renal disease, thyroid disease, medication-induced bone loss, and other secondary etiologies before starting drugs, even though none are suggested by the vignette [^670abeb9] [^fbf5b162].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy. ACOG recommends bisphosphonates as initial therapy for most postmenopausal patients at increased fracture risk, with strong recommendation and high-quality evidence, so alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, or zoledronic acid are appropriate first choices depending on tolerance and access [^d9cfa3ec] [^e8668deb]. I need to ensure calcium and vitamin D adequacy are addressed, as guidelines advise ensuring adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D with any pharmacotherapy, even though the magnitude of fracture risk reduction from calcium/vitamin D alone is modest and context-dependent [^c298b6c4] [^dc26de8e].

> I will now examine monitoring. ACOG suggests repeat DXA every 1–3 years during therapy until findings are stable, then spacing out, which means I should plan a follow-up DXA in 1–2 years to document response and guide continuation or adjustment of therapy [^9d456e04] [^a19eb129].

> But wait, what if her baseline risk is so high that an anabolic-first approach is better? Let me consider risk stratification. Although ACOG emphasizes bisphosphonates as first-line for most, contemporary endocrine guidance identifies patients at very high risk — such as those with very low T-scores, recent fractures, or very high FRAX — where initial anabolic therapy may be favored to rapidly reduce fracture risk; her T-score of -2.7 with FRAX hip risk 5.2% places her at high risk, and while not automatically "very high", this nuance supports shared decision-making if rapid risk reduction is prioritized or if antiresorptive monotherapy is contraindicated or poorly tolerated [^e34640a5] [^6476794b].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, ACOG recommends initiating pharmacotherapy for this 67-year-old with a femoral neck T-score of -2.7 and FRAX risks of 24% major osteoporotic and 5.2% hip fracture, because she meets both the T-score threshold and the FRAX-based high-risk criteria, after evaluating for secondary causes and ensuring calcium and vitamin D sufficiency, with bisphosphonates as first-line therapy and planned DXA monitoring [^efc8b7f0] [^fdf57cf0] [^670abeb9] [^d9cfa3ec] [^9d456e04].

---

Based on current ACOG guidelines, **pharmacotherapy is indicated** for this 67-year-old postmenopausal woman because she has a femoral neck T-score of -2.7 (osteoporosis) and a FRAX 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 24% and hip fracture risk of 5.2%, both exceeding the ACOG thresholds of ≥ 20% and ≥ 3%, respectively [^efc8b7f0] [^fdf57cf0]. ACOG recommends initiating pharmacotherapy for patients with a T-score ≤ -2.5, a history of fragility fracture, or osteopenia (T-score -1.0 to -2.5) with FRAX risks meeting or exceeding these thresholds [^efc8b7f0]. Bisphosphonates are the **first-line therapy** unless contraindicated, and secondary causes of osteoporosis should be evaluated before starting treatment [^d9cfa3ec] [^670abeb9].

## ACOG guidelines for pharmacologic therapy in postmenopausal osteoporosis

ACOG provides clear recommendations for initiating pharmacologic therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or at high fracture risk [^efc8b7f0]. According to ACOG Clinical Practice Guideline No. 2, pharmacologic therapy is recommended for patients who meet any of the following criteria:

- **T-score of -2.5 or lower**: At the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, or distal one-third radius [^efc8b7f0].
- **History of fragility fracture**: Including asymptomatic vertebral fracture [^efc8b7f0].
- **T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 with increased fracture risk**: Determined by a formal clinical risk-assessment tool, such as FRAX, with a 10-year hip fracture probability of 3% or greater, or a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability of 20% or greater [^efc8b7f0].

---

## Application of ACOG guidelines to the patient

This patient has a femoral neck T-score of -2.7, which meets the diagnostic threshold for osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) [^f76b3c33]. Additionally, her FRAX scores indicate a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 24% and a 10-year hip fracture risk of 5.2%, both exceeding the ACOG thresholds of 20% and 3%, respectively [^efc8b7f0]. Therefore, **she meets multiple criteria** for pharmacologic therapy according to ACOG guidelines [^fdf57cf0].

---

## Recommended pharmacologic therapy

ACOG recommends **bisphosphonates as first-line therapy** for most postmenopausal patients at increased fracture risk, given their proven efficacy in reducing vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures [^d9cfa3ec]. Alternative pharmacologic options include denosumab, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and parathyroid hormone analogs, which may be considered based on patient-specific factors, contraindications, and preferences [^2b148314].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

Before initiating pharmacologic therapy, ACOG recommends evaluating for **secondary causes of bone loss**, such as hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or medication-induced bone loss [^670abeb9]. Additionally, patients should be counseled on adherence, potential side effects, and the importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation [^c298b6c4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current ACOG guidelines, **pharmacologic therapy is indicated** for this 67-year-old postmenopausal woman with a femoral neck T-score of -2.7 and elevated FRAX fracture risks. Bisphosphonates are the recommended first-line therapy, and secondary causes of osteoporosis should be evaluated before initiating treatment [^d9cfa3ec] [^670abeb9].

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — indications for pharmacotherapy state that after evaluation for remediable secondary causes, pharmacotherapy is recommended for patients who meet any of the following: T-score −2.5 or lower by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, or distal 1/3 radius; history of fragility fracture, including asymptomatic vertebral fracture; or T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 with increased risk of fracture determined by a formal clinical risk-assessment tool. For example, using the U.S. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) tool, this corresponds to a 10-year hip fracture probability of 3% or greater, or a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability of 20% or greater. Hip (femoral neck) and lumbar spine measurements by DXA provide the most accurate and precise measurements of bone mineral density, and when one or both these sites cannot be evaluated, bone mineral density measurement at the forearm (distal one third of the radius) can be used for diagnosis.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a review of latest guidelines [^6c628ba2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover and reduced bone mass, leading to skeletal fragility and heightened fracture risk. It is a growing public health concern with expectations for a continued significant rise of fractures by 50% in 2030. Diagnosis is typically based on body mineral density with a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicating osteoporosis. Treatment duration varies, and is determined by careful monitoring of fracture risk and timing for potential drug holidays. Emerging therapies and ongoing research continue to evolve the landscape of osteoporosis management, aiming to reduce fracture risk and improve patient outcomes.

### A 55-year-old woman with osteopenia [^8b0cd611]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

About half of postmenopausal women have a bone density T score at the femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5. Bone density in this range was termed "osteopenia" by a World Health Organization working group. Osteopenia is not a disease and the label can cause unnecessary anxiety. Osteopenia encompasses a wide range of fracture risks; an individual patient's risk can be estimated from her age, bone mineral density, and clinical risk factors. Regardless of bone mineral density, regular exercise and adherence with vitamin D and calcium intake may reduce the risk of hip fracture. Osteopenia by itself is not an indication for treatment. Decisions about pharmacological treatment to prevent fractures should be based on the patient's risk of fractures, evidence about the efficacy and nonskeletal effects of the specific treatment, and the patient's preferences.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — treatment indications and very high fracture-risk criteria: Pharmacologic therapy to reduce fracture risk is indicated when fracture risk is high based on T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5 with a history of fragility fracture of the hip or spine, or when T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5 are accompanied by a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture ≥ 20% or hip fracture ≥ 3% in the U.S., or above country-specific thresholds elsewhere. Patients at very high fracture risk include those with a recent fracture within the past 12 months, fractures while on approved therapy, multiple fractures, fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term glucocorticoids), a very low T-score less than −3.0, high risk of falls or history of injurious falls, or very high FRAX probability such as major osteoporotic fracture > 30% or hip fracture > 4.5%. Some patients at very high fracture risk may require more aggressive treatment, and there is evidence supporting superiority of anabolic agents over antiresorptive agents in reducing vertebral fracture risk in this group.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^c7fc89c5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Risk assessment tools for osteoporosis — USPSTF and FRAX: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) review found common osteoporosis risk assessment tools performed comparably with moderate predictive ability, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.58 to 0.82; an AUC of 0.5 indicates no discrimination, 0.7 or greater acceptable discrimination, and 1.0 perfect discrimination. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is a computer-based algorithm that estimates the 10-year risk of hip fracture and the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture in adults 40 years and older and can be used to assess the need for BMD testing in postmenopausal patients younger than 65 years with risk factors or to determine the need to initiate pharmacotherapy in a patient with a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5. Risk calculations include multiple clinical risk factors and the U.S. FRAX tool has separate calculators for Caucasian, Black, Asian, and Hispanic racial and ethnic groups. Without femoral neck BMD T-score input, FRAX's pooled AUC for identifying major osteoporosis fracture risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.63–0.69), and with inclusion of the hip BMD T-score, FRAX's pooled AUC for predicting future major osteoporotic fracture in women was 0.70 (95% CI 0.68–0.71). Limitations include that FRAX does not allow input of specific amounts, dosage, or duration for alcohol intake, corticosteroid use, or smoking or for the number of prior fractures, and that spine BMD and recent falls are not incorporated, which can underestimate risk in individuals with these factors.

Public health impact of osteoporosis — burden and epidemiology in the U.S.: The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) estimates that 10.2 million Americans have osteoporosis and that an additional 43.4 million have low bone mass, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually in the U.S.; more than 70% of these occur in women. In the U.S., the costs of osteoporotic fracture are estimated to be more than $25 billion by 2025, yet less than 1 in 4 women aged 67 years or older with an osteoporosis-related fracture get bone density measured or begins osteoporosis treatment. The annual cost of caring for osteoporotic fractures exceeds the annual costs of caring for breast cancer, myocardial infarction, or stroke in women aged 55 years and older. By age 60 years, half of white women have low bone mass (osteopenia) or osteoporosis. The average femoral neck T-score by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for 75-year-old women is −2.5, and more than 20% of postmenopausal women have prevalent vertebral fractures.

### The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX ®): applications in clinical practice [^ef9e68c2]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a serious health concern affecting millions of Americans, with many patients going undiagnosed and untreated. Fractures due to osteoporosis and fracture-related complications are the most clinically relevant and costly consequences of this disorder. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®), released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2008, is a major achievement in helping determine which patients may be candidates for pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis. This Web-based algorithm, which has been incorporated into some dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) reporting software, calculates the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (clinical vertebral, hip, forearm, or humerus) and the 10-year probability of hip fracture in men and women based on easily obtained clinical risk factors and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck (optional). The National Osteoporosis Foundation updated its U.S. guidelines in February 2008 to incorporate FRAX and recommends that all postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years with a hip or vertebral fracture, a T-score ≤ -2.5 at the femoral neck or spine (excluding secondary causes), or low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) and a 10-year probability of hip fracture ≥ 3% or of major osteoporosis-related fracture ≥ 20% (based on FRAX) should be considered candidates for drug therapy. Despite its demonstrated clinical utility, FRAX has limitations and should not be used in all situations. Acceptance and clinical use of FRAX may help identify men and women at increased risk for osteoporotic fracture, but implementing the tool into clinical practice may be a challenge for busy physicians.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^378fb8e2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The Swiss Association against Osteoporosis released a position statement in 2017. The position statement recommended continuing denosumab up to 10 years in patients at high fracture risk, defined as: hip, spine or multiple fractures before or during therapy; femoral neck T-score < −2.5 if age < 65 years, < −2.0 SD if age > 65 years and/or frequent falls; continuing hormone ablative therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibition, androgen deprivation therapy); secondary osteoporosis; and continuing glucocorticoid therapy. In patients with good treatment response (low fracture risk, increase of BMD to within age-adjusted range, cessation of aromatase inhibition) they advised mandatory sequential treatment with bisphosphonates (or SERM if bisphosphonate intolerant) for 12–24 months post discontinuation of denosumab. They emphasized the importance of this particularly in older women with prevalent VFs and in women without a history of long-term bisphosphonate use prior to denosumab.

The Endocrine Society 2019 suggests that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are prescribed denosumab the fracture risk should be reassessed after 5–10 years. The guidance is that women who remain at high risk of fracture should continue denosumab or receive other osteoporosis treatment. The high-risk group is defined as patients who have a prior spine or hip fracture, or a BMD T-score of −2.5 or below at either the hip or spine, or a 10-year hip fracture risk > 3%, or a risk of major osteoporotic fracture > 20%. According to the guideline, denosumab could then be stopped in low to moderate risk patients (i.e. those who do not meet these criteria) but they recommend against delaying or stopping denosumab without subsequent antiresorptive (bisphosphonate, hormone therapy or SERM) administered in order to prevent rebound increase in bone turnover, rapid BMD loss and increased risk of fracture. The advice for follow-up of these patients is a reassessment of fracture risk every 1–3 years. If bone loss is noted, fracture occurs or the patient becomes high risk, then the guideline recommends consideration of restarting therapy.

Fracture risk assessment and treatment consideration — postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older with osteopenia (T-score between −1.0 and −2.5) who have a 10-year hip fracture probability ≥ 3% or 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability ≥ 20% in the U.S. or above a country-specific threshold are recommended to consider osteoporosis treatment, and the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) incorporates clinical factors such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, prior fracture, parental history of hip fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, and femoral neck BMD while predicting the 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture; however, FRAX underestimates risk in settings including multiple or recent fractures, lumbar spine BMD much lower than femoral neck BMD, secondary osteoporosis, and increased fall risk, and falls are not directly captured in FRAX and are a proximate cause of most fractures in older adults.

Bone mineral density categories and fracture risk — osteoporosis is defined by a T-score at or below −2.5 and osteopenia as a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and these criteria are useful for classification and risk stratification but are not intended as treatment thresholds. More than 80% of fragility fractures occur in women with BMD in the "osteopenia" range, and it is now recommended that treatment decisions include consideration of fracture probability; BMD results should be combined with other clinical risk factors, and FRAX® integrates the contribution of BMD and other clinical risk factors and calculates an individual's probability of fracture over 10 years.

### Bone mineral density: clinical relevance and quantitative assessment [^b0ecadd0]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an internationally accepted standard-of-care screening tool used to assess fragility-fracture risk. Society guidelines have recommended which populations may benefit from DXA screening and the use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to guide decisions regarding pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis. According to the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, postmenopausal women and men at least 50 y old with osteopenic BMD warrant pharmacologic treatment if they have a FRAX-calculated 10-y probability of at least 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with osteoporosis defined by a clinical event, namely a fragility fracture, or with an osteoporotic BMD should also be treated. Patients who are treated for osteoporosis should be monitored regularly to track expected gains in BMD by serial DXA scans. With some drug therapies, BMD targets can be reached whereby further improvements in BMD are not associated with further reductions in fracture risk. Although reaching this target might suggest a stopping point for therapy, the reversibility of most treatments for osteoporosis, except for the bisphosphonates, has dampened enthusiasm for this approach. In the case of denosumab, it is now apparent that stopping therapy at any point can lead to an increase in multiple-fracture risk. For patients who do not respond to antiosteoporosis pharmacologic therapy with an improvement in BMD, or who have an incident fragility fracture on therapy, secondary causes of osteoporosis or non-compliance with medical therapy should be considered.

### Goal-directed osteoporosis treatment: ASBMR / BHOF task force position statement 2024 [^9cc5d60d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The overarching goal of osteoporosis management is to prevent fractures. A goal-directed approach to long-term management of fracture risk helps ensure that the most appropriate initial treatment and treatment sequence is selected for individual patients. Goal-directed treatment decisions require assessment of clinical fracture history, vertebral fracture identification (using vertebral imaging as appropriate), measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), and consideration of other major clinical risk factors. Treatment targets should be tailored to each patient's individual risk profile and based on the specific indication for beginning treatment, including recency, site, number and severity of prior fractures, and BMD levels at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine. Instead of first-line bisphosphonate treatment for all patients, selection of initial treatment should focus on reducing fracture risk rapidly for patients at very high and imminent risk, such as in those with recent fractures. Initial treatment selection should also consider the probability that a BMD treatment target can be attained within a reasonable period of time and the differential magnitude of fracture risk reduction and BMD impact with osteoanabolic versus antiresorptive therapy. This position statement of the ASBMR/BHOF Task Force on Goal-Directed Osteoporosis Treatment provides an overall summary of the major clinical recommendations about treatment targets and strategies to achieve those targets based on the best evidence available, derived primarily from studies in older postmenopausal women of European ancestry.

Successful treatment and treat-to-target concepts — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments aim to prevent fractures, randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in fracture risk in patients with stable or increasing BMD receiving pharmacologic therapy, particularly with bisphosphonates versus placebo, and the goal of treatment is prevention of fractures although no treatment can eliminate risk of fracture. A fracture during therapy is not necessarily a treatment failure and should trigger reconsideration of fracture risk factors and possible changes in treatment strategies; the risk of fracture is higher after a recent fracture and diminishes over time, and the number, severity, and recency of vertebral fractures are directly correlated with risk of future fractures. Response to therapy is not necessarily the same as achieving an acceptable level of fracture risk, leading to proposals for treat-to-target goals; an ASBMR/NOF task force was formed to review evidence and propose targets, but at this time treatment targets have not been identified. When treatment is initiated due to a low DXA T-score (such as −2.5 or lower), a higher T-score is an intuitive target, and when treatment is started due to high fracture probability with FRAX it is intuitive that fracture probability be reduced below the threshold for starting treatment; a change in BTMs is also a possible target, and challenges to defining targets include limited comparative effectiveness data, lack of consensus on acceptable risk, and limited effectiveness particularly for nonvertebral fractures.

### Implications of expanding indications for drug treatment to prevent fracture in older men in United States: cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of prospective cohort study [^cd8acac8]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The FRAX algorithm is a publicly available web based tool that uses clinical risk factors and country specific data, with or without consideration of femoral neck bone mineral density measurement, to estimate an individual patient's 10 year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fractures (defined by FRAX as clinical vertebral, forearm, hip, or proximal humerus fracture). The development of the FRAX tool has been advocated by several organizations, supported in part by funding from the pharmaceutical industry, which have advocated the use of FRAX in clinical decision making to identify high risk candidates for drug treatment to prevent fracture. This has promoted a shift in treatment approach in many practice settings from one based primarily on measurement of bone mineral density to an approach based on absolute risk of fracture.

Use of FRAX in clinical practice demands a consideration of the probability of fracture at which to intervene. On the basis of a cost effectiveness analysis, the NOF in 2010 recommended FRAX intervention thresholds of 3% for hip fracture and 20% for major osteoporotic fracture as cut points for starting drug treatment in US adults aged 50 years and older. However, a critical unproved assumption in this analysis is that drug treatment reduces risk of clinical fractures by 35% regardless of bone mineral density or the presence of existing vertebral fractures. Despite the controversies in identifying osteoporosis in men and lack of data on the efficacy of treatment in preventing clinical fracture events in populations other than postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as defined by WHO criteria or with existing vertebral fractures, current US treatment guidelines recommend starting drug treatment to prevent fracture in men with a history of hip or vertebral fracture, men with male specific bone mineral density T scores at or below –2.5, and men with a male specific bone mineral density T score between –1.0 and –2.5 who are at or above NOF derived FRAX intervention thresholds.

We used data collected in 5880 untreated, community dwelling US men aged 65 years or above enrolled in the prospective Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study to determine the incremental effects of broadening the definition of osteoporosis and use of NOF derived FRAX intervention thresholds on the proportion of older men identified as candidates for drug treatment for fracture prevention. We also compared observed and predicted 10 year fracture probabilities within distinct groups identified by osteoporosis status and fracture risk category.

### Bone-density testing interval and transition to osteoporosis in older women [^0883938a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, -2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests.

Methods

We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, -1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, -1.01 to -2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models. Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks.

Results

The estimated BMD testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal BMD, 17.3 years (95% CI, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, postmenopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years for women with normal bone density or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^a012524b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Bone mineral density testing — ACOG recommendation and diagnostic thresholds: ACOG recommends screening for osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients 65 years and older with BMD testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In addition, several guideline groups recommend screening for osteoporosis with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in all postmenopausal women who are 65 years and older. Hip (femoral neck) and lumbar spine measurements by DXA provide the most accurate and precise BMD measurements, and when one or both of these sites cannot be evaluated, BMD measurement at the forearm (distal one third of the radius) can be used for diagnosis. In postmenopausal patients, a BMD T-score of −2.5 or less establishes a diagnosis of osteoporosis, whereas a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 indicates low bone density (osteopenia); for patients with T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5, a risk assessment tool such as FRAX can help determine the need for pharmacologic therapy.

Imminent fracture risk and initiation timing — postmenopausal osteoporosis — support urgent treatment: data suggest that a recent fracture (within the past 2 years) is a better predictor of imminent fracture risk (i.e., risk of fracture within the next 2 years) than is a distant fracture history (> 5 years ago), and pharmacological therapies should be initiated without delay in patients with recent fractures to prevent more fractures. For post–hip fracture timing, based on the Horizon trial, we would suggest initiating therapy 2 weeks or more after a hip fracture, and women should also be counseled on adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, fall prevention strategies, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and weight-bearing, muscle-strengthening exercises as well as balance training.

### Classification and treatment of… [^307731ff]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Illustrative Case A 75-year-old woman presented to her family physician with persistent left buttock pain for several weeks. Staff at the patient's assisted living facility had noted that in recent weeks she had occasionally limped when walking from her bed to the bathroom. However, she remained able to shower, dress herself, and walk to the main dining room and garden. On careful review of the patient's history, the physician determined that a fall had not taken place. Aside from mild Alzheimer's disease, the patient was in good health. Other than the slight limp, her physical examination was normal. The patient subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course and returned to the assisted living facility. Clinical Presentation of Hip Fracture The typical patient with hip fracture is often an elderly woman with dementia who sustains a fall, may complain of severe hip pain, and is unable to walk.

The physical examination commonly reveals an abducted and externally rotated hip with leg-length discrepancy. The patient usually has localized tenderness over the hip and limited range of motion of the affected limb during attempts at passive and active rotation and flexion. Radiographs clearly demonstrate the fracture. In some instances, however, patients with hip fracture have normal ambulation and complain only of vague pain in their buttocks, knees, thighs, groin, or back. These patients frequently report no antecedent trauma, particularly if cognitive impairment is present. Their physical examination, including assessments of active, passive, and resisted movements of the affected hip joint and limb, may be normal. They often have additional injuries that mask the hip pathology and direct the physician's attention away from the diagnosis of hip fracture.

Diagnostic Imaging The diagnosis of hip fracture can usually be established with a detailed history, a thorough physical examination, and plain-film radiographs of the symptomatic hip. If radiographic findings are indeterminate but suspicious for a hip fracture, other imaging modalities can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. Various nonrandomized, observational studies have shown that bone scanning of the hip using technetium Tc 99m polyphosphate as the radiopharmaceutical can be up to 98 percent sensitive in confirming the presence of hip fracture when initial radiographic findings are normal or indeterminate. Various studies also have demonstrated the efficacy of MRI in diagnosing hip fractures. 12–19 One prospective study showed that coronal T 1-weighted hip MRI was 100 percent sensitive in confirming the presence of hip fracture in patients with indeterminate findings on initial plain-film radiographs.

17 The authors of the study concluded that MRI is more accurate and probably less expensive than other imaging alternatives, especially if consideration is given to the fact that earlier detection results in faster recovery and shorter hospital stays. In this study, the estimated total charges were $448 for MRI, $455 for bone scanning, and $797 for CT scanning. Other cited advantages of MRI over bone scanning or CT scanning include its ability to detect fractures within 24 hours and its noninvasive nature. 11, 14 The decision to use bone scanning or MRI largely depends on the availability of these technologies at a given medical facility and the preference of the treating physician. If these resources are not available, the physician should confer with an orthopedic surgeon to decide which imaging modalities should be used.

### Probability of achieving bone mineral density treatment goals with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^253fbf61]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Goal-directed treatment is critical in managing chronic health conditions and setting achievable treatment targets that guide initial treatment and treatment adjustments. In patients with osteoporosis, reducing the risk of first or recurrent fracture and increasing BMD can be considered the main treatment goals. Studies show that BMD levels achieved after the initiation of osteoporosis medication (denosumab, alendronate, zoledronic acid, or romosozumab) are robust indicators of subsequent fracture risk.BMD levels attained at the TH are the most consistent predictors of the subsequent risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures.

For interpreting BMD determinations by DXA, T-score is the established outcome reported since it reduces differences by DXA manufacturer and model and is the most feasible output in clinical practice. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or less, at one of the main skeletal sites, and many guidelines suggest initiating treatment for individuals with T-scores in this osteoporosis range. Furthermore, a T-score above the osteoporotic range (ie, > −2.5) has been proposed as a minimum target for osteoporosis treatment; however, higher target T-scores may be required in patients with higher fracture risk, due to prior fracture history, advanced age, or other major clinical risk factors.

The antiresorptive agent denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity to the human RANK ligand, reduces osteoclast number and activity, thereby reducing bone resorption. In the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM; NCT00089791) study, postmenopausal women randomized to receive denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 mo for 3 yr had improved BMD at TH and LS and a reduced risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures compared with those randomized to placebo. In women who entered the extension phase of the study, FREEDOM Extension (NCT00523341), with denosumab treatment for up to an additional 7 yr, the yearly incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures remained low, and BMD continued to increase without plateau (LS, 21.7%; TH, 9.2%; femoral neck, 9.0%). In addition, with continuous denosumab treatment, subsequent fracture risk was predicted by TH T-score achieved at any time throughout the 10 yr of observation.

In this population, zoledronate may have reduced the risk for any clinical or vertebral fractures at 6 years of treatment without higher risk for serious adverse events compared with placebo in a randomized controlled clinical trial, but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of bisphosphonates (zoledronate) on the risk for hip fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and atrial fibrillation at 6 years (insufficient), and other medications have not been examined yet in females with low bone mass.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^0a650e08]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Conclusions

Evidence from clinical trials and insights from clinical experience with pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis were critically evaluated in formulating this guideline for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patient preferences, data on adherence and persistence, and risks and benefits from the patient and provider perspectives were also considered in writing committee deliberations. A consensus by the Writing Committee members was achieved for four management principles: (i) The risk of future fractures in postmenopausal women should be determined using country-specific assessment tools to guide decision-making. (ii) Patient preferences should be incorporated into treatment planning. (iii) Nutritional and lifestyle interventions and fall prevention should accompany all pharmacologic regimens to reduce fracture risk. (iv) Multiple pharmacologic therapies are capable of reducing fracture rates in postmenopausal women at risk with acceptable risk-benefit and safety profiles.

### Estimates of the proportion of older white women who would be recommended for pharmacologic treatment by the new U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines [^67a448fb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2009). Low credibility.

The new U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation Clinician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis includes criteria for recommending pharmacologic treatment based on history of hip or vertebral fracture, femoral neck (FN), or spine BMD T-scores ≤ -2.5 and presence of low bone mass at the FN or spine plus a 10-yr risk of hip fracture ≥ 3% or of major osteoporotic fracture ≥ 20%. The proportion of women who would be recommended for treatment by these guidelines is not known. We applied the NOF criteria for treatment to women participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). To determine how the SOF population differs from the general U.S. population of white women ≥ 65 yr of age, we compared women in SOF with women who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III on criteria included in the NOF treatment guidelines that were common to both cohorts. Compared with NHANES III, women in SOF had higher FN BMD and were younger. Application of NOF guidelines to SOF data estimated that at least 72% of U.S. white women ≥ 65 yr of age and 93% of those ≥ 75 yr of age would be recommended for drug treatment. Application of the new NOF Guidelines would result in recommending a very large proportion of white women in the United States for pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis diagnosis — T-score and FRAX criteria is defined as follows: Osteoporosis is also diagnosed based on a T-score of −2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine (anteroposterior), femoral neck, total hip, or 1/3 radius (33% radius), even in the absence of a prevalent fracture; when the initial diagnosis is made according to a T-score of −2.5 or below, the diagnosis persists even when a subsequent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) shows a T-score better than −2.5. Osteoporosis may also be diagnosed in patients with a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 and increased fracture risk using FRAX country-specific thresholds.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^6cdd6d01]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline — pharmacologic management states that for patients with nonmetastatic cancer with osteoporosis (T scores of −2.5 or less in the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine) or who are at increased risk by clinical assessment or risk tools (10-year probability of ≥ 20% for major osteoporotic fractures or ≥ 3% for hip fracture based on the US-adapted FRAX tool), bone-modifying agents such as oral bisphosphonates, intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates or subcutaneous denosumab at the osteoporosis-indicated dosage may be offered to reduce the risk of fracture. Hormonal therapies for osteoporosis management (eg, estrogens) are generally avoided in patients with hormonally-responsive cancers, and for patients without hormonally responsive cancers, estrogens may be offered along with other bone-modifying agents when clinically appropriate (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). Current evidence suggests that oral bisphosphonates, IV bisphosphonates, and subcutaneous denosumab are each efficacious options.

### Time to clinically relevant fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women [^6a838db9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend use of fracture risk scores for screening and pharmacologic treatment decisions. The timing of occurrence of treatment-level (according to 2014 National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines) or screening-level (according to 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective competing risk analysis of new occurrence of treatment-level and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, prior to receipt of pharmacologic treatment and prior to first hip or clinical vertebral fracture.

Results

In 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level FRAX score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had FRAX scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level FRAX ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.6–8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% CI, 3.5–7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level FRAX at baseline, 100 (0.6%) experienced a hip or clinical vertebral fracture by age 65 years.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at baseline were unlikely to develop a treatment-level FRAX score between ages 50 and 64 years. After age 65, the increased incidence of treatment-level fracture risk scores, osteoporosis, and major osteoporotic fracture supports more frequent consideration of FRAX and bone mineral density testing.

### Goal-directed osteoporosis treatment: ASBMR / BHOF task force position statement 2024 [^740e181c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The evidence used here is based almost solely on women self-reporting as White, primarily 60 yr of age and older. It needs to be clarified how recommendations should differ in lower risk populations (younger patients; men; women of other ethnicities, race, or geographical location). Furthermore, specific BMD levels are associated with a wide variation in absolute fracture risk, depending on ethnicity and geography. Indications for treatment vary in different regions of the world and the treatment targets suggested here should be modified according to local considerations. The treatment targets might also differ in patients with secondary osteoporosis conditions such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis or in patients with diabetes mellitus.

A consensus is needed to confirm which fractures constitute a risk high enough to warrant initial use of osteoanabolic therapy. This is true for both patients with recent fractures and fractures that occurred more than 2 yr earlier. Consensus is also needed on defining an acceptable level of fracture risk after treatment. Reducing fracture risk is the treatment goal; currently, BMD targets are the best way to determine if this goal has been achieved. Determining whether BMD treatment targets have been met requires good quality, reliable BMD data, and interpretation. With a very low starting T-score, especially in the TH, treatment targets might not be attainable even with the most potent currently available therapy; however, the concept of choosing treatment sequences likely to attain BMD levels close to the target is still appropriate. The data to derive probabilities of attaining treatment targets are from post-hoc analyses, with two of the studies published only as abstracts at the current time. There is a paucity of evidence about treatment targets for patients who have fractures with starting T-scores above −2.5. Making treatment decisions based on at least a 50% probability of achieving the BMD target is intended as a general guide, not a rule.

### Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis with pharmacological therapy: practice and possibilities [^547bec48]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) is a common disease that will become more prevalent in the future, with costly implications for public health. Prevention of the disease and its consequences, namely fractures, is therefore, important for both the individual and society. This review discusses: the goals of PMO prevention; the identification of women at risk, including the use of bone mineral density and bone turnover markers; the relevance in the prevention setting of various current guidelines for PMO management; recent data on therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of PMO, in particular bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy and several other new pharmacological agents. It concludes that it is crucial for PMO prevention to start before disease onset and that, in the light of recent evidence, the existing guidelines need updating if they are to continue to be relevant.

Role of BMD in diagnosis and clinical decision-making: For women without prior fragility fractures, BMD is the single best predictor of osteoporotic fracture risk, and for every 1–standard deviation decrease in age-adjusted BMD the relative risk of fracture increases 1.6 to 2.6-fold; the relationship between bone density and fracture risk is a continuum, without a clear fracture threshold.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^fb58a57d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — introduction and epidemiology — describes osteoporosis as a common generalized skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and loss of bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration, and a decline in bone quality that increase vulnerability to fracture, noting it is a silent disease until a fracture occurs. Approximately 71% of osteoporotic fractures in people aged 50 years and older occur in women, and individuals with osteoporosis and an elevated or high risk of fracture can be identified through screening and risk assessment. Bone loss can be slowed or prevented with pharmacologic therapy. Since publication of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Osteoporosis Practice Bulletin in 2012, advances include the use of drug holidays from bisphosphonates to possibly decrease rare adverse effects and the development of new medications; this guideline provides evidence-based clinical recommendations for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and prevention, screening, and diagnosis is addressed in a separate ACOG guideline.

Bone mineral density measurements — potential uses in postmenopausal women include screening for osteoporosis, establishing the severity of osteoporosis or bone loss in patients with suspected osteoporosis, determining fracture risk especially when combined with other risk factors for fractures, and identifying candidates for pharmacologic intervention; additional uses include assessing changes in bone density over time in treated and untreated patients, enhancing acceptance of and perhaps adherence with treatment, and assessing skeletal consequences of diseases, conditions, or medications known to cause bone loss.

### Effect of abaloparatide on bone mineral density and fracture incidence in a subset of younger postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture [^1ca15111]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Current treatment guidelines recommend treatment for postmenopausal women with a T score < 2.5 regardless of age. This subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide in younger postmenopausal women considered to be at high risk for fracture.

Methods

Subgroup analysis of women in the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) trial who were < 65 years old and met modified utilization management criteria (baseline T score ≤ -2.5 [any site] and ≥ 1 prevalent vertebral and/or ≥ 1 prior clinical fracture within 5 years of randomization).

Findings

A total of 296 women (age range, 49–64 years) were included. Significant increases in bone mineral density from baseline were observed for abaloparatide versus placebo at all 3 sites at 6 months (p < 0.01 for total hip and femoral neck; p < 0.0001 for lumbar spine), 12 months (p < 0.0001 at all 3 sites), and 18 months (p < 0.0001 at all 3 sites). Fracture rates were numerically lower for abaloparatide versus placebo, consistent with the overall trial results, although the differences were not statistically significant. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 additional vertebral fracture after 18 months of treatment versus placebo was 18 for abaloparatide and 21 for teriparatide. The number needed to treat had nonsignificant trends toward lower values with abaloparatide versus teriparatide for nonvertebral fractures (23 vs 40) and clinical fractures (16 vs 73) and similar for major osteoporotic fractures (24 vs 27). The safety profile was consistent with the overall ACTIVE population.

Implications

Findings of this subgroup (post hoc) analysis are consistent with the overall ACTIVE population. Abaloparatide appears to be effective and well tolerated in this subgroup of younger postmenopausal women. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01343004.

### Reassessment intervals for transition from low to high fracture risk among adults older than 50 years [^6c168363]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The current analysis was undertaken to examine reassessment intervals for transition from low (below the treatment threshold) to treatment-qualifying high fracture risk in routine clinical practice. We hypothesized that level of baseline risk relative to the treatment threshold and change in clinical risk factors are associated with the time to reach a treatment-qualifying high-risk level. Because treatment guidelines differ among countries and this may be associated with results, we examined 3 different osteoporosis practice guideline strategies for pharmacologic treatment thresholds: (1) fixed MOF with 10-year risk of 20% or greater (major determinant in Canadian guidelines), (2) fixed hip fracture with 10-year risk of 3% or greater (major determinant under US National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines), and (3) an age-dependent threshold that plateaus after age 70 years corresponding to the MOF with 10-year risk for a woman who has already sustained a fragility fracture (major determinant according to the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group).

### At odds about the odds: women's choices to accept osteoporosis medications Do not closely agree with physician-set treatment thresholds [^600f1123]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis guidelines recommend pharmacologic therapy based on 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture, which may fail to account for patient-specific experiences and values.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether patient decisions to initiate osteoporosis medication agree with guideline-recommended intervention thresholds.

Design and Participants

This prospective cohort study included women aged ≥ 45 with age-associated osteoporosis who attended a group osteoporosis self-management consultation at a tertiary osteoporosis center.

Intervention

A group osteoporosis self-management consultation, during which participants received osteoporosis education and then calculated 1 their 10-year MOF and hip fracture risk using FRAX and 2 their predicted absolute fracture risk with therapy (assuming 40% relative reduction). Participants then made autonomous decisions regarding treatment initiation.

Main Measures

We evaluated agreement between treatment decisions and physician-set intervention thresholds (10-year MOF risk ≥ 20%, hip fracture risk ≥ 3%).

Key Results

Among 85 women (median [IQR] age 62 [58–67]), 27% accepted treatment (median [IQR] MOF risk, 15.1% [9.9–22.0]; hip fracture risk, 3.3% [1.3–5.3]), 46% declined (MOF risk, 9.5% [6.5–11.6]; hip fracture risk, 1.8% [0.6–2.3]), and 27% remained undecided (MOF risk, 14.0% [9.8–20.2]; hip fracture risk, 4.4% [1.7–4.9]). There was wide overlap in fracture risk between treatment acceptors and non-acceptors. Odds of accepting treatment were higher in women with prior fragility fracture (50% accepted; OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.9–15.2; p = 0.0015) and with hip fracture risk ≥ 3% (32% accepted; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4–9.2; p = 0.012), but not MOF risk ≥ 20% (47% accepted; OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0–8.5; p = 0.105).

Conclusions

Informed decisions to start osteoporosis treatment are highly personal and not easily predicted using fracture risk. Guideline-recommended intervention thresholds may not permit sufficient consideration of patient preferences.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: is now the time? [^1334aff2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Current clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for effectiveness of therapy. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. As a consequence, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated for longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk for fracture may have treatment stopped when they might benefit from continuation of the same treatment or a change to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

Participants

We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore the options, review the evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

Evidence

Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

Consensus Process

Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in the process of developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients in the care of osteoporosis.

Conclusions

A treat-to-target strategy for osteoporosis offers the potential of improving osteoporosis care by reducing the burden of osteoporotic fractures and limiting adverse effects of therapy.

### Menopause practitioner perspective on the American society of bone and mineral research task force report on atypical femoral fracture [^d07efa0f]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario

One of your patients, a 59-year-old postmenopausal Asian woman (menopause, age 52), took hormone therapy for about one year for her menopause symptoms. When she was 54, her mother (age 80) suffered a hip fracture, and she requested a bone density test at her next gynecology visit. The t-score results were spine, -1.1; total hip, -1.8; and femoral neck, -2.1, all in the osteopenic range. After some discussion, she was started on alendronate 70 mg once a week, together with calcium and vitamin D. Follow-up dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry testing after 2 and 5 years of therapy showed increases in bone mineral density, resulting in t-score improvements of about 0.3 to 0.5 units (spine was now normal; femoral neck was -1.8). The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool estimated her 10-year risk of hip fracture to be 0.4% and her 10-year risk of any of 4 major osteoporotic fractures to be 7.5%. During her most recent gynecology visit, she expressed concern about unusual femoral fractures being linked to long-term use of alendronate. She asks if there is reason for her to stop using this drug.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring: Serial BMD testing may be done to determine if or when to initiate treatment and to monitor the response; age-related bone loss occurs at an average rate of 0.5 to 1.0% per year, menopause-related bone loss begins 3 to 5 years before the last menstrual period and continues for 3 to 5 years after, occurring at 1 to 2% per year, and more rapid loss of 3 to 5% a year may occur in some women; one SD is about a 10% deviation from the young-adult mean, so a 10% bone loss will result in a decrease of about 1.0 T-score units, and serial monitoring is based on absolute BMD and not T-scores; for patients on treatment or near a fracture intervention threshold, BMD testing every 1 to 2 years is an option; in patients on treatment, stable or increasing BMD at the spine and hip indicates a satisfactory response, whereas if BMD decreases significantly, patients should be evaluated for noncompliance, secondary causes, or medications that might cause bone loss; facilities should determine their least significant change (LSC), with ISCD guidance of 30 patients in duplicate or 15 in triplicate, the LSC usually set at the 95% confidence limit for change, and if the difference exceeds the LSC the probability that it is real is greater than 95%.

### Fracture prevention in postmenopausal women… [^d9d4e54d]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

What are the effects of treatments to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women. BENEFICIAL Alendronate. Two systematic reviews involving postmenopausal women found that alendronate reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo after one to four years. Risedronate. One systematic review involving postmenopausal women found that compared with control risedronate reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures after four years. Parathyroid Hormone. One randomized controlled trial involving women with prior vertebral fractures found that parathyroid hormone reduced the proportion of women with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo. Another RCT involving women with osteoporosis found that parathyroid hormone plus estrogen reduced vertebral fractures compared with estrogen alone after three years. Raloxifene.

One large RCT involving postmenopausal women with osteoporosis found that raloxifene reduced vertebral fractures compared with placebo, but no significant difference was found in nonvertebral fractures. We found no RCTs examining the effects of other selective estrogen receptor modulators. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Etidronate. One systematic review involving postmenopausal women found that etidronate reduced vertebral fractures compared with control over two years but found no significant difference in nonvertebral fractures. Calcium Plus Vitamin D. One large RCT involving women 69 to 106 years of age living in nursing homes found that calcium plus vitamin D 3 reduced hip fractures and all nonvertebral fractures after 18 months to three years compared with placebo.

One smaller RCT involving women and men 65 years or older found that calcium plus vitamin D 3 reduced nonvertebral fractures after three years compared with placebo but found no significant difference in hip fractures. Another small RCT involving post-menopausal women found no significant difference between calcium plus vitamin D 3 and placebo in hip fractures after two years. The two smaller RCTs may have lacked power to detect clinically important differences. Vitamin D Analogue. One systematic review found limited evidence from two small RCTs involving postmenopausal women that calcitriol reduced vertebral fractures after three years compared with placebo. Calcitonin. One systematic review involving postmenopausal women found that calcitonin reduced vertebral fractures compared with placebo one to five years after treatment but found no significant difference between calcitonin and placebo in nonvertebral fractures. UNLIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Calcium Alone.

One systematic review involving postmenopausal women found no significant difference between calcium supplementation and placebo in vertebral or nonvertebral fractures after one and one half to four years. Vitamin D Alone. One large RCT involving postmenopausal women and two large RCTs involving postmenopausal women and older men provided no evidence of a difference between vitamin D 3 and placebo in hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures after two to five years. LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL Hormone Therapy. We found insufficient evidence of benefit but reliable evidence of harm. One systematic review involving postmenopausal women found that hormone therapy reduced vertebral fractures compared with control. However, another systematic review and two subsequent RCTs involving post-menopausal women found no significant difference in vertebral fractures.

Evaluating patients for and with osteoporosis — background: osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder affecting humans and is characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes to increased risk of fracture, most importantly of the spine and hip; serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events, whereas wrist fractures in young postmenopausal women are important warning signs. The bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause. Persons with osteoporosis and high risk of fracture can be readily identified; both general and pharmacologic management strategies are available to slow or prevent bone loss and to reduce fracture risk, and skeletal health assessment should be a part of the routine evaluation of all postmenopausal women.

### Does osteoporosis therapy invalidate FRAX for fracture prediction? [^efb65761]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Ten-year fracture risk assessment with the fracture risk assessment system (FRAX) is increasingly used to guide treatment decisions. Osteoporosis pharmacotherapy reduces fracture risk, but the effect is greater than can be explained from the increase in bone mineral density (BMD). Whether this invalidates fracture predictions with FRAX is uncertain. A total of 35,764 women (age ≥ 50 years) and baseline BMD testing (1996–2007) had FRAX probabilities retroactively calculated. A provincial pharmacy database was used to identify osteoporosis medication use. Women were categorized as untreated, current high adherence users [medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥ 0.80 in the year after BMD testing], current low adherence users (MPR < 0.80), and past users. Fractures outcomes to 10 years were established form a population-based health data repository. FRAX and femoral neck BMD alone stratified major osteoporotic and hip fracture risk within untreated and each treated subgroup (all p-values < 0.001) with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In untreated and each treated subgroup, a stepwise gradient in observed 10-year major osteoporotic and hip fracture incidence was found as a function of the predicted probability tertile (all p-values < 0.001 for linear trend). Concordance (calibration) plots for major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures showed good agreement between the predicted and observed 10-year fracture incidence in untreated women and each treated subgroup. Only in the highest risk tertile of women highly adherent to at least 5 years of bisphosphonate use was observed hip fracture risk significantly less than predicted, though major osteoporotic fracture risk was similar to predicted. In summary, this work suggests that the FRAX tool can be used to predict fracture probability in women currently or previously treated for osteoporosis. Although FRAX should not be used to assess the reduction in fracture risk in individuals on treatment, it may still have value for guiding the need for continued treatment or treatment withdrawal

### Probability of achieving bone mineral density treatment goals with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^b851414c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

BMD levels achieved on osteoporosis treatment are predictive of subsequent fracture risk, and T-score > -2.5 has been proposed as a minimum treatment target for women with osteoporosis. Knowing the likelihood of attaining target T-scores with different medications for different baseline BMD levels can help determine appropriate initial treatment for individual patients. In this post hoc analysis, we estimated the probability of achieving a non-osteoporotic T-score (> -2.5 or ≥ -2.0) at the TH or LS in postmenopausal women > 60 yr old treated with denosumab for either 3 or 10 yr in the FREEDOM trial and its long-term extension. In women with baseline TH T-scores of -2.7, -3.0, and -3.5, the probabilities of achieving target T-scores > -2.5 with 3 yr of denosumab were 71%, 12%, and 0.1%, respectively. At LS, for baseline T-scores of -2.7, -3.0, and -3.5, the probabilities were 86%, 59%, and 11%, respectively. Longer treatment duration of up to 10 yr increased the probability of achieving target T-scores. The baseline T-scores that permitted at least 50% of women to achieve a target T-score > -2.5 were -2.8 at TH and -3.1 at LS after 3 yr and -3.0 at TH and -3.7 at LS after 10 yr of treatment. To achieve higher treatment targets (T-scores ≥ -2.0), overall probabilities were lower at both skeletal sites, particularly for TH, even with longer treatment duration. Our results demonstrate that the probability of achieving T-score targets with denosumab is dependent on baseline BMD, skeletal site, and treatment duration. Knowing the probability of achieving treatment targets for different baseline TH and LS T-scores can help determine whether denosumab is an appropriate first choice of treatment in individual patients.

Defining clinical thresholds

There are no previous recommendations on when patients should receive treatment based on DXR measurements. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation clinician's guide to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, health-care providers should consider FDA-approved medical therapies in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older at T-score ≤ −2.5 at the femoral neck or spine or in the case of low bone mass (T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 at the femoral neck or spine) and a 10-year probability of a hip fracture ≥ 3%. In clinical fracture outcome trials, a T-score of −2.5 is one of the most commonly used inclusion criteria, for example in the FREEDOM trial. A combination of low BMD and prevalent vertebral fracture has also been used for inclusion. In the HORIZON trial subjects could be included if they had femoral neck BMD with a T-score of ≤ −2.5 or if they had a T-score of ≤ −1.5 plus at least two prevalent vertebral fractures. When calculating the annual hip fracture rate in women receiving a placebo during those two clinical trials, the rate was 0.37% and 0.76% respectively. If the threshold DXR T-score ≤ −2.5 is applied for all women in our material, the sensitivity to find hip fractures would be 0.81 and the specificity 0.79. However, in guidelines treatment is normally recommended for the 55–85-year age group. Used in that age group, the threshold DXR T-score ≤ −2.5 would result in a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.72, with an annual fracture rate of 1.6%. That rate is clearly higher than those observed in most pivotal fracture trials. This higher fracture incidence illustrates the difference in fracture incidence between clinical cohorts and that of clinical trials with selected subjects. It can therefore be discussed whether treatment should be given at higher DXR T-scores than < −2.5 in order to give treatment at the same fracture risk level as those shown to be efficient in the clinical trials. However, if the threshold were based on annual hip fracture rates similar to those observed in the placebo group of the HORIZON trial (0.76%), it would result in a severely reduced specificity. Women aged 55 to 85 would then receive treatment already at DXR T-scores of ≤ −0.59, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.97, but with the poor specificity of 0.23. This would lead to substantially higher numbers needed to treat in order to avoid one hip fracture.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, regimens, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate romosozumab for up to 1 year to reduce the risk of vertebral, hip, and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at very high risk of fractures, such as with severe osteoporosis (low T-score < −2.5 and fractures) or multiple vertebral fractures.

Expanding the risk stratification approach to osteoporosis care

In recent years, domestic and international organizations, such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Endocrinology, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, and the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, have recommended an expanded framework for stratifying risk for fracture into additional high risk and very high risk categories to guide treatment decision making.

The Working Group recommends increased and earlier routine screening of BMD and fracture risk assessment than the current guidelines by initiating evaluation at the time of menopause, leveraging the risk-based stratification paradigm to appropriately address BMD concerns based on the individual's risk category. Based on the results of that assessment, when making treatment recommendations, moderate-risk patients could be put on an estrogen patch, raloxifene, or in some cases, a short course of oral bisphosphonates.

High-risk patients could be treated with oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, rank ligand antibody injections, or in some cases, anabolic agents. Very high-risk patients should be considered for anabolic agents as initial therapy, followed by antiresorptive agents. Not only does this expanded stratification approach guide decisions regarding pharmacotherapy, but it also seeks to leverage lifestyle interventions and education, particularly for low- to moderate-risk patients, further supporting a lifespan approach to bone health care.

It should be strongly noted that physicians utilizing this approach must take care to emphasize the value of lifestyle as a first line of treatment for low- to moderate-risk patients and limit pharmacologic intervention to patients with qualifying levels of risk.

### Aromatase inhibitors and fracture prevention-do 2017 guidelines work in real world? [^e2f4910a]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

In the UK, most centres follow 2008 Consensus position statement from a UK Expert Group which recommended bisphosphonates for postmenopausal women younger than 75 years with T-scores < −2.0 or with bone loss ⩾ 4% per year in pre-existing osteopenia (T scores between −1.1 to −2.4). At our centre, this translated to only a quarter of women with osteopenia qualifying for bisphosphonates leading to over one in ten women fracturing during follow up.

In 2017, The Joint position statement of the International Osteoporosis Foundation, Cancer and Bone Society, European Calcified Tissue Society, International Expert Group for AIBL, European Society for Clinical and Economics Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, and Musculoskeletal Diseases, International Menopause Society and International Society for Geriatric Oncology recommended starting anti-osteoporotic therapy when T-score is < −2.0 or with ⩾ 2 risk factors (including T-score < −1.5). When we switched to these guidelines, an extra 15% women qualified for bone active therapy thereby achieving absolute fracture reduction of 10% compared to the earlier cohort. Our study confirms the superiority of the 2017 joint position statement which were reinforced by European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO).

All guidelines concur on the need to offer bone sparing therapy for women with osteoporosis however the differences exist in recommendations for osteopenia. Our study reaffirms that a significant number of fractures occur in women with osteopenia. The differential improvement in fractures observed is largely down to the extra 15% of women qualifying for antiresorptive therapy based on 2017 guidelines. This endorses the need for holistic risk assessment and lower threshold for intervention in women with low bone mass considering all risk factors.

There are several caveats to consider including monocentric, retrospective nature of the study with two unmatched cohorts in a diverse ethnic setting thus making generalisability of the findings difficult. Additionally, data was not collected on markers of bone turnover, vitamin D levels or administration of concomitant glucocorticosteroids or chemotherapy which may have been confounding factors. However, the strengths include a large cohort with a long follow up period, availability of comprehensive clinical data and ability to provide hard outcome of fracture rather than BMD data.

Decision-making on pharmacologic therapy — local context and individualization: Therapeutic intervention thresholds vary by country based on cost, threshold-setting approach, and available modalities and resources; clinical experience of the treating physician should be incorporated with best practices and local resources. The potential risks and benefits of osteoporosis interventions should be reviewed and incorporated into local guidelines while allowing physicians to individualize treatment decisions for patient preferences and circumstances.
