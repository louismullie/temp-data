## Question

How should sharp abdominal pain be worked up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to work up sharp abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should review the focused history and physical examination. Next, I will consider initial laboratory testing. After that, I need to decide on imaging based on pain location, patient characteristics, and risk. Then, I should weigh conditional versus direct CT strategies and diagnostic stewardship. I will also integrate special considerations for "sharp" pain, determine observation versus immediate disposition, apply decision tools, and set clear follow-up and safety netting recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priority: assess stability and intervene if unstable, because hypotension or shock shifts the pathway to resuscitation and rapid bedside ultrasound to detect free fluid, with expedited operative management when indicated; I should double-check trauma guidance to avoid delays in life-threatening etiologies such as intra-abdominal hemorrhage or hollow viscus injury in the unstable patient [^111H1jke] [^112GmKXV].

> Next, I should review the focused history and exam to localize and characterize the pain and identify red flags; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — location, onset, radiation, severity, peritoneal signs, vital instability, gastrointestinal bleeding, and distension all steer the differential, while age, pregnancy status, prior surgery, vascular disease, immunocompromise, and anticoagulation modify pretest probabilities; I need to ensure extra-abdominal causes like pneumonia or pulmonary embolism are not missed when pain is sharp and pleuritic [^112BidjC].

> I will now examine the initial laboratory approach: a baseline panel including CBC with differential, inflammatory markers, electrolytes, renal function, hepatobiliary enzymes, lipase, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test when applicable, with targeted testing such as lactate when mesenteric ischemia is suspected; wait, let me verify the ischemia signal — "pain out of proportion" and rising lactate heighten concern, but I should confirm with imaging rather than relying on labs alone [^112BidjC] [^117Bfwyq].

> Let me think about imaging selection by location and population because this is pivotal; for right upper quadrant pain I should confirm ultrasound as first-line, for lower quadrant pain in adults CT with IV contrast is often preferred, whereas in children I need to start with ultrasound and reserve CT for inconclusive cases, and in pregnancy I should prioritize ultrasound or MRI without gadolinium; for diffuse nonlocalized pain, I should confirm that contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis is generally indicated and consider noncontrast CT only if IV contrast is contraindicated; I need to ensure that special contexts such as postoperative fever, suspected leak, or neutropenia receive prompt contrast-enhanced CT as well [^112BidjC] [^112TdBTm] [^1158fzNi] [^1174tgeC] [^114VwB1P].

> Hold on, I should verify the stewardship balance between conditional and direct CT; evidence supports an ultrasound-first approach followed by CT if ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic to maximize sensitivity for urgent conditions while limiting radiation, but I should confirm the diagnostic performance — CT has higher sensitivity than ultrasound for urgent intra-abdominal pathology, and a conditional CT strategy can minimize missed diagnoses with less radiation than CT-for-all; direct-to-CT is justified for high-risk scenarios such as peritonitis, suspected free perforation, mesenteric ischemia, rupturing AAA, or in older adults with severe nonlocalized pain where disease prevalence is high [^112BidjC] [^11118GHx] [^112BidjC] [^112TdBTm] [^112EpQGz].

> For pediatrics, I should double-check diagnostic stewardship specifics; ultrasound-first for suspected appendicitis is recommended, and I need to be mindful that a high cross-sectional imaging-to-appendicitis ratio suggests overutilization; but wait, what about safety — reassuringly, statewide collaborative data show very low delayed diagnosis rates of appendicitis after ED discharge when stewardship is emphasized, supporting a measured approach [^114VwB1P] [^111qzHNv].

> Let me consider what "sharp" pain implies; sudden, sharp, severe pain should heighten suspicion for perforation, mesenteric ischemia, ovarian or testicular torsion, ruptured AAA, or ruptured ectopic pregnancy, whereas sharp pleuritic pain warrants evaluation for pulmonary causes that can mimic abdominal pain; I need to ensure a lower threshold for immediate cross-sectional imaging and surgical or specialty consultation when these are on the table [^112BidjC] [^117Bfwyq].

> Wait, let me verify one nuance about contrast; I initially thought I should add oral contrast broadly when obstruction or perforation is suspected, but hold on, I should reconsider — modern ED pathways increasingly avoid routine oral contrast because it often delays care without improving critical outcomes, and while upright chest radiographs can show free air, CT is far more sensitive for detecting perforation, so I should correct that earlier assumption and prioritize contrast-enhanced CT based on the clinical question and contraindications [^1135ZSij] [^112TdBTm] [^112BidjC].

> I need to check disposition pathways; low-risk patients with improving symptoms and reassuring exams and labs can be discharged with explicit return precautions and timely re-evaluation, intermediate-risk patients benefit from observation with serial exams and repeat labs, and high-risk patients with peritoneal signs, instability, or concerning labs require immediate imaging and expedited surgical consultation rather than prolonged observation [^112vMi9p] [^112BidjC].

> Next, I should review decision tools; the Alvarado score (and pediatric adaptations) can help stratify pretest probability of appendicitis and guide the choice and sequence of imaging, though I need to ensure these tools complement rather than replace clinical judgment and imaging in equivocal cases [^115Kx1L8] [^114VwB1P] [^114wFAj5].

> I should confirm follow-up and safety netting; clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, vomiting, or syncope, along with a 24–48 hour re-evaluation plan, reduce missed pathology, and encouragingly, contemporary pediatric data indicate a delayed appendicitis diagnosis rate of approximately 0.1% after ED discharge, which helps balance stewardship and safety in practice [^111qzHNv].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm without skipping verification: stabilize the unstable with bedside ultrasound and surgical activation, proceed in stable patients with targeted history, exam, and labs, then select imaging by location and risk, with ultrasound-first where appropriate and conditional CT when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, while using direct contrast-enhanced CT for high-risk or nonlocalized presentations; this approach captures urgent conditions with high sensitivity and leverages evidence that CT outperforms ultrasound for many urgent diagnoses, yet conditional strategies can reduce radiation without sacrificing accuracy [^112TdBTm] [^113NoZTN] [^11118GHx].

The workup for sharp abdominal pain should be **structured and rapid**, starting with **ABCs and hemodynamic stability** [^112BidjC]. Begin with a **focused history** (onset, location, character, radiation, associated symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and risk factors) and a **targeted physical exam** (vitals, abdominal exam, and rectal/pelvic exam as indicated) [^1149qknL]. Order initial labs (CBC, CMP, lipase, lactate, urinalysis, pregnancy test in females of reproductive age) and select imaging based on clinical suspicion [^113NoZTN]: ultrasound for RUQ or pelvic pain [^111kDKdj], CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for generalized or lower quadrant pain [^112TdBTm], and MRI for pregnant patients [^112BidjC]. Early surgical consultation is essential for suspected surgical emergencies, and prompt analgesia and supportive care should be provided.

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Immediate assessment of **airway, breathing, and circulation** and hemodynamic status is essential [^1114fmQt]; initiate prompt resuscitation if unstable. Obtain a **focused history** [^112BidjC] detailing onset, location, character, radiation, associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea, constipation, urinary symptoms), comorbidities, medications, and risk factors such as anticoagulation, recent surgery, trauma, or pregnancy [^1149qknL]. Perform a **targeted examination** including vital signs and a complete abdominal exam (tenderness, rebound, guarding, rigidity, masses, bowel sounds) [^112BidjC], with rectal and pelvic examinations as indicated [^1149qknL].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for infection [^1111Jzaz], inflammation, anemia, or bleeding [^112BidjC].

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess electrolytes, renal [^111kDKdj], and hepatic function [^112BidjC].

- **Lipase**: Evaluate for pancreatitis [^112BidjC].

- **Lactate**: Assess for ischemia [^117Bfwyq] or sepsis [^112BidjC].

- **Urinalysis**: Identify urinary tract infection [^111kDKdj] or hematuria [^112BidjC].

- **Pregnancy test**: Essential in females of reproductive age [^114VwB1P] to rule out ectopic pregnancy [^112BidjC].

---

## Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound**: First-line for RUQ pain (gallstones, cholecystitis) [^111kDKdj], pelvic pain (ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion) [^112BidjC], and pediatric patients [^114VwB1P].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Preferred for generalized or lower quadrant pain (appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, perforation, mesenteric ischemia) [^113NoZTN] [^112BidjC] [^112TdBTm].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Useful in pregnant patients or when radiation exposure is a concern [^112TdBTm] [^112BidjC].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis includes **surgical emergencies** — appendicitis [^113k1sn7], cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, perforated ulcer, mesenteric ischemia [^117Bfwyq], ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, testicular torsion, hernia incarceration, and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^111kDKdj] — and **medical conditions** such as gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia [^112BidjC].

---

## Red flags and indications for immediate surgical consultation

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Hypotension, tachycardia, shock [^1149qknL].

- **Peritonitis**: Rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity [^111kDKdj].

- **Severe pain with minimal exam findings**: Suggests mesenteric ischemia [^117Bfwyq].

- **Suspected surgical emergencies**: Appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, perforation, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, testicular torsion, hernia incarceration, abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^113NoZTN].

---

## Special considerations

In pediatric patients, **ultrasound is preferred**, with key considerations including appendicitis, intussusception, volvulus, and testicular torsion [^114VwB1P] [^111qzHNv]. In pregnant patients, MRI or ultrasound is preferred [^112TdBTm], with ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis prioritized on the differential. In elderly patients, presentations are often atypical and carry a higher risk of serious pathology, warranting a lower threshold for imaging and surgical consultation [^112yNKfH].

---

## Management and disposition

Provide **prompt analgesia and supportive measures** [^1114fmQt]. For nonspecific abdominal pain without red flags, consider observation and arrange outpatient re-evaluation when appropriate [^114SRLF5] [^112vMi9p]. Decide on admission or discharge based on clinical stability, the working diagnosis, and response to initial treatment. A structured approach to sharp abdominal pain includes **initial stabilization**, focused history and exam, targeted labs and imaging, and early surgical consultation for suspected emergencies to ensure **timely diagnosis and management** and reduce morbidity and mortality [^113NoZTN].

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide clinicians with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain, and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, it discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intra-abdominal abscess, particularly concerning diagnostic imaging, ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis in patients with nonlocalized abdominal pain not otherwise specified. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast should be obtained for patients unable to receive IV contrast. Consider obtaining an MRI as another imaging modality to provide clinically useful information in this clinical setting.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes, such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain, should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability.

Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases.

Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and the index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis.

In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

When evaluating functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, the first step is to rule out "red flags" or alarm signals of structural organic disease, which necessitate referral to a specialist.

- **Ruling out organic pathology**: When a patient first presents to primary care with symptoms of FACP, it is crucial to eliminate the possibility of potentially serious organic disease. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease require attention and are detailed in specific criteria. Patients displaying any indicators of organic disease should be referred to a specialist for further investigation.

- **Investigations and diagnosis**: All patients presenting with FACP symptoms in primary care should undergo a thorough evaluation, which includes reviewing family history, medication, characteristics of pain, and eating/bowel habits. In selected cases, and at the discretion of the physician, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be appropriate. Additionally, abdominal ultrasound investigations can be beneficial.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study.

Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (e.g. acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are necessarily related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### Development and validation of the Comprehensive Acute Pancreatitis Pain Core Outcome Set (CAPPOS): Study protocol [^115LVmU1]. Pancreas (2025). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a leading cause of gastrointestinal hospitalizations worldwide, with rising incidence, significant morbidity, and high healthcare costs. Pain, a hallmark symptom of AP, remains inadequately assessed, often relying on unidimensional scales such as the visual analogue score, which fail to capture its multidimensional nature. Poorly managed acute pain negatively impacts clinical outcomes, prolongs recovery, and increases the risk of chronic pain syndromes. Comprehensive pain assessment tools specific to AP are lacking, highlighting the need for improved evaluation methods. The proposed study aims to develop and validate the Comprehensive Acute Pancreatitis Pain Outcome Set (CAPPOS) to address this evidence gap.

- **Methods**: The CAPPOS initiative follows COMET and COSMIN guidelines. Three systematic reviews will identify pain domains and assessment methods in AP, acute abdominal pain, and post-pancrectomy pain. A consensus process, using a modified Delphi approach, will involve multidisciplinary experts and patients to confirm and define key domains. Measurement tools will be selected for each domain and refined through iterative feedback. Pilot testing with 50 patients will evaluate the feasibility, clarity, and responsiveness to change of the preliminary tool. Validation studies with 200 AP patients will assess structural, content, and criterion validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change, ensuring content validity and clinical utility.

- **Conclusion**: CAPPOS will provide a validated, multidimensional core outcome set to optimize pain assessment and management in AP.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function tests are helpful in indicating the possibility of biliary colic, as is microscopic hematuria, which may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign, self-limiting illnesses with no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. High white blood cell (WBC) counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease, where patients tend to have raised white cell counts and demonstrate signs of peritonism. This can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and commonly, patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging, such as ultrasound, is helpful.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^115BjHzp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests, including blood gas and lactate levels, is also important to look for indications of bowel ischemia. The grade of recommendation is a strong recommendation, based on low- or very-low-quality evidence, 1C.

- **Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus**: Symptoms include abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting (a late sign). In 30%–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This triad is much more common in endemic volvulus than in the sporadic type (88% versus 33%).

- **Clinical presentation**: In the "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In this fulminant clinical presentation, the prognosis is poor because colonic necrosis and perforation may have already occurred by the time the patient first presents for care. Conversely, in Western countries, the patient usually presents 3 to 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The typical patient is elderly, institutionalized, and under psychotropic medications that cause chronic constipation. The history should elicit the aforementioned risk factors, including a personal history of previous sigmoid volvulus, which is present in 30%–40% of cases.

- **Clinical examination**: The classic clinical examination will identify abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds, and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often complicated due to the presence of abdominal distension, which is the result of colonic obstruction.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^112uJff2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain across all ages, affecting 7% of the US population and having an incidence of 1.1 cases per 1,000 persons each year. However, diagnosing acute appendicitis can be perplexing, especially during the early stages, potentially delaying diagnosis and contributing to persistent rates of morbidity and mortality. Classic signs and symptoms are present in only 60% to 70% of cases, underscoring the challenge of making a correct diagnosis. Therefore, clinicians must enhance their diagnostic skills by carefully assessing these signs and symptoms.

When employing standard clinical methods, a correct diagnosis can be achieved in 71% to 97% of cases, with the rate of negative appendectomies ranging from 14% to 75%. In certain regions, this rate may reach 85%. The incidence of perforated appendicitis varies from 4% to 45%, and the mortality rate ranges from 0.17% to 7.5%, peaking at 20% in children under two years of age.

### An approach to the patient with chronic undiagnosed abdominal pain [^114HA7ey]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for referral to a gastroenterologist. The workup of patients with chronic abdominal pain can be extremely challenging as clinicians are responsible for determining whether the patient can be observed, treated symptomatically, or if the abdominal pain indicates a more systemic disease. The differential is typically wide, and given the innervation of the abdomen, localization of abdominal pain does not always provide clear insight into the etiology. This review attempts to help the gastroenterologist narrow down that broad differential and focus on key elements of the patient visit.

We emphasize the importance of a detailed history from the patient, along with reviewing specific details of their history and physical examination that can provide clues about the etiology of the abdominal pain. We review the causes of diffuse abdominal pain that may not first be considered, along with uncommon causes of localized abdominal pain. We also review the functional causes of abdominal pain and the importance of identifying these disorders to avoid unnecessary testing that commonly occurs with these patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blunt abdominal trauma, particularly in the context of initial evaluation, the WSES 2022 guidelines recommend considering the use of scoring systems. These systems should incorporate radiological, biochemical, and clinical signs to guide management in challenging scenarios.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^113jvDyY]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Formerly, these patients were thought to have an acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, do not all undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity are operated on.

Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are both frequently used on top of clinical and laboratory evaluation. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium in patients with acute abdominal pain. Others favor ultrasound as the primary imaging technique mainly because ultrasound is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation exposure at CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer. This is a drawback of CT, especially as it is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies next to CT, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, diagnoses should not be missed or delayed, and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be used.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favored a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound as the initial approach.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for efficient throughput of patients. Decision-making in patients with abdominal pain based solely on clinical and laboratory evaluations can result in unnecessary interventions or delays in treating urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, especially ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), can assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to positively affect the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, lead to changes in management decisions, and increase diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has increased hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of radiation exposure for adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence-based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has provided guidelines for imaging patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. However, these patient-tailored guidelines may not sufficiently cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^112vMi9p]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The present study was conducted in a middle-sized teaching hospital equipped with a 24-hour emergency service, including surgery, radiology, intensive care, and on-call consultants in pediatrics, gynecology, and internal medicine. All consecutive patients with acute abdominal pain evaluated in the emergency department (ED) by a surgical department resident between June 2005 and July 2006 were included in the study.

The surgical resident made the primary assessment, with a consultant surgeon evaluating the patient if necessary. Exclusions from the study were patients evaluated at another hospital for the same complaint, those with abdominal pain due to trauma, and patients who underwent radiological examination (ultrasound or CT) before surgical consultation. A structured diagnostic and management strategy algorithm was followed for all patients.

First, a "clinical diagnosis" (D1) was made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and biochemical blood and urine analyses. The resident recorded their degree of certainty for the clinical diagnosis on a scale from 1 to 5. An initial management proposal (S1) was formulated based on the clinical diagnosis. All clinical parameters, the clinical diagnosis (D1), and the proposed strategy (S1) were documented on a study form.

After a conference with the consulting surgeon, a decision was made on whether to perform additional radiological examinations. When such studies were conducted, the radiologist was asked to confirm the clinical diagnosis or provide an alternative diagnosis.

### Approach to abdominal imaging in 2022 [^111Gw6LE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain represents 5% to 7% of all emergency department presentations. Many patients require imaging for diagnosis, and choosing the appropriate imaging modality is a crucial decision point. Modern medicine offers a fantastic array of options including abdominal radiograph, computed tomography, MRI, and ultrasonography. However, the plethora of alternatives can be paralyzing. This article introduces the commonly available modalities, discusses the advantages and disadvantages, and presents recommendations for commonly diagnosed conditions.

### Acute abdominal pain in the older adult [^112yNKfH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain in older adults is a concerning symptom common to a variety of diagnoses with high morbidity and mortality. Organizing the differential into categories based on pathology — such as inflammatory, obstructive, vascular, or other causes — provides a framework for the history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies. An organized approach, along with treatment and considerations specific to the geriatric population, is discussed.

### Severe bradycardia in a teenager as the initial manifestation for Guillain Barré syndrome: a case report [^111YHF2L]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A previously healthy, 17-year-old male adolescent arrived at the Emergency Room Department in mid-February 2020, complaining of acute-onset left flank abdominal pain with an intensity of 5/10, associated with diarrhea and lipothymia. Initial evaluation revealed a heart rate of 20–27 beats per minute, requiring immediate transfer to the Pediatric Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and monitoring.

Due to the abdominal pain and diarrhea, an infectious etiology was considered. Following blood, urine, and stool cultures, treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated. Laboratory evaluation revealed that complete cell blood count, glucose, venous gases, renal function, hepatic function, and serum electrolytes (sodium 139 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L, calcium 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 5 mg/dL, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL) were all within normal limits, and a toxicology screen was negative.

A contrasted abdominal CT showed mild concentric wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon, and inflammatory periportal and perivascular reaction in the soft tissue. Mild leukopenia was observed (WBC count of 4860/mm³), with normal erythrocyte and platelet counts and a negative C-reactive protein (0.01 mg/dL). Early improvement of acute gastroenteritis was observed, and antibiotic treatment was discontinued soon after blood and stool culture results were negative.

### Peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain: Can physical examination limit diagnostic testing [^114yQZUV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The emergency department evaluation of patients with abdominal pain is most appropriately directed at identifying acute inflammation, infection, obstruction, or surgical disease. This often involves "routine" (and often extensive) diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing. Benign mimics of serious visceral abdominal pain that can be diagnosed by physical exam and confirmed with local anesthetic injections have been identified over the last century. These syndromes derive from painful irritation of the intercostal nerves by a mobile rib below, or from impingement of the cutaneous branches of those same intercostal nerves as they penetrate the abdominal wall. These peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain continue to go unrecognized and underdiagnosed.

- **Methods**: Our purpose is to review the affirmative diagnosis of non-visceral abdominal pain by physical examination.

- **Results**: The consequences of failure to identify these conditions are considerable. In the search for a diagnosis that is literally at the provider's fingertips, patients frequently undergo months to years of fruitless and often invasive diagnostic tests, not uncommonly including unsuccessful surgeries.

- **Conclusions**: With proper consideration of and appropriate testing for visceral etiologies, a carefully directed physical examination may yield an affirmative diagnosis in a percentage of these common emergency department patients.

### A randomized, controlled trial of routine early abdominal computed tomography in patients presenting with non-specific acute abdominal pain [^116WvLTW]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of an initial early computed tomography (CT) examination versus standard practice (SP) on the length of hospital stay, diagnostic accuracy, and mortality of adults presenting with acute abdominal pain.

- **Materials and methods**: Two hundred and five adults presenting with acute abdominal pain were randomized to undergo an early CT examination or SP, which comprised supine abdominal and erect chest radiography. One hundred and ninety-eight patients (99 in each arm) were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint was the duration of inpatient stay; secondary endpoints were diagnostic certainty and mortality.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two arms (p = 0.20). At randomization, 36% (35 of 96) of CT patients and 49% (48 of 98) of SP patients were correctly diagnosed; 24 hours after randomization, the correct diagnosis had been established in 84% of CT patients and 73% of SP patients. This refinement in diagnostic certainty was significantly better in the CT group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mortality between the two trial arms (p = 0.31).

In conclusion, early abdominal CT in patients with acute abdominal pain improves diagnostic certainty but does not reduce the length of hospital stay and 6-month mortality.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113z6sUS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Whether outcomes for abdominal pain patients have changed with additional imaging requires further study using data sets other than NHAMCS, which does not record outcomes after the ED visit and any subsequent hospitalization. For pulmonary embolisms, increased use of CT angiography yielded additional diagnoses, but those diagnoses were less severe and of unclear clinical significance. The impact of additional diagnoses on population health depends on the natural history of untreated compared to treated disease. For instance, patients with small gallstones diagnosed by CT or ultrasound might be overintervened upon once diagnosed, perpetuating overutilization of health care, whereas early appendicitis diagnoses allow for successful antibiotic treatment or laparoscopic surgery before a perforation can occur.

The distribution of diagnosis categories within EGS conditions varied across age groups. Appendicitis was a top 10 diagnosis for all age groups, contrary to clinical guidelines that suggest it is more prevalent at younger ages, although in absolute terms it remains more common at younger ages. Colitis was in the top 10 diagnoses for younger adults but not for older ages; these acute colitis diagnoses may represent overdiagnosis, where viral or other benign infectious or inflammatory causes of colitis are being uncovered by CT, resulting in potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Biliary disease, primarily calculi and cholecystitis, was prevalent in all ages, but ultrasound — a methodology well suited to these diagnoses — was used approximately twice as much in young adults.

### Acute mesenteric ischaemia: A pictorial review [^117Bfwyq]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinically, EAMI is characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain in patients over 70 years old with a history of atrial fibrillation. In the early course of the disease, it can be characterized by an initial discrepancy between the severity of abdominal pain and minimal findings on physical examination. Patients can also present with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and initial forced evacuation. The location of pain varies, but as ischaemia progresses to infarction, it becomes diffuse, and signs of peritoneal irritation appear. The development of transmural infarction may also be signaled by fever, bloody diarrhea, and shock.

- **Thrombotic arterial mesenteric ischaemia (TAMI)**: TAMI has a more indolent course. Patients experience a gradual progression of arterial occlusion and may report symptoms of mesenteric angina, including postprandial abdominal pain lasting up to 3 hours and nausea, which results in "food fear", early satiety, and weight loss. In the acute setting, however, the clinical symptoms are similar to those found in patients with EAMI. The main risk factors for TAMI are atherosclerotic disease and dyslipidemia. There may be a history of other vascular events and previous vascular surgery.

- **Venous acute mesenteric ischaemia (VAMI)**: Mesenteric venous thrombosis may be caused by infiltrative, neoplastic, or inflammatory/infectious conditions. VAMI appears in younger patients, over 40, sometimes with several days of mild symptoms. Although occasionally idiopathic, up to 50% of patients have an identifiable risk factor, such as previous deep venous thrombosis.

### Pain intensity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis in an international, prospective study [^111pxitE]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**:
	- **Study design**: The database used for this post-hoc analysis was from the international, prospective PAINAP study, which has been detailed in previous publications. The study was observational, with patient treatment decisions made solely by the treatment-responsible physicians at each inclusion site. Patients were recruited upon admission within a 3-month interval in 2022, with a 1-month follow-up for each patient. All centers obtained local approval before data collection, adhering to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. In total, 118 centers across 27 countries participated. All adult patients (≥ 18 years) admitted directly to inclusion sites with first-time acute pancreatitis (AP) were eligible. Patients referred from other hospitals were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were chronic pancreatitis, recurrent AP, and pregnancy. For this post-hoc analysis, patients with missing data for key variables (age, sex, pain intensity on admission, or AP outcomes) were excluded.

- **Outcome variables**: The PAINAP database included patient demographic details (age, sex, continent of inclusion site, etiology, and comorbidity quantified by the Charlson Comorbidity Index), pain characteristics (duration before admission and intensity on admission), and AP outcomes (severity and local complications according to the revised Atlanta classification, organ failure — including type of organ failure — length of admission reported in days, and mortality). Patients were categorized as having pancreatic necrosis (yes/no) if they developed any such condition.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: An algorithm of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^1135xHQE]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The workup for a patient with concerns of a ventral abdominal wall or groin hernia begins with a thorough history and physical examination. It is essential that the physical examination include all potential sites of abdominal wall hernia, including the groin and perineal areas, especially in patients with more vague presenting symptoms. Incarcerated hernias, especially in the groin, can be easily missed by a more superficial examination.

After the diagnosis of a hernia has been made, the specific location, surgical history, associated symptoms, and patient-specific factors will help determine the appropriate next steps in management. History should focus on the duration of symptoms, prior episodes of hernia incarceration, past surgical history, and evidence of systemic signs of illness, including fever, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, or skin changes overlying the hernia.

Physical examination should evaluate the location of the hernia, the size of the fascial defect, the presence of hernia incarceration, and any redness or ecchymosis of the overlying skin. For a well-defined localized fascial defect, adding imaging to the initial diagnostic workup is of unclear benefit and is not mandatory. If there are concerns for a complicated abdominal wall hernia, based on either patient factors or hernia variables, additional workup should be considered, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained to include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and lactate.

The determination of the need and urgency for surgical repair will depend on various factors.

Cross-sectional imaging in the emergency department (ED) has increased substantially over more than a decade. Rising rates of emergency general surgery diagnoses suggest that this increase in imaging may be resulting in additional diagnoses of intervenable disease. We urgently need data sources that link ED visitation to 30-day outcomes to determine whether these rising rates of imaging-driven diagnoses lead to improvements in health.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^111qzHNv]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship is the effort to optimize diagnostic testing to reduce errors while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment. Abdominal pain and appendicitis in children are essential use cases. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis can be dangerous and even life-threatening, but overtesting is harmful.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5–17 years presenting with abdominal pain to 26 emergency departments (EDs) within the Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative (MEDIC) from May 1, 2016, to February 29, 2024. We defined two outcome measures summarized by ED. First, we describe the cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio, defined as the count of ED visits resulting in any cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) divided by the count of ED visits with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Second, we describe the delayed diagnosis rate, defined by an ED visit for abdominal pain resulting in a discharge and subsequent return visit with a diagnosis of appendicitis within 7 days.

The sample included 120,112 pediatric visits for abdominal pain at 26 EDs; 4,967 (4.1%) were diagnosed with appendicitis. The cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio varied by site, from as low as 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1–0.2) at a pediatric site to as high as 7.9 (95% CI 4.8–16.4) at an urban ED. The proportion of pediatric ED visits for abdominal pain that resulted in an identified delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was 0.1% (141/120,112). All but four sites had fewer than 10 cases of delayed diagnosis across the study period.

The patient presented with two of the three criteria from the revised Atlanta classification, including acute onset epigastric pain and elevated lipase, which led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) without a clear etiology. Given that the patient was previously well, the negative workup for common causes of AP, and the progressive history of cannabis use coinciding with the onset of symptoms, the likely cause for the patient's symptoms was ingestion of cannabis. He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) with a secondary upper gastrointestinal bleed resulting from a Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike CT, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation; it represents a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X-rays are poorly sensitive and poorly specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that utilization of imaging modalities increased as they became more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5‐fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain grew to become the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age; yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visits has been shown to receive an X-ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults, and this occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growth of these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized at the time of writing that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X-ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^1168bZoS]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Eligible patients gave written informed consent before inclusion. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the study protocol. Included patients underwent a medical history evaluation, physical examination, and initial laboratory investigations. A diagnosis based on clinical evaluation and laboratory investigation was recorded. Thereafter, patients were investigated with a full structured imaging protocol, including upright chest and supine abdominal plain radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT scans. After assessment of the plain radiographs by the physician in the emergency department, a new diagnosis was recorded. Ultrasonography and CT scans were each interpreted without disclosure of any results from the other investigation, although clinical information was available to the readers of ultrasonography and CT. The reader recorded the radiological diagnosis from the same list of diagnoses used by the physicians in the emergency department.

A general survey of the abdomen was conducted using ultrasonography with the graded compression technique. CT images were obtained from the diaphragm to the groins. The CT protocols included an effective mAs level of 165, 120 kV, a maximum of 2.5 mm collimation, a maximum of 3 mm slice width, and a 0.5-second rotation time, with the injection of 125 mL intravenous contrast following a 60-second delay at 3 ml/s; no oral or rectal contrast agents were used. CT scans conducted after office hours were re-evaluated blindly the next day by a radiologist.

**Results**: Inclusion started in March 2005, and 1101 patients were included over the following 21 months. For six months, we recorded invited patients who declined in the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam; 2% (4/188) of the patients approached refused to participate. Data collection could not be completed for 80 patients. We found no significant differences between these 80 patients and the included patients in terms of age, sex, or time or type of presentation. The mean age of the remaining 1021 patients was 47 (range 19–94) years, and 55% (n = 565) were female. Most patients (75%; n = 766) had been referred to the emergency department by a general practitioner. Seventeen percent (17%; n = 169) were self-referrals, 7% (n = 73) were referred by other medical specialties, and 1% (n = 13) were presented by emergency services.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^117B5yz6]. Surgical endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Determining the best moment to perform surgery in the case of acute appendicitis is of crucial importance. Acute appendicitis has traditionally been considered an irreversible progressive disease, although recent studies have questioned this dogma. Currently, it is endorsed that two types of appendicitis exist: uncomplicated (non-perforating) and complicated (perforating) appendicitis. The aetiology and pathogenesis of acute appendicitis remain largely unknown, and predicting whether appendicitis will follow a mild or fulminant course is not possible. Delaying an appendectomy increases the risk of perforated appendicitis, which is associated with a higher incidence of both short- and long-term morbidity. Hence, it is recommended to perform an appendectomy as soon as possible. It should be noted, however, that some studies have revealed that the clinical outcome was not affected by the time to surgery when surgery was performed within 12 hours after presentation at the emergency department.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

- **Certain elements of the history and physical examination**: Constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction, whereas anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis.

- **Imaging recommendations**: The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on the location of pain. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, while computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain.

- **Special populations**: It is important to consider women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease that may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^1151fS7o]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The study explores trends in visits, imaging practices, and diagnosis patterns for abdominal pain presentations in emergency departments across the United States from 2007 to 2019. The analysis reveals significant changes over the years.

- **Trends in visits**: The number of emergency department visits for abdominal pain showed a noticeable increase, highlighting the growing burden on healthcare facilities.

- **Imaging practices**: There has been a marked rise in the use of imaging technologies, such as CT scans, which suggests a shift towards more diagnostic testing for abdominal pain cases.

- **Diagnosis patterns**: Changes were observed in the diagnostic approaches, with an increase in the identification and management of various abdominal conditions.

This examination of trends provides valuable insight into the evolving landscape of emergency care for abdominal pain in the United States.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^116RRvWR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal X-rays are neither sensitive nor specific for acute pathology in older adults in the ED. In contrast to ultrasound and CT scan use patterns, over the 2007–2019 time period, X-ray administration decreased for all age groups. Despite this decline, usage remains high, particularly in the older adult population where 13% of abdominal pain visits received an X-ray as the sole diagnostic imaging modality in 2019.

While NHAMCS does not indicate the anatomical target of X-ray imaging, in this population who presented with abdominal pain, the majority of X-rays likely are abdominal plain films. Abdominal X-ray is an appropriate imaging modality for confirming gastric tube placement or identifying kidney stones. However, we did not find evidence that these uses contributed meaningfully to utilization of this imaging technique. We also did not find evidence that EGS diagnoses, where X-ray without CT is an appropriate means of diagnosis (e.g. gastrostomy tube confirmation), accounted for relatively high rates of plain film use. This suggests that dissemination of knowledge about this potentially ineffective, and relatively high radiation dose abdominal imaging modality may reduce overuse and improve outcomes.

Female patients comprise 55% of overall ED visits nationally, but 67% of abdominal pain visits. This difference was primarily driven by visits from reproductive age women, for whom there is additional diagnostic complexity due to chronic, painful conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, due to pregnancy, and due to acute conditions that can present with pain such as ovarian torsion.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113XxXfU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common reason for visit (RFV) to the emergency department (ED) for adults, yet no standardized diagnostic pathway exists for abdominal pain. Optimal management is age-specific as symptoms, diagnoses, and prognoses differ between young and old adults. The availability and knowledge of the effectiveness of various imaging modalities have also changed over time. To understand the practice patterns of abdominal imaging across age groups over time, we compared diagnostic imaging rates for younger versus older adults.

We analyzed weighted, nationally representative data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2007 to 2019 for adult ED visits with a primary RFV of abdominal pain. Our analysis included 23,364 sampled visits, which represent 123 million visits.

From 2007 to 2019, the total number of visits increased significantly for ages 18–45 (p < 0.001), 46–64 (p < 0.001), and 65+ (p = 0.032). The percentage of visits with a primary RFV of abdominal pain increased from 9.4% to 11.6% for ages 18–45, from 7.8% to 9.0% for ages 46–64, and from 6.0% to 6.5% for those aged 65 and older. Computed tomography (CT) scan rates also increased over time, from 26.2% of all patients receiving a CT scan to 42.6%. The greatest relative percentage change in abdominal CT scans occurred among older adults, with a 30.3% increase, compared to a 24.0% increase for middle-aged adults and a 15.0% increase for young adults. Test positivity, defined as receiving an emergency general surgical diagnosis following a CT or ultrasound, rose from 17.2% in 2007 to 22.9% in 2019 (p < 0.01). Of older adults with abdominal pain in 2019, 13% received an X-ray.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^112dBi6Q]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the leading chief complaint among emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for 8.8% of all visits. In addition to being the immediate concern for many index visits to the ED, abdominal pain accounts for nearly a quarter of all return visits within 72 hours. Although an ED chief complaint of abdominal pain carries high morbidity and mortality for older adults, its significance in younger and middle-aged adults remains poorly characterized.

Computed tomography (CT) scans can improve the diagnosis and management of abdominal pain cases, especially in older adults, and initially were shown to reduce negative exploratory surgery. These benefits extend beyond the ED visit, as abdominal CT scans for patients with abdominal pain in the ED reduced the rates of return to the ED within 30 days. CT scans may be particularly effective for diagnosing the oldest older adults (80 years and older), with 43% of positive CTs resulting in clinically unsuspected diagnoses prior to CT.

However, as CT has become widely available in United States EDs in the past two decades, controversy as to their use in a broader range of indications has emerged. The wide variation in CT ordering between individual ED physicians suggests potential over- and under-testing, sparking interest in optimizing imaging. Several guidelines have been compiled to address the risks and benefits of imaging to patients, as well as the cost of care. In 2010, the American College of Emergency Physicians updated their clinical policies to provide guidelines for imaging decision-making for risk stratification.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

While most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If a patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^115Kx1L8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). High credibility.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986, it is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups; however, it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to potential atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado Score as a diagnostic tool involves a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- **Right lower quadrant tenderness**: Worth 2 points.
- **Elevated temperature**: Higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius, adds 1 point.

The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The fully paired study design, with all imaging tests conducted in all patients and using the panel-based final diagnosis as the reference standard, allowed for a comprehensive comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. We compared the following single imaging strategies: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. Additionally, we investigated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients, followed by CT in those with a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result, and (6) ultrasonography in all patients with CT only for patients with inconclusive ultrasonography findings.

Imaging strategies driven by patient characteristics were also studied. In these strategies, only selected patients underwent initial ultrasonography with CT following a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, while all other patients underwent initial CT. For strategies involving initial ultrasonography, we selected (7) younger patients (< 45 years), for whom exposure to ionising radiation is most hazardous, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m²), in whom ultrasonography is more likely to yield diagnostic results. In another strategy (9), both younger and non-obese patients would undergo initial ultrasonography.

A widely held clinical perspective is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be informed by the location of the pain. Therefore, we explored strategies where the selection of ultrasonography or CT was driven by the specific abdominal quadrant afflicted.

### Operative management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery in the emergency setting: The OBA guidelines [^112SGxRs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion of evidence**: Damage control surgery (DCS) represents a staged surgical approach to the treatment of critically ill patients. It has three stages: an abbreviated initial operative procedure with temporary abdominal closure (TAC), continued resuscitation and management of physiologic and acid–base derangements, and definitive treatment and closure.

At present, there are no good quality published prospective studies focused on the implementation of DCS in the management of patients with a previous history of bariatric surgery. Basic science data indicates that open abdomen management with negative pressure peritoneal therapy may fundamentally affect the propagation of inflammatory biomediators in severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis, although there are certainly risks to its use. Ongoing studies, such as the closed or open after laparotomy for severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis trial, are attempting to answer these questions, and bariatric surgery patients are not excluded from enrollment.

The threshold to operate on patients in the emergency setting due to late complications of bariatric surgery, when radiological findings are inconclusive, should be lower if they present with acute abdominal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tenderness) and/or persistent tachycardia. Surgery is mandatory within the first 12–24 hours to achieve a good outcome and decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Laparoscopy is considered a safe technique if skills are present and if the patient is hemodynamically stable.

### Delays in imaging diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in the emergency setting [^1135ZSij]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common cause of ED visits and often requires imaging to identify a specific diagnosis. Prompt and appropriate imaging plays a crucial role in patient management and leads to improved patient outcomes, decreased hospital stay, and improved ED workflow. There are many cases of abdominal pain in the ED with delayed diagnosis and management secondary to a combination of institutional policies and knowledge deficits in imaging guidelines.

Inappropriate use of abdominal radiographs, use of oral contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis, and concern for iodinated contrast-induced acute kidney injury are three of the more commonly encountered roadblocks to prompt imaging diagnosis of abdominal pain. The purpose of this review is to discuss why these potential causes of delayed diagnosis occur and how radiologists can help improve both imaging and ED workflow by utilizing the most up-to-date imaging guidelines, such as the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria and ACR Manual on Contrast Media, to assist clinicians working in the emergency setting.

### Association between advanced image ordered in the emergency department on subsequent imaging for abdominal pain patients [^116pU4Bg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study examines the relationship between advanced imaging techniques ordered in the emergency department (ED) and subsequent imaging for patients presenting with abdominal pain. It assesses whether initial imaging influences the likelihood of further imaging and potential implications for patient care and resource utilization.

- **Methods**: The research involved a retrospective analysis of patient data from an academic emergency department. Patients presenting with abdominal pain who received an initial advanced imaging study were included in the sample.

- **Results**: The analysis revealed that patients who underwent initial advanced imaging in the ED were more likely to receive additional imaging. This trend suggests potential overutilization of imaging resources.

- **Discussion**: The findings highlight the need for standardized guidelines to optimize imaging practices and reduce unnecessary diagnostic procedures. Recommendations for future research include evaluating interventions to guide decision-making in imaging utilization.

By addressing these aspects, the study underscores the importance of balanced imaging practices to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis [^114wFAj5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis remains challenging. The clinical presentation can vary from mild symptoms to signs of generalized peritonitis and sepsis. Hence, the value of individual clinical variables to determine the likelihood of acute appendicitis in a patient is low. Biochemical testing is routinely performed in most patients, but its value in confirming acute appendicitis is debatable. A recent systematic review showed that elevated C-reactive protein levels render the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by increased numbers of leucocytes, with an area under the curve of 0.75 [95% CI 0.71–0.78] and 0.72 [95% CI 0.68–0.76], respectively. The area under the curve represents the ability of a test to correctly classify patients. If the score is between 0.7 and 0.8, it represents a fair test.

- **Clinical and biochemical variables**: Both clinical and biochemical variables have been combined into clinical predicting rules (CPR) such as the Alvarado score and the paediatric appendicitis score (PAS) to increase the value of the individual variables. Ohle et al. demonstrated that the Alvarado score was good at "ruling-out" appendicitis with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 81%, respectively. In children, however, it has been shown that the PAS outperforms the Alvarado score.

- **Predictive value increase**: To increase the predictive value of these two tests, Ebell et al. identified new cut-off values for the Alvarado score and PAS, which improved sensitivity and specificity rates. Based on the Alvarado score, patients can now be categorized into low risk categories.

### Association between advanced image ordered in the emergency department on subsequent imaging for abdominal pain patients [^116W1Dxx]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is associated with high rates of emergency department (ED) imaging utilization and revisits. While imaging often improves diagnosis, a better understanding is needed on when the decision to image is justified and how it influences subsequent resource utilization and outcomes for patients in the ED presenting with abdominal pain. We evaluated the association between advanced ED imaging on subsequent outpatient imaging and on revisits among abdominal pain patients discharged from the ED.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, observational study was conducted using electronic health record data from an academic ED in the U.S. Midwest. A sample of Medicare patients with a chief complaint of abdominal pain from January 2013 to December 2016 following ED evaluation were included in the analysis. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between receiving advanced imaging in the ED and subsequent outpatient imaging within 7-, 14-, and 28-day windows after discharge, and 30-day revisit rates to the study ED and to any ED.

- **Results**: Of the 1385 ED visits with abdominal pain chief complaint and discharged home from the ED, individuals who were not imaged in the ED had significantly higher adjusted odds of being imaged outside the ED within 7 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.96–11.17, p < 0.001), 14 days (aOR 4.69, 95% CI 3.11–7.07, p < 0.001), and 28 days (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 2.25–4.27, p < 0.001) of being discharged and had a significantly higher adjusted odds of revisiting the study ED (aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29–2.12, p < 0.001).

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^117Q4pNN]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship is the effort to optimize diagnostic testing to reduce errors while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment. Abdominal pain and appendicitis in children are essential use cases. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis can be dangerous and even life-threatening, but overtesting is harmful.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5–17 years presenting with abdominal pain to 26 EDs within the Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative (MEDIC) from May 1, 2016, to February 29, 2024. We defined two outcome measures summarized by ED. First, we describe the cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio, defined as the count of ED visits resulting in any cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) divided by the count of ED visits with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Second, we describe the delayed diagnosis rate, defined by an ED visit for abdominal pain resulting in a discharge and subsequent return visit with a diagnosis of appendicitis within 7 days.

- **Results**: The sample included 120,112 pediatric visits for abdominal pain at 26 EDs. Of these, 4967 (4.1%) were diagnosed with appendicitis. The cross-sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio varied by site, from as low as 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1–0.2) at a pediatric site to as high as 7.9 (95% CI 4.8–16.4) at an urban ED. The proportion of pediatric ED visits for abdominal pain that resulted in an identified delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was 0.1% (141/120,112). All but four sites had fewer than 10 cases of delayed diagnosis across the study period.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116qjTKf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case and triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses. It directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features, and diagnostic testing. In complex cases, it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here, the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^114SRLF5]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Approximately 4–5% of patients evaluated at an emergency department (ED) present with acute abdominal pain. Some patients that require admission for surgical or medical treatment are easily recognized. Others may present during the early stages of surgical pathology and will be difficult to distinguish from patients with mild self-limiting disease. Judgment errors in evaluating these patients with an ambivalent presentation may lead to therapeutic delay, possibly increasing morbidity and even mortality. For this reason, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) are often used to aid in the diagnostic process and subsequent clinical decision-making. Cross-sectional imaging may not, however, be beneficial in the diagnosis of all patients seen in the ED for acute abdominal pain, as these examinations are costly, time-consuming, and, in the case of CT, subject the patient to ionizing radiation.

Another method often used to differentiate mild disease from more serious pathology in ambivalent cases is outpatient re-evaluation. Re-evaluation can allow the disease to present itself through natural progression, permitting surgical cases to become more typical and thus identifiable. In patients with nonspecific abdominal pain or mild nonsurgical diagnoses, the symptoms will regress, allowing the patient to be safely discharged from follow-up.

The present study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of standard outpatient re-evaluation in a large series of patients with acute abdominal pain seen in our ED but who were not admitted.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113voqZd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

A potential explanation for the observed increase in imaging is that ED clinicians utilize their expertise to sort patients into a continuum of risk of clinically significant, intervenable intra-abdominal diagnoses. They then respond to the increasing availability of CT over this period by lowering the testing threshold to include patients at a lower, but still clinically meaningful, risk of making such a diagnosis on CT. For example, in the case of renal colic, consensus recommendations from multiple specialty experts favor imaging as presentations become higher risk, as symptoms become less typical, and as the risk of diagnoses other than kidney stones becomes more likely. If this were the case for other high‐risk conditions, we would anticipate that the proportion of patients diagnosed with an EGS condition at the end of an ED visit during which a CT was performed (test positivity) would decline as the rate of imaging increased. Instead, we found that increases in test positivity occurred for every age group, suggesting increased EGS diagnosis in the population or improved funneling of patients experiencing symptoms of EGS to the ED.

This increased test positivity with CT scans also provides a partial explanation for the increasing proportion of abdominal pain ED visits diagnosed with EGS conditions overall: greater CT utilization means more EGS conditions are being found, resulting in fewer missed diagnoses. This may be particularly important for older adults, who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality for a given diagnosis. Especially in younger ages, however, the importance of accurate diagnosis cannot be underestimated.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112EpQGz]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, relying on the clinical diagnosis would have led to a high number of false positive urgent diagnoses, whereas the use of ultrasonography as the only imaging investigation would have resulted in an unacceptably high number of missed urgent conditions. In comparison, computed tomography (CT) after clinical evaluation had better accuracy. The use of CT conditional on a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result had the highest sensitivity for urgent conditions and would result in the lowest overall exposure to radiation. Use of imaging driven by patients' characteristics or location of pain would have led to a loss in accuracy compared with the conditional CT strategy.

- **Potential limitations**: We acknowledge several potential limitations of this analysis. The study design, with its full diagnostic investigation in all enrolled patients, carefully collected data, and diagnosis assigned after each step, allowed us to make the comparisons presented here without conducting a randomized clinical trial with 11 groups. Our approach allowed a comparison of imaging strategies but no direct evaluation of the effects of imaging on patients' management and outcome. In this study, management after completion of the diagnostic protocol was always based on the result of all diagnostic tests.

This study included a pre-imaging selection of patients, which should be kept in mind when attempting to generalize the results. Most patients were referred to the emergency department by general practitioners, and patients discharged from the emergency department without imaging were not included in the study.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the observers, either the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To ensure a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the following morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, ensuring all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist. In contrast, ultrasound examinations were performed by radiological residents alone after hours. To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1,000–5,000).

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^11118GHx]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

To identify an optimal imaging strategy for the accurate detection of urgent conditions in patients experiencing acute abdominal pain, a fully paired multicentre diagnostic accuracy study with prospective data collection was conducted in the emergency departments of two university hospitals and four large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants included 1021 patients with non-traumatic abdominal pain of over 2 hours' and less than 5 days' duration. Patients were excluded if they were discharged from the emergency department with no imaging deemed necessary by the treating physician, if they were pregnant, or if they were experiencing haemorrhagic shock.

All patients underwent plain radiographs (upright chest and supine abdominal), ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) following clinical and laboratory examination. A panel of experienced physicians assigned a final diagnosis after six months, categorizing the condition as urgent or non-urgent.

- **Main outcome measures**: Sensitivity and specificity for urgent conditions, percentage of missed cases and false positives, and exposure to radiation for single imaging strategies, conditional imaging strategies (CT following initial ultrasonography), and strategies driven by body mass index and age or by location of pain.

Results showed that 661 patients (65%) received a final diagnosis classified as urgent. The initial clinical diagnosis often led to many false-positive urgent diagnoses, which were significantly reduced following ultrasonography or CT. CT was more effective than ultrasonography in detecting urgent diagnoses, with a sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval 87% to 92%) for CT, compared to 70% (67% to 74%) for ultrasonography.
