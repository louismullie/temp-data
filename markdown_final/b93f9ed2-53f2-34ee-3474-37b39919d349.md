## Question

Does crohns flare require antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a Crohn's disease flare requires antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "flare" and how it differs from complications like abscess or fistula. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about antibiotics for luminal inflammatory flares. Next, I will review the evidence base, including Cochrane and meta-analyses, to quantify benefit. After that, I need to check for exceptions where antibiotics are indicated, such as perianal fistulizing disease, intra-abdominal abscess, and postoperative prophylaxis. Finally, I should confirm infection workup priorities, especially C. difficile, and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with clear recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a Crohn's flare typically reflects increased inflammatory activity with symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, but symptoms alone do not reliably track mucosal inflammation, so objective assessment is essential to distinguish a pure inflammatory flare from complications or infection that would change management, including the need for antibiotics [^3bc8b699] [^da6d6c41].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on antibiotics for luminal flares. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do any major societies endorse antibiotics as primary therapy for active luminal Crohn's disease? The ACG advises that antibiotics are not effective for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as primary therapy, and ECCO/BSG similarly recommend against antibiotics for induction or maintenance of luminal disease, while ESPEN concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend antibiotics for active CD, so routine antibiotic use for a standard flare is not supported [^6bd3c20c] [^5ff03b40] [^3f9c8047].

> I will now examine the evidence base. The Cochrane review of 13 RCTs found only modest, borderline benefits of antibiotics as a class for induction at 6–10 weeks and uncertain benefit for maintenance, with authors concluding that any benefit is likely modest and may not be clinically meaningful; a separate meta-analysis of 11 RCTs found no significant benefit for antibacterial therapy versus placebo for remission or response, reinforcing that routine antibiotics are not effective for luminal flares [^76cf660b] [^417cf149].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions where antibiotics are actually indicated? I need to check those carefully. For perianal fistulizing disease, guidelines suggest antibiotics can be considered as initial therapy to reduce drainage and symptoms, often alongside anti-TNF therapy, and ECCO advises against antibiotic monotherapy for complex perianal fistulas, emphasizing drainage and anti-TNF as cornerstone therapy; for intra-abdominal abscess, antibiotics plus drainage are recommended; and after ileal resection, nitroimidazoles can modestly reduce recurrence for 3–12 months, though anti-TNF or thiopurines are more effective for prophylaxis [^2ebbbd0d] [^6128c9a2] [^68a877c2] [^bb359521] [^9cbbaeaf] [^013911c2].

> Hold on, I should verify infection mimics that can trigger or worsen flares. Infections, especially C. difficile, are common and can mimic or precipitate flares; IBD patients have a roughly fivefold increased risk of C. difficile, so any suspected flare warrants testing and, if positive, targeted antibiotic therapy for C. difficile rather than empiric antibiotics for Crohn's itself; emergency and IBD guidelines also advise excluding other GI infections in acute presentations before escalating immunosuppression [^116e4e3d] [^8c0a97fc] [^a89dc823].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. For a typical luminal inflammatory Crohn's flare without abscess or fistula, antibiotics are not required and should not be used as primary therapy; management should focus on confirming active inflammation objectively, treating with corticosteroids for short-term induction when appropriate, and transitioning to steroid-sparing maintenance such as thiopurines, methotrexate, or biologics, with treat-to-target monitoring; antibiotics are reserved for specific complications or infections, not for the flare itself [^6bd3c20c] [^5fee3572] [^da6d6c41].

> Final answer: No, a standard Crohn's disease flare does not require antibiotics; antibiotics are not effective primary therapy for luminal inflammatory flares and should be avoided unless there is perianal fistulizing disease, intra-abdominal abscess, postoperative prophylaxis, or a documented infection such as C. difficile that warrants targeted antimicrobial therapy [^6bd3c20c] [^5ff03b40] [^3f9c8047] [^2ebbbd0d] [^68a877c2] [^116e4e3d].

Routine antibiotics are **not indicated** for uncomplicated Crohn's flares [^6bd3c20c] because they do not improve remission or mucosal healing [^76cf660b] and are not recommended by major guidelines for luminal disease [^510070f7] [^3f9c8047]. Antibiotics are only used when there is **active infection** (e.g. C. difficile) [^8c0a97fc] or **complications** such as abscess or fistula [^68a877c2] [^2ebbbd0d], where they are adjuncts to drainage or anti-TNF therapy [^625fcc5d] [^16e7c6b5]. For flares, prioritize corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologics [^c85de9ea] [^98f06874], and reserve antibiotics for confirmed infection or specific complications [^6bd3c20c].

## Evidence and guidelines on antibiotic use in Crohn's flares

- **Luminal disease**: Multiple high-quality guidelines (ACG, ECCO, BSG, ESPEN) advise against antibiotics for induction or maintenance in luminal Crohn's disease because benefits are modest, transient, and not disease-modifying [^6bd3c20c] [^510070f7] [^5ff03b40] [^3f9c8047].

- **Perianal fistulizing disease**: Antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin) may be used short term for symptom relief, but should be combined with anti-TNF therapy and drainage/setons for durable response [^2ebbbd0d] [^625fcc5d] [^16e7c6b5].

- **Abscesses**: Antibiotics plus drainage are indicated for intra-abdominal or perianal abscesses; hold immunosuppression until drainage is achieved [^68a877c2] [^bb359521].

- **Postoperative prophylaxis**: Nitroimidazoles (e.g. metronidazole) can reduce postoperative recurrence for 3–12 months, but anti-TNF or thiopurines are more effective for long-term prevention [^9cbbaeaf] [^013911c2].

---

## Risks and limitations of antibiotic use

- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal upset, neuropathy, and rare serious events occur with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin [^notfound].

- **Microbiome disruption**: Antibiotics can worsen dysbiosis and may increase future IBD risk, especially with repeated exposures [^58f83e39] [^5bdd85e1].

- **Resistance**: Repeated or prolonged use drives resistance, limiting future options [^690cd69a].

## Alternative therapies for Crohn's flares

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | Induction of remission in moderate-to-severe flares | Rapid anti-inflammatory effect; not for maintenance [^2aa22007] [^7335578d] |
| Immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-MP, methotrexate) | Maintenance after induction; steroid-sparing | Reduce relapse and steroid dependence [^7335578d] [^510070f7] |
| Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) | Moderate-to-severe or fistulizing disease | Induce and maintain remission; reduce complications [^c85de9ea] [^98f06874] |
| Integrin therapy (vedolizumab) | Moderate-to-severe disease | Alternative to anti-TNF; gut-selective [^510070f7] [^9e8e2f21] |
| IL-12/23 inhibition (ustekinumab) | Moderate-to-severe disease | Alternative mechanism; effective in anti-TNF failures [^510070f7] [^98f06874] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where antibiotics may be considered

- **Confirmed infection**: C. difficile or other enteric pathogens require targeted antibiotics [^8c0a97fc] [^a204ba24].

- **Perianal fistulas**: Short-term metronidazole or ciprofloxacin with anti-TNF and drainage [^2ebbbd0d] [^625fcc5d].

- **Abscesses**: Antibiotics plus drainage; hold immunosuppression until drained [^68a877c2] [^bb359521].

- **Postoperative prophylaxis**: Nitroimidazoles for 3–12 months after ileal resection [^9cbbaeaf] [^013911c2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine antibiotics are **not indicated** for uncomplicated Crohn's flares; they do not improve remission or mucosal healing and carry risks of adverse effects and resistance [^6bd3c20c] [^76cf660b]. Use antibiotics only for confirmed infection or specific complications (abscess, fistula, postoperative prophylaxis), and prioritize corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or biologics for flare management [^c85de9ea] [^98f06874].

### Crohn's disease [^3d8e2487]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract, has a progressive and destructive course and is increasing in incidence worldwide. Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn's disease, including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. The onset of the disease at a young age in most cases necessitates prompt but long-term treatment to prevent disease flares and disease progression with intestinal complications. Thus, earlier, more aggressive treatment with biologic therapies or novel small molecules could profoundly change the natural history of the disease and decrease complications and the need for hospitalization and surgery. Although less invasive biomarkers are in development, diagnosis still relies on endoscopy and histological assessment of biopsy specimens. Crohn's disease is a complex disease, and treatment should be personalized to address the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. In the future, disease management might rely on severity scores that incorporate prognostic factors, bowel damage assessment and non-invasive close monitoring of disease activity to reduce the severity of complications.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of flare of inflammatory bowel disease [^fc94cb99]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Intestinal microbial flora participate in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Because antibiotic therapy alters intestinal microbial flora, we hypothesized that use of antibiotics might decrease the risk of flare.

Methods

We conducted a case-crossover study by using the General Practice Research Database from 1989–1997. Flares of disease were identified by receipt of a new prescription for either corticosteroids or mesalamine medications after an interval of at least 4 months without prescriptions for either class of medication. The primary exposure was receipt of any antibiotics in the 60 days preceding the index date.

Results

Among 1205 patients with Crohn's disease, exposure to antibiotics was associated with a reduced risk of flare (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.96; P = 0.019). The effect was strongest with more recent exposure (test for trend, P < .05). Among 2230 patients with ulcerative colitis, use of any antibiotics within 60 days was not associated with flare of disease (adjusted OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82–1.12; P = 0.581), although a potentially protective effect was observed in those patients with very recent exposure (exposure within 15 days: OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.85).

Conclusions

Antibiotic use within 60 days was associated with a lower risk of flare of Crohn's disease, but not ulcerative colitis. The strength of the protective effect of antibiotics in Crohn's disease wanes over time.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by recurrent flares that can lead to progressive bowel damage. Conventional management involves treatment of acute flares with corticosteroids and, where required, addition of immunomodulators and advanced therapies to achieve sustained remission. However, the disease course and clinical outcomes for a newly diagnosed patient are highly uncertain. The frequency and severity of flares, likelihood of response to any particular treatment, and rate of progression to complications requiring surgery, including the intestinal strictures and fistulae that characterise Crohn's disease, are all unpredictable. The advent of biologic treatments, including anti-TNF therapy, has helped mitigate adverse outcomes but surgical resection is still required in 17–25% of patients within 5 years of diagnosis.

Ideally, a safe and affordable treatment strategy would be available that was effective in all patients from diagnosis. Thiopurines appear ineffective in this context and the efficacy of advanced therapies from diagnosis remains largely unstudied. Indeed, Crohn's disease trials usually enrol patients years after diagnosis and typically show benefit of active comparator over placebo of only 10–20%. However, one consistent observation based on both post-hoc clinical trial analyses and retrospective cohorts is that the earlier patients receive advanced treatments the more effective they are. Notably, D'Haens and colleaguesrandomised 133 patients within 4 years of Crohn's diagnosis to either infliximab induction followed by azathioprine or conventional step-up care. Remission at week 52 was significantly higher in patients receiving early combined immunosuppression. Similarly, the CALM and REACT trials, which enrolled patients with established Crohn's disease in flare, found that earlier escalation to anti-TNF therapy resulted in fewer major adverse outcomes than treatment with conventional step-up strategies.

Added value of this study

Patients with newly diagnosed active Crohn's disease were recruited to a biomarker-stratified interventional trial based on a pragmatic clinical trial design. The biomarker did not demonstrate clinical utility to guide the treatment strategy for patients living with Crohn's disease. However, top-down treatment with combination infliximab and immunomodulator was significantly better than accelerated step-up (conventional) treatment in maintaining steroid-free and surgery-free remission throughout 48 weeks of follow-up. Top-down treatment also showed greater efficacy in achieving endoscopic remission, improved quality of life, and reduced number of flares requiring treatment escalation. Top-down treatment was safer than accelerated step-up treatment, with fewer adverse and serious adverse events, no increased rate of infection, and reduced need for urgent abdominal surgery.

Implications of all the available evidence

Top-down treatment with combination infliximab and immunomodulator should be adopted as the standard of care for most patients with newly diagnosed active Crohn's disease.

### Corticosteroids in Crohn's disease [^2aa22007]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a lifelong illness characterized by chronic recurrent flares. The precise etiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, it appears to involve an enhanced systemic immune response and intensified local intestinal mucosal inflammatory activity, mediated through various inflammatory cells and an array of proinflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of Crohn's disease. The controlled trials of the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study and the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study established that corticosteroids were effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease for the duration of the studies (6–17 wk). However, corticosteroids have not been shown to have an impact on the maintenance of long term remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, they are associated with a high potential for dependence and serious toxic side effects. Alternative classes of medical therapy for Crohn's disease, including modified corticosteroids and a group of new biological therapies, have proven to be efficacious in the management of active and/or quiescent Crohn's disease.

### Antibiotics should be used as first-line therapy for Crohn's disease [^72db15ab]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The etiology of Crohn's disease remains uncertain, and to date no therapy is curative. Recent experimental evidence suggests that an altered immune response to commensal enteric flora in a genetically susceptible host plays a key role in both the development and perpetuation of the intestinal inflammation of Crohn's disease. Thus, incorporation of antibiotics into the therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease, either as first-line therapy or combined with immunomodulatory drugs, would seem to be a rational strategy. Indeed, most IBD clinicians would attest to the marked benefit of antibiotic therapy in individual patients. Skepticism surrounding this approach arises because evidenced-based analyses' show that the few clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of antibiotics for Crohn's disease have produced equivocal or negative results or have methodological deficiencies, including small number of patients and absence of a placebo group. However, by undertaking an analysis that integrates information from both basic and clinical spheres of study, the dichotomy between experimental and clinical observations tends to merge. This approach underscores certain key factors that determine an optimal response to antibiotics, emphasizes the requirement for assessment in well-defined subsets of patients, and leads to the conclusion that antibiotics do provide benefit for Crohn's disease.

### Do NSAIDs, antibiotics, infections, or stress trigger flares in IBD? [^ccd946c3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, enteric or other systemic infections, and stress have all been reported to be potential triggers of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although a mechanism of triggering a flare of IBD can be hypothesized for each factor, the associations of these factors with flares of IBD remains confusing. In this review, we analyze the literature that explores these associations. There is some evidence to support an association between NSAID use and flares but little data to associate antibiotic use directly with flares. An important connection between antibiotic use and an exacerbation of symptoms is through the development of Clostridium difficile infections. However, for all enteric infections, including C. difficile, it is unclear whether these infections simply trigger symptoms in patients with IBD that resolve on resolution of the infection, or whether they truly trigger a flare of intestinal inflammation that outlasts the infection. There is a paucity of evidence that other systemic infections trigger flares of IBD. Although there is strong evidence for an association between perceived stress levels and flares, there is a weaker association between a simple accounting of stressful life events and flares. Much of the literature is limited by a lack of adequate control groups and failure to report on base rates in the population under study (i.e. NSAIDs and antibiotic use, occurrence of infections, and stress levels). More large population-based matched cohort or case crossover studies and a continued emphasis on prospective designs are needed to better explore these potential associations. Clinical implications given the current state of knowledge are discussed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria Crohn disease [^f7350b3e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder involving the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by episodic flares and times of remission. Underlying structural damage occurs progressively, with recurrent bouts of inflammation. The diagnosis and management of this disease process is dependent on several clinical, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic, and histologic factors. In recent years, with the maturation of CT enterography, and MR enterography, imaging has played an increasingly important role in relation to Crohn Disease. In addition to these specialized examination modalities, ultrasound and routine CT have potential uses. Fluoroscopy, radiography, and nuclear medicine may be less beneficial depending on the clinical scenario. The imaging modality best suited to evaluating this disease may change, depending on the target population, severity of presentation, and specific clinical situation. This document presents seven clinical scenarios (variants) in both the adult and pediatric populations and rates the appropriateness of the available imaging options. They are summarized in a consolidated table, and the underlying rationale and supporting literature are presented in the accompanying narrative. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### A biomarker-stratified comparison of top-down versus accelerated step-up treatment strategies for patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (PROFILE): a multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial [^459144d0]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

11 urgent abdominal surgeries were required during the trial. One patient was in the top-down group and had gallstone ileus. Nine patients were in the accelerated step-up group, all requiring surgery for obstructive or penetrating complications of Crohn's disease; one patient required two operations (appendix 1 p 14). Six of the nine patients in the accelerated step-up group were classified as having Montreal B1 inflammatory disease at enrolment. The post-hoc odds ratio for needing abdominal surgery was 0·095 (95% CI 0·001–0·505). One patient in each group required surgery for perianal disease. Hospital admission data including surgeries are presented in appendix 1 (p 15).

The most frequent adverse event was a disease flare (table 3, appendix 1 pp 16–17). There were fewer adverse events or serious adverse events in the top-down group than in the accelerated step-up group (adverse events: 168 vs 315; serious adverse events: 15 vs 42). Further information on adverse events and serious adverse events is reported in table 3. Although not powered to show a difference in safety endpoints, there was no difference in risk of serious infection between treatment strategies and no reported malignancies or deaths during the trial (table 3).

Table 3
Adverse events

The time-to-event analyses considered events as a composite of disease flare, treatment escalation, or surgery. Time to both first and second event were longer for participants in the top-down group than in the accelerated step-up group, with no difference between biomarker subgroups (figure 4).

### Gastrointestinal bacterial infections precede disease activation and treatment intensification in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^7cc236d5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Based on our study, effective IBD medication does not significantly increase the risk of severe GI infections. However, it is important to rule out GI bacterial infections in case of an IBD flare, as they may influence the subsequent course of the disease, requiring an escalation in medication. Patients may benefit from careful follow-up for 6 months after GI infection.

### Post-traumatic stress in Crohn's disease and its association with disease activity [^1c03d1dc]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Measures of exacerbation of CD were flares, extraintestinal manifestations, complications and non-response to therapy. These were selected because they have a high clinical impact, force patients to seek gastroenterological healthcare and, in combination, allow for a complete evaluation of the disease course. They were combined to one binary outcome which is referred to as adverse events (present/absent), as previously described. In brief, flares were defined as an increase of 100 points or more from baseline on the CD activity index. Any need for an increase in medication was considered a treatment failure. Extraintestinal manifestations were included if they occurred during the observation period. Complications included strictures, fistulae, malignancies or any other need for surgery.

Clinical experience has shown that disease duration, strictures and fistulae requiring hospitalisations, need for medication (ie, 5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazin, steroids, immunosuppressors, antitumour necrosis factor α agents, antibiotics), low body mass index, baseline disease activity and smoking are predictive of the disease course. For this reason, we controlled not only for those factors but also for gender and age because these are the most important demographic parameters.

### Do not assume symptoms indicate failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease [^8e21c0be]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to monitor patients with Crohn's disease who remain symptomatic despite anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Clinicians must use a systematic approach for each patient and obtain objective evidence about disease activity and response to therapy. Alternate etiologies for symptoms should be sought and treated, if found. Active Crohn's disease despite therapy requires reassessment and adjustments to management plans.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles in any language published up to Sept 17, 2023, with the search terms "Crohn's disease", "early disease", "combined immunosuppression", "treatment algorithm", and "biomarker-stratified". This produced no results. Dropping the requirement for "biomarker-stratified" yielded abstracts for three high quality interventional clinical trials. The Step-Up/Top-Down trial recruited 133 immunosuppressant and anti-TNF-naive patients with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease within 4 years of diagnosis. Patients were randomised to early combined anti-TNF and immunosuppressant induction followed by intermittent anti-TNF treatment to control disease flares, or conventional step-up therapy. At week 52, 61% and 42%, respectively, were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission (p = 0·028), with no differences in serious adverse events between groups. The CALM trial randomised 244 adults with Crohn's disease (mean duration 1 year) and endoscopic activity to tight control (treatment escalation for elevated CRP or calprotectin as well as symptoms) versus conventional management (treatment escalation for symptomatic flares). More patients in the tight control group achieved the primary endpoint of mucosal healing at week 48 (46% vs 30%), with no difference in adverse events. Although REACT was framed as testing early combined immunosuppression with a TNF antagonist and antimetabolite, its participants had an average disease duration of over 12 years. The primary endpoint of steroid-free remission (using a symptom-based score alone without corroboration by objective evidence of inflammation) at 12 months, was similar between the 921 patients treated with early combined immunosuppression and the 806 treated conventionally (66% vs 62%; p = 0·52). However, the composite secondary outcome of serious adverse events (complications, hospitalisation, surgery) was lower at 24 months in the early combined immunosuppression group. Although previous trials support earlier use of anti-TNF therapy, typically in combination with an immunomodulator, an accelerated step-up approach to the management of Crohn's disease, where treatment is escalated in intensity until the tendency to relapse is controlled, remains the most common strategy in the UK and globally. Under this strategy, the course of Crohn's disease, including the frequency of disease flares, varies substantially between patients and is unpredictable. To better understand the basis of these heterogeneous outcomes and enable personalised therapy in IBD a blood-based biomarker derived from transcriptional signatures in T-cell subsets was developed and shown in observational datasets to be associated with need for future treatment escalation. Testing its utility, however, would require a biomarker-stratified randomised controlled trial.

Treatment

Disease flares were treated with mesalamine (3–4 g daily) or steroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day, or budesonide 9 mg per day, each progressively tapered after 4 weeks), according to their clinical severity. When steroid treatment failed or was contraindicated, patients seen before 1999 were given enteral or parenteral nutrition; those seen after June 1999 received Infliximab. Adalimumab was used as a second-line anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment after 2006. Metronidazole or ciprofloxacine were used in symptomatic perianal disease.

Patients with asymptomatic or moderately active forms of the disease were treated with aminosalicylates (1.6–3 g daily). Immunosuppressive drugs were used in patients that were steroid dependent or poorly responsive to steroids. Azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day) was preferentially used as the immunosuppressive drug, and increased to 2.5–3 mg/kg per day if needed. Intramuscular methotrexate (15–25 mg, weekly) was used in patients unresponsive or intolerant to azathioprine. In cases of controlled CD, methotrexate was tapered after 3–6 months to 10–15 mg, weekly. In cases of poor responses to classical immunosuppressants, anti-TNF therapies were used for maintenance.

Although the overall strategy remained mostly unchanged, there was a distinct tendency to initiate immunosuppressants earlier in the disease course. Surgery was performed for stenotic complications, extraparietal complications, or intractable forms of CD after well conducted medical management.

The maximum treatment received by one patient during each calendar year was codified prospectively at each visit/hospitalisation, according to a pre-established gradation (0–5 (table 1)). All treatment(s) were taken into account, even in cases of short duration.

2 When disease is diffuse or located in the left colon, prednisone is preferred; however, formulations of controlled ileal-release budesonide are an option for disease affecting the ileum and/or proximal colon and may be preferred because of their unique delivery specifically to that area. 2 Budesonide undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in improved tolerability. 26 Because corticosteroids do not maintain remission, adverse effects are common, and because perforating complications are higher in patients who take corticosteroids, they are most often used to treat symptom flare-ups while patients transition to more effective therapies. IMMUNOMODULATORS Thiopurines and methotrexate are the immunomodulators used in Crohn's disease. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are no more effective than placebo in inducing remission, and therefore, have limited use as monotherapy.

Anti-TNF agents, such as certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab, induce and maintain remission in moderate- to high-risk patients, or in patients with inadequate response to corticosteroids and immunomodulators. Onset of action and clinical benefit are often seen within two weeks of therapy initiation. The overall effectiveness of anti-TNF agents is greatest when given within two years of disease onset. 2 Anti-interleukin-12/23p40 antibody therapy is an emerging treatment option for patients when standard therapies have been ineffective. 2 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ustekinumab for Crohn's disease in September 2016. Although ustekinumab has been shown to be better than placebo for achieving remission and decreasing symptoms of Crohn's disease, no head-to-head studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ustekinumab over other therapies, and clinical experience is limited. 2, 33, 34.

Antimicrobial therapy in Crohn's disease — limited role for luminal disease with specific conditional uses: Although widely used in the past, the primary role of antibiotics for the treatment of luminal CD has not been supported by the evidence; metronidazole is not more effective than placebo at inducing remission in patients with CD, ciprofloxacin has not been shown to be more effective than placebo to induce remission in luminal CD, and neither has been shown to heal the mucosa in active luminal CD. For patients with moderately severe disease and evidence of systemic symptoms, including a febrile episode with systemic toxicity, antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones or metronidazole may be considered, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for ongoing complications such as intra-abdominal, mesenteric, or perianal abscesses. Anti-MAP therapy should not be used to treat active CD and has not been shown to be effective for induction of remission or mucosal healing, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy.

### Study of antibiotics in the treatment of colonic Crohn's disease… [^171ee67e]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Among such strategies is the use of a combination of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. These broad-spectrum antibiotics control CD symptoms by acting on the intestinal bacteria that can contribute to chronic inflammation. More investigation is needed to firmly establish the usefulness of this therapy because previous clinical trials have given mixed results, although they have suggested that antibiotics can be particularly useful in cases of Crohn's colitis. Because these earlier studies have lacked a large enough patient population with colonic involvement, a trial focusing on this CD subgroup with a sufficient number of subjects will help to clarify the value of combining metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that combination antibiotic therapy is effective in the treatment of CD involving the colon.

The study will compare the use of combination therapy consisting of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin with placebo and will examine the results of treatment at the end of 8 weeks of treatment. The role of bacteria and microbial agents in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease has been suggested and is supported by animal models of inflammatory bowel disease in which the presence of normal gut flora is required for the initiation and full expression of the inflammatory reaction. In human Crohn's disease, antibiotics are commonly used even though the evidence to support this practice is not strong. Several studies have indicated that antibiotics have some biological activity in Crohn's disease and that this activity may be most pronounced in the subset of patients with colonic involvement.

In order to better justify the use of antibiotics in the treatment of Crohn's disease, the Antibiotics for Colonic Crohn's Disease trial has been designed to determine if ciprofloxacin and metronidazole combination therapy is effective in the treatment of active Crohn's disease of the colon. This two arm, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study will involve 136 patients with mild to moderate active Crohn's disease of the colon, as defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score between 220 and 450. within 2 weeks of the screening visit, v) infliximab within 12 weeks of the screening visit, vi)an initiation of therapy with sulphasalazine or with any 5-ASA preparation within 4 weeks of the screening visit or a change in the dose within 2 weeks of the screening visit.

Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

### Higher disease activity of inflammatory bowel disease predisposes toinfection [^116e4e3d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two major subtypes are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Unclassified IBD (IBD-U) is a subtype that exhibits characteristics of both UC and CD. The prevalence of IBD has increased worldwide in the past few decades, especially in industrialized countries. Typical disease onset is in young adulthood; however, increasing incidence has also been observed in the elderly. A combination of hereditary predisposition, abnormal intestinal immunity, intestinal bacteria, and nutritional and environmental factors have all been estimated to influence the onset of IBD. IBD is characterized by relapses and remitting episodes with poorly characterized etiology and an unpredictable clinical course.

GI infections cause approximately 10% of disease flares in IBD patients. One common such infection is caused by Clostridioides difficile. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been noted to increase in incidence among IBD patients and complicate the course of underlying IBD. – CDI frequently leads to flare-ups of underlying IBD, causes treatment failure in IBD remission, increases the need for colectomy, and even raises mortality rates.– The risk of CDI among IBD patients is nearly five-fold compared to the general population, and its recurrence has been reported to be slightly higher than in non-IBD patients (30% vs 24%). Patients with UC have reportedly been more susceptible to CDI than CD patients.

IBD appears to be an independent risk factor for CDI, even without antibiotics exposure or hospitalization. Other IBD-related risk factors, such as pre-existing colonic inflammation and the use of immunosuppressants and biologicals, have been evaluated to predispose to CDI. –

IBD patients with CDI pose a clinical challenge in getting correctly diagnosed due to presenting with symptoms similar to an IBD flare and CDI. These two conditions require distinctly different treatment approaches. For an IBD flare, treatment often involves escalating immunosuppression. However, in cases of active CDI, treatment focuses on reducing immunosuppression and administering antibiotics.

This study sought to characterize the risk factors for CDI in IBD patients in the era of the common use of biological and immunosuppressive medication and the effect of CDI on the course of IBD in a large case–control setting. We also examined whether active IBD predisposed individuals to CDI.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects up to 480,000 persons in the United States. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, malaise, and arthralgias, and cause considerable morbidity. Speculation about genetic, environmental, dietary, infectious, and immunologic etiologies has led to treatment modalities directed at each theoretic cause, but therapy guidelines are determined by the severity of disease. Use of salicylates and/or antibiotics can be effective in mild to moderate disease, while steroids are the accepted therapy for more severe active disease. Azathioprine and other immunosuppresant drugs can be used as adjunctive therapy for active Crohn's disease and may help to maintain remission. Infliximab, an antibody to human tumor necrosis factor alpha, has proved successful in the treatment of severe refractory disease and generally causes only mild side effects. Therapy for Crohn's disease must involve treating comorbid conditions to improve the quality of life of patients.

### Antibiotics for induction and maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^76cf660b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Several antibiotics have been evaluated in Crohn's disease (CD), however randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have produced conflicting results.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for induction and maintenance of remission in CD.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register and Clinicaltrials.gov database from inception to 28 February 2018. We also searched reference lists and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing antibiotics to placebo or an active comparator in adult (> 15 years) CD patients were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened search results and extracted data. Bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were failure to achieve clinical remission and relapse. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic relapse, histologic response, histologic remission, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawal due to AEs and quality of life. Remission is commonly defined as a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150. Clinical response is commonly defined as a decrease in CDAI from baseline of 70 or 100 points. Relapse is defined as a CDAI > 150. For studies that enrolled participants with fistulizing CD, response was defined as a 50% reduction in draining fistulas. Remission was defined as complete closure of fistulas. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI for continuous outcomes. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Thirteen RCTs (N = 1303 participants) were eligible. Two trials were rated as high risk of bias (no blinding). Seven trials were rated as unclear risk of bias and four trials were rated as low risk of bias. Comparisons included ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus placebo, rifaximin (800 to 2400 mg daily) versus placebo, metronidazole (400 mg to 500 mg twice daily) versus placebo, clarithromycin (1 g/day) versus placebo, cotrimoxazole (960 mg twice daily) versus placebo, ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and metronidazole (250 mg four time daily) versus methylprednisolone (0.7 to 1 mg/kg daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg daily), metronidazole (500 mg daily) and budesonide (9 mg daily) versus placebo with budesonide (9 mg daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus mesalazine (2 g twice daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) with adalimumab versus placebo with adalimumab, ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) with infliximab versus placebo with infliximab, clarithromycin (750 mg daily) and antimycobacterial versus placebo, and metronidazole (400 mg twice daily) and cotrimoxazole (960 mg twice daily) versus placebo. We pooled all antibiotics as a class versus placebo and antibiotics with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) versus placebo with anti-TNF. The effect of individual antibiotics on CD was generally uncertain due to imprecision. When we pooled antibiotics as a class, 55% (289/524) of antibiotic participants failed to achieve remission at 6 to 10 weeks compared with 64% (149/231) of placebo participants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98; 7 studies; high certainty evidence). At 10 to 14 weeks, 41% (174/428) of antibiotic participants failed to achieve a clinical response compared to 49% (93/189) of placebo participants (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.93; 5 studies; moderate certainty evidence). The effect of antibiotics on relapse in uncertain. Forty-five per cent (37/83) of antibiotic participants relapsed at 52 weeks compared to 57% (41/72) of placebo participants (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.47; 2 studies; low certainty evidence). Relapse of endoscopic remission was not reported in the included studies. Antibiotics do not appear to increase the risk of AEs. Thirty-eight per cent (214/568) of antibiotic participants had at least one adverse event compared to 45% (128/284) of placebo participants (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; 9 studies; high certainty evidence). The effect of antibiotics on serious AEs and withdrawal due to AEs was uncertain. Two per cent (6/377) of antibiotic participants had at least one adverse event compared to 0.7% (1/143) of placebo participants (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.29 to 10.01; 3 studies; low certainty evidence). Nine per cent (53/569) of antibiotic participants withdrew due to AEs compared to 12% (36/289) of placebo participants (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.29; 9 studies; low certainty evidence) is uncertain. Common adverse events in the studies included gastrointestinal upset, upper respiratory tract infection, abscess formation and headache, change in taste and paraesthesiaWhen we pooled antibiotics used with anti-TNF, 21% (10/48) of patients on combination therapy failed to achieve a clinical response(50% closure of fistulas) or remission (closure of fistulas) at week 12 compared with 36% (19/52) of placebo and anti-TNF participants (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.10; 2 studies; low certainty evidence). These studies did not assess the effect of antibiotics and anti-TNF on clinical or endoscopic relapse. Seventy-seven per cent (37/48) of antibiotics and anti-TNF participants had an AE compared to 83% (43/52) of anti-TNF and placebo participants (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 2 studies, moderate certainty evidence). The effect of antibiotics and anti-TNF on withdrawal due to AEs is uncertain. Six per cent (3/48) of antibiotics and anti-TNF participants withdrew due to an AE compared to 8% (4/52) of anti-TNF and placebo participants (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.45; 2 studies, low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infections, change in taste, fatigue and headache AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to high quality evidence suggests that any benefit provided by antibiotics in active CD is likely to be modest and may not be clinically meaningful. High quality evidence suggests that there is no increased risk of adverse events with antibiotics compared to placebo. The effect of antibiotics on the risk of serious adverse events is uncertain. The effect of antibiotics on maintenance of remission in CD is uncertain. Thus, no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for maintenance of remission in CD can be drawn. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of antibiotics as therapy in CD.

### Managing complicated Crohn's disease in children and adolescents [^393580c8]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by recurrent exacerbations. A small, but significant, number of pediatric patients with Crohn's disease are resistant to standard medical therapies. The goal of therapy in pediatric patients is not only to achieve and maintain clinical remission, but also to promote growth, development and improve quality of life. All of this needs to be achieved within a relatively short window of opportunity, before growth and development deficiencies become permanent. The standard therapy for pediatric patients with Crohn's disease consists of 5-aminosalicylic-acid compounds, antibiotics and enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition has an excellent adverse-effect profile and, in addition to its therapeutic effect, positively impacts growth and nutritional status. Immunomodulating medications, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, are frequently used to maintain remission, and to treat corticosteroid-dependent and perianal disease. Recently, biologic treatment with the anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibody infliximab has dramatically changed the therapeutic approach. The long-term safety of this therapy still needs to be established. Limited data are available on other biologic therapies, which, at this point in time, are considered experimental and are only available through clinical trials.

### Engineered E. coli nissle 1917 for the delivery of matrix-tethered therapeutic domains to the gut [^c2922ec2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes a group of autoimmune diseases that cause chronic inflammation of the small and large intestine. This group of diseases affects about 3 million adults in the U.S. A complete picture of IBD etiology remains a subject of intense research and debate, and the development of the disease has been linked to multiple factors, including dysregulated immune responses, genetic predisposition, and an altered balance of microbiota (i.e. dysbiosis). However, the complex interplay between these factors has greatly hindered the development of effective therapies. Conventional IBD treatment relies on pharmacological interventions that scale with the severity of the disease, starting with aminosalicylates and antibiotics, and proceeding to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, with the goal of dampening inflammation by influencing host biology or by decreasing the chance of bacterial infection of mucosal wounds. The consequences of disease flare-ups can be severe and mount over time, leading to 23–45% of ulcerative colitis patients and 75% of Crohn's disease patients requiring surgical removal of portions of their gastrointestinal (GI) tract at some point in their lives. Therefore, the ability to induce deep remission and sustain it indefinitely is the long-term goal of IBD treatments.

### Withdrawal of immunosuppressant or biologic therapy for patients with quiescent Crohn's disease [^fe88d6e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract that can cause significant morbidity and disability. Current treatment guidelines recommend early intervention with immunosuppressant or biological therapy in high-risk patients with a severe disease phenotype at presentation. The feasibility of therapeutic de-escalation once remission is achieved is a commonly encountered question in clinical practice, driven by patient and clinician concerns regarding safety, adverse events, cost and national regulations. Withdrawal of immunosuppressant and biologic drugs in patients with quiescent CD may limit adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Alternatively, stopping these drug therapies may result in negative outcomes such as disease relapse, drug desensitization, bowel damage and need for surgery.

Objectives

To assess the feasibility and safety of discontinuing immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination, in patients with quiescent CD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 19 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of potentially relevant manuscripts and conference proceedings to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies that followed patients for a minimum duration of six months after drug discontinuation were considered for inclusion. The patient population of interest was adults (> 18 years) with CD (as defined by conventional clinical, endoscopic or histologic criteria) who had achieved remission while receiving immunosuppressant or biologic drugs administered alone or in combination. Patients then discontinued the drug regimen following a period of maintenance therapy of at least six months. The comparison was usual care (i.e. continuation of the drug regimen).

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who relapsed following discontinuation of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination. Secondary outcomes included: the proportion of patients who responded to the reintroduction of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, given as monotherapy or combination therapy; the proportion of patients who required surgery following relapse; the proportion of patients who required hospitalization for CD following relapse; the proportion of patients who developed new CD-related complications (e.g. fistula, abscesses, strictures) following relapse; the proportion of patients with elevated biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, fecal calprotectin) in those who stop and those who continue therapy; the proportion of patients with anti-drug antibodies and low serum trough drug levels; time to relapse; and the proportion of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis where patients with missing outcome data were assumed to have relapsed. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

A total of six RCTs (326 patients) evaluating therapeutic discontinuation in patients with quiescent CD were eligible for inclusion. In four RCTs azathioprine monotherapy was discontinued, and in two RCTs azathioprine was discontinued from a combination therapy regimen consisting of azathioprine with infliximab. No studies of biologic monotherapy withdrawal were eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies received unclear or low risk of bias ratings, with the exception of three open-label RCTs, which were rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Four RCTs (215 participants) compared discontinuation to continuation of azathioprine monotherapy, while two studies (125 participants) compared discontinuation of azathioprine from a combination regimen to continuation of combination therapy. Continuation of azathioprine monotherapy was shown to be superior to withdrawal for risk of clinical relapse. Thirty-two per cent (36/111) of azathioprine withdrawal participants relapsed compared to 14% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine therapy (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low quality evidence). However, it is uncertain if there are any between-group differences in new CD-related complications (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08, GRADE low quality evidence), adverse events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, GRADE low quality evidence), serious adverse events (RR 3.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 30.80, GRADE low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 19.04, GRADE low quality evidence). Common adverse events included infections, mild leukopenia, abdominal symptoms, arthralgias, headache and elevated liver enzymes. No differences between azathioprine withdrawal from combination therapy versus continuation of combination therapy were observed for clinical relapse. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52, P = 0.32; GRADE low quality evidence). The effects on adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.81, GRADE low quality of evidence) or serious adverse events are uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; GRADE very low quality of evidence). Common adverse events in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, arthralgias and infusion reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with quiescent Crohn's disease are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal for avoiding clinical relapse, while very low quality evidence suggests that there may be no difference in clinical relapse rates between discontinuing azathioprine from a combination therapy regimen, compared to continuing combination therapy. It is unclear whether withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of CD-related complications, adverse events, serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Further high-quality research is needed in this area, particularly double-blind RCTs in which biologic therapy or an immunosuppressant other than azathioprine is withdrawn.

Crohn's disease (CD) — medical management includes that mucosal healing as determined by endoscopy is a goal of therapy, and scoring systems are available to measure the endoscopic disease activity and may be used to monitor response to therapy. No maintenance treatment is a treatment option for some patients with asymptomatic (silent), mild CD; however, routine monitoring is recommended to identify disease progression. Sulfasalazine should only be considered for patients with symptomatic mild colonic CD, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy. For adult patients with mild CD and low risk of progression, diet-based strategies along with careful monitoring for inadequate symptom relief, worsening inflammation, or disease progression may be considered. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD and as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^98f06874]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) — biologic therapies and severe disease management detail that biosimilar infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are effective treatments for patients with moderate-to-severe CD and can be used for de novo induction and maintenance therapy, and there are data to support the safety and efficacy of transitioning or switching to biosimilar infliximab or adalimumab for patients with CD in stable disease maintenance. Biologic therapy (including anti-interleukin-12/23 therapy, anti-TNF therapy, and anti-integrin therapy) dose optimization may be considered for patients with inadequate or loss of response to that specific biologic agent's induction and maintenance. For hospitalized patients presenting with severe to fulminant CD, intravenous corticosteroids may be used to control inflammatory burden while evaluating steroid-sparing treatment options. Anti-TNF agents are effective for severely active CD and infliximab may be administered in the inpatient setting for patients with severe to fulminant disease. Antibiotics (imidazoles) can be considered for patients with simple perianal fistulas as a primary therapy, and drainage of perianal abscesses with appropriate placement of setons to facilitate drainage should be undertaken before treating perianal fistulizing disease with advanced therapy to increase treatment effectiveness.

### Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel disease [^90737a97]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile colitis has doubled in North America over the past 5 years and recent reports have demonstrated an increase in incidence and severity of these infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Studies from single institutions as well as trends identified in nationwide inpatient databases have shown that IBD patients with concomitant C. difficile infection experience increased morbidity and mortality. Results from our center have shown that over half of C. difficile-infected IBD patients will require hospitalization and the colectomy rate may approach 20%. Because C. difficile colitis will both mimic and precipitate an IBD flare, it is essential that clinicians be vigilant to identify and address this infectious complication, as empiric treatment with corticosteroids without appropriate antibiotics may precipitate deterioration. The majority of IBD patients appear to contract C. difficile as outpatients, and a prior history of colitis appears to be the most significant risk factor for acquiring this infection. In addition to C. difficile colitis, IBD patients are now known to be at risk for C. difficile enteritis as well as infections in reconstructed ileoanal pouches. An additional challenge facing C. difficile infections in IBD patients is the decreased efficacy of metronidazole, and the need for oral vancomycin in patients requiring hospitalization. In this review we summarize the present knowledge regarding C. difficile infection in the setting of IBD, including unique clinical scenarios facing IBD patients, diagnostic algorithms, and treatment approaches.

### Update in medical treatment of Crohn's disease [^8b661c7a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disorder that has no known cause. The goal of medical treatment is to control active disease, induce and maintain clinical remission, and treat complications. Anti-inflammatory medications and immunomodulatory therapies are the primary treatment modalities for Crohn's disease. The categories of standard treatment include the 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and immunomodulators. New biologic therapy has been developed to better target the immune mediators that are active in Crohn's disease. Infliximab is the first of the biologic agents approved for the treatment of fistulizing and active Crohn's disease. Despite medical advances in treatment, there is still no cure for Crohn's disease.

### Moderate to severe disease… [^b28a53bf]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Mild to Moderate Disease Mild to moderate Crohn's disease can be treated with a salicylate preparation, and in patients who are unresponsive, an antibiotic may help. 5 Response to therapy should be evaluated after several weeks; patients who do not respond should be treated for moderate to severe disease or with alternative therapy. In the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, antibiotic therapy may be an acceptable alternative. Metronidazole in a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per kg per day has demonstrated benefit in the treatment of ileocolitis and colitis, with most patients reporting clinical improvement and more than one half achieving remission. A variety of other immunomodulatory agents have been studied in active, refractory Crohn's disease, including cyclosporine, methotrexate, and tacrolimus.

Parenteral methotrexate in a dosage of 25 mg per week has shown effectiveness in steroid-dependent patients, allowing for steroid tapering. 23, 24 Guidelines for using tacrolimus and cyclosporine have yet to be determined. 23, 25 Recently, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved infliximab, an antibody to human tumor necrosis factor alpha, to treat Crohn's disease. In persons unresponsive to salicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants, infliximab has proved successful in closure of fistulas, steroid-refractory disease, and in the improvement of moderate to severe disease. A study. Infliximab appears to be useful in maintaining remission, but retreatment is likely to be necessary on an ongoing basis. 27, 28 Clinical improvement is accompanied by endoscopic and histologic improvements, which have not been demonstrated in many other therapies for Crohn's disease.

29, 30 While antibody development and theoretic long-term sequelae are of concern, side effects such as serum sickness reactions are generally mild. Severe Disease Patients with severe Crohn's disease often require hospitalization. Indications for hospitalization include persistent symptoms despite use of steroids or infliximab, or if patients have fever, vomiting, intestinal obstruction, acute abdomen, cachexia, or evidence of abscess. In such cases, parenteral steroids should be administered.

### Clinical profiles of moderate and severe Crohn's disease patients and use of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents: Greek expert consensus guidelines [^29e5c346]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of relapse under optimal therapy with immunosuppressives

The appropriate choice of treatment of a particular flare of CD is influenced by previous response to this treatment. This is especially true when patients relapse on optimal therapy to which patients strictly adhere. The panelists strongly endorsed the concept that biological agents should be initiated when there is relapse of CD in patients who adhere to optimal therapy with conventional immunosuppressives (100% agreement). The expert panel recommended that patients who have a severe relapse of CD within 6 months after a course of steroids should be considered for biologic therapy, because early administration of anti-TNF-α therapy is more effective than AZA monotherapy. However, it was also recommended that if a patient experiences a relapse of moderate severity, after long-term remission on immunosuppressives, restarting steroids may be appropriate; the response should be further assessed and, if the patient relapses again, initiation of biologic therapy should be considered (Clinical statement 3).

Clinical statement 3
Indications for early administration of biological therapy in newly diagnosed patients with moderate Crohn's disease

For patients either refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines, available options are to switch to MTX or biologic therapy. The panel reached consensus (100% agreement) regarding the initiation of biologic agents in patients who fail to respond to or are intolerant of or have contraindications to thiopurines. In this case, biological agents may be considered as a treatment option and MTX may be an alternative. Adding MTX to the biologic agent was also recommended to minimize immunogenicity.

The panel agreed that ECCO's working definition of severe CD as indicated by a CDAI score higher than 450 and persistent symptoms despite treatment with steroids is valid although again it is difficult to apply CDAI in routine clinical practice.

There was general agreement among panelists that the main difference between patients with newly diagnosed moderate or severe CD is that the later have more pronounced symptoms and require immediate hospitalization and more aggressive treatment whereas the former can be treated as outpatients. The panelists also agreed that outpatients recently diagnosed with moderate CD who have symptoms refractory to treatment with adequate doses of oral steroids should also be treated as patients with severe CD (Clinical statement 4).

### Maintenance drugs for inflammatory bowel disease [^26f3e6b5]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the bowel that affect 2–4 per 1,000 people in Northern Europe. The course of these diseases is difficult to predict and relapses can occur many years after presentation. Various drugs (and/or surgery in Crohn's disease) are used to induce remission, and maintenance drug therapy is commonly given to prevent relapse once remission is achieved. Here, we consider maintenance drug treatment, in particular the size and duration of benefit and potential short-term and long-term risks associated with such therapy.

### Antibiotics for inflammatory bowel disease: do they work? [^63a12471]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

A growing amount of evidence indicates that the intestinal flora plays a pathogenic role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): hence, the use of anti-bacterial agents as ancillary treatment in patients with ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease. While the results with anti-tubercular agents remain inconclusive, antibiotic treatment in IBD is usually carried out with either metronidazole or ciprofloxacin, or both. Controlled trials are scarce and, although both antibiotics appear to provide clinical benefit, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn and precise therapeutic guidelines cannot be suggested. The best results are achieved in the long-term treatment of Crohn's disease and in the management of pouchitis, or of perianal Crohn's disease. Long-term tolerability of antibiotic treatment may be poor due to the appearance of systemic side-effects. The use of non-absorbable anti-bacterial agents such as rifaximin deserves further investigation.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^da6d6c41]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — general management principles and objective assessment — are based on disease location, severity, disease-associated complications including extraintestinal manifestations, and factors affecting future prognosis, and the goal is to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission without significant adverse effects; objective evaluation by endoscopic, sonographic, or cross-sectional imaging is recommended, with improvement evident within 4–12 weeks and maximal treatment effect by 12–16 weeks, after which patients achieving response or remission are transitioned to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy; for continued active symptoms despite optimized therapy, evaluation with an objective study is recommended, and if symptoms or inflammation persist, assessment for medication optimization, addition of other agents, or transition to a different medical or surgical strategy is warranted; biomarkers such as CRP and FC can be assessed but should not exclusively serve as a treatment endpoint, and mimickers such as C. difficile, cytomegalovirus infection, and medication-related adverse effects should be excluded, noting that risks of C. difficile infection may be up to 5-fold higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Postoperative Crohn's disease — normal C-reactive protein (CRP) test performance in asymptomatic patients is summarized with misclassification counts per 1000 tested across pretest probabilities: false negatives (FN) were 70 (60 to 79) at low pretest probability (10%), 210 (180 to 237) at intermediate (30%), and 420 (360 to 474) at high (60%); false positives (FP) were 90 (54 to 144), 70 (42 to 112), and 40 (24 to 64), respectively. The table notes that FNs would be falsely reassured with potential risk of complications and flare, whereas FPs may undergo unnecessary endoscopy or treatment adjustment with avoidable anxiety and resource use. GRADE certainty of evidence is reported as VERY LOW for FNs, and for FPs as VERY LOW in the low-pretest column and LOW in the intermediate and high columns.

### Advances in the treatment of Crohn's disease [^7a3618dd]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The medical therapy of Crohn's disease has improved considerably in recent years. In large part, this is due to the introduction of new efficacious agents, both "biologics" and traditional small molecules. Further study of older drugs has also advanced our ability to devise the optimum approach to individual Crohn's disease patients by better clarifying the benefits, adverse effects, and means to optimize doses of established medications. In this review, we present an evidence-based approach to the medical management of active Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease in remission, and perianal Crohn's disease that emphasizes recent advances that have come from the results of randomized controlled clinical trials.

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for the management of luminal Crohn's disease [^510070f7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong illness with substantial morbidity, although new therapies and treatment paradigms have been developed. We provide guidance for treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active luminal CD.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to identify published studies of the management of CD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The consensus includes 41 statements focused on 6 main drug classes: antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and other therapies. The group suggested against the use of antibiotics or 5-aminosalicylate as induction or maintenance therapies. Corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide) can be used as induction, but not maintenance therapies. Among immunosuppressants, thiopurines should not be used for induction, but can be used for maintenance therapy for selected low-risk patients. Parenteral methotrexate was proposed for induction and maintenance therapy in patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD. Biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were recommended for patients failed by conventional induction therapies and as maintenance therapy. The consensus group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressant therapies in initiation of treatment with a biologic agent.

Conclusions

Optimal management of CD requires careful patient assessment, acknowledgement of patient preferences, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### Integrated multi-omics of feces, plasma and urine can describe and differentiate pediatric active Crohn's disease from remission [^3e5da60b]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and growth failure due to inflammation that can be present in the entire gastrointestinal tract. CD can have a large impact on quality of life and development of affected children. The etiology of CD is complex, and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle, but also patients' genetics and the gut microbiome play a role –.

The disease often manifests in "flares" of inflammation, also called active disease, in which intensified inflammation and symptom exacerbation can be seen, which requires careful management to restore control of the disease. Flares can be alternated with periods in which the disease is more or less in remission without observable endoscopic inflammation. Determining whether a patient is in remission is a challenge because the different parameters to determine remission do not always correlate. This is especially difficult in a, by definition, vulnerable pediatric population in which monitoring should be limited.

Recommendations HIGH-LEVEL EVIDENCE Moderate to Severe Disease. In persons with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who are naïve to immunomodulators or infliximab, treatment with these medications combined is more effective than monotherapy. Patients in whom corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti– tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been ineffective, as well as those who have not taken anti-TNF inhibitors previously, should receive ustekinumab. For those in whom symptom remission is desired, treatment with natalizumab alone or vedolizumab with or without an immunomodulator should be considered. Moderate to Severe Disease. Short-term oral corticosteroids can be prescribed to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease, with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine considered to support remission.

Cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and tacrolimus should be avoided because they are not effective. For disease not amenable to corticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate, anti-TNF agents are recommended. Natalizumab should only be continued to maintain remission if results of serum antibody to John Cunningham virus testing are negative, with testing performed every six months and treatment halted upon a positive result. Mild to Moderate Disease. Treatment with antimycobacterials should not be used as the main treatment for any patient with mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Metronidazole should not be used as the main treatment regimen, and ciprofloxacin is not recommended for luminal inflammatory disease.

Sulfasalazine can be used in persons with colonic mild to moderate Crohn's disease, and controlled ileal-release budesonide can be used in persons with mild to moderate ileocecal disease. If patients are unlikely to have the condition advance, management options include antidiarrheal or other non-specific medications, and changes in diet in conjunction with careful monitoring.

### Predominantly antibiotic-resistant intestinal microbiome persists in patients with pouchitis who respond to antibiotic therapy [^690cd69a]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Pouchitis that develops in patients with ulcerative colitis after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis is usually treated with antibiotics. Some patients have recurrence of flares, or become antibiotic-dependent, and require repeated courses or prolonged periods of antibiotic therapy. We investigated microbial factors associated with response to antibiotic treatment and development of antibiotic dependence in patients with pouchitis.

Methods

We performed a prospective study of 49 patients who had undergone pouch surgery at a tertiary center. Disease activity was determined based on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. Pouch phenotype was defined as recurrent-acute pouchitis (n = 6), chronic pouchitis and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (n = 27), normal pouch from patient with ulcerative colitis (n = 10), and normal pouch from patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 6). Fecal samples (n = 234) were collected over time during or in the absence of antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole). Thirty-three patients were treated with antibiotics, for a median of 425 days of cumulative antibiotic therapy, during follow-up. Calprotectin was measured and fecal DNA was sequenced using shotgun metagenomics and analyzed with specifically designed bioinformatic pipelines. Bacterial strains were isolated from fecal samples. We assessed their ciprofloxacin resistance and ability to induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells.

Results

Most antibiotic-treated patients (79%) had a clinical response to each course of antibiotics; however, 89% of those who completed a 4-week course relapsed within 3 months. Median calprotectin levels decreased by 40% in response to antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment reduced disease-associated bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but also beneficial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The microbiomes of antibiotic-responsive patients were dominated by facultative anaerobic genera (Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus), with multiple ciprofloxacin-resistance mutations in drug target genes and confirmed drug resistance. However, these strains had lower potential for virulence and did not induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells. After antibiotic cessation, patients had an abrupt shift in microbiome composition, with blooms of oral and disease-associated bacteria. In addition, antibiotic treatment enriched for strains that acquired multidrug resistance loci, encoding enzymes that confer resistance to nonrelated antibiotics, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

Conclusions

The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of pouchitis might be attributed to the establishment of an antibiotic-resistant microbiome with low inflammatory potential. This microbiome might provide resistance against colonization by bacteria that promote inflammation. To avoid progression to antibiotic-dependent disease and its consequences, strategies such as short-term alternating antibiotics and nutrition- and microbiome-based interventions should be considered.

### Difficult-to-treat inflammatory bowel disease: results from an international consensus meeting [^dfa44302]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have persistent symptoms and disease activity despite the best available medical or surgical treatments. These patients are commonly referred to as having difficult-to-treat IBD and need additional therapeutic strategies. However, the absence of standard definitions has impeded clinical research efforts and comparisons of data. Under the guidance of the endpoints cluster of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, we held a consensus meeting to propose a common operative definition for difficult-to-treat IBD. 16 participants from 12 countries voted on 20 statements covering various elements of difficult-to-treat IBD, such as failure of medical and surgical treatments, disease phenotypes, and specific complaints from patients. "Agreement" was defined as at least 75% consensus. The group agreed that difficult-to-treat IBD is defined by the failure of biologics and advanced small molecules with at least two different mechanisms of action, or postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease after two surgical resections in adults, or one in children. In addition, chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis, complex perianal disease, and comorbid psychosocial complications that impair disease management also qualified as difficult-to-treat IBD. Adoption of these criteria could serve to standardise reporting, guide enrolment in clinical trials, and help identify candidates for enhanced treatment strategies.

### Antibiotics in IBD: still a role in the biological era? [^58f83e39]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Despite compelling evidence pointing to a critical role of gut microflora in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis, the role of antibiotics in clinical practice remains limited, largely due to heterogeneous trials with often conflicting evidence. In this review, we revisit previous randomized controlled trials and high-quality uncontrolled studies in an effort to better elucidate the role of antibiotics in contemporary treatment algorithms. The most established role of antibiotics is in perianal Crohn's disease (CD), utilizing ciprofloxacin with or without metronidazole often as an adjunct to biological therapy. Evidence also points to a likely modest role of various antibiotic classes in mild to moderate luminal CD, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, azithromycin, and rifaximin. The benefit of metronidazole in preventing postoperative recurrence in CD is well reported; however, the long-term benefit of this intervention remains uncertain. The use of antibiotics in ulcerative colitis (UC) is even more controversial, but studies using broad-spectrum oral antibiotic cocktails have reported a possible role in acute severe colitis and chronic persistent UC. Similarly, the role of oral vancomycin and gentamicin in very early-onset IBD has interesting preliminary results. Adverse events of antibiotics, the resulting alterations in the microbiome with its associated unknown long-term sequela, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains must be carefully balanced. Therefore, although antibiotics may be underused in the treatment of IBD, their integration into clinical practice must be approached judiciously and individually.

4.4 Maintenance treatment in ileocolonic Crohn's disease

Statement 38. We recommend that systemic or locally acting corticosteroids should be avoided as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease due to toxicity and lack of efficacy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Irrespective of whether remission is induced surgically or medically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease compared with placebo (see Section 5.2.8.1: Overuse of corticosteroids). Systematic reviews and pooled trial data show that budesonide does not reduce relapse rates over a 12-month period. One systematic review did show a modest reduction in CDAI scores, but this was outweighed by a significant increase in adverse events and adrenocortical suppression compared with the placebo groups.

4.4.1 Immunomodulator therapy

Statement 39. We recommend that for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease responding to prednisolone, early introduction of maintenance therapy with thiopurines (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or methotrexate (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) should be considered to minimise risk of flare as prednisolone is withdrawn (Agreement: 93.3%).

Relapse of Crohn's disease is common on corticosteroid withdrawal, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and early initiation of corticosteroid-sparing therapy is appropriate. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate are effective in the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease.

4.4.1.1 Thiopurine therapy

Statement 40. We recommend that azathioprine or mercaptopurine can be used as monotherapy in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Thiopurines should not be used for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Thiopurines are more effective than placebo in maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease but the Cochrane analysis reports low quality evidence (NNT = 9). A systematic review and network meta-analysis also showed the benefit of azathioprine/mercaptopurine compared with placebo in remission maintenance (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.6)), although anti-TNF therapy was significantly more effective than thiopurines.

### Crohn's disease and gynecologic manifestations in young women [^7e61fbf1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the reproductive and gynecological concerns of young women with Crohn's disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective chart review of young women with Crohn's disease and gynecologic concerns at a large, urban tertiary children's hospital.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measures

Documentation of abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, genital fistula, ulcer, or abscess.

Results

Most of the patients (85.7%) had menstrual concerns reported as abnormal bleeding patterns or chronic pelvic pain. Genital complaints (fistula, ulcer, or abscess) were present in 75% of patients who ultimately required immune modulators or antibiotics to control their Crohn's disease. Genital complaints were present in only 1 of 3 patients who did not have a history of immune modulator use for Crohn's disease related flare.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of information available on gynecological concerns occurring in patients with Crohn's disease. Providers should be aware of gynecological manifestations that might appear concurrently with Crohn's colitis, including vulvovaginal pain, vulvar infections, rectovaginal or rectovestibular fistulas, pelvic pain, and menstrual irregularities.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing antibacterial therapy with placebo in Crohn's disease [^417cf149]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Antibacterial therapy has been investigated in several randomized, clinical trials compared with placebo for the management of Crohn's disease. Evidences for the efficacy of intervention are increasingly required.

Objectives

To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials to compare the effects of antibacterial therapy versus placebo in patients with Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

A systematic literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (April 1966 to July 2009) was conducted using specific search terms.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing antibacterial (antimycobacterial and broad-spectrum antibiotic) therapy with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were reviewed to determine the number of participants, mean follow-up, and the odds ratios (OR) for primary end point of clinical remission and clinical response were also abstracted. The meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model or a randomized-effects model according to the degree of heterogeneity.

Results

Eleven randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials with 668 participants (364 patients in the treatment group and, 304 patients in the placebo group) were identified. Antimycobacterial agents were used in four of the trials and broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in the other seven trials. Pooled analysis showed no significant differences in the rates of clinical remission [OR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87–1.90, P = 0.214] and clinical response (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 0.91–2.55, P = 0.108) after receiving antibacterial treatment for 3 months or longer.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in patients with Crohn's disease was found.

### AGA technical review on the medical management of moderate to severe luminal and perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease [^9e8e2f21]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) is rising globally. Patients with moderate to severe CD are at high risk for needing surgery and hospitalization and for developing disease-related complications, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. Optimal management of outpatients with moderate to severe luminal and/or fistulizing (including perianal) CD often requires the use of immunomodulator (thiopurines, methotrexate) and/or biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators) to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe CD are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Since the last iteration of these guidelines published in 2013, significant advances have been made in the field, including the regulatory approval of 2 new biologic agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized updating clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. The review addressed the following focused questions (in adult outpatients with moderate to severe luminal CD): overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, comparative efficacy of a top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up treatment strategy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of mesalamine), and the role of corticosteroids and mesalamine for induction and/or maintenance of remission. Finally, in adult outpatients with moderate to severe fistulizing CD, this review addressed the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for achieving fistula and the role of adjunctive antibiotics without clear evidence of active infection.

### Spontaneous remission of Crohn's disease following a febrile infection: case report and literature review [^01007659]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that often follows a relapsing-remitting course. Current treatment regimens for Crohn's disease focus on immunosuppressive agents including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, purine analogues such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, and biologic therapies such as tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors. Along similar lines, surgery is frequently employed to excise regions of immune-mediated inflammatory activity. Contrasting such approaches, recent studies have suggested that underlying defects in innate immunity may play a role in the development of this disease. Innate immune deficiencies may in turn leave predisposed individuals vulnerable to an infection or infections that cause the disease. In support of a role for infection, various antibiotic and probiotic regimens have been explored in an attempt to eradicate or displace the suspect pathogen(s). Many pathogens have been implicated with the idea that the disease may result from some form of occult infection or from reduced control/decreased biodiversity of commensal bacteria. While the probiotic or antibiotic approach may lead to a lessening of inflammation and symptoms, the ability of such regimens to produce cures is limited and antibiotic side effects prevent its long term use.

Although many studies have highlighted defects in the innate immune response, the febrile response arm remains a critical, but often ignored component of innate immunity. In the present case study, we report on the temporary remission of severe Crohn's disease following an influenza-like illness with repeated high fevers and review the literature associated with this phenomenon.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the management of Crohn's disease after surgical resection [^9cbbaeaf]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

AGA Crohn's disease after surgical resection — comparative efficacy of prophylactic therapies and role of antibiotics: Anti-TNF therapy compared with placebo resulted in 49% and 76% relative reductions in clinical and endoscopic recurrence at 18 months, respectively, and thiopurines resulted in 65% and 60% relative decreases in clinical and endoscopic recurrence, respectively. Moderate-quality evidence shows that antibiotics reduced the risk of endoscopic and clinical recurrence by approximately 50%, but their use is usually limited to 3 to 12 months and disease usually recurs within a couple of years after antibiotics are stopped. Antibiotics are probably inferior to anti-TNF agents by a large extent (moderate-quality evidence) and may be modestly inferior to thiopurines (low-quality evidence) in reducing recurrence; if chosen postoperatively, nitroimidazole antibiotics (eg, metronidazole) should be used because they are the only class that has been adequately studied.

AGA guideline — TNF-antagonist withdrawal in Crohn's disease on combination therapy: Across 3 trials (339 individuals), clinical relapse was higher with TNF-antagonist withdrawal than with continued combination therapy (30.6% vs 11.2%; RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.08–4.61). In included RCTs, the risk of serious adverse events was similar between groups (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.36–1.88). The certainty of evidence was judged to be low, and the evidence-to-decision balance of effects favor continuation of combination therapy over withdrawal of TNF antagonists in CD.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^bf6728e1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — smoking and Crohn's disease (CD) outcomes — In time-dependent multivariate analysis, smokers had decreased survival free of stricturing disease (HR 1.5, 1.18–1.90), higher perianal complications (HR 1.50; 95% CI, 1.01–1.46), and a higher risk for requiring thiopurine therapy (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.30). A meta-analysis reported in smokers a 56% higher risk of a flare of disease activity and a twofold risk of flare after surgery, with increased need for first surgery (OR 1.68; 95% CI, 1.33–2.12) and second surgery (OR 2.17; CI, 1.63–2.89). Compared with nonsmokers, response to episodic infliximab was lower in smokers (22% vs. 74%) with response (OR 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08–0.41). After endoscopic balloon dilatation, current smokers more often required another intervention than never smokers (79% vs 55%; adjusted HR 2.50; 95% CI, 1.14–5.50), and after 5 years the cumulative probability of a new intervention was 0.81 vs 0.52, difference 0.29 (95% CI, 0.07–0.52).

### The importance of monitoring the postpartum period in moderate to severe Crohn's disease [^bf04fc29]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior research demonstrates Crohn's disease patients often do well in pregnancy; however, less is known about the risk of flare in the postpartum period.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary care inflammatory bowel disease center. All pregnant women with Crohn's disease who were followed in the postpartum period, defined as 6 months after delivery, were included. Statistical analysis included χ2 analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression analysis. The primary outcome of interest was rate of flare in the postpartum period.

Results

There were 105 patients included in the study, with a majority (68%) on biologic medication during pregnancy. Thirty-one patients (30%) had a postpartum flare at a median of 9 weeks (range 2–24 weeks). Twenty-five patients (81%) had their postpartum flare managed in the outpatient setting with medications (only 4 of these patients required prednisone). 6 of 31 patients (19%) were hospitalized at a median of 4 weeks (range 2–26 weeks) after delivery, requiring intravenous corticosteroids or surgery. In multivariable regression, there was no significant increase in risk of postpartum flare with increasing maternal age, flare during pregnancy, or steroid or biologic use during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy increased risk of postpartum flare (odds ratio, 16.2 [1.72–152.94], P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In a cohort of Crohn's disease patients, 30% experienced a postpartum flare despite being on medical therapy, but most were able to be managed in the outpatient setting.

### Aeromonas species: an opportunistic enteropathogen in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases? A single center cohort study [^ec9b03ef]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of Aeromonas species as an enteropathogen in patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still debated. The aim was to explore the significance of positive Aeromonas stool cultures in IBD and patients without IBD.

Methods

Observational retrospective study including all patients with a stool culture positive for Aeromonas between January 2011 and October 2013 at the Leuven University Hospitals. Demographics, clinical, and endoscopic outcomes and laboratory results were analyzed.

Results

A total of 77 patients (11 IBD) were identified. In 37 cases, Aeromonas caused a mild self-limited gastrointestinal infection. Among the 40 patients needing antibiotics, 22 presented a mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal infection; 4 suffered from extraintestinal complications; and 4 were coinfected by Campylobacter spp. A. veronii caused more frequently severe infection than the other species (25% versus 5%; P = 0.046). In 2 patients with ulcerative colitis, Aeromonas triggered a moderate-to-severe flare and 2 cases appeared in the context of de novo Crohn's disease. In contrast, in 1 patient with ulcerative colitis and 2 patients with Crohn's disease, Aeromonas caused a mild gastrointestinal infection not worsening the disease activity and in 4 patients with Crohn's disease, it presented in the context of active disease with no clear pathogenic role. Patients with IBD were treated more often with antibiotics (82 versus 41%, P = 0.012) and had more complications (46 versus 14%, P = 0.024).

Conclusions

Aeromonas caused mostly mild infections but also moderate and severe infections. A. veronii was more prevalent in patients with IBD and was associated with worse clinical outcomes. Aeromonas caused milder infections in patients without IBD. Other risk factors for severe infection were not found.

### Chronic pain and infection: mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^5bdd85e1]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The treatment of pain in inflammatory bowel disease depends on presentation. Antidepressants and opioids should be considered for flares of visceral pain, although chronic opioid use could paradoxically worsen abdominal pain. Given the high co-prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric illnesses, psychotherapy can be considered. Systematic reviews have found evidence for antibiotics in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but paradoxically, the use of antibiotics in childhood could increase the risk for future inflammatory bowel disease. Immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine, methotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors have shown effectiveness.

Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome

Myalgic encephalitis or chronic fatigue syndrome is a poorly understood clinical condition characterized by post-exertional malaise lasting at least six months, associated with variable symptoms of neurological, immune, endocrine, or autonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis is controversial, with no universally accepted diagnostic criteria. The term "chronic fatigue syndrome" was originally proposed as an alternative to "chronic Epstein-Barr syndrome" to describe the symptom complex of chronic fatigue presenting with other (often painful) symptoms, including sore throat, lymph node pain and tenderness, headache, myalgia, and arthralgias. Myalgic encephalomyelitis refers to a specific neuro-immunological condition, and has been suggested to be clinically distinct from chronic fatigue syndrome, but most practitioners use the two terms synonymously or in combination. Although painful symptoms were prominent in earlier case definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome, more recent clinical diagnostic criteria have de-emphasized pain, which is not required for diagnosis. Nevertheless, pain remains a common symptom in patients with myalgic encephalitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, and many nociplastic pain conditions (eg, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine) are comorbidities.
