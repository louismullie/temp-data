## Question

depakotes effect on womens hormones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Depakote's effects on women's hormones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall endocrine effects seen in women taking valproate, including hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and PCOS. Then, I should verify mechanistic pathways that could plausibly explain these effects via GABAergic modulation of GnRH neurons. Next, I will review specific hormonal changes and timing, including LH/FSH, testosterone, SHBG, and early-onset effects. After that, I need to assess age-related vulnerability and metabolic interactions like insulin resistance and weight gain. Then, I should examine clinical consequences for menstruation, ovulation, and fertility. I will also check contraceptive and drug interaction issues that complicate management. Finally, I will outline risk stratification, monitoring, and guideline-based counseling to translate evidence into practice [^114MBfch] [^114gCx5s] [^117Pfo1K].

> Let me first confirm the core signal. Across prospective and observational studies, valproate in women is associated with increased rates of hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and PCOS compared with alternative antiseizure medicines such as lamotrigine or carbamazepine, with a particularly robust prospective trial showing more ovulatory dysfunction and higher PCOS incidence on valproate over 12 months [^114MBfch] [^111YuopX] [^112uR56R] [^114XHwnf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: some endocrine abnormalities occur in women with epilepsy even without medication, but valproate appears to amplify these risks beyond background epilepsy effects, which is why guidelines and regulators flag this specifically for women of childbearing potential [^117Pfo1K] [^116vHBvA] [^112xaqff].

> Now, I need to check the plausibility of mechanism. Valproate enhances GABAergic tone, and GABAergic afferents to GnRH neurons can depolarize and increase GnRH firing due to high intracellular chloride in those neurons, disturbing pulsatile GnRH release and downstream LH/FSH patterns that regulate ovulation and androgen production [^114gCx5s] [^115knPxB]. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with clinical phenotypes: both animal and human neuroendocrine data link increased GABAergic drive to GnRH dysfunction and PCOS-like traits, supporting a mechanistic bridge from valproate to hyperandrogenism and cycle disruption, even if some human acute studies are neutral on LH pulsatility over one month [^114gCx5s] [^1143J45S].

> Next, I will examine specific hormonal changes. Within 1–3 months of initiating valproate, women can show increases in serum testosterone and alterations in gonadotropins, while SHBG often rises early yet does not prevent an increase in bioavailable androgens in a subset, consistent with an emerging hyperandrogenic profile in susceptible patients [^112uR56R]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SHBG would necessarily fall to explain higher free androgens, but early data actually show SHBG may increase with valproate, implying the androgen excess stems from increased ovarian/adrenal production and altered gonadotropin drive rather than reduced binding alone, which fits the GnRH/LH perturbation model [^112uR56R] [^114gCx5s].

> I will now assess the clinical syndrome. Multiple cohorts report a PCOS-like phenotype during valproate therapy, with substantially higher frequencies of polycystic ovaries and/or hyperandrogenism than controls or carbamazepine comparators, and higher rates of menstrual irregularities in women with bipolar disorder receiving valproate, mirroring the epilepsy data [^111YuopX] [^112zPE8Q] [^111oZcoT]. Hold on, I should verify comparators: the prospective randomized data against lamotrigine strengthen causality by reducing confounding, showing more ovulatory dysfunction and PCOS on valproate, especially in younger women, which is a clinically important modifier of risk [^114MBfch].

> Age at initiation may be pivotal, so let me consider vulnerability windows. Starting valproate under age 26 doubles the risk of hyperandrogenism compared with starting at older ages, and exposure in puberty is associated with higher androgens and more PCOS at follow-up compared with those off medication, suggesting a developmentally sensitive HPG axis that is more easily dysregulated [^114MBfch] [^114hBjZy]. Wait, I should double-check the prepubertal data because I recall conflicting signals: one small study in prepubertal girls found hyperinsulinemia with relative hypoandrogenism and higher SHBG early on, meaning androgen excess may emerge later with pubertal maturation rather than during the prepubertal period, which helps reconcile apparent discrepancies across ages [^113HF8mF].

> I need to examine metabolic effects that could potentiate endocrine disruption. Valproate is linked to weight gain and adverse lipid changes in children within 6–12 months, and in adult women with PCOS features on valproate, hyperinsulinemia and unfavorable lipids are common, aligning with an insulin resistance cluster that can further stimulate ovarian androgen production and perpetuate the hyperandrogenic cycle [^115w61Jq] [^111YuopX]. Let me reconsider causality: while not all cohorts show uniform metabolic changes, the convergence of weight gain, insulin resistance, and androgen excess on valproate is pathophysiologically coherent and clinically relevant for CV risk and reproductive dysfunction in susceptible women [^115w61Jq] [^111YuopX].

> Next, I should review the reproductive consequences. Prospective monitoring demonstrates increased ovulatory dysfunction on valproate versus lamotrigine, with menstrual irregularities frequently emerging after valproate initiation in bipolar cohorts, and endocrine guidance recommends surveillance for prolonged cycles and biochemical hyperandrogenism given the implication for anovulation and subfertility [^114MBfch] [^111oZcoT] [^117Pfo1K]. Hold on, I should verify persistence: some elevations in androgens and PCOS features are observed during ongoing therapy, and while reversibility after discontinuation varies, the safest approach is early detection and consideration of alternatives if reproductive goals are affected [^114hBjZy] [^117Pfo1K].

> I need to check contraceptive and drug interaction issues that complicate management. Estrogen-containing contraceptives increase valproate clearance and can lower valproate serum levels, so I should monitor concentrations and seizure or mood control when starting or stopping these contraceptives, whereas valproate itself is not an enzyme inducer and does not appear to lower contraceptive steroid levels in direct studies, preserving contraceptive efficacy [^112ZNDft] [^112wtYwF] [^1135JZzv] [^111avZuf]. But wait, what if I assumed valproate reduces contraceptive effectiveness like enzyme-inducing ASMs? I should correct that assumption, because the interaction here is primarily in the direction of contraceptives affecting valproate levels, not vice versa, which mandates therapeutic drug monitoring rather than contraceptive changes per se [^112ZNDft] [^1135JZzv].

> Next, I should review who is highest risk and how to monitor. Risk appears higher when valproate is started before age 26, with obesity or preexisting metabolic syndrome, and possibly with puberty exposure, so baseline documentation of cycles, BMI, androgens, and metabolic labs with periodic reassessment is prudent, adding transvaginal ultrasound if cycles are prolonged or testosterone rises, to detect PCOS and guide management or switching therapy [^114MBfch] [^117Pfo1K] [^112MZwyj]. Hold on, I should verify frequency: quarterly androgen checks in the first year in high-risk patients are reasonable extrapolations from prospective trial schedules and endocrine recommendations, customized to symptoms and goals of care [^114MBfch] [^117Pfo1K].

> I should confirm regulatory and guideline positions that inform shared decision-making. Regulators and neurologic societies advise avoiding valproate in women of childbearing potential unless alternatives fail, mandate effective contraception, and absolutely contraindicate use for migraine prophylaxis in women who are pregnant or not using effective contraception, reflecting both teratogenic and endocrine risks that begin early in exposure [^116vHBvA] [^112xaqff] [^114WAi94] [^117YSyiw]. Let me verify counseling points: do not stop valproate abruptly because of status epilepticus risk, enroll in pregnancy registries if exposed during pregnancy, and discuss folic acid while acknowledging it does not mitigate valproate-specific risks, all of which should be part of repeated counseling at the onset of puberty and during reproductive years [^116vHBvA] [^111JRN2o] [^116J37DK].

> Putting this together for clinical translation, I need to ensure shared, informed choices: in women who need valproate for compelling indications, I should use the lowest effective dose, proactively monitor menstrual and metabolic parameters, address weight and insulin resistance, and consider switching to alternatives such as lamotrigine if hyperandrogenism, anovulation, or PCOS features emerge, while closely monitoring valproate levels if estrogen-containing contraception is started or modified to maintain disease control [^114MBfch] [^117Pfo1K] [^112ZNDft] [^112MZwyj]. Hold on, I should verify that these actions align with evidence: the randomized comparison with lamotrigine, endocrine surveillance recommendations, and regulatory guidance all support this structured approach to reduce endocrine harm without compromising seizure or mood stability [^114MBfch] [^117Pfo1K] [^116vHBvA].

> Final answer synthesis: Depakote (valproate) can disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in women, leading to increased androgens, altered LH/FSH dynamics, ovulatory dysfunction, and a PCOS-like phenotype, especially when started in adolescence or early adulthood and in the presence of weight gain or insulin resistance; these effects are mechanistically consistent with GABAergic modulation of GnRH neurons and warrant avoidance when possible, meticulous monitoring if used, and careful coordination with contraception due to bidirectional interactions affecting valproate exposure [^114MBfch] [^111YuopX] [^114gCx5s] [^117Pfo1K] [^112ZNDft].

---

Depakote (valproate) significantly affects women's hormones [^114XHwnf], increasing the risk of **PCOS-like features** (hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, and polycystic ovaries) [^117Pfo1K] [^114MBfch] [^114gCx5s] and **insulin resistance** [^111YuopX] [^113HF8mF]. These effects are more common with valproate than with lamotrigine [^114MBfch] or carbamazepine, especially when started before age 26 [^114MBfch] [^114hBjZy] or used long term. Valproate is **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to high risks of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders [^114EcZTU], and should be avoided in women of childbearing potential unless no alternatives exist, with effective contraception required [^116vHBvA] [^117YSyiw]. Hormonal contraceptives can lower valproate levels [^112ZNDft], potentially increasing seizure risk [^112wtYwF], so monitoring is needed [^111avZuf].

## Hormonal effects of depakote in women

### Hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

- **Increased androgens**: Valproate is linked to higher androgens (testosterone, androstenedione) [^112uR56R] [^114MBfch], causing hirsutism, acne, and alopecia [^111YuopX] [^117Pfo1K].

- **PCOS risk**: Valproate increases PCOS risk [^114XHwnf], with more hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction than lamotrigine (9% vs 2%; p = 0.007) [^114MBfch].

- **Early exposure**: Starting valproate before age 26 [^114MBfch] increases hyperandrogenism risk [^114hBjZy].

---

### Menstrual irregularities

Cycle disturbances associated with valproate include **oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea and irregular cycles** [^112zPE8Q] [^111oZcoT] [^117Pfo1K]. Early changes in reproductive hormones can appear within one month [^112uR56R], characterized by **higher testosterone, LH, FSH, and SHBG** and **lower DHEAS**.

---

### Insulin resistance and metabolic effects

**Insulin resistance** is increased with valproate [^111YuopX]; hyperinsulinemia contributes to metabolic syndrome and PCOS [^113HF8mF]. **Weight gain** and obesity are also associated with valproate [^115w61Jq], worsening metabolic and reproductive effects [^111YuopX].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

### Fertility and reproductive health

Infertility risk stems from valproate-related **hyperandrogenism** [^114MBfch] and **menstrual irregularities** [^112zPE8Q], which can reduce fertility [^117Pfo1K]. Contraception is **required** for women of childbearing potential taking valproate [^116vHBvA] [^112xaqff].

---

### Pregnancy considerations

Teratogenicity is significant with valproate [^112xaqff] and includes **neural tube defects**, **craniofacial and cardiovascular malformations**, and **neurodevelopmental disorders** [^114EcZTU] [^113cD5yz]. Contraindications include use for **migraine prophylaxis in pregnancy**; for epilepsy or bipolar disorder, it should be **avoided unless no alternatives exist** [^116vZEh9] [^117YSyiw].

---

### Monitoring and management

- **Hormonal monitoring**: Regularly monitor menstrual cycles [^117Pfo1K], androgens, and metabolic parameters [^112MZwyj] in women on valproate.

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternatives (e.g. lamotrigine) [^114MBfch] for women of childbearing potential or with PCOS risk factors [^112MZwyj].

- **Patient counseling**: Counsel on reproductive risks [^112xaqff], contraception, and pregnancy planning [^116vHBvA] [^116J37DK].

## Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives

Estrogen effects include **increased valproate clearance** with **estrogen-containing contraceptives** [^112wtYwF], lowering levels [^112ZNDft] and potentially increasing seizure frequency [^111avZuf]. Monitoring of **valproate levels** and **clinical response** is recommended when **starting or stopping estrogen-containing contraceptives** [^112ZNDft] [^113i4bP6].

---

Depakote alters women's hormones, increasing **androgens** [^112uR56R], **menstrual irregularities** [^112zPE8Q], and **insulin resistance** [^111YuopX], with higher **PCOS** risk than some alternatives [^114MBfch]. It is **contraindicated in pregnancy** and requires **effective contraception** and close monitoring in women of childbearing potential [^116vHBvA] [^112MZwyj].

### Hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovary syndrome with valproate versus lamotrigine [^114MBfch]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the development of components of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and PCOS itself in women with epilepsy who were starting valproate or lamotrigine therapy.

- **Methods**: Female individuals with epilepsy and regular menstrual cycles were eligible for this prospective study. Participants were randomized to receive either 12 months of valproate (n = 225) or lamotrigine (n = 222) therapy. Serum androgen levels were measured every 3 months, while urinary pregnanediol glucuronide levels were assessed weekly for two 3-month periods. The primary end point was the development of PCOS components, namely hyperandrogenism (HA) or ovulatory dysfunction (OD). A post hoc analysis was conducted in women more than 2 years after menarche (177 on lamotrigine, 186 on valproate) to exclude the confounding effect of puberty on OD.

- **Results**: More women in the valproate group than in the lamotrigine group developed OD in the prospective study (54% valproate, 38% lamotrigine; p = 0.010) and in the post hoc analysis (36% valproate, 23% lamotrigine; p = 0.007). Additionally, more women in the valproate group developed PCOS compared to those in the lamotrigine group (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.007). The development of HA was more frequent with valproate than with lamotrigine among those initiating treatment at an age younger than 26 years (44% valproate, 23% lamotrigine; p = 0.002) but was similar if treatment was started at age 26 years or older (24% valproate, 22% lamotrigine).

- **Interpretation**: The development of HA occurred more frequently with valproate than with lamotrigine, especially if the medication was started at an age younger than 26 years.

### Valproic acid [^116vHBvA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, and major congenital malformations, including neural tube defects, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death, such as prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications (4)]. Women should use effective contraception while using valproate.

Women of childbearing potential should be counseled regularly regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy. This is especially important for women planning a pregnancy and for girls at the onset of puberty; alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.

Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation.

### Depakote [^112xaqff]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure.

Valproate is therefore contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)]. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.

Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Pancreatitis**: Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should be discontinued immediately [content cut off].

### Valproate-induced insulin resistance in prepubertal girls with epilepsy [^113HF8mF]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Valproate is commonly used for treatment of a variety of seizure types in both children and adults. However, if the medication is started before the age of 20 years, it may affect reproductive endocrine functions. In order to investigate the possible role of valproate treatment in the development of obesity, hyperinsulinism, and polycystic ovaries, we studied metabolic parameters and ovarian morphology/size in prepubertal girls with epilepsy.

Our study included 14 girls with epilepsy and 15 healthy age-matched controls. The age of the patients ranged from 7 to 13 years. The mean body weight, fasting serum insulin, glucose levels, and HOMA index of girls in the study group were significantly greater than those of the control girls (p < 0.05). Serum androstenedione, prolactin, and free testosterone were significantly lower in the VPA-treated girls than in the controls, whereas the SHBG level was higher (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups for ovarian morphology.

In conclusion, our findings showed that valproate treatment may lead to hyperinsulinemia and hypoandrogenism during the prepubertal period. This emphasizes that a mature adult endocrine system may not be necessary for the development of VPA-related hyperinsulinemia.

### Valproate sodium [^112ZNDft]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, leading to decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen-containing products.

- **Felbamate**: A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

- **Rifampin**: A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.

- **Drugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed**:

	- **Antacids**: A study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate.

	- **Chlorpromazine**: A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate did not reveal any significant interaction.

### Altered ovarian function and cardiovascular risk factors in valproate-treated women [^111YuopX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovaries and menstrual disturbances appear to be common among women taking valproate for epilepsy. This study aimed to assess the frequency of valproate-related metabolic and endocrine disorders in different groups of women with epilepsy.

- **Subjects and methods**: Seventy-two women with epilepsy and 52 control subjects from centers in three European countries (Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands) participated in the study. Thirty-seven of the women with epilepsy were taking valproate monotherapy and 35 were on carbamazepine monotherapy.

- **Results**: The frequency of polycystic ovaries or hyperandrogenism, or both, among valproate-treated women with epilepsy was 70% (26 of 37) compared to 19% (10 of 52) among control subjects (P < 0.001). These conditions were found in 79% (11 of 14) of obese and 65% (15 of 23) of lean women on valproate, and in 20% (7 of 35) of carbamazepine-treated women. The obese valproate-treated women with polycystic ovaries or hyperandrogenism, or both, also exhibited hyperinsulinemia and associated unfavorable changes in serum lipid levels, consistent with insulin resistance.

- **Conclusions**: Polycystic ovaries and related hyperandrogenism are frequently encountered in both obese and lean women taking valproate for epilepsy. The use of valproate is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease in obese women.

### Early hormonal changes during valproate or carbamazepine treatment: A 3-month study [^112uR56R]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with valproate (VPA) or carbamazepine (CBZ) may induce reproductive endocrine disorders in patients with epilepsy.

- **Methods**: Serum concentrations of reproductive hormones were studied in 17 women and 22 men with recently diagnosed epilepsy before they started either VPA or CBZ medication, and 1 and 3 months later.

- **Results**: No weight gain or clinical signs of hormonal disorders were observed during the follow-up. The mean serum levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) decreased, in women starting VPA. Serum testosterone levels increased in half of the women on VPA. Serum concentrations of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone increased, and gonadotropins decreased, in men on VPA during the follow-up. Serum SHBG levels increased and DHEAS decreased during the first months of CBZ treatment in both sexes. In addition, the free-androgen index decreased in men after starting CBZ.

- **Conclusions**: Hormonal changes occur after only 1 month's use of VPA or CBZ. VPA treatment seems to be associated with increased serum androgen levels, but the profile of hormonal changes appears to be different in women than in men. The use of CBZ, in turn, was associated with increased SHBG concentrations and thus with diminished sex steroid function in both sexes. The women with increased serum testosterone levels in the early phase of VPA medication may be at increased risk for VPA-related endocrine disorders later during treatment.

### Depakoteer [^1135JZzv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Clozapine**: In psychotic patients (n = 11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with clozapine.

- **Lithium**: Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n = 16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium.

- **Lorazepam**: Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.

- **Olanzapine**: No dose adjustment for olanzapine is necessary when olanzapine is administered concomitantly with valproate. Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n = 10) caused a 15% reduction in Cmax and a 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.

- **Oral contraceptive steroids**: Administration of a single dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to six women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for two months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.

### Neuroendocrine considerations in the treatment of men and women with epilepsy [^115knPxB]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Complex, multidirectional interactions between hormones, seizures, and the medications used to control them can present a challenge for clinicians treating patients with epilepsy. Many hormones act as neurosteroids, modulating brain excitability via direct binding sites. Thus, changes in endogenous or exogenous hormone levels can affect the occurrence of seizures directly as well as indirectly through pharmacokinetic effects that alter the concentrations of antiepileptic drugs. The underlying structural and physiological brain abnormalities of epilepsy and the metabolic activity of antiepileptic drugs can adversely affect hypothalamic and gonadal functioning. Knowledge of these complex interactions has increased and can now be incorporated in meaningful treatment approaches for men and women with epilepsy.

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: What are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach [^114BxfKs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

A woman of childbearing age taking valproate faces two conceivable scenarios when considering whether to continue the medication during pregnancy: she may be planning to become pregnant while taking valproate, or she may have already become pregnant while on the medication. Both scenarios are common in primary and secondary care. Additionally, bipolar disorder and epilepsy are prevalent among women of childbearing age, with patients suffering from bipolar disorder having an increased risk of unintended pregnancy due to factors such as sexual disinhibition associated with mania.

Several factors might affect the clinical outcome for both mother and child within these scenarios, including the severity of the condition (such as the frequency and duration of relapses), co-existing medication (such as the need for combination therapy to control bipolar disorder or epilepsy), drug and alcohol use, co-morbidity, sociocultural factors, level of social support, and, in the second scenario, the stage at which the pregnancy was confirmed.

Deciding whether or not to continue valproate in these situations requires a complex risk assessment. Many studies over the years have analyzed the sequelae of continuation and discontinuation of valproate, both for the mother and child. We review these assessments below.

### Long-term reproductive endocrine health in young women with epilepsy during puberty [^114hBjZy]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate the outcome of epilepsy and subsequent reproductive endocrine health in girls who experienced epilepsy during puberty, a population-based controlled study was conducted.

Sixty-nine patients (88%) and 51 control subjects (94%) from previously identified cohorts of 78 girls with epilepsy and 54 healthy control girls participated in this study. The initial ages ranged from 8 to 18.5 years, with follow-up ages from 12.5 to 25.8 years. Thirty-five patients were initially taking valproate (VPA), 17 were on carbamazepine, and 17 were on oxcarbazepine as monotherapy. Most of the patients (61%) were no longer on medication by the time of the study. All subjects underwent clinical examinations, provided medical and menstrual histories, had ovarian ultrasonography, and had their serum reproductive hormone concentrations analyzed.

There were no significant differences in laboratory or clinical findings between the patients who were off medication and the control subjects. However, postpubertal patients on medication demonstrated higher serum testosterone (1.9 nmol/L, SD 0.7 nmol/L) as well as androstenedione levels (18.8 nmol/L, SD 15.2 nmol/L) compared to patients off medication (1.4 nmol/L, SD 0.5 nmol/L, and 9.5 nmol/L, SD 2.6 nmol/L) or the control subjects (1.4 nmol/L, SD 0.5 nmol/L, and 10.2 nmol/L, SD 3.2 nmol/L). All comparisons showed statistical significance (p < 0.02). All patients still on VPA had elevated serum androstenedione levels. Polycystic ovary syndrome was more prevalent in patients on medication (38%; with 63% on VPA and 25% on other medication) than in patients off medication (6%) or control subjects (11%) (p = 0.005).

In conclusion, epilepsy during pubertal maturation does not appear to impact reproductive endocrine health adversely.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: A complex condition with psychological, reproductive and metabolic manifestations that impacts on health across the lifespan [^117PPPW1]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacological therapy in PCOS currently lacks an ideal medical treatment that fully reverses underlying hormonal disturbances and addresses all clinical features. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) improves hyperandrogenism, and insulin sensitizers, primarily Metformin, reduce insulin resistance in PCOS. Medical therapy should be targeted to symptoms and is not a replacement for lifestyle interventions in PCOS.

The OCP has long been utilized in PCOS to induce regular cycles, protect the endometrium, and treat hyperandrogenism. Its mechanisms of action include a significant first-pass hepatic effect, increasing the production of hepatic proteins, including sex hormone-binding globulin, which reduces free circulating androgen levels, even with low-dose OCPs. This critical antiandrogenic action does not occur with progestin alone or non-oral estrogen-containing contraceptive preparations. The OCP also reduces ovarian androgen production.

There is concerning data suggesting that the OCP can increase insulin resistance and worsen glucose tolerance. Studies are inadequate and data are conflicting, indicating a need for more research. However, consideration should be given to the cardiometabolic effects of medical therapy. Low-dose OCP preparations may be a preferable alternative, offering similar efficacy and reduced cardiometabolic effects.

Metformin has played an increasing role in PCOS management, improving clinical features such as ovulation, cycle regulation, and potentially hirsutism, with positive cardiometabolic effects. However, it does not appear to induce the effects discussed.

### DepakoteER [^111GmbHc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures, where patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Simple and complex absence seizures**: The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one-week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. As Depakote ER dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients who require the drug to prevent major seizures, because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

- **Migraine**: Depakote ER is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^1148bKW4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

There is consensus on the teratogenic harms of valproate for pregnant women and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. Patients and families harmed by valproate, and those who were not warned about these, are outraged. They deserve full compensation and financial and social support, as do all vulnerable and disabled people in societies promoting equality and social justice.

The impact of valproate on male fertility and possible epigenetic effects are unknown, and the MHRA has refused to release the unpublished information on which they have based their restrictions in men. The UK is the only country with such restrictions. They do not align with the Montgomery and McCulloch judgements, GMC regulations, or common law principles.

Recent regulations imposed by the MHRA effectively limit or prevent people from choosing valproate, even in circumstances when it is the only medication to prevent life-threatening seizures. 30–40% of people with epilepsy coming off valproate are predicted to experience seizures. Deaths have occurred because of the avoidance of valproate, and more will, unless the regulations are urgently amended. This article focused on adults with epilepsy, but there are also people with bipolar disorder or other mental health problems for whom valproate is the best medication to keep them well. They are often too unwell to advocate for themselves. Uncontrolled seizures, cognitive and neurodevelopmental consequences for young people and children denied valproate from birth have potential long-term and irreversible consequences.

### Antiepileptic drugs alter reproductive endocrine hormones in men with epilepsy [^116DWYni]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Disturbances of reproductive endocrine hormones are more often found in men with epilepsy than in the general population. There is an ongoing debate about whether this can be attributed to chronic use of antiepileptic drugs or to the epilepsy itself. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree of endocrine disturbances in men with epilepsy compared with healthy controls and to investigate whether there was a drug-specific effect of valproate (VPA) or carbamazepine (CBZ). Men with epilepsy, aged 20–40 years, having used either VPA (n = 16) or CBZ (n = 19) as monotherapy for more than two years were included and compared with age-matched controls.

Men with epilepsy (VPA + CBZ) had significantly lower follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values and higher C-peptide values compared with controls. The study investigated possible drug-specific effects, finding that VPA-treated patients had significantly higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels and lower FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations compared with the controls. There were no differences in testosterone, testosterone/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) ratio, or androstenedione levels.

Men on VPA also had significantly lower free carnitine/total carnitine, which may have implications for sperm motility, as well as higher insulin and C-peptide concentrations. The CBZ-treated patients had a significantly lower testosterone/SHBG ratio than the controls. Compared with CBZ-treated patients, men on VPA had significantly higher DHEAS concentrations and lower levels of FSH, LH, as well as a lower free carnitine/total carnitine ratio.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^114goWDG]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Valproate and male fertility-hormonal effects

Data on reproductive hormones in men taking valproate are contradictory and limited to small numbers (Grade C evidence). A review totaling 444 patients and 398 controls found that valproate had fewer hormonal effects than enzyme-inducing ASMs. Another review found an association between valproate use in men and lowered testosterone, with p = 0.04. Contradictory findings were observed in a controlled study of 90 men; among those treated with valproate, 57% had elevated serum androgens (n = 12, p = 0.001) compared to 20% in those taking carbamazepine and 8% in controls. In another study of 70 males with epilepsy treated with VPA (age-matched to 70 controls, age range 7–20 years), androgen levels were elevated in 45 participants (64%, p = 0.0006), particularly in prepubertal patients (p = 0.0003).

- **Erectile dysfunction**: Valproate reduced erectile dysfunction and penile fibrosis in rodents in a small study and is being trialed as a neuroprotective agent to reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction requiring radical prostatectomy. Population surveys report erectile dysfunction in 2% of healthy men over 80 years. In one study, 42.5% of 80 men with epilepsy reported erectile dysfunction using a self-administered scale, with similar rates (38.6%) in an uncontrolled hospital cross-sectional survey of men with neurological disabilities (Grade C evidence). A self-reported reduction in erectile function was noted by men taking valproate (n = 32) and levetiracetam (n = 30) compared to controls without epilepsy on no medication.

### The consequences of valproate exposure in utero [^116UaTCR]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

A consistent finding from epilepsy and pregnancy registries is that higher doses of valproate are less safe than lower doses, and valproate used in combination with other drugs is more cognitively and physically teratogenic than when used alone. For women with genetic generalized epilepsy who need valproate for adequate seizure control, consideration should be given to whether a minimum valproate dose together with an alternative concomitant therapy or the smallest efficacious dose of valproate in monotherapy should be used.

The International Registry of AEDs and Pregnancy (EURAP) is an observational study established in 1999 that brings together investigators from 42 countries across Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. It primarily studies major congenital malformations by recruiting women prior to week 16 of pregnancy. As such, EURAP can often provide the largest sample sizes for subgroup comparison studies. This study identified 1,224 pregnancies with valproate as monotherapy and 364 when valproate was taken with another anti-epileptic drug; 44% of combinations were valproate and lamotrigine.

Major malformations, at one year of age, were seen in 10% of children exposed to valproate alone, in 11.3% exposed to valproate and lamotrigine, and in 11.7% exposed to valproate and another anti-epileptic drug that was not lamotrigine. The major finding was that it was the dose of valproate that predicted malformation rate with doses over 1.5

### Metabolic alterations during valproic acid treatment: A prospective study [^115w61Jq]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We prospectively examined the effects of valproic acid on the endocrine system and metabolic variables in epileptic children. Patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy were included in the study. Laboratory and clinical variables were assessed before and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. In total, 30 patients (mean age, 8.6 ± 4.4 years S.D.) were investigated. Body mass index and body mass index standard deviation scores of patients increased significantly during treatment. Although there was no statistical significance regarding fasting glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and the insulin resistance index, a statistically significant increase in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurred after 12 months of valproic acid treatment. At the end of the study period, four patients were obese and six patients were overweight. There was a significant correlation between serum levels of valproic acid and body mass index at month 6 of treatment. There was no significant change in androgen hormone levels during treatment in the prepubertal group. Body mass index and body mass index standard deviation scores increased during the first 6 months of valproic acid treatment. Patients treated with valproic acid should be regularly followed for obesity.

### Valproic acid [^114c2KPD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death, such as the prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Infertility**: There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

- **Pediatric use**: Experience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning]. When valproic acid is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2 years, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Younger children, especially those receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to attain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e. between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearance.

### Premenstrual exacerbations of mood disorders: Findings and knowledge gaps [^111j28wQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sex hormones and their cyclic fluctuations affect physiological systems related to drug processing and are assumed to constitute a main factor for variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. This also applies to antidepressant treatments, suggesting less stable efficacy and adverse effects in women and contributing to inconsistent results on possible sex differences in response to antidepressant treatment. Women with PME of mood disorders may be particularly vulnerable to menstrual cycle–related serum level variability of drugs and may therefore need specific drug monitoring and adaptation. Systematic research on this topic is lacking for PME of depression, while a recent small-scale review showed a link between PME in (hypo-) manic and psychotic symptoms and a decrease in lithium serum levels during the luteal phase in women with BD. In one case report, a higher dose of lithium in the premenstrual phase appeared to compensate for the premenstrual decline in serum levels and prevent PME symptoms.

Treatment of BD with mood stabilizers appears to affect further menstrual cycle–linked abnormalities, including hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and metabolic dysfunctions, which interfere with menstrual cycle functioning. Both lithium and valproate facilitate menstrual cycle irregularities, and valproate may provoke polycystic ovarian syndrome, thereby causing elevated testosterone levels, anovulation, and infertility. Most studies in BD excluded women with menstrual cycle irregularities, which substantially limits generalizability.

### Valproate prescription to women of childbearing age in English primary care: Repeated cross-sectional analyses and retrospective cohort study [^112RUfrU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Prescription of valproate has steadily decreased in general practice since 2004; however, contraception prescription has not increased. While a range of interventions have been attempted, it is possible that a well-rewarded QOF indicator could build on the work of the UK's medical regulator to achieve greater impact.

### The role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons in polycystic ovary syndrome [^114gCx5s]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). High credibility.

- **Potential role of GABAergic neurons in PCOS-related GnRH neuron dysfunction**: The pharmacological agent valproate increases GABAergic tone, and long-term therapeutic use of valproate for epilepsy and bipolar disorder has been associated with an increased risk for PCOS. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid GABA concentrations may be elevated in women with PCOS. Although one study suggested that valproate administration to normal women for one month did not increase LH pulse frequency, studies in preclinical animal models suggest that GABAergic neurons play a role in the disordered GnRH secretion characteristic of PCOS.

The influence of sex steroids on GnRH secretion appears to be substantively mediated indirectly through neuronal systems afferent to GnRH neurons. Thus, neuronal circuits afferent to GnRH neurons likely mediate hyperandrogenemia-related GnRH neuron dysfunction in PCOS. Because GnRH neurons have high intracellular chloride concentrations, GABA A-receptor stimulation depolarizes GnRH neurons and can induce action potential firing in these cells. GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons, as well as the amplitude of the GABAergic postsynaptic currents, is decreased and increased by progesterone and DHT, respectively, suggesting that GABA neurons mediate progesterone-mediated suppression as well as androgen-mediated stimulation of GnRH neuron activity. In PNA mice, anatomical GABAergic innervation onto GnRH neurons is increased, as is functional excitatory GABAergic drive. These GABAergic neurons, originating largely from the arcuate nucleus, demonstrate less colocalization with…

### DepakoteER [^116D1AJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Starting doses in the elderly lower than 250 mg can only be achieved by the use of Depakote. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Dose-related adverse reactions**: The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.

- **G. I. irritation**: Patients who experience G. I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by slowly building up the dose from an initial low level.

- **Compliance**: Patients should be informed to take Depakote ER every day as prescribed.

### Should women of childbearing potential be prescribed valproate? A call to action [^117DUesi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Prescribing medications during pregnancy can be complicated by a serious negative outcome — harm to the fetus. Probably the two best-known examples of medications that can cause severe teratogenicity are thalidomide and isotretinoin. Thalidomide, used for anxiety, insomnia, and tension, was associated with phocomelia (malformation of limbs that many children did not survive).

### Reproductive effects of valproate, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine in men with epilepsy [^114dFz7S]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent observations have indicated that reproductive endocrine disorders are common among women taking valproate (VPA) for epilepsy, but it is not known whether respective abnormalities develop in men taking VPA for epilepsy. Carbamazepine (CBZ) may induce endocrine disorders in men with epilepsy, but the endocrine effects of oxcarbazepine (OXC) are not known.

- **Methods**: Reproductive endocrine function was evaluated in 90 men taking VPA (n = 21), CBZ (n = 40), or OXC (n = 29) as monotherapy for epilepsy and in 25 healthy control men.

- **Results**: Twelve men (57%) taking VPA had increased serum androgen levels. The mean serum level of androstenedione was high in patients taking VPA. Serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were low, and serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were high in men taking CBZ. The endocrine effects of OXC seemed to be dose-dependent because serum hormone levels were normal in patients with low OXC doses or ≤ 900 mg.

- **Conclusions**: VPA increases serum androgen concentrations in men with epilepsy. The endocrine effects of CBZ and OXC were different because CBZ appears to decrease the bioactivity of androgens, whereas OXC does not.

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: What are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach [^115vKJE4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is a condition characterized by abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity in the brain, causing seizures, and is associated with a variety of neurobiological, psychological, social, and cognitive consequences. The prevalence of active epilepsy in adults is 5–10 per 1000 and is influenced by many factors, both genetic and environmental. One risk factor for seizure activity is estrogen; hence, pregnancy can increase the seizure rate.

Information from EURAP, the International Registry of Anti-Epileptic Drugs and Pregnancy, suggests that 20% of pregnant patients with epilepsy were treated with valproate from 1999 to 2004, despite knowledge of its teratogenic risks. A more recent study in the UK showed that valproate accounted for 25% of anti-epileptic drug prescriptions in pregnancy.

This article will explore the benefits and harms of sodium valproate and its alternatives in both ordinary and planned pregnancies in the context of a tightening regulatory system for this drug. We will suggest questions that should guide decision-making for these patients and address the crucial issue of whether and how patients can be involved as democratic partners in such decisions.

Regarding the use of divalproex sodium ER PO (also known as Depakote ER) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is contraindicated for use as migraine prophylaxis but can be considered for the treatment of bipolar disorder and epilepsy if the patient has failed all other therapeutic options. If valproate is used during pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully in the mother. If abnormalities are found in the mother, then these parameters should also be monitored in the neonate.

### Depakoteer [^113wTtrV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Published case reports indicate instances of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate during pregnancy.

- **Animal studies**: Developmental toxicity studies in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys showed increased rates of fetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death after administering valproate to pregnant animals during organogenesis at clinically relevant doses (calculated on a body surface area [mg/m²] basis). Valproate induced malformations in multiple organ systems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, fetal neural tube defects were reported following valproate administration during critical periods of organogenesis, with the teratogenic response correlating with peak maternal drug levels. Behavioral abnormalities, such as cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits, and brain histopathological changes have been observed in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally to clinically relevant doses of valproate.

- **Lactation (8.2)**: Valproate is excreted in human milk. Data in the published literature indicates the presence of valproate in human milk, ranging from 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL, corresponding to 1% to 10% of maternal serum levels. Valproate serum concentrations collected from breastfed infants aged 3 days postnatal to 12 weeks following delivery ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL, which were 1% to 6% of maternal serum valproate levels. A published study in children up to six years of age did not report adverse effects.

### Treatment of hypopituitarism in patients receiving antiepileptic drugs [^1124zPrS]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that there may be drug interactions between antiepileptic drugs and hormonal therapies, which can present a challenge to endocrinologists dealing with patients who have both hypopituitarism and neurological diseases. Data are scarce for this subgroup of patients; however, data for the interaction of antiepileptic drugs with the pituitary axis have shown that chronic use of many antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate, enhances hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity and can decrease serum concentrations of sex hormones. Other antiepileptic drugs increase sex hormone-binding globulin, which reduces the bioactivity of testosterone and estradiol.

Additionally, the combined oestrogen-progestagen contraceptive pill might decrease lamotrigine concentrations, which could worsen seizure control. Moreover, sex hormones and their metabolites can directly act on neuronal excitability, acting as neurosteroids. Because carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine can enhance the sensitivity of renal tubules, a reduction in desmopressin dose might be necessary in patients with central diabetes insipidus.

Although the effects of antiepileptic drugs in central hypothyroidism have not yet been studied, substantial evidence indicates that several antiepileptic drugs can increase thyroid hormone metabolism. However, although it is reasonable to expect a need for a thyroxine dose increase with some antiepileptic drugs, the effect of excessive thyroxine in lowering seizure threshold should also be considered.

### Depakote [^114EcZTU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Structural birth defects**: Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities, such as craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and limb malformations. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk of congenital neural tube defects in the general population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Decreased IQ following in utero exposure**: Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom, which found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n = 62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C. I. 94–101]) than children with prenatal exposure to other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C. I. 105–110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C. I. 102–108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C. I. 104–112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects i

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^116zowQY]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction increases with age and is reported worldwide as 41%. Antiseizure medications (ASMs), including valproate (VPA), epilepsy, and chronic illness, all have reported associations with sexual dysfunction. Socioeconomic deprivation, which correlates with the severity of epilepsy, stress, and psychiatric illness, are also associated factors. The focus of sexual health research in epilepsy has primarily been on reproduction.

There are no current or planned randomized controlled trials of ASM use during pregnancy. Observational data derived from population studies, pregnancy registers, and case–control studies in people with epilepsy are the principal evidence for all guidance on this subject. Cochrane reviews conclude that methodological flaws do not affect the assertions of the risks of valproate. A pooled analysis reported major congenital malformations, defined as an abnormality of an essential anatomical structure that substantially interferes with function or requires major intervention, in 6.1% (range 4–10%) of children whose mothers took ASMs during pregnancy. This contrasts with 2.8% in children of untreated women with epilepsy and 2.2% in the general population. Registries report rates of major malformations for valproate ranging from 6.7% in the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Registers, which include a third of relevant pregnancies, to 10–13.8% in the Australian Pregnancy Registry, which includes 1 in 12 relevant pregnancies. There are few prospective reports for indications other than epilepsy. The Australian registry captured nine children of women who were taking valproate for indications other than epilepsy.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^114YNUiU]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Studying sexual health is challenging given the lack of standardization of definitions and outcome measures, and the wide variability that exists across age, cultures, and socioeconomic settings. Chronic conditions, including epilepsy, can affect sexual function and fertility in many ways. For people with epilepsy, many inter-related factors can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Those with comorbidities — particularly intellectual disability (ID) and psychiatric problems — more severe epilepsy, certain seizure types, and those who are socially deprived are more likely to have difficulties. Fertility levels are reported as lower for people with epilepsy in small, detailed surveys and large population studies. Nevertheless, evidence suggests no direct relationship between sex hormone levels and sexual happiness, with high levels of sexual satisfaction occurring in some people with abnormal hormonal profiles. Men in relationships who have epilepsy report the same level of sexual satisfaction as those in relationships without epilepsy.

Valproate may indirectly increase sexual happiness through seizure freedom, which is the main determinant of quality of life in epilepsy, and through mood-stabilizing effects. Indirect negative effects of valproate on sexual function include weight gain, insulin resistance with associated increased risk of hypogonadism in males, and polycystic ovarian syndrome in women.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^111Xvck5]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In many countries, individuals can make reproductive decisions with a wide range of options. For example, a person with a serious autosomal dominant genetic condition may choose to have a child without intervention, terminate a pregnancy, or undergo prenatal testing if available. They are not required to use contraception or be told what type they must use to receive optimal medical care. They may also decline to discuss their sexuality with healthcare professionals if they prefer.

In contrast, people choosing valproate as their treatment are denied these rights. According to the new MHRA guidelines, they may face the stress of potentially running out of their life-saving medication if the necessary reviews and dual signatories are not completed in time.

### The consequences of valproate exposure in utero [^113X73bQ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Prospective studies have unequivocally identified that valproate poses an unacceptable risk to the fetus in utero, prompting European and national bodies to issue unambiguous advice to neurologists. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency recommended strengthening the restrictions on the use of valproate in women and girls. The joint task force of the International League Against Epilepsy-Commission on European Affairs and the European Academy of Neurology responded with a detailed letter, later published in Epilepsia, which included seven recommendations. The first of these recommendations is, "Where possible, valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing potential".

In January 2015, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom issued stringent guidance regarding the prescription of valproate to women of childbearing potential. The data supporting these statements were based on robust prospective research approximating the risk of major malformations at one in ten, and that four in ten children are at risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The advice is, therefore, that first, valproate should not be used in girls or women of childbearing potential unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated. Second, it is advised that women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment.

However, valproate cannot simply be discarded from the panoply of anti-epileptic medications since it remains one of the most efficacious therapies; especially for those patients with genetic generalized epilepsy.

### Depakote [^112wtYwF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen-containing products.

A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

Methotrexate may decrease serum valproate levels and potentially result in increased frequency of seizures.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**: Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking valproate [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death, such as the prophylaxis of migraine headaches [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Infertility**: There have been reports of male infertility coincident with valproate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]. In animal studies, oral administration of valproate at clinically relevant doses resulted in adverse reproductive effects in males [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Reproductive function and risk for PCOS in women treated for bipolar disorder [^111oZcoT]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

This study examined the reproductive function and prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with bipolar disorder taking antimanic medications.

- **Method**: Women aged 18–45 treated for bipolar disorder and not taking steroid contraceptives were recruited to complete questionnaires about their menstrual cycle and to provide blood samples for measurement of a range of reproductive endocrine and metabolic hormone levels. Eighty women participated in completing the questionnaires and 72 of them provided blood samples.

- **Results**: Fifty-two of the 80 women (65%) reported menstrual abnormalities, 40 of which (50%) reported one or more menstrual abnormalities that preceded the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Fifteen women (38%) reported developing menstrual abnormalities since treatment for bipolar disorder, 14 of which developed abnormalities since treatment with valproate (p = 0.04). Of the 15 patients reporting menstrual abnormalities since starting medication, 12 (80%) reported changes in menstrual flow (heavy or prolonged bleeding) and five (33%) reported changes in cycle frequency. No significant differences were observed between women receiving or not receiving valproate in mean levels of free or total serum testosterone levels. This was true for the total sample and for the sub-group without preexisting menstrual problems. However, within the valproate group, the duration of use was significantly correlated with free testosterone levels (r = 0.33, p = 0.02). Three of the 50 women (6%) taking VPA, and 0% of the 22 taking other antimanic medications…

### The reproductive safety profile of mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and broad-spectrum psychotropics [^112ajmGR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

There has been growing concern about the potential iatrogenic effects of several newer psychotropic drugs on reproductive health safety in women. Areas of particular concern in this regard include (1) controversies about a potential association between the use of valproate and the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), (2) the safety of use of newer psychotropic medications during pregnancy, and (3) safety issues with these medications in women while breastfeeding. This review summarizes information about each of these areas.

In particular, existing data suggest that (1) PCOS very likely represents a complex neuroendocrine disorder with multiple determinants; (2) menstrual irregularities may be a frequently seen phenomenon in women with bipolar illness, at least partially independent of psychotropic drug therapy; (3) potential central nervous system teratogenicity remains substantial during first-trimester exposure to valproate or carbamazepine; (4) with newer agents used for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, safety data during pregnancy, while not definitive, are most abundant with olanzapine and lamotrigine, though relatively less is known about systematic pregnancy outcomes with other atypical antipsychotics or newer anticonvulsants; and (5) risks for neonatal safety during lactation continue to appear substantial with lithium, are of potential concern with lamotrigine and clozapine, are quite likely minimal with valproate or carbamazepine, and are indeterminate with most other new anticonvulsants or atypical antipsychotics. Recommendations are presented.

### The consequences of valproate exposure in utero [^116PePW9]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The consequences of valproate exposure in utero have been extensively studied. Research indicates significant risks associated with prenatal exposure to valproate, including an increased likelihood of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders. The study by Tomson et al. highlights the importance of evaluating the potential benefits and risks of valproate use during pregnancy. These findings underscore the need for healthcare providers to actively engage in informed decision-making and patient education when prescribing valproate to women of childbearing age.

### Animal models to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1143J45S]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

In this regard, women receiving valproic acid, an anti-epileptic medication that increases central GABA levels, develop PCOS-like symptoms, and women with PCOS exhibit increased cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of GABA. These clinical correlates further support the notion that PNA programs LH hypersecretion in over 75% of women with PCOS by increasing GnRH neuron depolarization through increased GnRH and KNDy neuronal expression of GABA A receptor–regulated chloride ion transporters. Such novel appreciation of GABA neuronal regulation of GnRH neurons reveals a potential neural therapeutic target for women with PCOS. Recently, acute activation of GABA neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the female mice hypothalamus with opto- or pharmacogenetics was shown to elicit a long-lasting increase in LH secretion, while chronic activation was found to disrupt reproductive cycling and promote elevation of T levels, a functional induction of PCOS-like reproductive traits resembling those in PNA models.

- **Clozapine**: In psychotic patients (n = 11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with clozapine.

- **Lithium**: Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male volunteers (n = 16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium.

- **Lorazepam**: Concomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male volunteers (n = 9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.

- **Olanzapine**: No dose adjustment for olanzapine is necessary when olanzapine is administered concomitantly with valproate. Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n = 10) caused a 15% reduction in Cmax and a 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.

- **Oral contraceptive steroids**: Administration of a single-dose of ethinyl estradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.

### Longitudinal evaluation of reproductive function in women treated for bipolar disorder [^115Cbgsc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

We assessed reproductive endocrine and metabolic markers in women treated for bipolar disorder over a 2-year time period, controlling for valproate use.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five women ages 18–45 with bipolar disorder underwent longitudinal evaluations. Subjects completed a reproductive health questionnaire and endocrinological exam at baseline. Total and free testosterone, progesterone, LH, FSH, fasting insulin and glucose, and other hormones were measured across the menstrual cycle at baseline and at a 2-year follow-up.

- **Results**: Ten subjects were currently receiving valproate as a mood stabilizing agent; of the remaining subjects, six received lithium, and five received atypical antipsychotics. Of all subjects, 41.7% reported oligomenorrhea, while 40% reported oligomenorrhea before starting medication. Rates of oligomenorrhea and clinical hyperandrogenism did not differ by medication use. Eighty percent of women had a high homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at baseline; all other measures were normal. Over time, all subjects exhibited a significant decrease in luteal phase progesterone and increase in free testosterone concentrations. Valproate use was associated with an increase over time in total testosterone. Baseline values and changes in BMI were similar across groups.

- **Limitations**: Limitations include small sample size and the absence of a control group.

- **Conclusion**: We confirm our previous observations of high rates of menstrual abnormalities, hyperandrogenemia, and insulin resistance in women with bipolar disorder.

### Antiepileptic drugs and hormonal contraceptives in adolescent women with epilepsy [^113i4bP6]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Both estrogen and progesterone influence seizure activity in women with epilepsy, with estrogen generally demonstrating proconvulsant and progesterone anticonvulsant effects. Women with epilepsy exhibit a variety of endocrine disturbances, probably due to a combination of factors, including the epilepsy syndrome and the effect of interictal and ictal epileptic discharges in the brain. The direct effects of some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) further increase this risk, apparently related to a specific drug's effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes of the cytochrome P-450 system. AEDs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes also interact with hormonal contraception to increase estrogen's metabolism and progesterone's protein binding, decreasing concentrations of both hormones and thus reducing contraceptive efficacy.

Some evidence indicates that concurrent use of hormonal contraceptives and lamotrigine significantly decreases the plasma concentration of lamotrigine, suggesting that close monitoring is warranted. Nevertheless, hormonal contraception confers comparable or superior efficacy compared with such other contraceptives as the intrauterine device and barrier methods and remains an appropriate option in women with epilepsy. Importantly, concurrent use of hormonal contraception and AEDs does not adversely affect seizure control. Careful patient management, including the use of increased estrogen doses (≥ 50 micrograms) in patients receiving enzyme-inducing AEDs, may further minimize the risk for unintended pregnancy. Special considerations in women of childbearing age include detailed management strategies for effective contraception when using AEDs.

### Management of epilepsy in women [^112MZwyj]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in women worldwide. Hormonal changes occurring throughout a woman's life can influence and be influenced by seizure mechanisms and antiepileptic drugs, presenting unique management challenges. Effective contraception is particularly important for women with epilepsy of childbearing potential because of antiepileptic drug-related teratogenicity and hormonal interactions; although studies reveal many women do not receive contraceptive and preconceptual counselling. Management challenges in this population include the higher risk of pregnancy complications and peripartum psychiatric problems than in women without epilepsy.

Research is needed to clarify the precise role of folic acid supplementation in the prevention of congenital malformations in children born to women with epilepsy. To optimize the treatment of low bone density in women with epilepsy, studies investigating bone densitometry frequency and calcium and vitamin D supplements are required. Understanding the mechanisms linking seizures and menopause will help to develop effective therapeutic strategies, and advances in managing epilepsy could improve quality of life for women with this condition.

### Depakoteer [^111avZuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Carbapenem antibiotics**: A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

- **Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives**: Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen-containing products.

- **Felbamate**: A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

- **Methotrexate**: Methotrexate may decrease serum valproate levels and potentially result in increased frequency of seizures.

### Reproductive dysfunction in women with epilepsy [^117Pfo1K]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Reproductive endocrine disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothalamic amenorrhea, premature menopause, and hyperprolactinemia, are reported to be more common in women with epilepsy than in the general female population. Epilepsy itself may affect reproductive endocrine function. For example, the prevalence of PCOS appears to be high even among women with epilepsy who do not take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, AEDs also induce various changes in endocrine function. The hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs phenytoin and carbamazepine (CBZ) have been shown to increase serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which in turn leads to a diminished estradiol:SHBG ratio and decreased bioactivity of estradiol. This may result in menstrual disorders in some women receiving long-term CBZ treatment. Additionally, enzyme-inducing AEDs can reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

In women with epilepsy who are treated with valproate (VPA), especially those who gain weight during treatment, polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, and menstrual disorders appear to be common. After initiating VPA therapy in a woman with epilepsy, both the length of the menstrual cycles and body weight should be monitored. Transvaginal ultrasonography of the ovaries is indicated if the menstrual cycles are prolonged and serum testosterone levels are elevated, particularly if there is associated weight gain. The endocrine effects of the new AEDs have not been widely studied. However, treatment with these agents should be considered in women who develop reproductive endocrine issues.

### Depakoteer [^113cD5yz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g. craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population [see use in specific populations (8.1)].

- **Structural birth defects**: Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n = 62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C. I. 94–101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C. I. 105–110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C. I. 102–108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C. I. 104–112]).

### DepakoteER [^111JRN2o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy exposure registry**: There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote ER, during pregnancy. Women taking Depakote ER during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1–888–233–2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This enrollment must be initiated by the patient herself.

- **Risk summary**: For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)]. For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia, posing a threat to life.

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects such as spina bifida, as well as malformations involving other body systems, including craniofacial defects (such as oral clefts), cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and limb malformations. This risk is dose-dependent.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^114UGi7M]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Sperm and semen quality, morphology, and quantity fluctuate significantly in all males and are affected by mood, stress, season, age, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors, including alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, exercise, and even choice of underwear, in males both with and without epilepsy.

There are reports of abnormalities in semen analysis, such as lower sperm count and motility, and dysmorphic sperm in men with epilepsy before starting ASMs. Similar findings are seen in men prescribed carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam (Grade B & C). Lamotrigine has the least reported impact on spermatogenesis, with little data on the newer ASMs.

There is Grades B–D evidence of abnormalities in sperm count, morphology, and motility in men taking valproate. Reduced testicular volume and sperm abnormalities were reported in 27 men treated with valproate compared to 41 controls, with similar findings in another study of 25 men. A case study, without controls or pre-treatment values, found a reversible reduction in sperm count in a man taking valproate.

Oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and lamotrigine had no significant effect on sexual function and sex hormones in a study of 38 men. In fact, oxcarbazepine improved sperm motility and survival rate. In 26 men taking levetiracetam, the total sperm count, percentage of normal morphology, and functional sperm count tested after treatment were significantly lower compared with pre-treatment values (p < 0.05), but there were no effects on hormone levels. There is little data on the newest ASMs.

### Valproic acid in women and girls of childbearing age [^114XHwnf]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate recent literature on valproic acid (VPA) in women and girls of childbearing age and to emphasize new findings.

Recent research confirms VPA's teratogenicity and risk of hormone disruption. VPA exposure in utero increases the risk for a variety of major congenital malformations (MCMs), reduced IQ, and behavioral problems. In girls and women, VPA increases the risk of hormone abnormalities, obesity, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Despite guidelines recommending caution, VPA continues to be prescribed to reproductive-aged women and girls. Despite significant and well-documented risks, adherence to guidelines in VPA use in reproductive-aged girls and women remains low.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^115x7wnv]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews estimate that 22% of people with intellectual disability (ID) have epilepsy, and the prevalence rises with the increasing severity of ID. Two-thirds of the population with ID and epilepsy are treatment-resistant. Only 5% of research in epilepsy focuses on ID, and many clinical trials in epilepsy exclude people with ID. People with ID and epilepsy have significantly higher multi-morbidity, polypharmacy, and higher rates of premature mortality than their peers with epilepsy or intellectual disability. Further, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and epilepsy-related harm are considered to be of higher risk in this population. A third of people with ID and epilepsy suffer psychiatric comorbidities.

A Cochrane review recommended using the same treatment paradigms for people with epilepsy and ID as for the general population; however, this is an area with a poor evidence base, especially given the other issues. An expert consensus study suggested that valproate should be considered as a first-line drug in men with ID. Valproate is often a good choice given its additional mood-stabilizing effects, and particularly in those with autism, thus reducing polypharmacy. It has been shown to be the most prescribed antiseizure medication (ASM) in international comparison studies. Valproate remains a first-line drug for generalized seizures, and people with ID and a number of genetic syndromes are specifically responsive to it. Since valproate is a mainstay of treatment in this population, excluding it as a treatment option puts many vulnerable individuals at significant risk of harm.

### Special considerations in treating bipolar disorder in women [^115bdzEF]. Bipolar Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

There are notable gaps in research regarding issues specific to women with bipolar disorder. These include gender differences and their implications for management, the impact of the reproductive cycle, and evidence-based treatment guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period. Although no gender differences have been reported for the prevalence of bipolar disorder, women are more likely to experience rapid cycling, mixed mania, and antidepressant-induced manias. This may affect response to treatment, which has been found, in some cases, to differ between men and women.

Furthermore, side effects in response to treatments may vary between genders, particularly concerning lithium and valproate prescriptions. The course of bipolar disorder in women can be influenced by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause, yet many issues still require further clarification. Treating bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postmenopausal period demands careful consideration, as does treatment during the childbearing years. Some mood stabilizers can affect the metabolism of oral contraceptives, adding complexity to treatment choices.

This review article evaluates existing literature on women with bipolar disorder comprehensively and critically to consolidate gender-specific aspects of the disorder that may have treatment implications for women.

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: What are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach [^115B7wrC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

There is a wide variety of evidence-based tools to support shared decision-making during the clinical encounter, and some of these have been trialed successfully in specific diseases. For example, the talk model, developed by Elwyn et al, improves treatment concordance and decision quality in epilepsy management, specifically for situations like pregnancy and medication withdrawal. The model involves three kinds of talk:

- **Team talk**: The patient is encouraged to consider different management strategies (e.g. valproate vs. levetiracetam for epilepsy).
- **Option talk**: More detailed information about the options is provided, typically using an 'option grid' – a matrix structured around questions the patient might ask, covering all potential options for a particular set of circumstances.
- **Decision talk**: The clinician assists the patient with decisions by providing facts, figures, and risks.

The talk model maps well to questions around valproate use in women who are pregnant (or planning on becoming pregnant). The clinician should firstly present the different management options. These would include: (1) continuing the drug at the current dose, (2) titrating down to a lower dose, (3) discontinuing the drug, or (4) changing to a different medication. To support more detailed conversations, a matrix of options could be offered.

### Menstrual abnormalities and polycystic ovary syndrome in women taking valproate for bipolar mood disorder [^112zPE8Q]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Valproate treatment has been associated with high rates of menstrual abnormalities, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries in women with epilepsy. This pilot study investigated whether valproate treatment had the same associations in women with bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: One hundred forty outpatient women with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder (aged 15–45 years) were surveyed on their medical, psychiatric, and reproductive health history. Thirty-two women met entry criteria for the study and were divided into two groups: (1) those currently receiving valproate (valproate, N = 17) and (2) those who were not currently taking valproate (nonvalproate, N = 15). These two groups were compared with a normal (never diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder) control group of 22 women. Women in the valproate group with menstrual problems (N = 7) underwent further assessment for the presence of polycystic ovaries and hyperandrogenism.

- **Results**: The age at onset of menses, mean length of menstrual cycle, and mean length of menses were not significantly different between the groups. Significantly more women reported menstrual abnormalities in the valproate group (47%) than women not receiving valproate (13%) and controls (0%). Forty-one percent of women with bipolar disorder taking valproate had polycystic ovary syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest high rates of menstrual disturbances and polycystic ovary syndrome in women with bipolar disorder currently receiving valproate.
