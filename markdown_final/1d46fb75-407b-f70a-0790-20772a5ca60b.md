## Question

Augmentin for pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) for pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with community-acquired pneumonia versus other etiologies. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed indications and dosing by patient population and severity. Next, I will examine the microbiologic rationale and resistance considerations, including pneumococcal MIC thresholds. After that, I should review efficacy data and safety/tolerability, including renal dosing and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note special scenarios and limitations where Augmentin may not be appropriate or where alternatives are preferred.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Augmentin is primarily used for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children, and its role differs by patient characteristics, severity, and local resistance patterns; it is not indicated for viral pneumonia or noninfectious infiltrates, so I need to ensure we are treating suspected or confirmed bacterial CAP before proceeding [^0ac7408f] [^f7279f2f].

> Next, I should review adult outpatient CAP without comorbidities. Wait, let me verify the first-line options here. Guidelines recommend amoxicillin monotherapy, doxycycline, or a macrolide if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is low; Augmentin is not first-line in this scenario because the added clavulanate is unnecessary for typical CAP pathogens in otherwise healthy adults, and using broader spectrum risks resistance and adverse effects without added benefit [^688d8fef] [^0ac7408f].

> Now, for adult outpatients with comorbidities, I need to check the recommended regimens. Guidelines endorse combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone; Augmentin is an appropriate beta-lactam choice in this context, with options including 500/125 mg three times daily, 875/125 mg twice daily, or the pharmacokinetically enhanced 2000/125 mg twice daily formulation, typically for 7–10 days depending on clinical response and severity [^f68083c3] [^0ac7408f] [^a040b298].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for choosing Augmentin over amoxicillin alone in comorbid patients. The concern is broader pathogen coverage, including beta-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and potentially methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; the clavulanate component mitigates beta-lactamase–mediated resistance, which is more relevant in patients with chronic lung disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia [^526808ca] [^d52d6a9c].

> I will now examine adult inpatient CAP. For hospitalized patients, standard initial therapy is a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone; Augmentin can be used as the beta-lactam component when oral therapy is appropriate or when IV therapy is not required, but many inpatients require IV agents such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam, with step-down to oral Augmentin once stable and if indicated by culture and susceptibility [^0ac7408f] [^f7279f2f].

> Let me consider pediatric CAP. For children, first-line therapy is amoxicillin; Augmentin is reserved for specific contexts such as severe disease, treatment failure, or when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected, and even then, evidence supports that adding clavulanate may not improve outcomes over optimized amoxicillin in many cases; WHO and BTS emphasize amoxicillin as standard, with Augmentin as an alternative when clinically justified [^f5626081] [^e289de9d] [^b6bde9c4].

> I should double-check the pharmacokinetic rationale for the 2000/125 mg XR formulation. This formulation was designed to achieve a time above MIC of roughly 35–40% of the dosing interval against pneumococci with elevated MICs, improving activity against penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; clinical and modeling data suggest high success against PRSP, though it is not active against pneumococci with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL, so I need to ensure susceptibility or use alternative therapy in high-level resistance [^bc68eef8] [^6a063599] [^8d74ec9d].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and headache; clavulanate is associated with increased risk of hepatotoxicity and C. difficile, so I need to weigh these risks, especially in older adults or those with hepatic disease; Augmentin XR is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), and dose adjustments are needed for standard formulations in significant renal dysfunction [^c68943fe] [^bac8957c] [^86e20cbf] [^56f1c59f] [^cefcd90a].

> But wait, what if the pneumonia is aspiration-related or there is concern for anaerobes. I initially thought Augmentin would be ideal for aspiration pneumonia because of anaerobic coverage; let me verify that. While Augmentin has some anaerobic activity, guidelines and labeling do not position it as a preferred agent for aspiration pneumonia; if anaerobes are a concern, agents with stronger anaerobic coverage or broader spectrum may be chosen based on severity and setting, so I should not overstate Augmentin's role here [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and limitations. In pregnancy, amoxicillin/clavulanate is generally considered safe when indicated, though penicillin allergy must be screened and hepatic monitoring considered; in pediatrics, avoid Augmentin in children under 3 months or when amoxicillin alone suffices; in older adults, monitor renal function and consider lower clavulanate exposure when possible to mitigate adverse effects [^10b2dffa] [^bac8957c] [^f858e61a].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For adults with CAP and comorbidities, use Augmentin 875/125 mg twice daily or 2000/125 mg twice daily for 7–10 days, combined with a macrolide or doxycycline, or choose a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy if beta-lactam allergy or intolerance; for adults without comorbidities, prefer amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide rather than Augmentin; for children, start with amoxicillin and reserve Augmentin for severe disease, treatment failure, or suspected beta-lactamase producers; always tailor to local resistance and culture results when available [^f68083c3] [^0ac7408f] [^f5626081].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats. Augmentin does not cover atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma or Legionella, so add a macrolide or doxycycline when atypicals are suspected; it is not active against high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococci with MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL; and indiscriminate use promotes resistance and adverse effects, so I need to ensure the indication is strong and reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or switch if not improving [^0ac7408f] [^8d74ec9d] [^86e20cbf].

Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is a **first-line option** for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults with comorbidities or when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected, with typical dosing of 875/125 mg twice daily or 2,000/125 mg twice daily for 7–10 days [^f68083c3] [^a040b298]. It is **not recommended for severe CAP** or when MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected, where broader regimens are needed [^0ac7408f]. In children, amoxicillin is first-line; Augmentin is reserved for severe disease or treatment failure [^e289de9d] [^f5626081]. Common adverse effects include diarrhea and nausea; monitor for hypersensitivity and hepatic effects [^c68943fe] [^7136501b].

---

## Indications and guidelines

### Adult patients

- **Outpatient CAP with comorbidities**: Augmentin is recommended for adults with chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia [^f68083c3] [^0a447dfe].

- **Combination therapy**: Often paired with a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) or doxycycline to cover atypical pathogens [^f68083c3] [^0a447dfe].

- **Not recommended**: For severe CAP, MRSA, or Pseudomonas risk, where broader regimens are required [^0ac7408f].

---

### Pediatric patients

In children, **amoxicillin is first-line** for CAP; Augmentin is reserved for severe disease, treatment failure, or suspected beta-lactamase producers [^e289de9d] [^f5626081].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Patient population** | **Standard dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults (outpatient) | 875/125 mg PO BID or 2,000/125 mg PO BID | 7–10 days [^a040b298] |
| Children (severe CAP or treatment failure) | 90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin component divided BID | 7–10 days |

---

## Clinical efficacy

Augmentin demonstrates **high clinical success** in CAP, including cases due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with success rates of 86–95% in clinical trials [^590badde] [^6a063599]. Pharmacokinetically enhanced formulations (2,000/125 mg BID) improve time above MIC, supporting efficacy against resistant pneumococci [^bc68eef8] [^5d8d515c].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [^c68943fe].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare hypersensitivity, hepatic dysfunction, and Clostridioides difficile infection [^7136501b] [^86e20cbf].

- **Contraindications**: History of severe hypersensitivity to penicillins, previous cholestatic jaundice with amoxicillin/clavulanate, or severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^bac8957c] [^4e451446].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Augmentin is **comparable to cefditoren** and other beta-lactams for CAP cure rates, with similar tolerability profiles [^81eef94b]. Compared with amoxicillin alone, Augmentin offers broader coverage but more gastrointestinal adverse effects; reserve it for appropriate indications to limit resistance [^a5911b57] [^538f9ada].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment is required in significant renal dysfunction [^56f1c59f] [^cefcd90a].

- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered safe, but use only if clearly needed [^10b2dffa].

- **Pediatric use**: Avoid in children < 3 months; safety and efficacy not established [^097154f0].

---

Augmentin is a **key agent for CAP** in adults with comorbidities or when beta-lactamase producers are suspected, with strong efficacy and acceptable safety when used appropriately. It is not for severe CAP or MRSA/Pseudomonas risk, and pediatric use is selective.

Safety

In 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies, AUGMENTIN XR 
(2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours, n = 577) was compared to AUGMENTIN 
(875 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours, n = 570), administered for 7 days for the 
treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Adverse events, regardless of 
relationship to test drug, were reported by 44.4% of patients who received 
AUGMENTIN XR (versus 46.3% in comparator group). Treatment-related adverse 
events were reported in 21.7% of patients who received AUGMENTIN XR (versus 
21.2% in comparator group); most were mild and transient in nature. Adverse 
events which led to withdrawal were reported by 2.8% of patients who received 
AUGMENTIN XR (versus 5.3% in comparator group). In each group, the most 
frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea (14.4% versus 13.0%, p = 0.47), 
nausea (3.5 % versus 4.4%), and headache (3.5% versus 3.2%). Only 2 patients 
(0.3%) who received AUGMENTIN XR and 3 patients (0.5%) in the comparator group 
withdrew due to diarrhea. Serious adverse events considered suspected or 
probably related to test drug were reported in 0.3% of patients (versus 0.5% in 
comparator).

Community-Acquired Pneumonia

Four randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies and 
one non-comparative study were conducted in adults with community-acquired 
pneumonia (CAP). In comparative studies, 904 patients received AUGMENTIN XR at a 
dose of 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 or 10 days. In the 
non-comparative study to assess both clinical and bacteriological efficacy, 
1,122 patients received AUGMENTIN XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 
7 days. In the 4 comparative studies, the combined clinical success rate at test 
of cure ranged from 86.3% to 94.7% in clinically evaluable patients who received 
AUGMENTIN XR; in the non-comparative study, the clinical success rate was 
85.6%.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for the 
treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial 
sinusitis due to confirmed, or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e., H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H. 
parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or 
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin 
(i.e., penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). AUGMENTIN XR is not indicated for the 
treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with 
penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see 
CLINICAL STUDIES).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant 
pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other 
common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g., alcoholism, 
immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were 
not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom 
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected, 
bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms 
and their susceptibility when AUGMENTIN XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a 
penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a 
β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another AUGMENTIN®(amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower 
daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e., 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12 
hours). Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the 
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN XR and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN XR should 
be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly 
suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility 
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying 
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and 
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibacterial with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam, structurally related to penicillin, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug resistance .

The clavulanic acid component of AUGMENTIN ES-600 protects amoxicillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, AUGMENTIN ES-600 possesses the distinctive properties of a broad spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)] .

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including isolates with penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL)

Gram-Negative bacteria:

Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. However, the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Staphylococci which are resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Streptococcus pyogenes

S. pyogenes do not produce beta-lactamase, and therefore, are susceptible to amoxicillin alone. Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have established the effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical infections due to S. pyogenes.

Susceptibility Test Methods:

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^526808ca]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by 
susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed 
below:

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M. 
catarrhalis .

Otitis Media

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M. 
catarrhalis .

Sinusitis

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of H. influenzae and M. 
catarrhalis .

Skin and Skin Structure Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp.

Urinary Tract Infections

− caused by β-lactamase−producing strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp.

While AUGMENTIN is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections 
caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with 
AUGMENTIN due to its amoxicillin content; therefore, mixed infections caused by 
ampicillin-susceptible organisms and β-lactamase−producing organisms susceptible 
to AUGMENTIN should not require the addition of another antibiotic. Because 
amoxicillin has greater in vitro activity against S. 
pneumoniae than does ampicillin or penicillin, the majority of S. pneumoniae strains with intermediate susceptibility to 
ampicillin or penicillin are fully susceptible to amoxicillin and AUGMENTIN. 
(See Microbiology.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the 
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN should be 
used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected 
to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility 
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying 
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and 
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Bacteriological studies, to determine the causative organisms and their 
susceptibility to AUGMENTIN, should be performed together with any indicated 
surgical procedures.

Susceptibility Testing

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial MICs. 
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial 
compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. 
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and 
standardized concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder.

The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant amoxicillin/clavulanate 
potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with varying amounts of amoxicillin. MICs 
are expressed in terms of the amoxicillin concentration in the presence of 
clavulanic acid at a constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid. The 
MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: 
RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANIC ACID SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING

For Gram-Negative Enteric Aerobes:

For Staphylococcus and Haemophilus species:

gStaphylococci which are susceptible to 
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be 
considered as resistant.

For S. pneumoniae from 
non-meningitis sources:

Isolates should be tested using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the following 
criteria should be used:

NOTE: These interpretive criteria are based on the 
recommended doses for respiratory tract infections.

A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be 
inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration 
usually achievable. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should 
be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to 
alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This 
category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is 
physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be 
used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small 
uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in 
interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the pathogen is not 
likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the 
concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

Table 5. Bacteriologic Eradication Rates in the Per Protocol Population

Clinical assessments were made in the per protocol population 2 to 4 days post-therapy and 15 to 18 days post-therapy. Patients who responded to therapy 2 to 4 days post-therapy were followed for 15 to 18 days post-therapy to assess them for acute otitis media. Non-responders at 2 to 4 days post-therapy were considered failures at the latter timepoint. The clinical assessments in the per protocol population are presented in Table 6.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, overall clinical outcomes at 2 to 4 days and 15 to 18 days post-treatment in patients with S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC equal to 2 mcg/mL and 4 mcg/mL were 29/41 (71%) and 17/41 (42%), respectively.

### In hospitalized patients with influenza and an infiltrate, adding clarithromycin and naproxen to oseltamivir improves outcomes (...) [^6f72b920]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question For patients with confirmed influenza and an infiltrate consistent with pneumonia, does adding clarithromycin and naproxen to oseltamivir improve outcomes. Bottom Line Adding clarithromycin and naproxen to oseltamivir significantly lowered all-cause mortality at 30 days and at 90 days. This study was limited by its open-label design. The outcome of mortality would not be subject to observer bias, though, and the groups were balanced. These findings are consistent with other studies of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia that concluded that adding a macrolide to amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin improves outcomes. . Synopsis These researchers recruited adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza A within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. All patients had an infiltrate on chest radiography, fever, and at least one typical symptom of influenza.

Of 334 patients screened for inclusion, 217 were randomized to receive oseltamivir, or oseltamivir plus clarithromycin and naproxen. The oseltamivir was given for five days, whereas the naproxen and clarithromycin were given for three days. Groups were balanced at baseline. All patients also received amoxicillin/clavulanate and esomeprazole. The mean age of patients was 80 years, and 57% were men. Approximately 50% were previously in good health, and despite extensive testing, only approximately 5% in each group had a bacterial coinfection. All-cause mortality was significantly lower at 30 days in the group who received clarithromycin and naproxen; it was also lower at 90 days.

The researchers hypothesized based on in vitro studies that naproxen and clarithromycin have antiviral properties, and they found that viral titers and the pneumonia severity index scores also declined faster in the combination therapy group.

Microbiology

Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum 
of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative 
microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by 
β-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include organisms 
which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam, structurally related 
to penicillin, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of 
β-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins 
and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically 
important plasmid-mediated β-lactamases frequently found responsible for 
transferred drug resistance.

The clavulanic acid component of AUGMENTIN XR protects amoxicillin from 
degradation by β-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic 
spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to 
amoxicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates 
of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as 
described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including 
isolates with penicillin MICs ≤ 2 mcg/mL)

Staphylococcus aureus (including 
β-lactamase−producing isolates)

NOTE : Staphylococci which are resistant to 
methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic 
acid.

NOTE: Susceptibility of S. 
pneumoniae should be determined using a 1-mcg oxacillin disk. Isolates 
with oxacillin zone sizes of ≥ 20 mm are susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate 
acid. An amoxicillin/clavulanate acid MIC should be determined on isolates of S. pneumoniae with oxacillin zone sizes of ≤ 
19 mm.

NOTE: β-lactamase−negative, ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates must be considered resistant 
to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

A report of S (“Susceptible”) indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to 
inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound in the blood 
reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of I (“Intermediate”) 
indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the 
microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible 
antimicrobials, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible 
clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically 
concentrated or in situations where high doses of antimicrobial can be used. 
This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled 
technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report 
of R (“Resistant”) indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit 
growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the 
concentration usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of quality 
control microorganisms to determine the performance of the test procedures.1,3,4Standard amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder should

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors:

- Antibacterial drug exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance [see Microbiology (12.4)] .

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms listed above.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Overview of newer antimicrobial formulations for overcoming pneumococcal resistance [^03b20586]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of an antimicrobial agent provides important information that can be used to maximize bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, minimize selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, and determine an optimal dosing regimen. Judicious selection of an antimicrobial based on local susceptibility data and PK and PD parameters is imperative in this era of increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactam antimicrobials display time-dependent bacterial killing with minimal to no persistent effects. Ketolides and fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent bacterial killing, and tetracyclines and macrolides display time-dependent killing. All have prolonged persistent effects (e.g., postantibiotic effect) that retard or prevent bacterial regrowth when free drug levels fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). New high-dose and/or extended-release formulations of traditional antimicrobials have been added to the current armamentarium for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These formulations include amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 90/6.4 mg/kg per day divided every 12 hours (Augmentin ES-600; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets 2 x 1,000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours (Augmentin XR; GlaxoSmithKline), clarithromycin extended-release tablets 2 x 500 mg once daily (Biaxin XL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and cefaclor extended-release tablets 375 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours (Ceclor CD; Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Of these agents, only amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets were designed to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci (penicillin MIC < or =2 microg/mL). Extended-release clarithromycin does not provide higher daily doses than its immediate-release counterpart; rather, it allows for once-daily dosing of this agent because of its slower absorption following oral administration. Extended-release cefaclor is considered clinically equivalent to 250 mg of immediate-release cefaclor pulvules administered 3 times daily; it cannot be used interchangeably with 500 mg 3-times-daily dosages of other cefaclor formulations. Thus, despite providing a similar or higher total daily dose than its immediate-release counterpart, extended-release cefaclor is indicated only for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanate for infections in infants and children: past, present and future [^c4974836]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical synthesis of the penicillin nucleus in the 1950s made introduction of a broad array of new and important antimicrobials, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, possible. Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended.

Animal Data

Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate. The amoxicillin doses in rodents (based on body surface area and assuming a 20 kg child) were approximately 2 times (rats) or equal to (mice) the recommended clinical AUGMENTIN ES-600 dose of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day. For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 15 times and 7.5 times the recommended daily dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from a published clinical lactation study report that amoxicillin is present in human milk. There are reports of diarrhea, irritability, and rash in infants exposed to amoxicillin and clavulanate through breast milk; therefore, infants exposed to AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be monitored for these symptoms. There are no data on the effects of amoxicillin and clavulanate on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for AUGMENTIN ES-600 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AUGMENTIN ES-600 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Acute Otitis Media

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg, for the treatment of acute otitis media, and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling.

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of Augmentin ES-600 have not been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing more than 40 kg.

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established for the treatment of pediatric patients (3 months to 12 years of age) with acute bacterial sinusitis. This use is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of AUGMENTIN XRTM Extended Release Tablets in adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, studies of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients with acute otitis media, and by similar pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate in pediatric patients taking AUGMENTIN ES-600 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] and adults taking AUGMENTIN XR.

### Effectiveness of amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium in the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in children [^98137208]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of antibiotic therapy in managing acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) in children is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of high-dose amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate in the treatment of children diagnosed with ABS.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Children 1 to 10 years of age with a clinical presentation compatible with ABS were eligible for participation. Patients were stratified according to age (<6 or >or=6 years) and clinical severity and randomly assigned to receive either amoxicillin (90 mg/kg) with potassium clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg) or placebo. A symptom survey was performed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30. Patients were examined on day 14. Children's conditions were rated as cured, improved, or failed according to scoring rules.

Results

Two thousand one hundred thirty-five children with respiratory complaints were screened for enrollment; 139 (6.5%) had ABS. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, and 56 were randomly assigned. The mean age was 66 +/- 30 months. Fifty (89%) patients presented with persistent symptoms, and 6 (11%) presented with nonpersistent symptoms. In 24 (43%) children, the illness was classified as mild, whereas in the remaining 32 (57%) children it was severe. Of the 28 children who received the antibiotic, 14 (50%) were cured, 4 (14%) were improved, 4 (14%) experienced treatment failure, and 6 (21%) withdrew. Of the 28 children who received placebo, 4 (14%) were cured, 5 (18%) improved, and 19 (68%) experienced treatment failure. Children receiving the antibiotic were more likely to be cured (50% vs 14%) and less likely to have treatment failure (14% vs 68%) than children receiving the placebo.

Conclusions

ABS is a common complication of viral upper respiratory infections. Amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate results in significantly more cures and fewer failures than placebo, according to parental report of time to resolution of clinical symptoms.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies were conducted in pediatric patients with acute otitis media. A non-comparative, open-label study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of AUGMENTIN ES-600 (90/6.4 mg/kg/day, divided every 12 hours) for 10 days in 521 pediatric patients (3 to 50 months) with acute otitis media. The primary objective was to assess bacteriological response in children with acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs of 4 mcg/mL. The study sought the enrollment of patients with the following risk factors: Failure of antibacterial therapy for acute otitis media in the previous 3 months, history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media, 2 years or younger, or daycare attendance. Prior to receiving AUGMENTIN ES-600, all patients had tympanocentesis to obtain middle ear fluid for bacteriological evaluation. Patients from whom S. pneumoniae (alone or in combination with other bacteria) was isolated had a second tympanocentesis 4 to 6 days after the start of therapy. Clinical assessments were planned for all patients during treatment (4 to 6 days after starting therapy), as well as 2 to 4 days post-treatment and 15 to 18 days post-treatment. Bacteriological success was defined as the absence of the pretreatment pathogen from the on-therapy tympanocentesis specimen. Clinical success was defined as improvement or resolution of signs and symptoms. Clinical failure was defined as lack of improvement or worsening of signs and/or symptoms at any time following at least 72 hours of AUGMENTIN ES-600; patients who received an additional systemic antibacterial drug for otitis media after 3 days of therapy were considered clinical failures. Bacteriological eradication on therapy (day 4 to 6 visit) in the per protocol population is summarized in Table 5.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^20d5fca0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Building in efficacy: developing solutions to combat drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^bc68eef8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The development of our understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine antimicrobial efficacy has advanced substantially over the last 10 years. We are now in a position to use PK/PD principles to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation so that we can predict eradication of specific pathogens or resistant variants when agents are used clinically. Optimisation of PK/PD parameters to enable the treatment of resistant pathogens with oral agents may not be possible with many current agents, such as some cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Aminopenicillins, however, such as amoxicillin, have linear PK and have a good safety profile even at high doses. The new pharmacokinetically enhanced oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate, 2000/125 mg twice daily, was designed using PK/PD principles to be able to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of up to and including 4 mg/L, which includes most penicillin-resistant isolates. For amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC (T > MIC) of 35-40% of the dosing interval (based on blood levels) is predictive of high bacteriological efficacy. This target was met by the design of a unique bilayer tablet incorporating 437.5 mg of sustained-release sodium amoxicillin in one layer plus 562.5 mg of immediate-release amoxicillin trihydrate and 62.5 mg of clavulanate potassium in the second layer, with two tablets administered for each dose. This unique design extends the bacterial killing time by increasing the T > MIC to 49% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 4 mg/L, and 60% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 2 mg/L. Based on these results, this new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation should be highly effective in treating respiratory tract infections due to drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^b6bde9c4]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n=410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n=404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n=413) or a longer duration (7 days; n=401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P=.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P=.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P=.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction=.18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction=.73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^10b2dffa]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in pregnant 
rats and mice given AUGMENTIN at oral doses up to 1,200 mg/kg/day revealed no 
evidence of harm to the fetus due to AUGMENTIN. In terms of body surface area, 
the doses in rats were 1.6 times the maximum human oral dose of amoxicillin and 
13 times the maximum human dose for clavulanate. For mice, these doses were 0.9 
and 7.4 times the maximum human oral dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate, 
respectively. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of 
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly 
needed.

Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are generally poorly absorbed 
during labor. Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration 
of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of 
contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the 
use of AUGMENTIN XR in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed 
adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the 
likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or 
resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. In a single study in women with 
premature rupture of fetal membranes, it was reported that prophylactic 
treatment with AUGMENTIN may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing 
enterocolitis in neonates.

### Performance in practice: bacteriological efficacy in patients with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^6a063599]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was designed to provide adequate levels of amoxicillin over the 12-h dosing interval to eradicate penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, penicillin MICs > or = 2 mg/L) with amoxicillin MICs of at least 4 mg/L. The clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was evaluated in patients with respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, including isolates with elevated penicillin (2-8 mg/L) MICs. Data from 10 clinical studies were combined: seven randomised (1:1), double-blind, controlled trials (efficacy intent-to-treat [ITT]N = 3376): amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily vs. levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS); levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB); clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily in AECB; amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily/three times daily and 1000/125 mg three times daily in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and three noncomparative studies (efficacy ITT N = 3024): two in ABS, one in CAP. The bacteriological per-protocol (PP) population at follow up (days 14-39) comprised 1295 patients for amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg and 241 for comparators. With amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg at follow-up, outcome was successful (clinical success and eradication/presumed eradication) in 85/90 (94.4%) patients with S. pneumoniae in comparative studies and 421/445 (94.6%) in noncomparative studies, and with comparators 58/70 (82.9%) were successes. In the amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg group at follow up, 52/552 S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin. At follow up, 50/52 (96.2%) patients with PRSP were successes, including 6/7 with amoxicillin MICs of 4 mg/L and 7/8 with amoxicillin MICs of 8 mg/L. Success rates for amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg against PRSP were similar for CAP (96.0%[24/25]), AECB (100%[3/3]) and ABS (95.8%[23/24]). There were six PRSP isolates in the comparator group (two isolates were from one patient), and three of five patients in this group were successes. In conclusion, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg demonstrated combined clinical/bacteriological success against 50/52 patients with PRSP, including 13/15 strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4-8 mg/L. These results for the pharmacokinetic-enhanced formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg are in line with the high efficacy against PRSP predicted using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.

### A comparison of cefditoren pivoxil and amoxicillin / clavulanate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study [^81eef94b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefditoren pivoxil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is approved for the treatment of pharyngitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and skin and skin-structure infections.

Objective

This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as a comparator because of its established efficacy and general acceptance as a standard of care in CAP.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group trial compared oral cefditoren 200 and 400 mg BID with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg BID for 14 days in adult outpatients with CAP.

Results

Eight hundred two patients (404 men, 398 women; mean age, 50 years; age range, 12-93 years) with CAP were enrolled. Comparable clinical cure rates were observed among evaluable patients in all treatment groups at both the posttreatment and follow-up visits: 88.0% (125/142) for cefditoren 200 mg, 89.9% (143/159) for cefditoren 400 mg, and 90.3% (130/144) for amoxicillin/clavulanate at the posttreatment visit, and 86.5% (128/148), 86.8% (138/159), and 87.8% (129/147) for the respective groups at the follow-up visit. Of 82 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated before treatment, 22 (26.8%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 12 (14.6%) of them penicillin resistant. Overall eradication rates at the posttreatment visit for pathogens isolated from microbiologically evaluable patients were 84.0%, 88.6%, and 82.6% for cefditoren 200 mg, cefditoren 400 mg, and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. In the respective treatment groups, 80.6%, 88.6%, and 88.0% of Haemophilus influenzae strains and 95.0%, 96.2%, and 89.5% of S pneumoniae strains were eradicated. The rates of resolution of or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were comparable between treatment groups. The treatment regimens were well tolerated, with 4.9%, 3.0%, and 5.2% of patients in the respective treatment groups requiring discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event.

Conclusions

In this study in adult outpatients with CAP, both doses of cefditoren demonstrated equivalence to amoxicillin/clavulanate based on rates of clinical and microbiologic cure. All 3 regimens were effective in resolving or improving the clinical signs and symptoms of CAP. Both cefditoren and amoxicillin/ clavulanate were well tolerated.

### Will reduction of antibiotic use reduce antibiotic resistance?: the pneumococcus paradigm [^a5911b57]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired respiratory infections in general, and those caused by S. pneumoniae in particular, are the main reason for prescribing antimicrobials in young children. Antibiotic drug abuse is common. This is the basis for the initiative for the reduction in antibiotic use. However, failure to consider that not all antibiotics are similar in their effect on promotion of resistance has led to continuous emerging resistance. In the present article, the trends in prescribing antibiotics in young children and their interrelation with antibiotic resistance among clinical respiratory isolates of S. pneumoniae in children will be reviewed, along with theoretical considerations and research evidence that led to concluding that among antibiotics, the least resistance-promoting drug for S. pneumoniae is amoxicillin (+/- clavulanate), whereas oral cephalosporins and azithromycin demonstrate a higher resistance-promotion potential in the individual population in the community. Although antibiotics differ in their resistant-promotion potential, all still do promote resistance.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^63f0c6d9]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations (AECOPD) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Key symptoms are breathlessness, increased sputum volume and purulence. The treatment involves the use of bronchodilators, oxygen treatment, systemic corticosteroids and often antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, shorten the course of the disease, prevent further deterioration of lung function, and prolong the period between exacerbations. A quick recovery and longer interval between hospitalizations are important, as both the patient's life and healthcare costs are influenced by the severity and the number of AECOPD. The largest and most recent meta-analysis on treatment of AECOPD concludes in line with earlier meta-analyses [,–], that for serious exacerbations (requiring hospital admission) there is moderate evidence that antibiotic treatment improves outcomes compared to placebo. For mild to moderate cases (outpatients), the conclusion is less clear, although it is observed, that the risk of treatment failure, defined as no resolution or deterioration of symptoms, is higher among patients who do not receive antibiotics. No effect was found regarding all-cause mortality or re-exacerbations within 2 to 6 weeks. The conclusion was based on pooled data from studies with different antibiotics, and where various doses were used. When using antibiotics, GOLD recommends that the choice is based on local resistance patterns. Today amoxicillin (AMX) 750 mg three times daily (TID) is recommended as first choice empirical treatment of AECOPD in Denmark in mild to moderate cases, however many clinicians prefer amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125 mg TID, as recommended in the previous guideline, referring to the fact that AMC is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis. A bacterial pathogen is believed to be accountable for around half of the deteriorations, where Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. AMX has a narrow spectrum of activity compared to AMC. Apart from Staphylococcus aureus and M. catarrhalis, most pathogens that cause community acquired pneumonia and AECOPD that are sensitive to AMC are also sensitive to AMX. The use of AMX instead of AMC in exacerbations in patients with severe COPD has not yet been investigated in a sufficiently large patient population and with clinically important endpoints like pneumonia hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcomes. On one hand, AMC has a broader spectrum of activity, and on the other hand, AMX is most often administered at a higher dose of amoxicillin (750 mg vs. 500 mg), which may increase the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for many pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, side effects may be more frequent when using AMC. The main analysis compares the risk of death or hospitalization due to pneumonia or AECOPD in the 30 days following a first AMX/AMC prescription.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^bfa54702]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people.In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons.,A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified,,,so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover ‘atypical’ infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ±a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP.Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR),more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections.Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP,none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.

### Proof of concept: performance testing in models [^5d8d515c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that predict antimicrobial efficacy can be used to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation. Although current formulations of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate have retained their efficacy against many, but not all, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, additional coverage is required to address the growing problem of drug-resistant strains. Accordingly, two new oral formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate, a paediatric formulation at 90/6.4 mg/kg/day and a pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation at 2000/125 mg twice daily for adults, were designed using PK/PD principles. These principles indicate that for amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC of 35-40% of the dosing interval is predictive of high bacterial efficacy. In line with PK/PD predictions, simulation of human pharmacokinetics in in-vitro kinetic models and in a rat model of pneumonia, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was highly effective against S. pneumoniae strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L. Against strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4 mg/L, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than the conventional 875/125 mg twice daily formulation, azithromycin and levofloxacin, even though all levofloxacin MICs were < or = 1 mg/L. Following infection with S. pneumoniae strains with amoxicillin MICs of 8 mg/L, the amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily formulation was more effective than the conventional amoxicillin/clavulanate formulations of 875/125 mg twice daily and three times daily and 1000/125 mg three times daily, and had similar or better efficacy than azithromycin and levofloxacin, depending on the strain. These data indicate the potential benefit of therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily compared with conventional formulations and other marketed antimicrobials in the treatment of respiratory tract infection.

### Are third-generation cephalosporins associated with a better prognosis than amoxicillin-clavulanate in patients hospitalized in the medical ward for community-onset pneumonia? [^5af005c6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to assess whether treatment with ceftriaxone/cefotaxime is associated with lower in-hospital mortality than amoxicillin-clavulanate in pati0ents hospitalized in medical wards for community-onset pneumonia.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective and multicentre study of patients hospitalized in French medical wards for community-onset pneumonia between 2002 and 2015. Treatments with ceftriaxone/cefotaxime or amoxicillin-clavulanate were defined by their start in the emergency department for a duration of 5 days or more with no other β-lactam. A logistic regression analysis was performed on the overall population, and a propensity score analysis was restricted to patients treated with either ceftriaxone/cefotaxime or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Results

1698 patients (median age, 80 y) were included, of which 716 and 198 were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxone/cefotaxime, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 10% (9-12%). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were treatment with ceftriaxone/cefotaxime (aOR 2.9; (1.4-5.7)), pneumonia severity index class 4 or 5 (aOR 7.8 (4.3-15.7)), do-not-resuscitate order (aOR 8.7 (5.2-14.6)) and fluid therapy (aOR 6.3 (2.5-15.1)). The propensity score analysis was performed on 178 patients treated with ceftriaxone/cefotaxime matched with 178 patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate; no significant association between treatment with ceftriaxone/cefotaxime and in-hospital mortality was found (OR 1.5 (0.7-3.0)).

Conclusion

In the largest study aiming to compare amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxone/cefotaxime in community-onset pneumonia, ceftriaxone/cefotaxime was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality than amoxicillin-clavulanate. Our results suggest that ceftriaxone/cefotaxime should not be preferred over amoxicillin-clavulanate for patients hospitalized in medical wards with community-onset pneumonia.

### Elements of design: the knowledge on which we build [^7391a3c4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The time the free drug serum concentration of antibiotic remains above the pathogen MIC (T > MIC) determines bacteriological efficacy and emergence or selection of resistance for penicillin and amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Multiple studies in animal and in-vitro models now support this conclusion. The size of the T > MIC (the pharmacokinetic/-dynamic target) is > 40-50% to maximise antibacterial effect and pathogen eradication for Streptococcus pneumoniae and probably also Haemophilus influenzae. The size of the T > MIC for optimal antibacterial effect is changed by host immune status but not by bacterial inoculum or mechanism of resistance. There is good animal evidence to support the prediction that, as long as the target T > MIC is achieved, strains of S. pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of 0.016 mg/L will respond to amoxicillin in the same way as those with MICs of 1-2 mg/L. Emergence of resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate in S. pneumoniae is related to low T > MIC (< 20%) and also to the degree of population heterogeneity to amoxicillin. Selection of resistant strains of S. pneumoniae is also related to T > MIC. Monte Carlo simulations based on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin with or without clavulanate in humans are needed to best predict the likely efficacy of different amoxicillin dosing regimens. This approach adequately allows the considerable pharmacokinetic variability in amoxicillin handling by infected patients to be accounted for as well as differences in pathogen beta-lactam susceptibility.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^4f45f774]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Standard dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy were cefazolin (100 mg/kg/day continuously after a loading dose of 2 g), amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2 g q 8 h), or third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone [2 g q 24 h] or cefotaxime [2 g q 8 h]). In the treatment period, patients who remained in ARC benefited from increased dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy (cefazolin 150 mg/kg/day, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2 g q 6 h, ceftriaxone 2 g q 12 h, or cefotaxime 2 g q 6 h). A 7-day course was considered sufficient unless inadequate initial antibiotic therapy, bacteremia, immunosuppressive disease, or MDR pathogen.

The overall treatment of patients with HAP-VAP during the control and treatment periods was similar except for the antimicrobial dosing regimens. There were no known significant changes to our ICU protocols, ventilation or weaning procedures, or patient population during the study period.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was a composite criterion defined as a poor clinical outcome of the antimicrobial therapy, including therapeutic failure and HAP-VAP recurrence within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization.
Therapeutic failure was defined as an impaired clinical response (persistent or worsening symptoms of HAP-VAP) with the need for escalating empirical antimicrobial therapy. Inappropriate empirical treatment was not considered as therapeutic failure. De-escalation did not qualify as therapeutic failure. Superinfections due to new causative pathogens with natural resistance to the initial antimicrobial therapy were not considered as therapeutic failure.
Recurrence was defined by a second HAP-VAP with at least one of the initial causative bacterial strains growing at a significant concentration from a second sample after completing antibiotic therapy. Tracheobronchial colonization without evidence of pulmonary infection was not considered as HAP-VAP recurrence.

The primary outcome was assessed by one of the investigators (GC) based on clinical and microbiologic data. External validation was performed independently by at least two other investigators (CC, NS) blinded to the allocated period and antibiotic dosing regimen.

The secondary endpoints were the reported antibiotic side effects during treatment (cholestasis, cytolysis, delirium, seizure, renal failure), the secondary acquisition of antimicrobial resistance within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the status (alive or dead) at discharge.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^5b35844c]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. The causal estimates produced depend on several assumptions, including that all determinants of treatment choice are included in the models. However despite using comprehensive EHR data, unmeasured confounding likely still exists: there may be unwritten/unrecorded factors that lead clinicians to use broad-spectrum antibiotics in more unwell patients, even when all measured factors are the same (potentially undermining model assumptions). Hence, our study provides clear support for a future randomised trial that could be used to address this concern more completely; however, investment in such a trial would need to be balanced against how likely unmeasured confounding sufficient to change study findings was, and how generalisable findings might be over time and to different locations.

Other limitations include using diagnostic codes to identify CAP, which may be imperfect, although findings were similar in the subset of patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia. Additionally, we did not account for the causative organism, since, in common with most CAP, most patients (94 %) lacked positive microbiology. This also precluded subgroup analyses by causative pathogens. In the subset of patients with positive blood cultures (3.1 %), S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae accounted for 76/298 (26 %) of infections, which would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin. However, as most patients did not have positive microbiology it is possible that beta-lactamase producing bacteria made up a smaller proportion of cases overall, which would be in keeping with our main findings suggesting amoxicillin was active in most cases. In settings with different bacterial species or resistance prevalence our findings may not generalise. As above, better diagnostics to reliably diagnose more of the infections that would not respond to amoxicillin, might help support wider use of narrow spectrum agents.

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^f858e61a]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are generally poorly absorbed 
during labor. Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration 
of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of 
contractions, and duration of contractions; however, it is not known whether the 
use of AUGMENTIN in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed 
adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the 
likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or 
resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. In a single study in women with 
premature rupture of fetal membranes, it was reported that prophylactic 
treatment with AUGMENTIN may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing 
enterocolitis in neonates.

Nursing Mothers

Ampicillin-class antibiotics are excreted in the milk; therefore, 
caution should be exercised when AUGMENTIN is administered to a nursing 
woman.

Pediatric Use

Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed 
according to the adult recommendations (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Pediatric 
Patients). Safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN Tablets in pediatric patients 
weighing less than 40 kg have not been established. (See prescribing information 
for AUGMENTIN Powder for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets.)

Geriatric Use

An analysis of clinical studies of AUGMENTIN was conducted to 
determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger 
subjects. Of the 3,119 patients in this analysis, 68% were <65 years old, 32% 
were > 65 years old and 14% were > 75 years old. This analysis and other reported 
clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the 
elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older 
individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk 
of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to 
monitor renal function.

### Randomized trial of amoxicillin for pneumonia in Pakistan [^9ae8f6ad]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The second issue relates to the criteria for pneumonia categorization. Though not powered for subgroup analyses, RETAPP raises several questions about targeted treatment. Temperature greater than or equal to 37.5°C, anemia and the presence of wheeze all significantly predicted TF. In the absence of these signs, allocation groups were comparable. Reported temperature, documented fever and wheeze at presentation have also been identified to be of prognostic importance in children with acute cough and respiratory infections in developed countries.

This suggests that, although potentially more complex to manage in the primary care setting, that with a change in criteria for non-severity, screening by predictor variables might be more cost effective. One issue which is now unequivocal is that the roll out of oxygen saturation testing at presentation will enhance the process. Debate continues as to whether point of care biomarker testing will augment triage.

The third issue relates to the intriguing difference in relapse rates. There were fewer TFs but greater relapse rates (3 % vs. 2 %) in the antibiotic group. What does this mean biologically? One explanation might be that it represents a subgroup of children with resistant bacterial infection who were treated or suppressed and then relapsed. Could these be the same children who would have been the TFs in the placebo group who simply presented earlier? Though hard to prove, this seems possible and represents an interesting philosophical balance/’trade off’. resistant bacterial infection who were treated or suppressed and then relapsed. Could these be the same children who would have been the TFs in the placebo group who simply presented earlier? Though hard to prove, this seems possible and represents an interesting philosophical balance/’trade off’.

### Amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care when pneumonia is not suspected: a 12-country, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^0bf8c9c0]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower-respiratory-tract infection is one of the most common acute illnesses managed in primary care. Few placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics have been done, and overall effectiveness (particularly in subgroups such as older people) is debated. We aimed to compare the benefits and harms of amoxicillin for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection with those of placebo both overall and in patients aged 60 years or older.

Methods

Patients older than 18 years with acute lower-respiratory-tract infections (cough of ≤28 days' duration) in whom pneumonia was not suspected were randomly assigned (1:1) to either amoxicillin (1 g three times daily for 7 days) or placebo by computer-generated random numbers. Our primary outcome was duration of symptoms rated "moderately bad" or worse. Secondary outcomes were symptom severity in days 2-4 and new or worsening symptoms. Investigators and patients were masked to treatment allocation. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2007-001586-15), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 4175), ISRCTN (52261229), and FWO (G.0274.08N).

Findings

1038 patients were assigned to the amoxicillin group and 1023 to the placebo group. Neither duration of symptoms rated "moderately bad" or worse (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.96-1.18; p=0.229) nor mean symptom severity (1.69 with placebo vs 1.62 with amoxicillin; difference -0.07 [95% CI -0.15 to 0.007]; p=0.074) differed significantly between groups. New or worsening symptoms were significantly less common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (162 [15.9%] of 1021 patients vs 194 [19.3%] of 1006; p=0.043; number needed to treat 30). Cases of nausea, rash, or diarrhoea were significantly more common in the amoxicillin group than in the placebo group (number needed to harm 21, 95% CI 11-174; p=0.025), and one case of anaphylaxis was noted with amoxicillin. Two patients in the placebo group and one in the amoxicillin group needed to be admitted to hospital; no study-related deaths were noted. We noted no evidence of selective benefit in patients aged 60 years or older (n=595).

Interpretation

When pneumonia is not suspected clinically, amoxicillin provides little benefit for acute lower-respiratory-tract infection in primary care both overall and in patients aged 60 years or more, and causes slight harms.

### Recommendations for treatment of childhood non-severe pneumonia [^f5626081]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been effective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3-5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48-72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the first-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable second-line agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an affordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^0ac7408f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient initial treatment—standard regimens are stratified by comorbidity and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa risk: for patients with no comorbidities or MRSA/P. aeruginosa risk factors, use “Amoxicillin or doxycycline or macrolide (if local pneumococcal resistance is <25%),” with dosing “Amoxicillin 1 g three times daily, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, azithromycin 500 mg on first day then 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, or clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily.” For patients with comorbidities—defined as “chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia”—use “Combination therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate or cephalosporin AND macrolide or doxycycline” with doses “Amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg three times daily, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily, 2,000 mg/125 mg twice daily, cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily, or cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily; AND azithromycin 500 mg on first day then 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily, or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily,” or “monotherapy with respiratory fluoroquinolone” at “Levofloxacin 750 mg daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily.” MRSA or P. aeruginosa risk factors are “prior respiratory isolation of MRSA or P. aeruginosa or recent hospitalization AND receipt of parenteral antibiotics (in the last 90 d).”

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^538f9ada]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In our secondary outcome analysis (all-cause hospitalization and non-pneumonia hospitalization) we observed aHR for AMX close to 1.0 (and thus not as low as for the primary outcome of pneumonia hospitalization or death), which argues that confounding by indication cannot explain our main results. Had this been the case, we would expect the aHR to be low for most of the unfavourable outcomes. Our analysis of need for additional antibiotics, pneumonia hospitalization or death showed an aHR of 1.2. It is important to keep in mind, that some of the new prescriptions being made is secondary to findings by cultivation and does not necessarily represent a clinical treatment failure. This is more likely to happen when treating with amoxicillin without beta-lactamase inhibitor. The result of this analysis should thereby be read with caution. When looking at death only, we see a broad CI (0.6–1.0) and few incidents, indicating that the combined endpoint pneumonia hospitalization or death is primarily driven by pneumonia.

Few studies compare the use of AMX instead of AMC in AECOPD, without also looking at other antibiotics at the same time in a small-spectred vs. broad-spectred analysis. We identified one article that directly compares AMX with AMC in AECOPD. It was conducted prospectively in 137 patients in an outpatient setting and did not find any difference in outcome (clinical cure assessed by a physical examination on day 10 and 30). The study population did not have as advanced COPD as in our population, and there was no information on hospitalization or death.

Overall we find no indication in our data, that treatment with AMX is inferior to AMC. There is a need to avoid the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to reduce the risk of selecting resistant strains and to cause least possible side effects and dysregulation in the patient´s microbiome. This study supports the use of AMX as first choice antibiotic treatment in non-hospitalized patients suffering from AECOPD.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0-59 days: a systematic review [^4c6d32e9]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTEXT

Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in young infants.

OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens to treat young infant pneumonia on critical clinical outcomes.

DATA SOURCES

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Registry of Trials.

STUDY SELECTION

We included randomized controlled trials of young infants aged 0 to 59 days with pneumonia (population) comparing the efficacy of antibiotic regimens (intervention) with alternate regimens or management (control) on clinical outcomes.

DATA EXTRACTION

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to assess certainty of evidence.

LIMITATIONS

Trials were heterogeneous, which precluded data pooling.

RESULTS

Of 2601 publications screened, 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Seven trials were hospital-based (n = 869) and 3 were nonhospital-based (n = 4329). No hospital-based trials evaluated WHO-recommended first-choice regimens. One trial found the WHO-recommended second-choice antibiotic, cefotaxime, to have similar rates of treatment success as non-WHO-recommended regimens of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (RR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82–1.10) or amoxicillin–clavulanate/cefotaxime (RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.86–1.12). Among 3 nonhospital-based trials comparing oral amoxicillin to alternate regimens to treat isolated tachypnea among infants aged 7–59 days, there were no differences in treatment failure between amoxicillin and alternate regimens. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for all primary outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

We found limited evidence to support the superiority of any single antibiotic regimen over alternate regimens to treat young infant pneumonia.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^77ac194a]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate criteria—The use of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (2 g/125 mg PO bid) is recommended for adults with ABRS who are at a high risk of being infected with penicillin nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; this includes those from regions with high endemic rates (>10%) of invasive PNS S. pneumoniae, those with severe infection (evidence of systemic toxicity with temperature of 39°C [102°F] or higher and threat of suppurative complications), age ≥65 years, recent hospitalization, antibiotic use within the past month, or those who are immunocompromised.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^ac7a7166]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

High-dose amoxicillin (80–100 mg/kg/d) was the prescribed antibiotic in 3 of the 4 studies, and in the fourth study 5% received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. A study from England compared short and long amoxicillin courses with low (35–50 mg/kg/d) and high amoxicillin doses separately. It found that short courses were not inferior to long courses with either dose, and low doses were not inferior to high doses.

High doses of amoxicillin have been needed in areas where penicillin or multiple antibiotic resistance is common in pneumococcal strains, but a double amoxicillin dose equates to double antibiotic exposure. Therefore, countries with low resistance rates have used low-dose amoxicillin as the first choice for children’s CAP, and the efficacy of low-dose in shorter duration should be confirmed in further studies.

The original purpose of the study was to compare clinical cures between short-course and long-course arms, but the clinical parameters expressing cure were heterogenous between the included studies and could not be pooled to produce any summary estimates. Instead, the retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month were constantly reported in all studies, and these failures were combined and used as the primary outcome in the analyses. Furthermore, owing to the low failure rates in the included studies, we decided to use RDs in the analyses instead of risk ratios. Three of the included studies were noninferiority-designed RCTs, but the pooling of these with a cenventional parallel superiority-designed RCT is feasible, and we aimed to seek differences between groups in our conventional meta-analysis instead of using a prespecified noninferiority margin in the analyses.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^8695a992]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings.The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines,of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^912ec12c]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

For antibiotic treatment of Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) the National guidelines in Denmark recommend either first choice amoxicillin 750 mg TID (AMX) or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid 500 mg/125 mg TID (AMC). Addition of clavulanic acid offers a broader spectrum; opposite, AMX alone in a higher dose may offer more time above MIC. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcome.

Methods

The Danish Registry of COPD (DrCOPD), a nationwide outpatient COPD registry, was crosslinked with medication data and hospital contacts. The first prescription of AMX or AMC after inclusion in DrCOPD was used as exposure variable. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the risk of hospitalization or death (combined) within 30 days and other endpoints.

Results

For the first treatment of AECOPD 12,915 received AMX, and 30,721 patients received AMC. AMX was associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia hospitalization or death (aHR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5–0.7; p < 0.0001) compared to AMC.

Conclusion

In AECOPD, empirically adding clavulanic acid to amoxicillin is not associated with a better outcome; it seems safe for these patients to be treated with amoxicillin alone.

### Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin / clavulanate (2, 000 / 125 mg) in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains [^83e0e497]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of a new pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate (2,000/125 mg) twice daily for the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (PRSP; penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs]: > or = 2 microg/ml. A total of 2,482 patients received study medication (safety population). Of these, 2,324 were clinically evaluable (efficacy population), and 1,156 of them had at least one pathogen isolated at screening (bacteriology population). S pneumoniae was isolated from 371 patients in the bacteriology population, including 37 with PRSP. Follow-up in the bacteriology population on days 17 through 28 revealed that amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was successful in 345 of 371 patients with S pneumoniae infection (93.0%) and in 36 of 37patients with PRSP infection (97.3%), including 7 of 8 patients (87.5%) whose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs were 4/2 microg/ml or higher. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate was generally well tolerated, as only 2.2% of patients withdrew because of adverse events. This agent represents a valuable new therapeutic option for the empiric treatment of ABRS, particularly in areas where antimicrobial-resistant pathogens (including beta-lactamase-positive organisms) are prevalent, and for the treatment of patients who are at increased risk of infection with PRSP.

### Exclusive oral antibiotic treatment for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^09635069]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of different ways of administration and types of beta-lactams for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

In this post-hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) on patients hospitalized for CAP (pneumonia short treatment trial) comparing 3-day vs. 8-day durations of beta-lactams, which concluded to non-inferiority, we included patients who received either amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) or third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) regimens, and exclusively either intravenous or oral treatment for the first 3 days (followed by either 5 days of oral placebo or AMC according to randomization). The choice of route and molecule was left to the physician in charge. The main outcome was a failure at 15 days after the first antibiotic intake, defined as temperature >37.9°C, and/or absence of resolution/improvement of respiratory symptoms, and/or additional antibiotic treatment for any cause. The primary outcome according to the route of administration was evaluated through logistic regression. Inverse probability treatment weighting with a propensity score model was used to adjust for non-randomization of treatment routes and potential confounders. The difference in failure rates was also evaluated among several sub-populations (AMC vs. 3GC treatments, intravenous vs. oral AMC, patients with multi-lobar infection, patients aged ≥65 years old, and patients with CURB65 scores of 3-4).

Results

We included 200 patients from the original trial, with 93/200 (46.5%) patients only treated with intravenous treatment and 107/200 (53.5%) patients only treated with oral therapy. The failure rate at Day 15 was not significantly different among patients treated with initial intravenous vs. oral treatment [25/93 (26.9%) vs. 28/107 (26.2%), adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.973 (95% CI 0.519-1.823), p 0.932)]. Failure rates at Day 15 were not significantly different among the subgroup populations.

Discussion

Among hospitalized patients with CAP, there was no significant difference in efficacy between initial intravenous and exclusive oral treatment.

Trial Registration

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01963442.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^0c295556]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The initial search retrieved 779 records, and after the removal of duplicates (238 records) we assessed 541 abstracts. We excluded 530 studies based on the abstracts, and 11 full texts were evaluated; finally, 4 studies were included in the analysis (Supplementary Figure 1).

All of the included studies were double blinded. Three studies were designed as noninferiority trials and one as a superiority trial. In 3 of 4 studies, the only antibiotic used was amoxicillin, and the fourth study treated patients with amoxicillin, amoxicillin and clavulanate (5.3%), or cefdinir (3.9%) (Supplementary Table 1).

Patients included in the studies were treated as outpatients. In every study, patients with suspected complicated pneumonia were excluded. The definition of pneumonia varied between the studies. Two studies required chest radiographs consistent with CAP to be included, while one made the diagnosis based on symptoms and signs. One study used a different approach: the patients were diagnosed with pneumonia before their inclusion in the study. They were then randomized to further antibiotics or placebo on day 5. The initial diagnoses did not have any specific diagnostic criteria for CAP and the randomization on the fifth day was done for those with early clinical improvement; therefore, it may have included milder pneumonia cases than the other included studies (Supplementary Table 2).

A total of 1573 children were included in the studies, of whom 784 belonged to the short-course and 789 to the long-course arms. The mean ages of children were between 28 and 36.8 months. Only a single study tested patients for respiratory viruses, and 104 children (83.9%) in the short-course group and 101 children (80.1%) in the long-course group tested positive for viruses (Supplementary Table 3).

The risk of bias was considered low in 3 of 4 studies (Supplementary Figure 2). One study had some concerns about deviations from an intended intervention, as it replaced the initial 3-day intervention with a 5-day intervention in the early phase.

Our study also highlighted the hitherto under-appreciated role of K pneumoniae as the second most important pathogen (25·5%) in presumed community-acquired pneumonia and the most common pathogen (43·0%) in presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. K pneumoniae is a prevalent pathogen in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, spreading rapidly within hospitals. K pneumoniae is estimated to account for 3–5% of community-acquired pneumonia cases across all age groups in high-income countries compared with 15% in low-income and middle-income countries.Our findings emphasise the need for diagnostics methods that can quickly identify cases of pneumonia due to K pneumoniae and the need for tailored empirical antibiotic therapy in cases of severe pneumonia in low-income and middle-income settings. The current WHO recommendation for first-line empirical treatment for childhood community-acquired pneumonia is amoxicillin or amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, which would be inadequate in the treatment of K pneumoniae, and could have contributed to the prominent role of K pneumoniae even in deaths due to presumed community-acquired pneumonia in our study.

Key messages

No evidence for effectiveness of addition of antibiotics to prednisolone for AECOPD with moderate severity and intermediate probability of bacterial infection was observed.
More placebo-controlled studies to define subgroups of COPD outpatients in which antibiotics are of additional value are needed.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^32dc30b0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Amoxicillin–clavulanate in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)—evidence and recommendation indicate no benefit and potential harm without carbapenems; in adjusted analyses, patients who received amoxicillin–clavulanate were less likely to have treatment success (aOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.5–0.8) and more likely to die (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.1) compared with those who did not receive it, and “the addition of amoxicillin–clavulanate (without coadministration with carbapenems) to a regimen for MDR-TB does not appear to provide benefit.” Conclusions state it “should not be used in MDR-TB treatment, except to provide clavulanate when using a carbapenem,” and “amoxicillin–clavulanate must be given whenever carbapenems are included in an MDR-TB regimen”; the guideline further notes, “Our recommendation against the use of amoxicillin–clavulanate … is strong despite the evidence being judged to be of very low certainty.”

Amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo in acute otitis media—randomized trial outcomes report baseline age distribution, efficacy, and adverse events: in the treatment group, 135 of 161 patients (84%) were younger than 24 months versus 124 of 158 (78%) in placebo; treatment failure occurred in 18.6% versus 44.9% (NNT = 3.8, P < .001), rescue treatment was needed in 6.8% versus 33.5% (P < .001), contralateral AOM developed in 8.2% versus 18.6% (P = .007), and use of analgesic or antipyretic medicine was 84.2% versus 85.9%. Parents of child care attendees on placebo missed more days of work (P = .005); clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 17.2% versus 42.7% and in bilateral AOM 21.7% versus 46.3%, with day 8 failures 17.2% versus 42.7% (unilateral) and 21.7% vs 46.3% (bilateral). Adverse events occurred in 52.8% versus 36.1% (P = .003), overall condition and tympanic membrane appearance favored antibiotics at end of treatment (P < .001), and two placebo recipients developed severe infection (pneumococcal bacteremia or radiographically confirmed pneumonia).

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^b6d31ac8]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Interestingly, strong recommendations were also made against proposals to adopt penicillin plus gentamicin for severe pneumonia and ceftriaxone for very severe pneumonia. Although evidence was largely absent, and thus did not support these proposals, such regimens were admitted to be common local practice. Here a major reason given for strongly rejecting what was already being practiced, in support of existing recommendations, was the perceived need to preserve the alternative treatments as second line regimens in the absence of viable alternatives. It is thus possible that here discussions on the absence of evidence supporting superiority of non-guideline regimens being used in practice may have helped to rebuild confidence in existing guidelines. In line with the evidence presented, the panel made a strong recommendation to abandon chloramphenicol as an alternative treatment to benzyl penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin for very severe pneumonia. In this case, although the decision was consistent with the moderate quality evidence, much of the data summarized was from non-African children. This contrasts with rejection of similar quality evidence, also from non-African children, referred to above in the case of amoxicillin in severe pneumonia. In this case we speculate that abandoning chloramphenicol may have resonated with existing views that the drug was no longer suitable, having been abandoned by western countries many years ago on the grounds of safety.

Antibiotics received

At baseline ([−12,+24 h] of admission), 2841 (29.3 %) patients received amoxicillin but not co-amoxiclav, with a median (IQR) duration of all antibiotic treatment, including switching agents/route, of 5.4 (5.0–7.3) days (5.0 (4.7–6.5) days on amoxicillin). 1628 (57.3 %) received oral, 664 (23.4 %) intravenous, and 546 (19.2 %) both oral and intravenous amoxicillin (3 through other routes). 5358 (55.3 %) patients received baseline co-amoxiclav, with a median 6.8 (5.1–10.0) total days of antibiotics (5.9 (4.7–7.9) days co-amoxiclav). 575 (10.7 %), 3568 (66.6 %), and 1212 (22.6 %) received oral, intravenous, and both oral and intravenous co-amoxiclav, respectively (3 through other routes). 1486 (15.3 %) received both amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav at baseline with a median 6.2 (5.2–8.8) total days of antibiotics. Among those receiving amoxicillin initially, 469 (16.5%) later switched to or received additional co-amoxiclav after the baseline period, after a median (IQR) 4.1 (1.7–5.3) days. Conversely, among those receiving co-amoxiclav initially, 499 (9.3 %) later de-escalated to amoxicillin, after a median (IQR) 2.4 (1.3–5.2) days. At baseline, 2919 (30.1 %) received additional macrolide antibiotics, 1881 (19.4 %) additional doxycycline, and 901 (9.3 %) additional gentamicin (Table 1).

### Necessity of amoxicillin clavulanic acid in addition to prednisolone in mild-to-moderate COPD exacerbations [^f458911d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of antibiotics in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations is still a matter of debate, especially in outpatients with an intermediate probability of bacterial infection.

Methods

In this study, 35 COPD outpatients diagnosed by their chest physician with moderately severe COPD exacerbation, but without pneumonia, were randomised in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients had one or two of the following characteristics: a positive Gram's stain of the sputum, 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year, a decrease in lung function of > 200 mL and > 12%. Patients received amoxicillin clavulanic acid (500/125 mg three times daily) or placebo for 7 days, always combined with a course of prednisolone (30 mg/day) for 7 days. Primary outcome was duration of the exacerbation. Additionally, we measured severity of the exacerbation, health-related quality of life, sputum parameters, number of relapses within 28 days and the number of re-exacerbations within 4 months after the study.

Results

There was no difference observed in time to resolution of the exacerbation between the two groups (HR=1.12; (95% CI 0.5 to 2.3; p=0.77)), nor in any other treatment parameter.

Conclusions

We detected no evidence for the effectiveness of addition of antibiotics to prednisolone for COPD exacerbations of moderate severity and with intermediate probability of bacterial infection in this underpowered study. More placebo-controlled studies are needed to properly define subgroups of COPD outpatients in which antibiotics are of additional value.
