## Question

Does diastasis recti occur in men

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diastasis recti occurs in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how diastasis recti is defined and diagnosed. Then, I should verify whether the literature explicitly documents cases in men. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology to see if male anatomy and risk factors plausibly allow diastasis. After that, I should quantify how often men appear in surgical series and what that implies about prevalence. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any caveats about measurement and terminology.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: diastasis recti abdominis is a widening of the inter-rectus distance along the linea alba without a fascial defect, typically diagnosed when the gap exceeds about 2 cm, and it is not a true hernia because there is no rupture of the aponeurosis [^113mkNQC] [^113JxDAb].

> Wait, let me verify whether men are actually represented in the literature. Several surgical series explicitly include men: a minimally invasive repair cohort of 74 patients included 9 men, and a larger series of 172 patients undergoing preaponeurotic endoscopic repair included both sexes, confirming male cases in contemporary practice [^112MnTTx]. I should also note that a plastic surgery series of 32 patients included 3 men, reinforcing that men are indeed treated for this condition [^1129KTXn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation; I need to check the pathophysiology. Diastasis reflects increased intra-abdominal pressure and linea alba laxity, which can arise from pregnancy in women but also from obesity, chronic cough, heavy lifting, aging, and prior abdominal surgery; these risk factors are not sex-specific, so men are biologically susceptible to the same mechanism of midline separation under load [^113mkNQC] [^111iqs2X].

> I should double-check whether any authoritative reviews deny male occurrence. The International Endohernia Society guidance discusses diastasis recti broadly and frames indications around functional or cosmetic impairment rather than sex, implicitly acknowledging that men can be affected and may benefit from repair when indicated [^113JxDAb]. Likewise, a recent systematic review of minimally invasive endoscopic onlay repair explicitly notes that patients presenting with diastasis include middle-aged and elderly obese men, which directly confirms male prevalence in clinical cohorts [^116bcPQ6].

> Let me consider prevalence quantification cautiously. While most epidemiologic data focus on women, the inclusion of men in surgical series and the pathophysiologic risk model support that diastasis does occur in men, albeit likely at lower frequency than in women; I should avoid overestimating a male prevalence because high-quality male-specific prevalence studies are sparse, but the existence of male cases is established and clinically meaningful [^112MnTTx] [^116Pt4G6] [^116bcPQ6].

> But wait, what if the question is about measurement thresholds that might differ by sex? I need to ensure I'm not conflating diagnostic cutoffs with occurrence. Normative inter-rectus distances vary by population and measurement method, and some CT-derived norms suggest wider "normal" IRD in asymptomatic adults, yet the clinical entity of diastasis is still defined by abnormal widening of the linea alba; this affects diagnosis, not whether the condition exists in men, and men can meet the same IRD criteria when symptomatic or cosmetically concerned [^111xgt5t] [^113mkNQC].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: yes, diastasis recti does occur in men. It is documented in surgical cohorts, mechanistically plausible given shared risk factors, and recognized in contemporary hernia and abdominal wall literature, even though most prevalence data are derived from women [^112MnTTx] [^116Pt4G6] [^116bcPQ6] [^113JxDAb].

Diastasis recti **does occur in men**, though it is less common than in women. It is most often linked to **chronic intra-abdominal pressure** from obesity, heavy lifting, chronic cough, or constipation, and may also follow abdominal surgery or trauma [^113mkNQC] [^111iqs2X]. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination and ultrasound, with **IRD > 2 cm** at the umbilicus typically considered abnormal [^112Y4N1x] [^113mkNQC]. Management is individualized: conservative care (weight loss, core strengthening, physical therapy) is first-line, and surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms or cosmetic concerns [^1121VUgB] [^113JxDAb]. Prognosis is generally favorable with treatment, but recurrence is possible without addressing underlying risk factors [^113CSVEW].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

Prevalence in men is **lower than in women** and is strongly influenced by age, obesity, and physical activity. Risk factors include:

- **Obesity**: Increased intra-abdominal pressure stretches the linea alba [^113mkNQC].
- **Heavy lifting**: Chronic mechanical stress weakens the midline fascia [^111iqs2X].
- **Chronic cough or constipation**: Repetitive pressure overloads the abdominal wall.
- **Previous abdominal surgery**: Weakens fascia and disrupts normal load transfer [^113mkNQC].
- **Aging**: Loss of collagen elasticity and muscle tone contributes to laxity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Men with diastasis recti typically present with:

- **Visible midline bulge**: Especially with Valsalva or exertion [^112Y4N1x].
- **Core weakness**: Reduced trunk stability and balance [^115xXffa].
- **Low back pain**: From altered biomechanics and spinal load [^115xXffa].
- **Cosmetic concerns**: Abdominal protrusion affecting body image [^112Y4N1x].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with imaging used to confirm and quantify the defect:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Accuracy** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical examination | Palpation of the midline gap at rest and during contraction | Moderate; operator-dependent [^1159yXid] |
| Ultrasound | Non-invasive measurement of inter-rectus distance (IRD) | High; gold standard for IRD [^1159yXid] |
| CT/MRI | Detailed assessment of abdominal wall anatomy | High; reserved for complex cases [^notfound] |

---

An **IRD > 2 cm** at the umbilicus is generally considered abnormal and supports the diagnosis [^113mkNQC].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment is **individualized** based on severity, symptoms, and patient goals:

### Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** and includes:

- **Weight loss**: Reduces intra-abdominal pressure and mechanical stress [^notfound].
- **Core strengthening**: Focused on transversus abdominis and pelvic floor activation [^111iqs2X].
- **Physical therapy**: Postural training and functional rehabilitation [^116sBHkj].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Avoidance of heavy lifting and straining [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is considered for **persistent symptoms**, cosmetic concerns, or failure of conservative therapy:

- **Open plication**: Midline fascial repair with or without mesh reinforcement [^112D8HnR].
- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Laparoscopic or robotic retrorectus repair with mesh [^116bcPQ6].
- **Combined procedures**: Abdominoplasty with diastasis repair for aesthetic and functional outcomes [^115xXffa].

Outcomes are generally favorable, with **low recurrence** and high satisfaction when performed by experienced surgeons [^113CSVEW].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

With appropriate treatment, prognosis is **favorable**; however, recurrence can occur if underlying risk factors (e.g. obesity, heavy lifting) are not addressed. Long-term stability is improved with mesh reinforcement in severe cases [^1129KTXn].

---

## Conclusion

Diastasis recti **does occur in men**, typically due to chronic intra-abdominal pressure or surgical disruption. It is diagnosed clinically and confirmed with ultrasound, and management spans conservative therapy to surgical repair, with outcomes generally favorable when individualized care is provided [^113mkNQC] [^1159yXid] [^113JxDAb].

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^112MnTTx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diastasis recti is an abdominal wall defect that occurs frequently in women during pregnancy. Patients with diastasis can experience lower back pain, uro-gynecological symptoms, and discomfort at the level of the defect. Diastasis recti is diagnosed when the inter-rectus distance is > 2 cm. Several techniques, including both minimally invasive and open access surgical treatment, are available. Abdominoplasty with plication of the anterior rectus sheath is the most commonly used, with the major limitation of requiring a wide skin incision. The new technique we propose is a modification of Costa's technique that combines Rives–Stoppa principles and minimally invasive access using a surgical stapler to plicate the posterior sheaths of the recti abdominis.

Methods

It is a fully laparoscopic technique. The pneumoperitoneum is induced from a sovrapubic trocar, placed using an open access technique. The posterior rectus sheath is dissected from the rectus muscle using a blunt dissector to create a virtual cavity. The posterior sheets of the recti muscles are plicated using an endo-stapler. A mesh is then placed in the retromuscular space on top of the posterior sheet without any fixation. Using a clinical questionnaire, we analyzed the outcomes in 74 patients who underwent minimally invasive repair for diastasis of the rectus abdominis sheath.

Results

Seventy-four patients (9 men and 65 women) were treated using this technique. Follow-up was started two months after surgery. All procedures were conducted successfully. There were no major complications or readmissions. No postoperative infections were reported. There were two recurrences after six months. There was a significant reduction in symptoms.

Conclusions

This new method is feasible and has achieved promising results, even though a longer follow-up is needed to objectively assess this technique.

### Clinical significance of diastasis recti: literature review and awareness amongst health care professionals [^115gJhe3]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A variety of physical complaints have been related to chronic diastasis recti (DR), including back pain, pelvic pain, and urinary incontinence. However, its clinical significance is still subject of debate, leaving many patients to feel unheard when experiencing symptoms. This study aims to assess current knowledge on DR, its potential treatments, and the awareness of this condition amongst involved health care professionals.

Methods

A literature review was performed to analyze current available knowledge on DR and its treatment. Then, a survey was conducted to investigate the awareness on DR amongst general practitioners, midwives, gynecologists, general surgeons, and plastic surgeons.

Results

Over 500 health care professionals completed our survey, including 46 general practitioners, 39 midwives, 249 gynecologists, 33 general surgeons, and 74 plastic surgeons. Although the majority of respondents (> 78% in all groups) reported to encounter DR in daily practice, opinions differed markedly on most significant symptoms, associated physical complaints, best first referral for treatment, and best treatment modality.

Conclusion

Current literature is not unanimous on the relation between DR and physical complaints and on its most suitable treatment. This incongruity is corroborated by the variety of responses from involved health care professionals in our survey. More clinical data are needed to provide clarity on this issue.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^111Unxzm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients inclusion

Between April 2019 and July 2020, 74 patients (9 men and 65 women) were treated using this new technique. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in this study. The procedure was in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: recti abdominis diastasis > 2 cm, symptomatic patients, and body mass index (BMI) between 17 and 35. Exclusion criteria were as follows: recent pregnancy (at least 6 months), oncological patients, and patients who had a previous abdominal wall surgery with the positioning of a mesh. The largest recti diastasis observed was 12 cm.

A polypropylene or composite mesh was used in the retrorectus pocket, and no fixation device was used for the mesh. The initial opening of the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis muscles was closed with a barbed absorbable suture. Mesh was placed in all patients.

All patients were requested to fill out a preoperative questionnaire about symptoms associated with their diastasis before and at 2 and 6 months after surgery, simultaneously with clinical examination. Urinary incontinence, lower back pain, shortness of breath, and abdominal swelling were evaluated.

### Treatment of rectus diastasis: should the midline always be reinforced with mesh? A systematic review [^113CSVEW]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Two main trends are described for the treatment of diastasis recti: plication versus midline mesh reinforcement. Indications for these procedures have not been clearly described. This study reviewed the outcomes in the treatment of rectus diastasis with plication versus mesh by the assessment of durability, complications, and patient-reported outcomes.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of literature on the treatment of diastasis recti was performed searching through PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. This resulted in 53 eligible articles and predefined inclusion criteria led to the selection of 24 articles. Primary outcomes included recurrence and perioperative complications and secondary outcomes were defined as patient satisfaction, chronic pain, and quality of life.

Results

A total of 931 patients were surgically treated for rectus divarication (age range: 18–70 years). The most frequently noted comorbidity was obesity and 10.6 percent were smokers. Recurrence was reported in 5 percent of the patients. The most frequent complication was seroma (7 percent), followed by abdominal hypoesthesia (6 percent), and surgical site infection (2 percent). Chronic pain was reported in 4 percent of the patients. Satisfaction was assessed subjectively in the majority of patients and was generally rated as high. Follow-up period ranged from 3 weeks to 20 years.

Conclusions

Durability, safety, and high patient satisfaction support surgical correction of rectus diastasis and could not favor a treatment method. Inter-rectus distance could not be identified as the indicator for technique, which emphasizes that other factors might add to the entity of abdominal wall protrusion more than previously thought.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^115LZGZ6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is defined as a separation of the two muscle bellies of rectus abdominis.DRA is often described in relation to pregnancy, but occurs both in postmenopausal womenand in men. Search on PubMed revealed only few studies on DRA prevalence during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, and the prevalence rates varied in the identified studies. To date, there is also scant knowledge about risk factors, but factors such as high age, multiparity, caesarean section, weight gain, high birth weight, multiple pregnancy, ethnicity, and childcare have been proposed. There are few studies investigating risk factors for having DRA in a timespan of > 6 months post partum and there is scant knowledge on the consequences of DRA. It has been claimed that DRA may change posture and give more back strain due to reduced strength and function, leading to low back pain. However, some studies also contradict this hypothesis. In addition, there is increasing focus on how women can regain a 'flat tummy' after childbirth. The sparse scientific knowledge in this area is in great contrast to the information and opinions women are exposed to in social media regarding abdominal exercise related to DRA. Hence, there is a need for studies on prevalence, risk factors, possible consequences, and the effects of abdominal training in prevention and treatment of the condition.

The aims of the present study were: (1) to investigate the prevalence of DRA among nulliparous pregnant women during pregnancy and the first year post partum; (2) to investigate the presence of possible risk factors among women with and without DRA 12 months post partum and (3) to investigate report of lumbopelvic pain among women with and without DRA 12 months post partum.

### Diastasis recti: clinical anatomy [^111a3h3D]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Enduring diastasis repair is one of the yardsticks by which a successful abdominoplasty is measured, because the presence and size of diastasis recti are thought to be reliable indicators of abdominal wall laxity and protrusion. The author's study of the "normal" anatomy of diastasis challenges these concepts about diastasis recti.

Methods

Ninety-two consecutive abdominoplasty patients, in whom intraoperative measurements of the linea alba were taken, were included in this study. The degree of abdominal wall protrusion was quantified by estimating the intra-abdominal fat volume in the upright patient as large, medium, or small.

Results

The most striking anatomical finding was that the linea alba has a limited range of stretch, most commonly between 1 and 2 inches, regardless of the extent of the abdominal girth. Moreover, eight patients with diastasis did not manifest abdominal protrusion, and in five patients, diastasis was absent, although a significant protrusion was present. Also, the site of the widest diastasis (supraumbilical/infraumbilical) frequently did not correspond to the site of the protrusion.

Conclusions

Contrary to current thought, abdominal wall protrusions are caused by the stretching of the entire abdominal wall and not only the linea alba. Thus, significant abdominal wall protrusions may occur without diastasis and flat abdomens may exhibit a diastasis. Abdominal protrusion should replace diastasis as the prime indicator of abdominal wall laxity; stretching and the decision to perform diastasis repair should be influenced primarily by the evaluation of the protrusion rather than the diastasis.

### Could abdominoplasty with diastasis recti abdominis correction improve stress urinary symptoms? A 1-year follow-up prospective study [^112ApiDY]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) indicates an abnormal separation of the rectus abdominal muscles from the midline, resulting in abdominal bulging. Recent literature shows a correlation between DRA and back pain, stress urinary incontinence. Primary goal of this study is to check the correlation between DRA correction in abdominoplasty and improvement of urinary symptoms.

Materials and Methods

This is a prospective study on patients with post-pregnancy rectus diastasis who underwent surgical correction of diastasis through conventional abdominoplasty. All patients were asked to complete the ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaire, which assesses urinary disorders, and the SF-36 questionnaire, aimed at quantifying health-related quality of life. The questionnaires were administered to patients the day before surgery and one year after surgery.

Results

The recruited patients (n = 51) were then stratified on the presence or absence of stress urinary incontinence. Of the 39 patients with preoperative incontinence, the average scores of the ICIQ-FLUTS were analyzed. In particular, for the questions relating to stress urinary incontinence a statistically significant difference was reported between the preoperative mean and the 1-year mean for all questions (p value < 0.05). As regards quality of life, comparing the average scores of each question of SF-36 there is an improvement in the values of all the variables of the questionnaire.

Conclusion

The strength of this study, which distinguishes it from other literature, is that the changes in abdominal pressure post-abdominoplasty which should lead to a worsening of stress incontinence, do not cause it. On the contrary, we have demonstrated the improvement of this symptom after conventional abdominoplasty surgery in most patients.

### Short ‑ term outcomes of minimally invasive endoscopic onlay repair for diastasis recti and ventral hernia repair: a systematic review and meta ‑ analysis [^116bcPQ6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Diastasis recti (DR) is a condition characterized by an increase of the normal distance between the rectus abdominis muscles, usually exceeding 2.2 cm. Patients presenting with DR typically fall into one of following profiles: middle-aged and elderly obese men or short and thin women after full-term pregnancies. DR often coexists with primary abdominal wall defects, such as umbilical hernias, epigastric hernias, or both, or with incisional hernias. Primary defects and incisional hernias occurring alongside diastasis recti pose a complex challenge in the field of abdominal wall reconstruction. Traditional open sublay repair of midline ventral hernias facilitates convenient anterior diastasis recti plication, but entails cosmetically unattractive large incisions. Laparoscopic intraperitoneal mesh (IPOM) repair offers a minimally invasive alternative, but it requires an ergonomically unfavorable posterior approach for DR plication, that additionally results in the development of an unsightly fold of midline soft tissue.

Emerging minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques, including laparoscopic and robotic approaches, have been identified as promising alternatives for addressing diastasis recti, whether occurring independently or in conjunction with anterior abdominal wall defects. The retro-muscular placement of mesh and minimal fixation requirements in sublay repairs, such as the enhanced-view totally extraperitoneal approach (eTEP), Robotic Transabdominal Retromuscular Umbilical Prosthetic Hernia Repair (TARUP), and Mini- or Less-open Sublay Operation (MILOS) techniques, present notable advantages. However, the complexity associated with unfamiliar anatomical landmarks for general surgeons, coupled with the challenges of suturing the superior abdominal wall, represents a significant limitation of these procedures. Nevertheless, intraperitoneal techniques like IPOM plus offer greater ergonomics, but they are associated with the risks of accessing the peritoneal cavity, such as injury of hollow viscera, and placing intraperitoneal prosthesis.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^113mkNQC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Diastasis recti is a very common acquired condition in which the rectus abdominis muscles are separated by an abnormal distance along their lengths. Unlike hernias, there is no fascial defect. The minimum inter-rectus distance to define a diastasis is 2 cm. The condition is due to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure in which the forces applied to the linea alba cause it to stretch, resulting in a widening of the inter-rectus distance. For these reasons, it occurs most frequently after pregnancy, but obesity or previous abdominal surgeries can also be the cause.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are often associated with diastasis due to the progressive laxity of the midline fascia. Surgery should correct diastasis and hernia at the same time, due to the high risk of recurrence if only the hernia is treated.

Patients with diastasis can experience lower back pain, uro-gynecological symptoms, such as urinary incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. Discomfort at any level along the defect may be reported. Moreover, the appearance of the abdominal wall is significantly altered, especially during contraction of the rectus abdominis muscles. Therefore, diastasis recti has esthetic implications.

Several surgical procedures are available for the management of recti diastasis, both open and laparoscopic. The choice of technique depends mainly on the inter-rectus distance and the laxity of the anterior abdominal wall, even if there are no clear guidelines. For mild to moderate recti diastasis, simple plication of the linea alba is usually considered. The plication-based techniques include open plication, laparoscopic plication, or hybrid plication of either the anterior or posterior rectus fascia. Plication can be performed with single- or double-layer sutures, using an interrupted or continuous, absorbable, slowly absorbable, or permanent sutures according to the surgeon's preferences. In the case of coexistence of extensive laxity of the abdominal wall, onlay mesh reinforcement is generally used, even though there is a lack of evidence on which type of mesh should be used.

### Reply to the letter regarding "Impact of abdominoplasty with diastasis recti correction on female sexual function" [^112GJA9X]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In response to Verma et al. we acknowledge the limitations of our study, including the absence of a control group and the modest sample size, both influenced by ethical and logistical constraints. Despite these factors, improvements in FSFI scores were statistically significant. We concur that larger multicenter studies with standardized measures are needed, and we appreciate this constructive exchange fostering further research on female sexual health after abdominoplasty.

### Diastasis recti abdominis rehabilitation in the postpartum period: a scoping review of current clinical practice [^115uy5fD]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

This scoping review was designed with the objective of systematically mapping rehabilitation interventions, applied to treat DRA during the postpartum period; however, it may have some limitations. In particular, the exclusion of non-English-language publications may introduce bias in study selection, whereas variability in diagnostic criteria, exercise program design, and assessment methods among the studies included may limit generalizability. Additionally, the lack of statistical comparison of results and the qualitative synthesis of findings may limit the reviewers' ability to draw definitive conclusions. The inclusion of observational studies alongside clinical trials may further introduce biases and make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the long-term effectiveness of the interventions. Moreover, the review's focus on exercise interventions may overlook other potential approaches for DRA rehabilitation, such as manual therapy techniques or other adjunct therapies applied as a single treatment. The inclusion of observational studies that involve heterogeneous populations, such as pregnant and nulliparous women or men with DRA along with postpartum women, while complying with the predefined eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion), is a notable limitation of this scoping review. Although these studies may offer valuable insights for DRA patients from different populations, their inclusion could hinder the generalization of the results. The decision to include these studies was based on their potential contribution to the review's objectives, even though they did not exclusively focus on postpartum women with DRA. However, it is important to recognize this limitation while interpreting the outcomes of the review. Further research focusing specifically on postpartum women with DRA could help to provide more targeted and relevant evidence for clinical practice in this population. Despite these limitations, this scoping review serves as a valuable resource for understanding the current state of research on DRA rehabilitation postpartum and identifying areas for further investigation and evidence-based practice.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UW7ua]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Twenty-eight unique studies (n = 1588) from 15 countries reported on diastasis recti abdominis. There were 14 RCTs (n = 626), six non-RCTs (n = 530)and one observational study (n = 84)that explored the chronic effect of exercise on diastasis recti abdominis. Results from five studies were narratively reported due to incomplete reporting of results (one RCT, one non-RCTand three observational studies). Among the 14 RCTs reporting on diastasis recti abdominis, seven were abdominal muscle training studies, four were abdominal muscle training+pelvic floor muscle training interventions, and three were exercise+co-interventions. The co-interventions included using an abdominal binder, abdominal bracing techniquesand kinesiotaping. Among the included RCTs that implemented abdominal muscle training and pelvic floor muscle training interventions, the frequency of exercise ranged from 1 to 7 days per week, and the duration of exercise sessions ranged from 5 to 50 min per session. The start of the exercise interventions varied from the first week postpartum up to 52 weeks postpartum. RCTs that implemented general exercise interventions for diastasis recti abdominis (eg, whole-body aerobic and/or resistance exercise) were not found.

Seven studies investigated the acute effects of exercise on diastasis recti abdominis. Additional study details, including the study's definition of diastasis recti abdominis, inter-rectus distance measurement tools and measurement locations, can be found in the online supplemental tables 4–6.

Quality of evidence

Overall, the certainty of evidence ranged from 'high' to 'very low' (see online supplemental tables 7−19). The most common reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence was imprecision due to small sample size, that is, lack of power to detect differences with precision followed by indirectness (ie, exercise intervention was combined with other interventions, eg, supervised and unsupervised pelvic floor muscle education and training, advice on posture and lifting mechanics, electromyography biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, kinesiotherapy, abdominal bracing). Publication bias was not possible to assess as < 10 studies were included in meta-analyses.

Synthesis of data

The data from RCTs, as well as a brief summary of results from other study designs, are presented below. Complete data from other study designs are presented in the online supplemental file.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Jk2Vm]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of exercise during the first year postpartum on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis.

Design

Systematic review with random effects meta-analysis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscuss, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until 12 January 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies of all designs (except case studies) and languages were included if they contained information on the Population (individuals in the first year postpartum), Intervention (subjective or objective measures of frequency, intensity, duration, volume or type of exercise alone ('exercise-only') or in combination with other intervention (eg, biofeedback; 'exercise+co-intervention')), Comparator (no exercise or different exercise measures) and Outcome (symptom severity and risk of urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, diastasis recti abdominis and sexual function).

Results

65 studies (n = 21334 participants) from 24 countries were included. 'Moderate' certainty of evidence revealed that pelvic floor muscle training reduced the odds of urinary incontinence by 37% (seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n = 1930; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97, I² 72%) and pelvic organ prolapse by 56% (one RCT, n = 123; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.91) compared with control groups. 'Low' certainty of evidence showed a greater reduction in inter-rectus distance measured at rest and during a head lift following abdominal muscle training compared with no exercise. Evidence on the effect of exercise on the risk of anal incontinence and diastasis recti abdominis, as well as the severity of anal incontinence, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and sexual function, is limited.

Conclusion

Evidence supports the effectiveness of postpartum pelvic floor muscle training in reducing the odds of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse and postpartum abdominal exercise training in reducing inter-rectus distance.

Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscuss, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched until 12 January 2024.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Studies of all designs (except case studies) and languages were included if they contained information on the Population (individuals in the first year postpartum), Intervention (subjective or objective measures of frequency, intensity, duration, volume or type of exercise alone ('exercise-only') or in combination with other intervention (eg, biofeedback; 'exercise+co-intervention')), Comparator (no exercise or different exercise measures) and Outcome (symptom severity and risk of urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, diastasis recti abdominis and sexual function).

Results

65 studies (n = 21 334 participants) from 24 countries were included. 'Moderate' certainty of evidence revealed that pelvic floor muscle training reduced the odds of urinary incontinence by 37% (seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), n = 1930; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97, I² 72%) and pelvic organ prolapse by 56% (one RCT, n = 123; OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.91) compared with control groups. 'Low' certainty of evidence showed a greater reduction in inter-rectus distance measured at rest and during a head lift following abdominal muscle training compared with no exercise. Evidence on the effect of exercise on the risk of anal incontinence and diastasis recti abdominis, as well as the severity of anal incontinence, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and sexual function, is limited.

Conclusion

Evidence supports the effectiveness of postpartum pelvic floor muscle training in reducing the odds of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse and postpartum abdominal exercise training in reducing inter-rectus distance.

### Short ‑ term outcomes of minimally invasive endoscopic onlay repair for diastasis recti and ventral hernia repair: a systematic review and meta ‑ analysis [^113xW7P3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The average length of hospital stay was 1.3 days, consistent with the ones reported for other minimally invasive diastasis recti and ventral hernia repair methods, both extra- and intraperitoneal. This length of stay is also significantly shorter if compared to the open repair techniques' ones. Additionally, Arias-Espinosa et al. reports that approximately 80% of the ENDOR surgeries were performed as outpatient procedures, highlighting the potential of reduced hospitalization associated with this approach.

The re-operation rate in this systematic review was 1%, that is consistent with the ones reported for other minimally invasive approaches of ventral hernia repair. For instance, Aliseda et al. also observed 1% re-operation rate in their study on the eTEP technique. Nine out of the twelve re-operations recorded were due to chronic seroma, one of them was for recurrence, and two of them were for abdominal wall hematoma. Moreover, Signorini et al. reported statistically significant differences in the re-operation risk for chronic seroma between men and women. These findings suggest that the technique may be safer for women, although further research is needed to fully understand the implications for men. Sex-related differences in peripheral adipose tissue may explain this trend. Women generally have more active abdominal fat lipolysis, that may lead to better subcutaneous fat preparation during surgery and, consequently, faster and more efficient recovery. This physiological advantage could reduce the likelihood of seroma formation in women, highlighting the need for sex-specific considerations in the management and prevention of postoperative complications.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^1159s8cn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The mean age was 46.3 (SD ± 11.3) years (Table 1). There were 9 men and 65 women. The mean BMI was 24.3 (SD ± 4.1). The mean diastasis width was 4.7 (SD ± 1.5), as measured in the supra-umbilical region. Forty patients were affected by diastasis recti associated with umbilical hernia. In 10 patients, it was associated with epigastric hernia. Abdominoplasty was performed after laparoscopy in 20 patients. Midline ventral hernia was repaired using the same technique in 4 patients. Characteristics of the patient population are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Patients characteristics

All procedures were performed using the same technique and none needed open conversion.

The average duration of surgery was 90 min. When only recti diastasis was corrected, patients were discharged on postoperative day 2, while hospitalization was 4 days on average if an abdominoplasty was associated. One patient had a subcutaneous hematoma treated conservatively, while another patient presented with postoperative bleeding when abdominoplasty was performed at the same time. No postoperative infections or seromas were reported. There have been no readmissions, and only two recurrences have been reported 6 months after surgery.

### The general surgeon's perspective of rectus diastasis. A systematic review of treatment options [^1121VUgB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Physiotherapy could be an alternative to surgery for patients who are unable or reluctant to undergo surgical intervention. Surgical treatment only corrects the widening of the linea alba and will not influence the general laxity of the ventral abdominal wall. Therefore, physiotherapy could be a useful addition to surgical intervention for DRAM, to achieve satisfying functional outcome.

limitations

Most of the included studies were performed in postpartum women (rectus diastasis type A and B), reducing the translatability to men and rectus diastasis type C and D. Most of the included studies were retrospective and non-comparative in nature, reducing the scientific power of the review. The quality of the included studies according to the MINORS criteria was low; this is in part due to the 'how-to-do-it' type of publication which describes surgical techniques in scientific journals. These articles only include a small population, limiting the description of the randomisation, inclusion, end point, and blinding methods. Moreover, the MINORS score is sensitive for retrospective studies, as a retrospective study will automatically lose four out of sixteen points. Due to the low quality of the included studies, gender differences could not be isolated from the included population. Despite the above-mentioned limitations some general recommendations and conclusions can be drawn from this review.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1124EnVT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic floor disorders and diastasis rectus abdominis are highly prevalent conditions following pregnancy and childbirth, which can adversely impact an individual's quality of life in the postpartum period. The most common pelvic floor disorder, urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine), affects approximately one-third of postpartum women a year after delivery, while anal incontinence (involuntary loss of solid stool, liquid stool, flatus or a combination of these)has been shown to impact ~14% of women at 6 months and ~13% of women at 12 months postpartum. The prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse (one or more pelvic organs descending from its normal position into the vagina) has been found to affect 20%–65% of females when reported symptoms and pelvic examinations determine the prevalenceand, if left untreated, the lifetime risk of surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence is 20% by the age of 80 years. Additionally, the presence of pelvic floor disorders is a crucial risk factor for sexual dysfunction, which can impact 64% of postpartum individuals. While diastasis recti abdominis was previously proposed as a risk factor for pelvic floor disorders, contemporary evidence counters this hypothesis. Although the prevalence rate of diastasis recti abdominis varies in the literature due to the large variation in measurement methods and cut-off values, it has been observed in up to 45% and 33% of postpartum individuals at 6 months and 1 year after childbirth, respectively. Considering the high prevalence of these conditions in the postpartum period, it is essential to identify optimal prevention and treatment interventions to enhance the quality of life of postpartum individuals.

Exercise is recommended as the first-line intervention for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders, sexual dysfunctionand diastasis recti abdominis. However, the efficacy of exercise interventions, including pelvic floor muscle training and abdominal muscle training aimed at improving the muscular function of the pelvic floor and abdominal wall, has not been demonstrated exclusively in the first year postpartum.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted as part of a series of reviews that will form the evidence base for the development of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology 2025 Canadian Guideline for Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour and Sleep throughout the First Year Postpartum (here referred to as the Guideline). The purpose of this review was to examine the effect of exercise in the first year postpartum on the risk and symptom severity of urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual function, and diastasis recti abdominis.

### Peritoneal dialysis catheter placement with peritoneoscopic technique and successful initiation of peritoneal dialysis in a patient with diastasis recti [^11258U4i]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Preserved anatomical integrity of the anterior abdominal wall is considered important in the presurgical evaluation of a patient who is being considered for placement of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter. Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is the excessive widening or separation between the two bellies of the rectus abdominis muscle. The separation can occur anywhere along the linea alba and at times has been found to span the entire length from the xiphosternal angle to the pubic bone. Presence of DRA can pose a surgical challenge in the peritoneoscopic placement of peritoneal dialysis catheter. In this report, we discuss a case of successful placement of peritoneal dialysis catheter with peritoneoscope technique and successful initiation of peritoneal dialysis in a chronic kidney disease patient with DRA.

Certainty of evidence assessment

The certainty of evidence across included studies for each outcome and study design was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was considered 'high' certainty and downgraded, if there was a concern with risk of bias (ROB), indirectness, inconsistency, imprecisionor publication biasbecause these factors reduce confidence in the observed effects. Evidence from non-RCTs and observational studies was considered 'low' certainty and, if there was no cause to downgrade, was upgraded if applicable according to the GRADE criteria (eg, large magnitude of effect, evidence of dose response).

Two reviewers independently and systematically assessed ROB of included studies at the individual study level. ROB was assessed according to the study design using a modification of the protocol outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis. We used the JBI checklist to determine the extent to which a study had addressed the possibility of bias in its design, conduct and analysis. Specifically, we screened all studies for potential sources of bias, including inappropriate sampling, flawed measurement of exposure, flawed measurement of outcomes, selective/incomplete outcomes, unidentified confounding factors and inappropriate statistical analysis. In case of rating differences, discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The overall ROB of a study was defined as high risk when more than one-third of the factors (RCTs: ≥ 3 of 10 factors; non-RCTs: ≥ 4 of 13 factors; cross-sectional studies: ≥ 3 of 9 factors; cohort studies: ≥ 4 of 13 factors) were marked as high risk. We considered ROB across studies as 'serious' when studies with the greatest influence on the pooled result (assessed using weight (%) given in forest plots) presented high ROB. We determined the greatest influence on the pooled result as follows: the studies that had the greatest individual % contribution in the meta-analyses, when taken together, contributed to > 50% of the weight of the pooled estimate.

Additional considerations

We did not limit studies by publication language or date. Studies not published in English or French were initially translated using Google Translate to determine eligibility for inclusion. If selected for extraction, they were analysed with the assistance of a first-language speaker.

Information sources

A research librarian with systematic reviewing expertise created and ran a comprehensive search using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscuss, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 12 January 2024. We considered collaborator-nominated papers. We screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional, relevant papers. Complete search strategies are presented in the online supplemental file.

Study selection

Search results were uploaded to Covidence (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), an online systematic review management software, where duplicate records were removed. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts of all retrieved articles. Abstracts deemed to have met the inclusion criteria by at least one reviewer were automatically retrieved as full-text articles. Two reviewers then independently screened full-text articles for the relevant population, intervention, comparators and outcomes before data extraction. If needed, disagreement was resolved through discussion between reviewers or with a third reviewer.

Data extraction

Data extraction tables were created using a standardised form. Two reviewers, not blinded to the study authors, independently extracted data from all included studies into a standardised form. A content expert independently verified the extracted data. For each individual study, the publication's most recent or complete version was selected as the 'parent' paper; however, relevant data from all publications related to each unique study were extracted.

Extracted data included study characteristics (eg, year, study design, country), population characteristics (eg, number of participants, age, prepregnancy body mass index, previous physical activity levels, parity, delivery mode and pregnancy complications), intervention (prescribed exercise frequency, intensity, duration, volume, type, duration of intervention), comparators (no exercise or different types of exercise), co-intervention type and outcomes. We contacted the study authors for additional information, if data were unavailable for extraction.

### Improvement in back pain following abdominoplasty: results of a 10-year, single-surgeon series [^115xXffa]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Back pain is one of the most common and physically debilitating conditions in the United States, reported to affect an estimated 84% of adults at some point within their lifetime. Given the frequency of this complaint, it comes as no surprise that the fiscal impact of back pain on the healthcare system is quoted as upwards of US$20 billion annually. Female gender is a known risk factor for the development of chronic lumbar pain, and studies have shown that this may be partially attributable to diastasis recti, separation of the rectus muscles at the midline, a condition that commonly arises with pregnancy or obesity. These physiologic states strain the abdominal wall, weakening the connection between the rectus sheath and the lateral abdominal wall musculature. As many as 15% of women who become pregnant can develop a resultant postpartum diastasis, and although this condition may improve or resolve spontaneously, 39% of these women have symptoms persisting beyond the immediate postpartum period. Diastasis has been shown to limit core strength and functional ability, due to the reduction in stability of the trunk caused by the abnormal length and position of the abdominal wall musculature. Models have been developed to examine the role a functionally tight abdominal wall plays in reducing tension on the spinal musculature and intervertebral joints, and stabilizing the spine.

Given this proven anatomic relationship, several studies have correlated the correction of diastasis with the alleviation of chronic back pain, a result which has been attributed to the spinal stabilization that occurs after plication. Other studies have demonstrated similar improvements in abdominal strength and functional status following abdominoplasty without plication of the abdominal wall, suggesting perhaps that shifting the center of gravity through tissue resection alone can significantly improve postural stability. This becomes an important question as plication of the abdominal wall is not without risk. Increasing the intra-abdominal pressure with plication may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolus and can restrict lung volumes which may lead to increased risk of postoperative pneumonia. Fabio Nahas, a pioneer of abdominoplasty, questions whether rectus plication is necessary to improve spinal stability, or if simply removing excess abdominal tissue alone can improve persistent back pain without subjecting patients to the increased risks of anterior abdominal wall plication.

### Muscle elasticity is different in individuals with diastasis recti abdominis than healthy volunteers [^115JjShQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is the enlargement of the distance between the edges of the recti abdominis along the linea alba with no fascial defect. Normally, the rectus muscles are fused at the midline with no more than 1 to 2 cm separation. A significant number of women are affected by DRA during the prenatal and postnatal periods, resulting in functional problems, such as back pain and hernia.

Clinically, DRA is evaluated by finger breadth. The widths of the two recti abdominis muscles are assessed by palpation 4.5 cm above and 4.5 cm below the umbilicus, along the linea alba. Separation is observed most commonly at the umbilicus. A width greater than or equal to the width of two fingers is defined as DRA. No separation or a width of less than two fingers is defined as no DRA. However, in the past twenty years, the reliability of palpation has been debated. Therefore, prior studies investigated the application of advanced imaging technology, like B-mode ultrasound (US), on the evaluation of inter-rectus distance (IRD) measurement. Most studies demonstrate the superior accuracy and validity of imaging tools compared to palpation.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^112TBydf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This procedure was performed on a small number of patients and longer follow-up is needed. The short-term outcomes showed good results in terms of postoperative pain and decrease of preoperative symptoms. This technique is feasible and requires a short operating time. Associated ventral hernias can be repaired easily. Since this procedure avoids disconnection of the umbilicus, in contrast to other similar laparoscopic procedures, it allows synchronous abdominoplasty.

### The general surgeon's perspective of rectus diastasis. A systematic review of treatment options [^111LLG6z]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscles (DRAM) is characterised by thinning and widening of the linea alba, combined with laxity of the ventral abdominal musculature. This causes the midline to "bulge" when intra-abdominal pressure is increased. Plastic surgery treatment for DRAM has been thoroughly evaluated, though general surgical treatments and the efficacy of physiotherapy remain elusive. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate both general surgical and physiotherapeutic treatment options for restoring DRAM in terms of postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, and recurrence rates.

Method

MEDLINE ®, Embase, PubMed, PubMed Central ®, The cochrane central registry of controlled trials (CENTRAL), Google Scholar, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) were searched using the following terms: 'rectus diastasis', 'diastasis recti', 'midline', and 'abdominal wall'. All clinical studies concerning general surgical or physiotherapeutic treatment of DRAM were eligible for inclusion.

Result

Twenty articles describing 1.691 patients (1.591 surgery/100 physiotherapy) were included. Surgical interventions were classified as plication techniques (313 patients; 254 open/59 laparoscopic), modified hernia repair techniques (68 patients, all open), and combined hernia & DRAM techniques (1.210 patients; 1.149 open/40 hybrid). The overall methodological quality was low. Plication techniques with interrupted sutures and mesh reinforcement were applied most frequently for DRAM repair. Open repairs were performed in 85% of patients. There was no difference in postoperative complications or recurrence rate after laparoscopic or open procedures, or between plication and modified hernia repair techniques. Physiotherapy programmes were unable to reduce IRD in a relaxed state. Though reduction of IRD during muscle contraction was described.

Conclusion

Both plication-based methods and hernia repair methods are used for DRAM repair. Based on the current literature, no clear distinction in recurrence rate, postoperative complications, or patient reported outcomes can be made. Complete resolution of DRAM, measured in a relaxed state, following a physiotherapy training programme is not described in current literature. Physiotherapy can achieve a limited reduction in IRD during muscle contraction, though the impact of this finding on patient satisfaction, cosmesis, or function outcome is unclear.

### Diastasis recti abdominis: a practical and effective width-length classification based on ultrasound measurements and its clinical validation [^113Lx5Xx]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to establish a simple and practical classification to guide the clinical treatment of diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) based on ultrasound characteristics with different severities of DRA, and to verify its clinical utility.

Methods

We retrospectively enrolled 301 DRA patients as pilot cohort and divided into Conservative Treatment Group and Surgical Group according to clinical outcomes. A new Width-Length classification was summarized based on ultrasound measurements of the width and length of midline separation. Then, 100 DRA patients were enrolled prospectively as validation cohort, and diagnostic performance was evaluated by clinical treatment.

Results

The Width-Length classification in pilot cohort was as follows: Type 1 (n = 108), open only at M3; Type 2 (n = 63), open at M3 and either M2 or M4 (inter-rectus distance at M3 < 47mm); Type 3 (n = 44), open at M3 and either M2 or M4 (inter-rectus distance at M3 ≥ 47mm); Type 4 (n = 74), open at M3, along with other two sites of M1, M2, M4, or M5; Type 5 (n = 12), open at M2, M3, and M4, along with M1 or M5, or both. DRA patients in Type 1–2 were recommended for conservative treatment, and in Type 3–5 were recommended for surgical treatment (all P < .05). In the validation cohort, the accuracy of Width-Length classification in determining treatment strategy was 86.0%.

Conclusions

This study proposes a Width-Length classification based on the width and length of midline separation on ultrasound, which was validated to be simple, practical and effective in guiding DRA treatment.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117D61h]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To quantitatively synthesise the evidence on the acute effect of exercise on inter-rectus distance, we used a random effects multilevel meta-analytic approach to account for dependency between effect sizes (ie, the correlation between effect sizes due to multiple measures or submeasures of the same outcome within a study). In such cases, outcome measures and comparisons from the same study were nested within the study first, and variance in observed effect sizes was decomposed into sampling, within-study and between-studies variance. The statistical heterogeneity I² statistic was also estimated in the context of a multilevel meta-analytical approach, that is, within-cluster heterogeneity (multiple arms from the same study) and between-cluster heterogeneity (effect sizes across studies).

Unless otherwise specified, studies were not included in the meta-analyses if data were reported incompletely (eg, indices of dispersion or number of participants not provided). Studies reporting continuous outcomes in other measures of central tendency and/or dispersion (ie, median, range, SE) were converted to mean and SD for analyses. For studies reporting data that could not be meta-analysed, the results were presented as a narrative synthesis structured around each outcome. Within each outcome, results were organised by study design. In this respect, results from non-RCTs (pre-interventio vs post-intervention studies) reporting on inter-rectus distance measured at rest were synthesised descriptively as measurement sites for inter-rectus distance varied across studies.

Equity, diversity and inclusion statement

Our study population included women of reproductive ages from 24 different countries, including low- and middle-income and high-income countries, from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and with no exclusion criteria on gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, socioeconomic status, chronic illness or disease. The author group consisted of students, researchers and clinicians at all career stages (junior, mid-career and senior) who spoke four languages (English, French, Spanish and Arabic). Two authors are people of colour. However, all members of the author group are from two high-income countries in North America.

Patient and public involvement statement

Patient preferences were obtained via an online survey to inform decisions made by the Guidelines Consensus Panel regarding the selection of the outcomes of interest but were otherwise not involved in the project.

### Is it possible to repair diastasis recti and shorten the aponeurosis at the same time? [^111YmwGn]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal wall deformity secondary to pregnancy is multidirectional. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath is the most widely used technique for correction of this condition. However, it would be desirable to simultaneously perform the transverse and longitudinal repair of this deformity. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the length of the musculoaponeurotic layer after diastasis recti repair using triangular mattress sutures.

Methods

Thirty-one women with Nahas' type III/A deformity were divided into two groups: the triangular mattress suture (TS) group and the continuous suture (CS) group. All patients underwent conventional abdominoplasty and diastasis recti repair with medial longitudinal plication performed between two metal clips. The two types of suture were used in both groups. In the TS group, after a CS was performed and removed, TSs were used and maintained in place. In the CS group, the order of suture placement was reversed. The distance between clips was measured before and immediately after suturing and at 3 weeks and 6 months postoperatively using plain abdominal radiographs. Statistical analysis was conducted using Friedman's analysis of variance and Wilcoxon's test.

Results

The use of TSs significantly reduced the length of the aponeurosis compared with both the intraoperative situation without suture (P < 0.001) and the use of CS (intraoperatively and 6 months after surgery; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The repair of diastasis recti using TSs resulted in vertical shortening of musculoaponeurotic layer immediately after the procedure and in the long term.

### Preaponeurotic endoscopic repair (REPA) of diastasis recti: a single surgeon's experience [^116Pt4G6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diastasis recti is a pathology that affects not only the abdominal wall but also the stability of lumbopelvic muscles, consequently altering urinary and digestive functionality. Preaponeurotic endoscopic repair (REPA) is an endoscopic alternative to tummy tuck for the treatment of diastasis. In this study, the outcomes of REPA application by a single surgeon are presented.

Methods

A total of 172 patients underwent REPA for the treatment of diastasis recti between August 2017 and December 2019. One hundred twenty-four patients were followed for at least one year. Sixty-three patients responded to a survey on satisfaction and quality of life 12 months after surgery.

Results

Three (2.4%) recurrences occurred, of which two occurred in the same patient. The main postoperative complications observed were 12 (9.7%) seromas, 3 (2.4%) haematomas, a single wound infection, 3 (2.4%) cases of skin fold formation, and a case of trophic skin lesion that required negative pressure therapy. Quality of life after surgery, as reported by 63 patients who responded to the survey, was satisfactory.

Conclusions

REPA is a safe and effective technique for diastasis recti treatment, representing a valid alternative to abdominoplasty. Since there is no need to access the peritoneal cavity and the mesh is onlay, there are no risks of bowel damage or adhesions between the intestine and prosthesis.

### Diastasis recti abdominis rehabilitation in the postpartum period: a scoping review of current clinical practice [^112Y4N1x]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is a connective tissue condition characterized by a separation of the two rectus abdominis (RA) muscles along the linea alba (LA) due to stretching and thinning. Separation is visible during an abdominal contraction, appearing either like a bulge or invagination through the midline of the anterior abdominal wall. DRA primarily affects women antenatally and postpartum; prevalence varies between 66 and 100% in the final trimester of pregnancy and up to 53% within 24 h of delivery. Natural resolution is reported during the first 8 weeks postpartum, after which time spontaneous resolution plateaus. However, some researchers suggest that recovery might still be ongoing at 6 months postpartum, and, despite limited research, DRA is found to be present in 36% of women at 12 months postnatally.

Assessment and diagnosis of DRA are performed via inter-recti distance (IRD) measurement. Ultrasound and calipers are recommended as the most reliable IRD assessment methods. Currently, there is no consensus about cut-off points for diagnosis, although some researchers consider ultrasound measurements of 2.2–2.3 cm at the umbilicus level to be clinically important. Beer et al. utilizing healthy nulliparous women, classified ultrasound-measured IRDs during rest with DRA if > 1.5 cm at the xiphoid, > 2.2 cm at 3 cm above the umbilicus, and > 1.6 cm at 2 cm below the umbilicus.

The abdominal wall plays a significant role in maintaining posture, trunk and pelvic mobility and stability, adequate breathing quality, and abdominal viscera support. Stretching and thinning of the LA during gestation is a result of connective tissue laxity and mechanical strain from hormonal changes and greater intra-abdominal pressure. Abdominal bulging results from visceral protrusion between rectus bellies, whereas abdominal invagination results from linea alba posterior distortion. Both clinical signs, evident in DRA, can cause significant aesthetic concerns for postpartum women. Additionally, modifications in muscle pull angles may alter body mechanics and impair the ability of the abdominal muscle to generate force and the ability of the fascia to transfer loads across the midline. Although there is weak evidence on the effects of DRA on trunk and pelvic dysfunctions or imbalances, some researchers claim that DRA-associated muscle changes may impair abdominal muscle strength, modify breathing patterns, and lead to low back or pelvic girdle pain, or other pelvic floor disorders.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)): part B [^113JxDAb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Indications for surgery

Diastasis recti, even when associated with significant protrusion, does not represent a true hernia and poses no risk of incarceration or strangulation. Thus, the decision for surgery is based on functional and/or cosmetic impairment. In the majority of studies, repair is performed as part of abdominoplasty or ventral hernia repair [4–6].

In order to identify predictive factors for successful surgery, Strigård et al. correlated preoperative Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire scores with postoperative improvement in abdominal muscle strength. Patients were predominantly female (55/57) with median age of 43 years and median BMI of 23 kg/m². The study found that pain while being seated for longer than 30 min and pain limiting the ability to participate in sports are preoperative predictors for successful surgery [7]. In another study by the same group of authors, patients were randomized between surgery and a training program supervised by a physiotherapist. Surgery resulted in significantly improved abdominal wall function compared to patients in the non-operative group [8].

Because the rectus abdominis muscles help stabilize the spine, researchers were interested in finding an association between diastasis recti and low back pain [9, 10]. After conducting a systematic review, Benjamin et al. concluded that there was a small association between diastasis recti and pelvic organ prolapse, and that diastasis recti may be associated with impaired health-related quality of life, impaired abdominal muscle strength and low back pain severity [10]. Wether there is an underlying connective tissue problem to explain the association remains unanswered.

Surgical technique

Surgical options for treatment of diastasis recti include linea alba plication, modified hernia repair techniques, minimally invasive techniques (endoscopic or laparoscopic), or a combination of open and minimally invasive (hybrid) techniques. A systematic review by Mommers et al. included 1591 patients and failed to demonstrate a difference in outcomes among different surgical approaches [4]. Another two systematic reviews showed high patient satisfaction after surgery, but no difference between the different surgical options [5, 6].

### Clarifying the impact: does diastasis recti correction truly alleviate low back pain? [^113jdHnR]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) significantly impairs quality of life and is frequently associated with diastasis recti abdominis (DRA), particularly in postpartum women. This study aims to evaluate the impact of lipoabdominoplasty with rectus muscle plication on LBP, core function, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in women with DRA.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled female patients who underwent lipoabdominoplasty with rectus muscle plication in 2023 for DRA correction (2–10 cm). Exclusion criteria included BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², hernias, prior abdominal wall surgery, major comorbidities, and unrealistic expectations. Pain and function were assessed preoperatively (T0) and postoperatively at 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for LBP and BODY-Q Physical Function and Symptoms domains. Complication rates were recorded.

Results

A total of 42 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean NRS scores decreased from 5.6 ± 1.2 at T0 to 2.9 ± 1.1 at T1 and 2.3 ± 1.0 at T2 (p < 0.001). BODY-Q Physical Function scores improved from 56.2 ± 8.4 at T0 to 75.5 ± 7.9 at T2 (p < 0.001). Physical Symptoms domain scores increased from 58.6 ± 9.1 to 78.3 ± 8.5 (p < 0.001). Minor complications occurred in 5 patients (11.9%), with no major adverse events.

Conclusion

Lipoabdominoplasty with rectus plication significantly reduced LBP and improved core function and HRQL in women with DRA. These findings support its functional benefits beyond aesthetics.

### An efficient way to correct recurrent rectus diastasis [^115GxQzf]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent rectus diastasis is a troublesome complication because its correction requires an extensive procedure.

Case Reports

Two patients with recurrent rectus diastasis secondary to abdominoplasty corrected by plication of the anterior rectus sheath are presented. These patients had lateral insertion of the rectus muscles. They were treated by the advancement of the rectus muscles after undermining of the posterior rectus sheath and a two-layer closure to correct the rectus diastasis. Good cosmetic results and postoperative pain control were achieved in both cases.

Discussion

The causes, prevention, and treatment for this type of rectus diastasis are described. The main reason for recurrence of this deformity in these patients was lateral insertion of the rectus muscles on the costal margins. On the basis principle, an efficient technique to correct this deformity is described. A postoperative compute tomography scan with slices made at the same bony level as the preoperative control examination demonstrated total correction of rectus diastasis over a long-term follow-up evaluation.

Conclusion

Advancement of the recti muscles seems to be a reliable method for correcting recurrent rectus diastasis in patients with lateral insertion of the recti muscles.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1135nJ1m]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We assessed inconsistency across studies using statistical tests and visual inspection of forest plots. We used Cochran's Q (α = 0.05) to detect statistical heterogeneity and I² statistic to quantify the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity between studies. In the case where we observed high statistical heterogeneity (I² > 50%), we considered downgrading the evidence if the direction of the effect was inconsistent across most studies, with minimal overlap of CIs, and if such heterogeneity remained unexplained after conducting meta-regression and/or subgroup analyses. We considered indirectness as 'serious' when PICO criteria differed substantially across studies. Imprecision was considered 'serious' or 'very serious' when the sample size was small (< 300 in each arm or < 100 in each arm, respectively) and/or when the effect estimate was imprecise with wide CI, including the no-effect value, which does not rule out a small harm or negative effect. Publication bias was assessed when at least 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Otherwise, it was deemed non-estimable and not rated down. Initially, we planned to have two individuals independently assess the certainty of the evidence across each health outcome. However, it was amended for feasibility reasons. Therefore, one individual evaluated the certainty of the evidence, and a second individual checked the GRADE tables as a quality control measure.

Evidence synthesis: statistical analysis and narrative synthesis

Meta-analyses were conducted using ReviewManager (RevMan) V.5.4 (Cochrane, London, UK). The mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean difference (SMD) in change scores (ie, post-intervention minus pre-intervention scores) was calculated for continuous outcomes. SMD effect sizes were calculated using Hedges' g. An effect size of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 were considered small, moderate and large, respectively. Quantitative synthesis of continuous outcomes was conducted using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models with an inverse-variance approach.ORs were calculated using post-intervention events or percentage data for dichotomous outcomes. Dichotomous outcome analyses were conducted with a Mantel-Haenszel random effects method. Clinical significance was considered as a ≥ 25% reduction in the odds of an outcome. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^115JYPNN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

In case of moderate to severe diastasis, retrorectus repair reinforcement with sublay mesh, based on the Rives–Stoppa principles, should be considered. The placement of a mesh in a retrorectus plane allows greater improvement in muscular strength and provides the most durable repair, with no adherence to bowel loops. Postoperative complications, include infection, seroma, mesh extrusion, recurrence, nerve injury, postoperative pain, skin necrosis, and visceral injury.

The laparoscopic procedure we describe combines the Rives–Stoppa principles with mechanical plication of the rectus fascia using a stapler. Costa et al. described a similar technique for incisional hernia repair in patients who previously underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass.

We decided to apply a modified Costa's technique as a treatment option in patients affected by diastasis recti, and we aimed to overcome some concerns raised by this technique when used in ventral hernias repairs, such as hernia width, redundant hernia sac left in the subcutaneous tissue, and the persistence of the pervious surgical scar.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using a laparoscopic approach to perform mechanical plication of the rectus fascia with a diastasis recti > 2 cm using a linear endoscopic stapler.

### Do abdominal binders prevent seroma formation and recurrent diastasis following abdominoplasty? [^113uZhfN]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For decades, the postoperative wearing of abdominal binders has been suggested to reduce dead space and prevent mobilization of the musculoaponeurotic layer in an attempt to decrease the risk of seroma formation and recurrent diastasis.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate whether the postoperative wearing of an abdominal binder provides any additional contribution to the reduction of either seroma formation or recurrent diastasis recti when abdominoplasty is performed with quilting sutures.

Methods

Thirty-four women undergoing abdominoplasty were randomized into 2 groups: the binder group (n = 16) wore abdominal binders during the postoperative period, whereas the control group (n = 18) did not. Ultrasound examination was performed on postoperative days 7 and 14 to assess seroma formation and at 6 months postoperatively to assess recurrence of diastasis recti. A t test for independent samples was applied to compare means between 2 numeric variables. Generalized estimation equation models were used to evaluate seroma volume at different time points for the 2 groups.

Results

No significant differences in seroma volume were found between groups on postoperative days 7 (P = 0.830) and 14 (P = 0.882). Seven cases of subclinical recurrent diastasis were observed by ultrasound examination in the supraumbilical (4 cases) and infraumbilical regions (3 cases), but without significant differences (P = 1.000) between the 2 groups. Recurrent diastasis was not detected during physical examinations.

Conclusions

The postoperative wearing of abdominal binders was not effective in preventing either seroma formation or recurrent diastasis following abdominoplasty with quilting sutures.

Chapter 2. Is there an indication for operative treatment of diastasis recti without hernia formation?

Mazen Iskandar MD, Dimitri Ranev, MD, and George Ferzli, MD

The following search terms were used: "diastasis recti" or "diastasis rectus" or "diastasis of the recti" or "diastasis of the rectus" or "rectus diastasis" or "rectus abdominis diastasis" or "divarication". A systemic review of the literature was done in September 2017. A total of 219 papers were found. After selecting relevant studies, 20 articles were used for this review.

Introduction

Diastasis recti is a diagnosis that surgeons have to manage on a regular basis. It is simply described as bulging of the linea alba with increased intra–intra-abdominal pressure. Typically, women during pregnancy develop diastasis recti which regresses within a year after child birth. However, in a third of those patients, the diastasis persists [1]. The width of the linea alba is measured at 2 reference points. The first is at 3 cm superior to the umbil-icus and the second is 2 cm inferior. A patient is considered to have diastasis if the width between the 2 medial edges of the recti is greater than 22 mm at the first reference point and greater than 16 mm at the second point [2]. Nahas proposed a classification that included 4 types of "myofascial deformities" with a tailored treatment for each type [3]. In addition to diastasis recti, these types took into consideration other factors such as the appearance of the waist line and the presence of lateral laxity. Most women with diastasis recti after pregnancy fall under type A and are treated with plication of the anterior rectus sheath.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^1147Ljqo]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

A 73-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2-week history of right sided abdominal discomfort and swelling. Six weeks prior, he had been treated for a right sided vesicular rash by his primary care doctor. Examination revealed a diffuse, reducible nontender swelling of the right abdominal wall with overlying post inflammatory hyperpigmentation in an 11th – 12th thoracic vertebrae dermatomal distribution (Figs 1 and 2). Hyperesthesia was also noted in this area.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Spigelian hernia
B. Diastasis recti
C. Postherpetic pseudohernia
D. Erythema ab igne
E. Macrocytic lymphatic malformation

Answers:
A. Spigelian hernia – Incorrect. This occurs due to herniation through the Spigelian fascia comprised of transversus abdominis and internal oblique aponeuroses.
B. Diastasis recti – Incorrect. This occurs due to abnormal stretching of the linea alba, commonly associated with pregnancy, obesity, and prior abdominal surgery.
C. Postherpetic pseudohernia – Correct. A postherpetic pseudohernia is a rare motor complication of herpes zoster, occurring in 0.17% of cases. A postherpetic abdominal pseudohernia is defined by a partial protrusion of the abdominal wall caused by muscle paralysis, resulting in a unilateral swelling on the affected side. In our case, residual dermatomal postinflammatory hyperpigmentation from a recent episode of herpes zoster served as a key diagnostic clue. The onset of abdominal bulging usually occurs between 7 and 60 days following the initial cutaneous eruption. While the recognition and management of other complications of herpes zoster, such as Ramsay Hunt syndrome and herpes zoster ophthalmicus are well described, postherpetic pseudohernia remains under-recognized.
D. Erythema ab igne – Incorrect. Erythema ab igne is due to chronic exposure to heat below the threshold for thermal burn and presents with localized areas of reticulated erythema and hyperpigmentation.
E. Macrocytic lymphatic malformation – Incorrect. This is a benign cystic lesion composed of dilated lymphatic channels, which would be easily distinguished on imaging.

### Urinary incontinence and abdominal diastasis: a detailed analysis and surgical outcome in 100 patients undergoing abdominoplasty [^114zhfgX]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary incontinence (UI), particularly stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is a prevalent condition that significantly impacts the quality of life, especially in women. Abdominal diastasis recti, a separation of the rectus abdominis muscles, have been increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to UI due to its impact on core stability and intra-abdominal pressure regulation.

Objective

This study aims to explore the pathophysiological connection between diastasis recti and UI and to evaluate the effectiveness of diastasis correction during abdominoplasty in alleviating UI symptoms.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 100 female patients with abdominal diastasis and SUI who underwent abdominoplasty with diastasis repair. Preoperative and postoperative UI severity was assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), and pelvic floor muscle strength was measured via perineometry. Statistical analysis was performed to compare preoperative and postoperative outcomes.

Results

Postoperative outcomes demonstrated a significant reduction in ICIQ-SF scores (17.2 ± 4.8 to 6.8 ± 3.3, p < 0.01), a decrease in daily UI episodes (4.6 ± 1.5 to 1.1 ± 0.6, p < 0.01), and an improvement in pelvic floor strength (13.2 ± 3.4 mmHg to 18.5 ± 4.7 mmHg, p < 0.05). These findings indicate that diastasis recti repair restores core stability, alleviates pelvic floor strain, and significantly improves UI symptoms.

Conclusion

Diastasis recti correction during abdominoplasty offers substantial functional benefits beyond esthetic improvements, particularly in reducing UI symptoms. These results underscore the importance of considering diastasis repair as part of a comprehensive treatment approach for patients with concurrent abdominal wall dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore long-term outcomes.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^116XnV1K]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Possible risk factors for DRA 12 months post partum

Our data shows no clear risk factors for DRA 12 months post partum. The wide CI for the OR on heavy lifting indicates that this result should be interpreted with caution. In support, the same variable was only on the borderline using Fisher's exact test and due to the multiple variables investigated in this study, the risk of a type I error is increased. Data on heavy lifting was collected through the questionnaire, and was neither defined nor measured directly. Some authors have discussed how frequent lifting and carrying children may cause increased strain on the abdominal wall and DRA, without providing any direct data for this hypothesis. Hence, this proposed risk factor needs further investigation. There was no correlation between possible confounding factors and DRA or investigated risk factors; therefore, it was considered to be of no basis for calculating adjusted OR.

### Triangular mattress suture in abdominal diastasis to prevent epigastric bulging [^111wFUmo]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

In the classic abdominoplasty, the treatment of large diastasis recti with simple or vertical mattress sutures may result in a nonaesthetic bulge. The surgeon may produce a craniocaudal bulge deformity by treating the flaccidity in the horizontal plane only, although it occurs in all directions. The authors describe the triangular mattress suture for the treatment of large diastasis recti, and demonstrate the mechanism involved in producing an epigastric bulge. Also presented is their clinical experience with 56 patients, with a 3-year follow-up, using this new plication method. The triangular mattress suture is a simple, quick, and effective way to correct abdominal diastasis and to avoid the epigastric bulge deformity with no added morbidity.

### Surgical management of diastasis recti: a systematic review of insurance coverage in the United States [^117LG264]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

As elective surgery becomes more popular, the stringency of insurance coverage policies has increased exponentially. Many patients with diastasis recti (DR) are denied coverage of the corrective surgery that has been shown to improve function and quality of life in this patient population. Plastic surgeons are frustrated by the lack of guidelines and sparsity of coverage for surgical correction of DR.

Methods

Fifty-four US insurance companies and Medicare were reviewed to determine their policies of coverage. These policies were compared with the guidelines set forth by the American Society of Plastic surgery and current literature on DR.

Results

Insurance company policy for DR repair is not clear nor well established. Of the 55 policies reviewed in this study, 51 had an established policy. Forty of these companies would not cover abdominoplasty to repair DR under any circumstances. Eleven companies required preauthorization to ensure that the patient met the requirements of medical necessity. These requirements differed from company to company. A comprehensive list was compiled of details required for preauthorization.

Conclusions

Insurance company policies do not recognize the spectrum of patients with DR and the necessity of abdominoplasty to relieve symptoms of patients with severe debilitation. The current Common Procedural Terminology coding classifies abdominoplasty to repair DR solely as a cosmetic procedure. Policies for DR repair should be amended to include a functional procedure reimbursement for severe DR and include detailed guidelines for coverage requirements to simplify the reimbursement process.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^116B4cCF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

On postoperative day one and two, 3 g of paracetamol was administered to all patients and 10 mg of ketorolac was administered to patients with persistent pain after surgery. A survey among patients showed a progressive reduction of postoperative pain until its disappearance on postoperative day 7. The median visual analog scale (VAS) score on the first postoperative day was 5.5 ± 2. The average follow-up period was 6 months (range 2–12 months).

Of all patients, 57 (77%) completed the preoperative and postoperative questionnaires.

Of all the patients, 31 (42%) had urinary incontinence before the surgery, while only 2 patients reported this symptom after surgery. Lower back pain was reported before surgery in 40 patients (54%), and 36 patients (90%) experienced improvement. 21 patients (28%) had respiratory symptoms, mostly shortness of breath, and 18 patients (86%) reported improvement with diastasis correction. Abdominal swelling and feeling of distress were also common symptoms in 43 patients (60%), with a postoperative improvement of 84%. In fact, only 7 patients reported this symptom 6 months after surgery. Even though these data are preliminary and based on patients' perception and personal experience, they seem promising. Further follow-up studies are needed. The results are shown in Table 2.

### Obesity indicators and female asthma risk: the mediating role of white blood cell count based on NHANES data analysis [^115P3NoZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, asthma exhibits notable differences in epidemiological characteristics and pathogenesis between sexes. Globally, asthma prevalence is consistently higher in women than in men, especially after puberty and in adulthood. This difference may be closely related to sex-specific hormonal fluctuations (e.g. estrogen, progesterone), fat distribution patterns (e.g. greater abdominal and subcutaneous fat accumulation), and stronger immune responses. During special physiological stages, such as the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause, significant hormonal changes may affect airway inflammation, immune regulation, and asthma phenotypes. Furthermore, pregnancy and postpartum conditions, such as diastasis recti, may lead to abnormal fat distribution, altered metabolic status, and immune dysregulation, thereby potentially increasing asthma risk or affecting disease progression.

The NHANES dataset includes variables specific to women, such as menopausal status and reproductive history, which facilitate systematic evaluation of their potential impact on asthma risk. These factors may indirectly contribute to asthma development through modulation of hormone levels, fat distribution, and immune function. Studies have shown that menopause and related hormonal changes are associated with asthma risk, potentially mediated by changes in immune function and fat redistribution. In addition, estrogen fluctuations have been implicated in the regulation of airway inflammation and asthma phenotypes.

In summary, this study utilized data from NHANES 2009–2018 to systematically evaluate the associations of BMI, BRI, and WBC with asthma risk in women, aiming to elucidate the links between obesity, inflammation, and asthma in women, and to provide epidemiological evidence for exploring potential mechanisms.

### Technical aspects of inter-recti distance measurement with ultrasonographic imaging for physiotherapy purposes: the scoping review [^111nkASs]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inter-recti distance (IRD) measurement using musculoskeletal USI has been used in physiotherapy research, in particular, to investigate pregnancy-related diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) and to seek its effective treatment methods. Severe and untreated diastasis may result in the formation of umbilical or epigastric hernias.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically map physiotherapy-related research articles that included descriptions of IRD measurement procedures using USI to present their similarities and differences, and formulate recommendations on the procedure.

Design

A scoping review was conducted according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, including 49 of 511 publications from three major databases. Publications were selected and screened by two independent reviewers whose decisions were consulted with a third reviewer. The main synthesized data items were: the examinees' body position, breathing phase, measurement sites, and DRA screening methods. The final conclusions and recommendations were the result of a consensus between seven reviewers from four research centers.

Results

Studies used 1–5 measurement sites that were differently determined. IRD was measured at the umbilicus (n = 3), at its superior (n = 16) and/or inferior border (n = 9), and at different levels: between 2 and 12 cm above the umbilicus, or a third of the distance and halfway between the umbilicus and xiphoid (n = 37); between 2 and 4.5 cm below the umbilicus or halfway between the umbilicus and pubis (n = 27). Different approaches were used to screen subjects for DRA.

Conclusions

The discrepancies between the measurement procedures prevent between-study comparisons. The DRA screening method should be standardized. IRD measurement protocol standardization has been proposed.

Critical Relevance Statement

This scoping review indicates that the inter-recti distance measurement procedures using ultrasound imaging differ between studies, preventing between-study comparisons. Based on the results synthesis, the measurement protocol standardization has been proposed.

Key Points

The inter-recti distance measurement procedures using USI differ between studies. Proposed standardization concerns body position, breathing phase, measurements number per location. Determination of measurement locations considering individual linea alba length is suggested. Recommended locations: umbilical top, ½ of umbilical top-xiphoid, ¼ of umbilical top-xiphoid/pubis distances. Diastasis recti abdominis diagnostic criteria are needed for proposed measurement locations.

### A new minimally invasive technique for the repair of diastasis recti: a pilot study [^111Kgjj9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical technique (Video included)

The patient is placed in a supine/combined lithotomy position: thighs were extended (120°) (Fig. 1). Preoperative antibiotics are administered, and general endotracheal anesthesia is induced. A Foley catheter is placed and then removed at the end of the procedure. The abdomen is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

Fig. 1
Patient's position

Pneumoperitoneum is induced using an open technique, placing the first 12-mm trocar 2 cm above the pubic symphysis. The abdomen is insufflated with carbon dioxide up to a pressure of 12 mmHg.

A 30° laparoscope is inserted, and the abdomen and abdominal wall are inspected.

Additional trocars are inserted under direct vision in the following locations: a 12-mm trocar in the left iliac fossa and a 5-mm trocar in the right iliac fossa. If a 5-mm laparoscope is available, two 5-mm trocars and one 12-mm trocar can be used (Fig. 2). When necessary, lysis of adhesions to the abdominal wall is performed. Hernias possibly encountered along the median line are reduced into the abdominal cavity and the sac is resected. Redundant adipose tissue is dissected from the posterior layer of the anterior abdominal wall until the defect is exposed (Fig. 3), and the falciform ligament is dissected.

### Autologous dermal mesh in severe postpregnancy recti muscles diastasis [^112KDfEj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The severe postpregnancy diastasis of recti muscles causes a biomechanical alteration of the statics of the trunk and an unaesthetic bulging of the abdominal wall. This is always combined with cutaneous and subcutaneous excess, which is different on a case-by-case basis. There is not a consensus on the best way to treat it. The anterior sheath plication is the mostly used surgical technique, and many surgeons believe that the use of mesh is necessary in the cases of severe diastasis. The authors here report the outcomes of the use of dermal automesh in the retromuscular layer.

Materials and Methods

Between January 2015 and December 2019, a retrospective study on 101 patients was conducted. All patients underwent the repairment of the diastasis recti with transversalis sheath plication and dermal automesh reinforcement in the sublay fashion. In addition, all the patients had an abdominal wall ultrasound before the operation and an ultrasound after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and every year afterward. The median follow-up was 32.5 months RESULTS: No major complications, such as infections, extrusions, respiratory diseases or thrombosis, were reported. The follow-up abdominal wall ultrasound reported the absence of muscle recti diastasis in all patients. All patients were completely satisfied with the final result.

Conclusion

In postpregnancy women, the severe recti muscles diastasis dermal automesh repair is safe and effective. The dermal graft is easy to handle, has demonstrated comparable tensile strength to alloplastic mesh and is available in abdominoplasty or miniabdominoplasty from the excised skin.

### Robotic-assisted endoscopic onlay repair (R-ENDOR) for concomitant ventral hernias and diastasis recti: initial results and surgical technique [^1126w8fT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The surgical management of midline ventral hernias complicated by concomitant diastasis recti presents a significant clinical challenge. The Endoscopic Onlay Repair (ENDOR) offers a minimally invasive solution, effectively addressing both conditions. This study focuses on describing the adaptation of ENDOR to a robotic platform, termed R-ENDOR, aiming to report initial outcomes along with other established robotic surgical approaches.

Methods

This retrospective case series study included consecutive adult patients who underwent R-ENDOR approach from October 2018 to April 2023, performed by a single surgeon. A comprehensive description of the surgical technique is included. Patient demographics, operative, and hernia-specific characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes are described.

Results

A total of 15 patients undergoing R-ENDOR for ventral hernia repair with diastasis recti plication were included. The median age was 59 years (IQR 42–63), with 60% (n = 9) female patients. The majority (86%, n = 13) had an ASA score of ≤ 2, and the median BMI was 24 kg/m², with 20% (n = 3) classified as obese. Median hernia size was 2 cm (IQR 2–2.25), with a median diastasis length of 19 cm (IQR 15–21.5) and width of 4 cm (IQR 3–6). The median operative time was 129 min (IQR 113–166). Most repairs (93%, n = 14) were reinforced with mesh, predominantly self-fixating (73.3%, n = 11). Eighty percent of patients (n = 12) were discharged on the same day, with a median follow-up of 153 days (IQR 55–309). Notable complications included clinically significant seromas in 20% of patients (n = 3), long-term hypoesthesia in 40% (n = 6), and readmission in one patient (6.6%) for surgical site infection (SSI) requiring IV antibiotic therapy.

Conclusion

Midline ventral hernias associated to diastasis recti can be managed robotically by ENDOR with safe and consistent 90-day outcomes in a carefully selected group of patients.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^111zWYrH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (V.21, Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Background variables were reported as means with SDs or frequencies, and percentages. Women with and without DRA were compared in relation to risk factors with independent sample Student's t-test for numeric data and χ²/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs for the different risk factors reported as OR with 95% CI. Spearman's correlation between variables was used to investigate the basis for adjustments for possible confounding factors. Differences in report of lumbopelvic pain were compared with Fisher's exact test. Missing data were excluded. The significance level was set to > 0.05.

### Diastasis recti abdominis rehabilitation in the postpartum period: a scoping review of current clinical practice [^116sBHkj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Despite exercise being the standard approach to diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) rehabilitation, there is no consensus on the most effective exercise routine and adjunct modalities for reducing DRA and improving functional parameters. The present study is aimed at investigating evidence for DRA rehabilitation in postpartum women, as well as knowledge gaps and areas for future research.

Methods

For this scoping review a systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and PEDro up to November 2022. Selection criteria included studies investigating exercise therapy interventions both with and without adjunct modalities for postpartum DRA. Sample characteristics, diagnostic criteria, program design, and outcome measures were recorded. Critical appraisal of clinical trials was performed using PEDro classification.

Results

Twenty-eight studies were included: 14 clinical trials, 3 case series, and 11 observational studies. DRA exercises that focused on deep and superficial muscles, pelvic floor muscles, respiratory maneuvers, functional exercises, or alternative interventions (yoga, suspension training, hypopressive exercise) and adjunct modalities showed promising results in reducing the inter-recti distance and related dysfunction. However, there was great variability in diagnostic criteria and methods, DRA severity, time post-birth, and exercise program design.

Conclusions

Reviewed studies provide valuable insights into exercise therapy, but it is important to recognize their limitations, as variability in diagnostic criteria, sample characteristics, and exercise program design hinder the generalizability of the findings. Further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence in this area and provide reliable recommendations for clinical practice.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xgt5t]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A consensus on an inter-rectus distance cut-off to diagnose diastasis rectus abdominis also does not currently exist in the literature. Ultrasound studies often draw on Beer et al, who classified women to have diastasis recti abdominis if the mean inter-rectus distance (measured at 3 cm above the umbilicus) is greater than the 90th percentile of the normative values reported for nulliparous women (> 2.2 cm). However, more recently, Kaufmann et al conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to define diastasis recti abdominis in adults using CT and found that an inter-rectus distance at 3 cm above the umbilicus may be considered normal up to 3.4 cm (80th percentile in asymptomatic adults). This is an important finding to reflect on, as the exercise intervention studies in this review included exercise groups with participants who had inter-rectus distances below the 80th percentile, as proposed by Kaufman et al. More research is needed investigating inter-rectus distance in postpartum individuals who present with larger inter-rectus distances (ie, > 5 cm). The clinical significance of an increased inter-rectus distance must be determined before postpartum individuals are prescribed abdominal muscle training to treat diastasis recti abdominis. There is limited evidence suggesting an increased inter-rectus distance is associated with decreased abdominal strength and enduranceand with low back pain severity, which may provide a rationale for abdominal muscle training in the postpartum period; however, more research is needed in this area.

Furthermore, contemporary evidence has proposed that a wide (or increased) inter-rectus distance may not be functionally problematic if the linea alba can stiffen when a task demands load transfer across the midline. Therefore, until a link between a clinically meaningful inter-rectus distance and the functional limitations of diastasis recti abdominis is established, it may be premature to conduct RCTs that focus on inter-rectus distance as a primary outcome. There is evidence that suggests postpartum individuals who present with diastasis recti abdominis are concerned about the appearance of their diastasis recti abdominis, and they report feeling weak in their abdominal muscles. Therefore, future research that investigates the impact of an increased inter-rectus distance on perceived abdominal strength, abdominal pain, physical function and body image satisfaction is needed and may prove to be more clinically meaningful to postpartum individuals.

### Impact of abdominoplasty with diastasis recti correction on female sexual function: a 1-year prospective follow-up study [^114S7NZM]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is a condition commonly affecting women postpartum, often leading to functional impairments, negative body image, and reduced quality of life. While abdominoplasty with DRA correction is known to improve core stability and aesthetic outcomes, its potential impact on female sexual function remains underexplored.

Objective

This prospective study investigates the effects of conventional abdominoplasty with DRA correction on female sexual function using the validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) over a 1-year follow-up period.

Methods

A total of 37 female patients with postpartum DRA (inter-rectus distance > 4 cm) who underwent conventional abdominoplasty were included. Sexual function was assessed preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively using the FSFI, encompassing six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis was performed to identify significant changes in FSFI scores and their correlation with patient satisfaction.

Results

Postoperative FSFI scores demonstrated a significant improvement in total score (mean increase: 7.1; p < 0.005) and in the domains of arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction. Improvements in desire, lubrication, and pain were observed but not statistically significant. Higher patient satisfaction correlated with greater FSFI score improvement, although this was not statistically conclusive due to the small sample size. Notably, menopausal patients exhibited significant enhancements in overall FSFI scores (mean increase: 7.0; p < 0.005). One dissatisfied patient reported a decline in FSFI, highlighting individual variability.

Conclusions

Conventional abdominoplasty with DRA correction significantly improves sexual function in women, particularly in domains of arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction, while enhancing overall quality of life. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing functional and psychological aspects in surgical outcomes. Further research, including larger controlled studies and longer follow-up, is necessary to confirm these results and explore predictive factors for optimal outcomes.

### Prospective observational study of abdominal wall reconstruction with THT technique in primary midline defects with diastasis recti: clinical and functional outcomes in 110 consecutive patients [^117HgvAC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical treatment of diastasis recti is still a matter of debate. Open approaches such as abdominoplasty, which offer the possibility to combine reparation of the diastasis with abdominal cosmetic surgery, are challenged by the emerging less-invasive laparoscopic or robotic techniques that offer shorter recovery for patients. However, evidence in favour of one of the two approaches concerning both short- and long-term complications and functional results is still lacking. In this paper, we analysed clinical and functional results of a new endo-laparoscopic technique for midline reconstruction (THT technique) in patients with primary abdominal wall defects associated with diastasis recti.

Methods

Prospective observational study on 110 consecutive patients was submitted to endo-laparoscopic reconstruction of the abdominal wall with linear staplers. Morbidity and relapse rates with clinical and radiological follow-up were recorded at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after the operation. Data regarding the impact of surgery on patients' quality of life (EuraHSQol) on chronic low back pain (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI) and urinary stress incontinence (Incontinence Severity Index, ISI) were gathered.

Results

After a mean follow-up of 14 months, the morbidity rate was 9.1% and no recurrences were recorded. 6-month follow-up ultrasound showed a rectus muscles mean distance of 6.7 mm; EuraHSQol, ODI, and ISI scores significantly improved in 93%, 77%, and 63% of the cases, respectively.

Conclusions

The THT technique proved to be a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for corrective surgery of primary midline hernias associated with diastasis recti. Short- and mid-term results are encouraging but need to be confirmed by further studies with longer follow-up. The achieved midline reconstruction offers a significant improvement of patients' perceived quality of life through reduction of abdominal wall pain, bulging, low back pain, and urinary stress incontinence.

### Evaluation of the long-term stability of sheath plication using absorbable sutures in 51 patients with diastasis of the recti muscles: an ultrasonographic study [^114SeeFQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Rectus sheath plication within abdominoplasty is a standard treatment for diastasis of the recti muscles. There are questions regarding the efficacy and long-term stability of the correction of rectus diastasis and whether absorbable sutures work as well as nonabsorbable sutures.

Methods

The authors conducted a case-control study to assess the outcomes of recti muscle diastasis correction with absorbable suture. The authors assessed the outcomes by physical and ultrasonographic examinations and a patient questionnaire, which asked about the number of pregnancies and the types of deliveries, other abdominal operations before or after the abdominoplasty, and the interval of time required to return to full activity. During the examination, the interrecti distances were measured at three levels: halfway between the xiphoid and umbilicus, just above the umbilicus, and halfway between the umbilicus and the pubis. The same examination was performed on a control group of nulliparous women.

Results

The authors examined a group of 51 patients aged 25 to 64 years (mean, 41 years). The time interval between the operation and the ultrasonographic examination was 12 to 41 months (mean, 20.8 months). There was no statistically significant difference between the studied group and the control group with respect to their interrecti distances.

Conclusion

Rectus sheath plication using absorbable sutures in patients with diastasis of the recti muscles is a reliable method that maintains the long-term stability of the abdominal wall.

### Minimally invasive bilayer suturing technique for the repair of concomitant ventral hernias and diastasis recti [^115mS5n7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

According to EHS guidelines, mesh repair is recommended in case of concomitant diastasis recti (DR) and ventral hernia more than 1 cm in diameter. Since in this situation, the higher risk of hernia recurrence may be attributed to the weakness of aponeurotic layers, in our current practice, for hernias up to 3 cm, we use a bilayer suture technique. The study aimed at describing our surgical technique and evaluating the results of our current practice.

Methods

The technique combines suturing repair of the hernia orifice and diastasis correction by suture, and includes an open step through periumbilical incision and an endoscopic step. The study is an observational report on 77 cases of concomitant ventral hernias and DR.

Results

The median diameter of the hernia orifice was 1.5 cm (0.8–3). The median inter-rectus distance was 60 mm (30–120) at rest and 38 mm (10–85) at leg raise at tape measurement and 43 mm (25–92) and 35 mm (25–85) at CT scan respectively. Postoperative complications involved 22 seromas (28.6%), 1 hematoma (1.3%) and 1 early diastasis recurrence (1.3%). At mid-term evaluation, with 19 (12–33) months follow-up, 75 (97.4%) patients were evaluated. There were no hernia recurrences and 2 (2.6%) diastasis recurrences. The patients rated the result of their operation as excellent or good in 92% and 80% of the cases at global and esthetic evaluations, respectively. The result was rated bad at esthetic evaluation in 20% of the cases because the skin appearance was flawed, due to discrepancy between the unchanged cutaneous layer and the narrowed musculoaponeurotic layer.

Conclusion

The technique provides effective repair of concomitant diastasis and ventral hernias up to 3 cm. Nevertheless, patients should be informed that the skin appearance can be flawed, because of the discrepancy between the unchanged cutaneous layer and the narrowed musculoaponeurotic layer.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^115fe9nT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Prevalence of mild DRA was high both during pregnancy and after childbirth. No obvious risk factors were found, and there was no difference in report of lumbopelvic pain between the group with and without DRA 12 months post partum. There is a need for more research on the influence of DRA on abdominal strength and lumbopelvic pain, and the effect of preventative and treatment programmes.

What are the findings?

Prevalence of diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) among first-time pregnant Scandinavian women were 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4% and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post partum, respectively.
Age, height, mean weight before this pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, caesarean section, baby's birth weight, benign joint hypermobility syndrome, and level of abdominal and pelvic floor muscle exercise training and general exercise training 12 months post partum were not found to be risk factors for DRA.
Women with DRA were not more likely to report lumbopelvic pain compared with women without DRA 12 months after childbirth.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?

Given the high prevalence of mild diastasis recti abdominis, coaches and healthcare providers should assess whether the condition is present in post partum women.
This study indicates that mild diastasis is not associated with lumbopelvic pain, which is important information to give to women with this condition.

### A proposed classification and treatment algorithm for rectus diastasis: a prospective study [^113Eu5ve]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This prospective study is one of the few that includes patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcomes. Moreover, to our knowledge, no prospective study or clinical trial has reported outcomes using only sutures to repair diastasis over 6cm. While there is still no consensus concerning the optimal way to correct RD, our proposal aims to provide surgeons a safe treatment guide. This is the first study to support that a simple suture-based technique that almost every plastic surgeon can use is enough to correct RD. Since RD has been proven that it is not a true hernia, the use of sutures is more than adequate for its correction, and there is no need for extreme measures.

It is our hope that our study will be a valuable tool for the plastic surgery society and could help future surgeons as a treatment guide during abdominoplasty procedures and as a guide on how to report their outcomes in a practical yet viable in a private practice setting manner.

### Differences in linea alba stiffness and linea alba distortion between women with and without diastasis recti abdominis: the impact of measurement site and task [^1173J4pe]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The biomechanical implications of diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) are unknown.

Objectives

To (1) investigate the impact of DRA, measurement site, and task on inter-rectus distance (IRD), linea alba (LA) stiffness, and LA distortion measured at rest and during head-lift and semi-curl-up tasks; and (2) describe the relationships among IRD, LA stiffness, and LA distortion.

Methods

In this cross-sectional, observational cohort study, brightness-mode ultrasound imaging and shearwave elastography were used on a sample of 20 women. Inter-rectus distance, LA stiffness, and LA distortion were measured at 3 locations, while at rest and during head-lift and semi-curl-up maneuvers. All outcomes were compared between groups (DRA versus no DRA), sites, and tasks. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the relationships among IRD, mean and peak LA stiffness, and LA distortion.

Results

Eleven women with and 9 without DRA participated. Women with DRA demonstrated lower peak and mean LA stiffness and higher LA distortion compared to women without DRA. In women with DRA, IRD and LA distortion were not influenced by measurement site; IRD decreased, LA distortion increased, and LA stiffness did not change during the head lift and semi-curl-up compared to rest. In women without DRA, the LA was least stiff closest to the umbilicus; it increased in stiffness during the head lift and semi-curl-up and did not distort or change compared to rest.

Conclusion

Diastasis recti abdominis was associated with low LA stiffness and with LA distortion during a semi-curl-up task; the amount of distortion was a function of IRD and LA stiffness. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2019;49(9):656–665. Epub 26 Mar 2019. doi:10.2519/jospt.2019.8543.

### Impact of exercise on diastasis rectus abdominus |… [^111iqs2X]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Impact of Exercise on Diastasis Rectus AbdominusClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Diastasis recti, is a condition where the linea alba becomes stretched, sometimes lax, and creates distance between the rectus abdominis muscle bellies. It occurs most often during and after pregnancy, abdominal weight gain, and sometimes due to straining while performing heavy lifting. If the linea alba becomes thin enough to tear, the person may experience a hernia. Inter-rectus distance > 25mm at one or more locations is considered to be clinically significant for diastasis recti. Pathological diastasis recti is an inter rectus distance widening more than 10mm above the umbilicus, 27mm at the umbilicus, and 9mm below the umbilicus. The prevalence of diastasis recti is significant in the postpartum population.

Clinically significant diastasis recti is currently thought to be best assessed at 2cm above the umbilicus and 5cm above the umbilicus between 25–41 weeks of pregnancy, and at 6 months postpartum. At 6 months postpartum, the average values for diastasis recti using these measurements were 23mm average at 2cm above the umbilicus, and 18mm average at 5cm above the umbilicus. The measures below the umbilicus were clinically insignificant at 6 months postpartum. Thed abdominal drawing-in maneuver and curl up are both exercise maneuvers that have been traditionally taught for diastasis resolution. It was found that curl ups alone narrow the inter-rectus distance but don't achieve tension through the linea alba. Transverse abdominis activation alone tensions the linea alba but doesn't achieve narrowing of the inter-rectus distance.

Combined transverse abdominis activation and curl up achieves both narrowing and tension through the linea alba. The positive correlation between diastasis recti and lumbopelvic pain, incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse has been shown in recent studies as well. 52% of urogynecological patients had a diastasis recti in one study, and that 66% of those women had a.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115uiSY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of our systematic review and meta-analysis is that it followed rigorous methodology (JBI, GRADE) to guide our work process. Grey literature, all study designs and languages were included to reduce overall publication bias, increase the comprehensiveness of the review and foster a balanced overview of available scientific evidence. Sensitivity and a priori subgroup analyses on change scores permitted detailed consideration of heterogeneity and the influence of various factors (eg, time when the exercise interventions were initiated, type of exercise and location and task used to measure inter-rectus distance) on the outcomes of interest.

Limitations of this systematic review include the high heterogeneity that was not reduced with subgroup analysis. For example, despite the decrease in urinary incontinence prevalence, we did not find a change in urinary incontinence symptom severity in this review. However, a wide range of study populations were used in the included studies investigating urinary incontinence symptom severity. Dufour et al included participants with and without urinary incontinence symptoms, Von Bargen et al only included participants with vaginal deliveries complicated by an obstetric anal sphincter injury (third-degree or fourth-degree laceration), Ahlund 2013 et al and Moossdorff-Steinhauser et al only included participants presenting with urinary incontinence at recruitment and the study population in Khorasani et al presented with both stress urinary incontinence and low back pain at the time of recruitment. High statistical heterogeneity was found with all outcomes, which may be due to several factors, including the inclusion of a diverse range of patient populations, the vast range in the components included in each exercise intervention (eg, exercise frequency, intensity and volume, education and supervision provided, duration of the intervention) as well as the diverse range in what is considered 'standard care' for postpartum individuals globally. This limitation is similar to reviews in pregnant populations and may also be related to the variability in the tools used to evaluate pelvic floor disorders and the lack of clarity on how diastasis recti abdominis is defined and measured in the postpartum period. Additionally, no urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse or sexual function study assessed the impact of exercise without pelvic floor muscle training, limiting the ability to draw conclusions on the effect of aerobic and resistance exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis.

### Muscle elasticity is different in individuals with diastasis recti abdominis than healthy volunteers [^1149u3T1]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

IRD measurement

The DRA patients underwent B-mode US examination of their anterior rectus abdominis sheath to evaluate the width of rectus diastasis. To standardize the position of the transducer, each measurement location was marked on the skin when the participant was resting in the supine position, with their arms across their chests. Additionally, special attention was paid to the pressure imposed on the probe to avoid reflexive responses from the participants. A thick gel layer was applied to replace the air gap between the US transducer and the targeted region.

According to the European Hernia Society (EHS) classification of midline incisional hernias, the transducer was placed transversely along the midline at five specific locations identified with skin markers in the following order: subxiphoidal, epigastric, umbilical, infraumbilical, and suprapubic location. The aforementioned locations were recorded as M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, respectively (Fig. 1). Using the medial margins of both rectus abdominis muscles, the inter-rectus distance could be clearly identified, from one side of the anterior recti sheath to the corresponding position of its counterpart on the other side. Measurements were taken with an on-screen caliper to the nearest 0.1 cm (Fig. 2). Finally, the maximum diastasis was recorded as the width of the recti abdominus separation in this study.

### Ultrasonography: a useful tool for plastic surgeons [^114bUWM7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Ultrasonography is a diagnostic technique used in many clinical specialties that should also be used by plastic surgeons. The authors have used ultrasonography since 2011 as part of the routine follow-up evaluation for all their patients who have undergone breast augmentation (the main indication), body implants, gynecomastia, fat transfer, or abdominoplasty. The main goal of this study was to correlate normal and pathologic conditions clinically with their respective imaging findings. The secondary aim was to establish the utility of this tool in a plastic surgery setting. With increasing experience, the use of ultrasound evaluation was expanded to include evaluation of seromas and hematomas, determination of the diastasis recti width, and confirmation of the presence of hernias, especially in patients with high adiposity, who are difficult to scan. This report describes several clinical cases of complications associated with breast augmentation and discusses the most significant common problems encountered during the first 2 years of ultrasonography scanner use in a plastic surgeon's office.

### Single-layer plication for repair of diastasis recti: the most rapid and efficient technique [^11199zxL]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Plication of the anterior rectus sheath is the most commonly used technique for repair of diastasis recti, but is also a time-consuming procedure.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and time required to repair diastasis recti using different plication techniques.

Methods

Thirty women with similar abdominal deformities, who had had at least one pregnancy, were randomized into three groups to undergo abdominoplasty. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath was performed in two layers with 2–0 monofilament nylon suture (control group) or in a single layer with either a continuous 2–0 monofilament nylon suture (group I) or using a continuous barbed suture (group II). Operative time was recorded. All patients underwent ultrasound examination preoperatively and at 3 weeks and 6 months postoperatively to monitor for diastasis recurrence. The force required to bring the anterior rectus sheath to the midline was measured at the supraumbilical and infraumbilical levels.

Results

Patient age ranged from 26 to 50 years and body mass index from 20.56 to 29.17 kg/m². A significant difference in mean operative time was found between the control and study groups (control group, 35 min:22 s; group I, 14 min:22 s; group II, 15 min:23 s; P < 0.001). Three patients in group II had recurrence of diastasis. There were no significant within- and between-group differences in tensile force on the aponeurosis.

Conclusions

Plication of the anterior rectus sheath in a single-layer with a continuous suture showed to be an efficient and rapid technique for repair of diastasis recti.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^116sExyn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

When comparing women with and without DRA in the present study, no difference was found in the number of women fulfilling the recommendations for general exercise, strength training or specific pelvic floor muscle training 1 year post partum. With a prevalence of DRA of above 30% at 12 months post partum, preventive and treatment strategies are likely to develop. As we did not perform a RCT we cannot, based on our data, advice women on how to prevent or treat the condition. A recent systematic review concluded that, as for now, there are no high-quality RCTs on the effect of abdominal training programmes to guide clinical practice in this area. Further high-quality studies regarding this prevalent condition within women's health and exercise training are therefore warranted.

In accordance with Mota et al, our study showed no association between report of regular exercise and DRA. Discordantly, Candido et al found that women with mild or no DRA were more often engaged in regular vigorous exercise three times a week or more, and in regular walking exercise during pregnancy as compared with women with moderate or severe DRA. In our sample, there were only two women with moderate DRA and none with severe DRA 12 months post partum. The fact that the majority of women had a mild DRA could be a reason for not seeing any differences between the groups regarding all the risk factors. The use of different categories of exercise may also explain the disparate results. We used the American College of Sports Medicine's guidelines for exercise when setting cut-off value for frequency of exercise. Other factors that may be protective against more severe diastasis in our population is the inclusion of only primiparous women carrying a single fetus. Lo et al found that twin pregnancy was a risk factor for DRA; however, this was not supported by the study of Candido et al.

### Simultaneous prosthetic mesh abdominal wall reconstruction with abdominoplasty for ventral hernia and severe rectus diastasis repairs [^111FdtLm]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The overwhelming majority of abdominoplasties involve suture manipulation of the abdominal wall and resection of skin as described by Pitanguy in 1967. For the abdominal wall, correction of mild to moderate rectus diastasis by means of suture approximation of the anterior rectus sheath gives excellent results. Small umbilical hernias and epigastric defects are often repaired at the time of abdominoplasty through suture plication.

Although there is consensus that hernias are best repaired using mesh as opposed to simple suturing, no such agreement exists for the repair of severe cases of rectus diastasis. The return of muscle laxity in certain patient populations has been reported as high as 100 percent with use of the plication technique. Previous authors have recommended mesh overlay to support the midline plication in patients with marked musculoaponeurotic laxity. Some surgeons have recommended posterior rectus sheath plication, rectus advancement, and anterior rectus aponeurosis fixation to the posterior rectus sheath. General surgeons have recommended a laparoscopic mesh-reinforced technique and consider rectus diastasis a "hernia without a defect" and worthy of hernia repair techniques. Still others do not believe that rectus diastasis repair will last in the setting of large intraabdominal fat volume or male pattern rectus diastasis and therefore recommend against repair. In Schwartz's Principles of Surgery, by Schwartz and Brunicardi, the authors express concern that rectus plication could actually introduce the risk of ventral hernia development. These concerns have prevented many surgeons from attempting repair of significant diastasis, particularly in men. Regarding the use of mesh, an entire industry of bioprosthetic meshes has developed to avoid feared prosthetic mesh complications of abdominal wall reconstruction. Surgical-site occurrences are quoted in the 14 to 43 percent range for clean or clean-contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction — a number not compatible with aesthetic procedures.

Over the years, we have developed familiarity with the use of prosthetic mesh for the repair of moderate to large ventral hernias. We hypothesized that prosthetic mesh support of severe female and male pattern rectus diastasis, and moderate to large ventral hernias, could be safely and effectively combined with simultaneous abdominoplasty. Although many would view the use of mesh for an aesthetic procedure to be unwarranted, the low complication rate and the reliability of the procedure in 32 patients has led us to document our indications and technique.

### Does diastasis recti abdominis weaken pelvic floor function? A cross-sectional study [^116rK9z4]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to compare pelvic floor muscle strength (PFMS) and the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse(POP) in women with and without diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) at 6–8 weeks postpartum.

Methods

Three hundred and ten women underwent routine examinations, including POP quantification (POP-Q), PFMS measurement, DRA evaluation, and UI determination. Chi-squared tests and independent sample t test were used to compare the differences between women with DRA and without DRA.

Results

Women with DRA presented significantly lower prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), predelivery BMI, and postpartum BMI; greater gestational age; and higher birth weights than women without DRA(p < 0.05). Moreover, DRA incidence was significantly higher in those who underwent cesarean section (CS) than in those who underwent vaginal delivery (VD)(p = 0.045). Although the PFMS of the DRA group was weaker and the prevalence of UI and POP was slightly higher than those of the no DRA group, the results were not statistically significant. The PFMS of the CS group was stronger than that of the VD group. Urinary incontinence and prolapse incidence were higher in the VD group than in the CS group. Women who underwent CS had a shorter genital hiatus (Gh) and smaller Ba and Bp values than those in the VD group. Women without DRA had an increased chance of Bp ≥ -2 and Gh ≥ 3(p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Women with DRA were not more likely to have weakened PFMS and increased UI or POP at 6–8 weeks postpartum.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^111NHyq1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background/aim

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is defined as a separation of the 2 muscle bellies of rectus abdominis. To date there is scant knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of the condition. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of DRA during pregnancy and post partum, presence of possible risk factors, and the occurrence of lumbopelvic pain among women with and without DRA.

Methods

This prospective cohort study followed 300 first-time pregnant women from pregnancy till 12 months post partum. Data were collected by electronic questionnaire and clinical examinations. DRA was defined as a palpated separation of ≥ 2 fingerbreadths either 4.5 cm above, at or 4.5 cm below the umbilicus. Women with and without DRA were compared with independent samples Student's t-test and χ²/Fisher exact test, and OR with significance level > 0.05.

Results

Prevalence of DRA was 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4%, and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post partum, respectively. No difference in risk factors was found when comparing women with and without DRA. OR showed a greater likelihood for DRA among women reporting heavy lifting ≥ 20 times weekly (OR 2.18 95% CI 1.05 to 4.52). There was no difference in reported lumbopelvic pain (p = 0.10) in women with and without DRA.

Conclusions

Prevalence of mild DRA was high both during pregnancy and after childbirth. Women with and without DRA reported the same amount of lumbopelvic pain 12 months post partum.

Ultrasound is becoming more popular in the evaluation of different musculoskeletal abnormalities with excellent reproducibility. With the recent developments in ultrasound elastography, it is now possible to quantitatively evaluate the stiffness of muscle. There are several ultrasound elastography methods investigated around the world in the past twenty years, including strain elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse, shear wave elastography, and transient elastography. As a semiquantitative approach, strain ratio values generated by strain elastography depend significantly on reference and target region of interest being above the same tissue, while not influenced by depth. Shear wave speeds would probably decrease with increasing scanning depth. Comparatively, more recent studies demonstrated that, in terms of inter- or intra-operator variability, shear wave elastography is a more reliable and widely used tool for quantitatively assessing muscle stiffness.

The main purpose of this study was to compare elasticity of abdominal wall musculature in individuals with and without DRA. Partially consistent with the first part of our hypothesis, we found a significantly lower SWS in the RA (p = 0.003) and a higher SWS in the TrA muscle (p < 0.001) in participants with DRA compared with the age-matched control group without previous pregnancy. However, the correlation between muscle elasticity and IRD should be interpreted with caution (Fig. 8). As SWS in both muscles were positively correlated with IRD (p < 0.05), the greater the IRD, the higher the SWS in RA. In addition, the value of SWS in EO unexpectedly decreased in DRA patients (1.65 ± 0.15 vs. 1.79 ± 0.14, p = 0.001). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to reveal these findings about muscle elasticity in DRA patients based on the specific 10-location setting.

### Simultaneous prosthetic mesh abdominal wall reconstruction with abdominoplasty for ventral hernia and severe rectus diastasis repairs [^11647RoP]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Rectus Diastasis

Skin is elevated to expose the linea alba and at least 4 cm of the anterior rectus fascia bilaterally. The retrorectus space is developed by incising the anterior rectus fascia along the medial muscle border The muscle is freed from the underlying posterior rectus sheath with blunt dissection, analogous to a pedicle transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. The anterior rectus sheath is left attached to the rectus muscle to maintain its vascularity. For the majority of patients, the plane of dissection extends from the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis (Fig. 2, above, left, and above, center). For men with isolated supraumbilical rectus diastasis, the rectus muscles are elevated to just below the umbilicus (Fig. 3, above).

Fig. 2.

Fig. 3.
Male patient undergoing epigastric rectus diastasis repair with retrorectus mesh placement.

Midweight macroporous polypropylene uncoated mesh, 7 cm in transverse dimension, is anchored with up to 40 interrupted transrectus 0-polypropylene sutures with bites taken 4 cm from the incised edge of anterior rectus fascia. These sutures are each placed approximately 2 to 3 cm apart. The inferior epigastric artery is carefully avoided during suture placement, as are intercostal nerves. When these sutures are tied down, the mesh is flat and tight across the midline. This is a high-tension closure, but the force is distributed across many individual sutures, thus avoiding suture pull-through. The rectus muscles and overlying anterior rectus fascia are then approximated in the midline with interrupted figure-of-eight 0 polypropylene sutures to achieve a direct supported repair (Fig. 2, above, center and right, and below, left).

### Simultaneous prosthetic mesh abdominal wall reconstruction with abdominoplasty for ventral hernia and severe rectus diastasis repairs [^1129KTXn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background:

Standard abdominoplasty rectus plication techniques may not suffice for severe cases of rectus diastasis. In the authors' experience, prosthetic mesh facilitates the repair of severe rectus diastasis with or without concomitant ventral hernias.

Methods:

A retrospective review of all abdominal wall surgery patients treated in the past 8 years by the senior author (G. A.D.) was performed. Patients with abdominoplasty and either rectus diastasis repair with mesh or a combined ventral hernia repair were analyzed.

Results:

Thirty-two patients, 29 women and three men, underwent mesh-reinforced midline repair with horizontal or vertical abdominoplasty. Patient characteristics included the following: mean age, 53 years; mean body mass index, 26 kg/m²; average width of diastasis or hernia, 6.7 cm; and average surgery time, 151 minutes. There were no surgical-site infections and two surgical-site occurrences — two seromas treated with drainage in the office. After an average of 471 days' follow-up, none of the patients had recurrence of a bulge or a hernia.

Conclusions:

For patients with significant rectus diastasis, with or without concomitant hernias, the described mesh repair is both safe and durable. Although this operation requires additional dissection and placement of prosthetic mesh in the retrorectus plane, it may be safely combined with standard horizontal or vertical abdominoplasty skin excision techniques to provide an aesthetically pleasing overall result.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^1134yuYP]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is defined as a separation of the 2 muscle bellies of rectus abdominis. To date there is scant knowledge on prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of the condition. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of DRA during pregnancy and post partum, presence of possible risk factors, and the occurrence of lumbopelvic pain among women with and without DRA.

Methods

This prospective cohort study followed 300 first-time pregnant women from pregnancy till 12months post partum. Data were collected by electronic questionnaire and clinical examinations. DRA was defined as a palpated separation of ≥ 2 fingerbreadths either 4.5cm above, at or 4.5cm below the umbilicus. Women with and without DRA were compared with independent samples Student's t-test and χ²/Fisher exact test, and OR with significance level > 0.05.

Results

Prevalence of DRA was 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4%, and 32.6% at gestation week 21, 6weeks, 6months and 12months post partum, respectively. No difference in risk factors was found when comparing women with and without DRA. OR showed a greater likelihood for DRA among women reporting heavy lifting ≥ 20 times weekly (OR 2.18 95% CI 1.05 to 4.52). There was no difference in reported lumbopelvic pain (p = 0.10) in women with and without DRA.

Conclusions

Prevalence of mild DRA was high both during pregnancy and after childbirth. Women with and without DRA reported the same amount of lumbopelvic pain 12months post partum.

### Impact of postpartum exercise on pelvic floor disorders and diastasis recti abdominis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KK6ut]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review by Benjamin et al investigated the effect of exercise on diastasis recti abdominis in pregnant and postpartum individuals (up to 3 years postpartum) and found moderate certainty of evidence that abdominal exercises reduced inter-rectus distance (MD −0.43 cm, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.05) compared with usual care. Benjamin et al concluded that conservative interventions do not lead to clinically significant reductions in postpartum inter-rectus distance. The focus of our review was on the first year postpartum and, therefore, did not include studies that included participants exclusively during pregnancy and that were beyond their first year postpartum, as done in the work of Benjamin et al. However, our research builds on the work of Benjamin et al with the addition of six newer RCTs. Although our review produced similar findings in individuals in their first year postpartum, it is important to highlight that a clinically meaningful difference in inter-rectus distance has not been established in the literature and was not defined in the work of Benjamin et al. Therefore, we would argue that the conclusion by Benjamin et al, that conservative interventions do not lead to clinically significant reductions in inter-rectus distance in women postnatally, may be premature.

### Diastasis recti abdominis during pregnancy and 12 months after childbirth: prevalence, risk factors and report of lumbopelvic pain [^114PsVv9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Lumbopelvic pain 12 months post partum

Several authors have postulated a relationship between DRA and low back pain, but the evidence for such an association is scant. Our result showed no difference between women with and without DRA, and prevalence of low back and/or pelvic girdle pain. This is in accordance with Mota et al and Parker et al. However, the latter study found an association between DRA and abdominal and pelvic region pain, and argued that the observation of no associations between DRA and low back pain might be due to inclusion of women with non-severe DRA. The maximal separation in their study was 5.02 cm, which is comparable to our result where only one woman had a separation greater than 4 fingerbreadths. Another explanation for the result of no association may be the small sample size in our study.

Strengths and limitations

The longitudinal design and blinding of assessors to symptoms and risk factors can be considered strengths of the study. In addition, we had a large sample size compared with other published studies in the postpartum period, and also investigated a sample of homogeneous primiparous women. Furthermore, two trained physiotherapists who were aware of the pitfalls of the palpation method conducted the study.

Palpation has been found to have moderate inter-rater reliability, and may be considered a limitation of the study. Today, ultrasound is recommended as a more responsive and reliable method to assess inter-recti distance. However, Van de Water and Benjaminargued that palpation may be a sufficient method for detecting presence of DRA. This was the main purpose of our study in addition to comparing risk factors and lumbopelvic pain in women with and without diastasis. Palpation is the most commonly used method in clinical practice, and the results may therefore be considered clinically understandable and relevant for most practitioners. However, we support the recommendations for use of ultrasound for more details of DRA in future studies.

Demographics and elastographic results

The clinical and sonographic features of the 60 subjects (DRA = 36, non-DRA = 24) are summarized in Table 2. No statistically significant differences were found in the age, height, and BMI between the two groups (p > 0.05). Among the DRA patients, 94.4% (34/36) had lumbopelvic pain. IRD measurements revealed that the maximum diameter of recti abdominus separation was located at the umbilicus (M3) in the DRA patients (4.59 ± 1.14 cm). The rectus muscles were fused at the midline without separating in the 24 healthy participants. The RA, EO, and TrA in DRA patient groups were significantly thinner than those in the control group (7.97 ± 1.60 vs. 9.99 ± 1.33 mm, p < 0.001; 5.11 ± 1.05 vs. 6.18 ± 1.07 mm, p < 0.001; 2.42 ± 0.45 vs. 2.96 ± 0.78 mm, p = 0.004, respectively). In addition, SWS propagated significantly slower in the RA and EO of DRA patients (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively). Conversely, the SWS propagated significantly faster in the TrA of DRA patients (p < 0.001).

Table 2
Frequency of clinical and US features in 36 DRA patients and 24 nulliparous healthy controls

As shown in Table 3, the SWS values for the RA, EO, IO, and TrA varied at different locations between the groups. Specifically, in the DRA patients, the SWS showed significantly lower SWS value in the upper RA and at the umbilicus (locations of 1, 2, 3, and 4, p < 0.05) than that in the healthy controls. However, with respect to TrA, SWS in the lower abdominal wall (locations of 9 and 10) of DRA patients displayed higher value than that of the healthy controls (p = 0.007, p < 0.001, respectively).

Discussion

At gestation week 21, 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post partum, the prevalence of DRA was 33.1%, 60.0%, 45.4% and 32.6%, respectively. There was a greater likelihood for DRA among women reporting to be exposed to heavy lifting 20 times a week or more calculated with OR, but no other risk factors were found to be statistically significant. Women with DRA were not more likely to report lumbopelvic pain compared with women without DRA.

Measurement of DRA and cut-off value

All clinical examinations were performed by two physiotherapists blinded to data collected through the questionnaire. Owing to practical reasons the physiotherapist did not necessarily follow the same women throughout the study period. DRA was measured by palpation 4.5 cm above, at and 4.5 cm below the umbilicus. The women were tested in a standardised supine crock-lying position with arms crossed over the chest. They were instructed to perform an abdominal crunch till the shoulder blades were off the bench. Palpation of DRA in postpartum women has shown to have good intrarater reliability (K_w > 0.70) and moderate inter-rater reliability (K_w = 0.53).

The women were classified into four categories depending on the largest measured inter-recti distance among the three locations: (1) non-DRA was set as a separation < 2 fingerbreadths, (2) mild diastasis as a separation of 2–3 fingerbreadths, (3) moderate diastasis as 3–4 fingerbreadths and (4) severe diastasis as a separation of 4 or more fingerbreadths. Observed protrusion along the linea alba was categorised as DRA even if the palpated distance was < 2 fingerbreadths. The categorising was based on the study by Candido et al. Prevalence of DRA was analysed as yes/no and mild, moderate and severe grade of DRA were merged in the main analysis.

### Muscle elasticity is different in individuals with diastasis recti abdominis than healthy volunteers [^1133HmAf]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of DRA is challenging. Based on the pathophysiology described by Baumann et al. the combination of physiotherapy and surgical repair has the potential to improve the anatomical divarication and the laxity of the ventral abdominal muscles. In other words, the preoperative assessment of DRA is not solely a distance measurement problem. Individual preoperative evaluation of physiologic tension is important. Up to now, conventional modalities, including B-mode ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, have been used to assess the IRD, but no functional biomechanical property evaluation was available. Therefore, an objective imaging assessment of the intrinsic abdominal muscle characteristics, such as the elasticity, is needed to predict successful treatment and disease progression.

In recent years, ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) has been increasingly used to measure physiologic and pathologic muscle behavior due to its non-invasiveness, high accuracy, user-friendliness, and availability in commercial ultrasound scanners. However, to this end, no convincing evidence in the current literature has established the application of SWE for detecting muscle properties in DRA patients. Based on our previous study of SWE in incisional hernia patients, we hypothesize that the elasticity in rectus abdominis (RA) of DRA patients is significantly lower than that in healthy controls, while the elasticity of lateral abdominal wall muscles, including the external oblique (EO) muscle, internal oblique (IO) muscle, or transversus abdominis (TrA), is comparatively higher.

This study aimed to determine the utility of applying SWE to the evaluation of abdominal wall muscles, including rectus abdominis, external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, and transversus abdominis, in patients with DRA and healthy controls, to assist in clinical management. No study has been reported on the SWE of abdominal wall muscles in DRA patients.

### Abdominal wall plication and correction of deformities of the myoaponeurotic layer: focusing on materials and techniques used for synthesis [^112D8HnR]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The different types of sutures utilized in plications and for correction of diastasis during abdominoplasty are reviewed and discussed. Because correction of abdominal deformities also involves fascia and muscle advancement, this review also covers the suture materials used in muscle advancement. The selection of specific techniques to treat different types of abdominal wall deformity is also considered. This is important, because the outcome when correcting these deformities depends not only on suture materials but also on employing the optimum technique. A PubMed/Medline search was performed with the following search terms: rectus diastasis, diastasis recti, diastasis recti abdominis, correction of rectus diastasis, abdominoplasty. Relevant articles identifying the type of suture (rapidly absorbable, slowly absorbable, nonabsorbable), monofilament or multifilament sutures, antibiotic-coated sutures, and barbed sutures were evaluated. In addition, articles about surgical technique comparing continuous and interrupted sutures, in both the anterior and posterior aponeurosis, to correct rectus diastasis are discussed. Efficacy of suture materials was evaluated based on the long-term results and recurrence rates reported in these articles. The current literature provides sufficient data to recommend a single-layer continuous suture, with slowly absorbable sutures of 0 polydioxanone or 2–0 nylon, for correction of abdominal diastasis. An interrupted triangular suture is a good alternative to correct the vertical elongation of the myoaponeurotic layer that occurs after pregnancy.

### Rehabilitation of abdominal diastasis after childbirth… [^1121Fwxt]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Diastasis Recti Abdominis is the separation of the rectus muscles caused by stretching and thinning of the linea alba during pregnancy and childbirth. It's a common condition, affecting 66–100% of women post-birth and can persist for many years, leading to abdominal protrusion, discomfort, and aesthetic concerns. It might also contribute to back pain, urinary issues, and reduced abdominal strength, impacting quality of life. Recent guidelines propose that conservative management, such as rehabilitation interventions, should be prioritized for DRA. However, there is a lack of consensus among researchers regarding the most effective exercise regimen, resulting in diverse rehabilitation programs. Recent evidence advocates not only for closing the gap but also for achieving optimal function. Current studies often neglect to address functional rehabilitation, underscoring the necessity for robust clinical trials, which is the primary focus of this study.

The primary objective of the study is to develop and assess a comprehensive rehabilitation program for Diastasis Recti Abdominis and associated dysfunctions, through a prospective randomized controlled trial. Both assessment and intervention will take place at the Physiotherapy Department of the University of Patras, in the Clinical Physiotherapy and Research Laboratory. Primary outcome measures will be inter-recti distance, assessed using diagnostic ultrasound. In cases where abdominal wall or lower back pain is reported, patients will be asked to rate the intensity of this pain according to the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies.

Inclusion Criteria:

- Females aged 18–50 years
- Diagnosed with diastasis recti abdominis with an inter-recti distance greater than 2. 8 cm
- Beyond 6 months postpartum. Exclusion Criteria:

- Severe chronic respiratory disease
- Connective tissue disorders
- Neurological disorders
- Severe musculoskeletal conditions hindering exercise participation
- Previous abdominal surgeries

### Muscle elasticity is different in individuals with diastasis recti abdominis than healthy volunteers [^1143yC84]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The maximum separation distance was located at the umbilicus, which is in line with the DRA classification system suggested by Rath et al. Contrary to Liaw's finding, no inter-rectus separation was found among the 24 nulliparous healthy subjects, irrespective of the locations along the midline (M1–M5). Of note, the mean age of the control subjects differed between the two studies (31.9 ± 4. 1 vs. 26.7 ± 4.7 mm). However, both studies complied with the commonly accepted definition of DRA, with no more than 1 to 2 cm separation.

Our study is unique in the use of SWE in 10-location settings to better quantify the elasticity of abdominal muscles in an objective approach. Given the current evidence of morphological changes and abdominal muscle functional deficits present during pregnancy, a group of nulliparous healthy women was enrolled as controls in this study. Generally, the range of SWS values acquired in the four abdominal wall muscles (0.85–2.08 m/s) was similar to the values reported by others. From a biomechanical viewpoint, the abdominopelvic cavity is a cylinder enveloped by muscles, tendons, and bony structures. According to Pascal's principle, any pressure generated within the abdominopelvic cavity is transmitted equally to the walls of that cavity. In response to increased abdominal pressure, the muscular abdominal wall contracts to generate counter-pressure. If intra-abdominal pressure exceeds abdominal wall pressure, the abdominal wall will rupture at its weakest point, causing herniation. Correspondingly, the rectus abdominis in DRA patients, which is considered the margin of the weakest point, displayed a lower SWS value than that in healthy controls, especially for the locations above and at the umbilicus. This difference in muscle elasticity should be considered when making treatment plans that include a combination of physiotherapy and surgical repair. However, subgroup analysis in 36 DRA patients showed a positive correlation between IRD and SWS. This can be explained by the biomechanical and pathological changes in muscle fibers as the inter-rectus separation increases. The composition of the RA, including muscle fibers, connective tissue, and adipose tissue infiltration, might vary at different stages of DRA progression, resulting in changes in shear wave speed at the later stage.

### Simultaneous prosthetic mesh abdominal wall reconstruction with abdominoplasty for ventral hernia and severe rectus diastasis repairs [^117RZg7M]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

In a Letter to the Editor, Horndeski and Gonzalez describe a technique of midline hernia repair using the horizontal abdominoplasty skin incision for exposure. They then use a large mesh overlay to cover the entire lower half of the anterior abdominal wall to prevent shearing at the midline and prevent further "biomechanical failure". None of their 14 patients developed a new hernia or infection. All of these three aforementioned studies include use of a mesh overlay, the placement of which, as noted by Marques et al. can obscure normal abdominal muscle contour. The technique described in this study uses a mesh underlay, which allows for the normal muscular contour to be appreciated through the redraped skin flap. In addition, limited undermining preserves both the subtle aesthetics of the semilunar lines and blood flow to the skin flaps.

The cosmetic result is the patient's greatest concern, and this technique allows for both abdominal wall functional repair and safe skin contouring. The ability of this technique to tighten the abdomen with confidence is far greater than for suture alone. For the 11 patients who already had a vertical scar, the midline incision was used for the procedure. The vertical abdominoplasty allows for excellent narrowing of the waistline and the creation of a new umbilicus as described. The minimal mesh technique preserves the attachments of the semilunar line, improving the final aesthetic contours. For patients without a preexisting vertical scar, the standard horizontal abdominoplasty incision allows for complete access to the hernia or rectus diastasis and excellent postoperative contour.

This study, the largest case series to date of abdominoplasty combined with prosthetic mesh, demonstrates the safety and feasibility of aesthetically sensitive repair of significant rectus diastasis and ventral hernias. This procedure uses familiar techniques combined in a straightforward manner that allows for a durable repair achieved within operative times acceptable to most surgeons. The concept that aesthetics and prosthetic mesh are incompatible is no longer valid, thereby giving additional options for repair in men and women with separation of their rectus muscles.

### Long-term outcomes of diastasis recti abdominis in postpartum women: a retrospective cohort study [^115uAMrp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective was to investigate whether diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) can cause adverse outcomes for different long-term postpartum women.

Methods

We recruited 437 long-term postpartum women at five different time points (3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 years postpartum respectively). Inter-recti distance (IRD) and linea alba or umbilical hernia were measured by ultrasound. Strength of abdominal muscle was measured by a manual muscle test. Low back pain (LBP), urinary incontinence (UI) and quality of life (QOL) were measured by questionnaires including the Oswestry Disability Index, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey respectively.

Results

Women with DRA experienced more severe LBP, and poorer QOL only 10 years postpartum according to the diagnostic criterion of IRD > 2cm. However, when the diagnostic criterion was raised to IRD > 3cm, women with DRA reported weaker abdominal muscle strength, more severe LBP 3, 5, and 10 years postpartum, poorer QOL 3, 5, 10, and 20 years postpartum, and higher incidence of linea alba or umbilical hernia 5 and 20 years postpartum.

Conclusions

When using IRD > 2cm as the diagnostic criterion, the impact of DRA is minimal. However, when utilizing IRD > 3cm as the diagnostic criterion, DRA is associated with increased linea alba or umbilical hernia, weakened abdominal muscle strength, increased LBP, and decreased QOL. Most of the effects are particularly evident within 3–10 years postpartum, but becomes insignificant 20 and 30 years postpartum. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the diagnostic criterion of DRA need to be improved.

Results

In total, 2621 women were scheduled for delivery at Ahus during the inclusion period. The cohort consisted of 300 primiparous women of European ethnicity (96%), and between 19 and 40 years of age (table 1). The prevalence of DRA was 33.1% at gestation week 21, 60.0% 6 weeks post partum, 45.5% 6 months post partum, and 32.6% 12 months post partum (table 2). The location with the highest prevalence of DRA was at the umbilicus for all the time points.

### Long-term ultrasonographic evaluation of midline aponeurotic plication during abdominoplasty [^117Wvp79]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the plication of the anterior rectus sheath during abdominoplasty and the anatomical characteristics of patients with recurrence.

Methods

Thirty-eight patients were selected. Patients had undergone abdominoplasty between 1 and 5 years previously. Patients were divided into two groups: group A, 18 patients who had undergone surgery 5 years previously; and group B, 20 patients who had undergone surgery 1 year before. All patients were submitted to a complete physical examination by the plastic surgeon to evaluate the abdominal wall. In addition, an ultrasound examination was performed by the same radiologist in all patients to evaluate rectus diastasis recurrence at two levels: in the supraumbilical region and in the infraumbilical region. The insertion of the recti muscles in the costal margin was also assessed. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact test and the t test. Groups were similar regarding age, body mass index, number of smokers, physical activity, and number of pregnancies.

Results

There was no recurrence of diastasis in any cases of the group with a follow-up of more than 5 years, whereas in the 1-year follow-up group there were two cases of recurrence of the diastasis. Only one of the patients who had recurrence of rectus diastasis had a clinical complaint.

Conclusions

Recurrence of rectus diastasis is not directly related to the length of the follow-up. It may occur within the first year after abdominoplasty. Recurrence of diastasis diagnosed by ultrasound is not related to a clinical complaint.

Clinical Question/Level Of Evidence

### Pelvic floor muscle function, pelvic floor dysfunction and diastasis recti abdominis: prospective cohort study [^113Xv8t7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Compare vaginal resting pressure (VRP), pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength, and endurance in women with and without diastasis recti abdominis at gestational week 21 and at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. Furthermore, to compare prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in the two groups at the same assessment points.

Methods

This is a prospective cohort study following 300 nulliparous pregnant women giving birth at a public university hospital. VRP, PFM strength, and endurance were measured with vaginal manometry. ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaire and POP-Q were used to assess UI and POP. Diastasis recti abdominis was diagnosed with palpation of ≥ 2 fingerbreadths 4.5cm above, at, or 4.5cm below the umbilicus.

Results

At gestational week 21 women with diastasis recti abdominis had statistically significant greater VRP (mean difference 3.06cm H₂O [95%CI: 0.70; 5.42]), PFM strength (mean difference 5.09cm H₂O [95%CI: 0.76; 9.42]) and PFM muscle endurance (mean difference 47.08cmH₂Osec [95%CI: 15.18; 78.99]) than women with no diastasis. There were no statistically significant differences between women with and without diastasis in any PFM variables at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. No significant difference was found in prevalence of UI in women with and without diastasis at any assessment points. Six weeks postpartum 15.9% of women without diastasis had POP versus 4.1% in the group with diastasis (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Women with diastasis were not more likely to have weaker PFM or more UI or POP. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:716–721, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A Systematic review and meta-analysis revealed thirteen studies to evaluate measurement properties of the 'finger-width' method, tape measure, calipers, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Ultrasound was most evaluated. Methodological quality of these studies varied widely. The available information supports ultrasound and calipers as adequate methods to assess DRAM (Diastasis of Rectus Abdominal Muscle). For other methods, limited measurement information of low-to-moderate quality is available [1].

A longitudinal descriptive exploratory study evaluates the normal width of the linea alba in first-time pregnant women during pregnancy and postpartum. Different normative values for the width of the linea alba were found at different locations of the anterior abdominal wall. In primiparous women, the IRD may be considered "normal" up to values wider than in nulliparous [2].

A study describes the relationship between inter-rectus distance (IRD) and symptom severity. IRD was significantly correlated with worst abdominal pain in the last 24 h (ρ = 0.45, p = 0.005), and with overall body image (ρ = − 0.44, p = 0.006), but not with the other outcomes [3].

In an intra-rater between-session reliability study, the between-session reliability of IRD measurement was high, particularly when measuring IRD at or above the umbilicus. When performed by an experienced investigator, ultrasound imaging is a reliable tool to measure IRD in postpartum women who have diastasis recti [4].

Another Reliability and validity study promotes the value of extended field of view (FOV) technique: Ultrasound imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive IRD measurement in parous women when investigating diastasis recti; however, its use is limited when IRD is large. Extended FOV techniques (panoramic USI or using acoustic standoff pads) allow complete visualization of the linea alba when the IRD is large and conventional imaging is not sufficient. FOV techniques were highly correlated with those acquired using conventional imaging (r > 0.95, p < 0.0001) [5].

### Muscle elasticity is different in individuals with diastasis recti abdominis than healthy volunteers [^113iBpwD]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Converse to our results in incisional hernia patients, the SWS of the EO muscle in DRA patients decreased in comparison with healthy subjects. This decrease mainly resulted from the biological and physical differences between the two studies. According to the law of Laplace, once a hernia has formed, it will continue to enlarge in size due to the increase in wall tension at that location. The wall tension is greatest at the point of the largest radius and the thinnest wall. Hence, it could be hypothesized that these muscles are more likely to be subjected to higher tension. In this study, no hernia was found among the 36 DRA patients. In addition, the positive correlation between SWS and muscle in the overall dataset (γ = 0.238, p < 0.001) may be explained by the significantly decreased EO muscle thickness (p < 0.001) with less volume of fibers in postpartum women that leads to slower shear wave propagation.

Similar to the EO muscle, the mean thickness of the TrA muscle decreased in DRA patients. Nonetheless, the tension of the TrA muscle increased. This finding is in agreement with the results of the anatomical study by Wingerden et al. which demonstrated that the TrA muscle, as the deep abdominal wall muscle, played an important role in the etiology of DRA. Typical for pregnancy is the space requirement of the growing uterus, which increases intra-abdominal pressure. The muscular tissue adapts more rapidly and to a further extent than collagenous fascial sheets. Hence, the posterior rectus fascia sheath, mainly formed by the aponeuroses of the TrA, is not expected to be as lax as the muscular dominant tissue. Comparison of the TrA SWS values among different locations also implicates the significance of the lower abdominal wall in preoperative treatment, including exercise the antenatal and postnatal periods.

Shear wave elastography measurement

After the IRD measurements, SWE was measured in the DRA patients and healthy nulliparous participants. Tissue SWS of the RA and lateral muscles (EO, IO, and TrA) were bilaterally measured. Based on our previous experience and the suggestions of Rath et a. SWE measurements were taken on both the left and right sides of the abdomen as per the following guidelines (Fig. 3):
Three locations were identified on each side of the RA region, the supraumbilicus (4.5 cm above the umbilicus), umbilicus, and subumbilicus (4.5 cm below the umbilicus).
Two locations were identified on each side of the abdomen along the anterior axillary line equidistant between the costal margin at the level of the ninth rib and a point anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine.

### Comparative analysis of the efficacy and functionality of abdominoplasty versus minimally invasive techniques in the surgical treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis in postpartum women [^113F7ZFC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This review aims to describe the surgical options available for treatment of diastasis recti in postpartum women, as well as compare the effectiveness of these treatment options. Historically, diastasis recti has been repaired through open procedures, such as abdominoplasty. More recently, studies have explored other methods for the treatment of diastasis recti, including various minimally invasive surgical options.

Methods

Twelve studies ranging from 2015 to 2022 were included in this analysis. Studies were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed descriptively. Statistical comparison of surgical outcomes between studies was performed using Fisher's Exact Test in SPSS.

Results

Minimally invasive approaches were categorized as laparoscopic preaponeurotic approaches, robotic approaches, and enhanced-view/extended totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) approaches. These techniques were compared to two open approaches: abdominoplasty and miniabdominoplasty. There were no significant differences in the rate of seromas, surgical site infections/complications, or hematomas between abdominoplasty and minimally invasive surgical techniques (p > 0.05). Among the minimally invasive techniques, no significant differences in readmission rates were reported (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences in recurrence rates were seen following minimally invasive or abdominoplasty repairs, except for the increased recurrence rates seen with the r-TARRD robotic technique (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Although current data on minimally invasive approaches is limited, our review reveals that both open and minimally invasive approaches are viable options for diastasis recti repair in postpartum women. Identifying the optimal approach for diastasis recti repair should rely on the patient's desired treatment outcome. If the patient indicates a desire for the removal of excess abdominal subcutaneous tissue, abdominoplasty may be a better surgical approach. Alternatively, if the patient puts a greater emphasis on shorter recovery time and smaller surgical incisions/scars, minimally invasive approaches may be a better surgical option.

### Bowel herniation after traumatic symphysis pubis diastasis [^111PQ3dv]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2001). Low credibility.

The authors describe a patient with small bowel herniation after traumatic symphysis disruption. Although gastrointestinal problems occur rarely with pelvic fractures, in a patient with a pubic diastasis and paralytic ileus, the development of abdominal hernia through torn peritoneum should be considered. Treatment of the patient with a pubic diastasis and a bowel problem should include early careful exploration and management of the gastrointestinal tract during pelvic surgery.
