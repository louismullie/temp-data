## Question

What is the relationship between STEACS with new LBBB at ECG ?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between STEACS and new LBBB on ECG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the clinical context. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic link between new LBBB and acute coronary occlusion. Next, I will review diagnostic challenges and the role of Sgarbossa criteria. After that, I need to check guideline-based management implications, including reperfusion thresholds and antithrombotic therapy. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special scenarios, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. STEACS refers to ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes, which in contemporary practice are synonymous with STEMI, characterized by complete coronary occlusion with ST-elevation in contiguous leads or a STEMI-equivalent pattern, whereas new LBBB denotes a new-onset complete left bundle branch block on ECG, historically considered a STEMI-equivalent when accompanied by ischemic symptoms or hemodynamic compromise [^237f6151] [^b9c6890f].

> Now, I should verify the pathophysiologic relationship. New LBBB in the setting of acute chest pain or ischemic symptoms reflects sudden impairment of conduction through the left bundle, most often due to proximal LAD occlusion compromising the conduction system, and thus signals a large anterior myocardial territory at risk and a high likelihood of transmural ischemia or infarction, which is why it has long been treated as a STEMI-equivalent in guidelines and trials [^b9c6890f] [^104248bd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic certainty. I need to check the diagnostic challenge: LBBB obscures standard ST-segment interpretation, so classic STEMI criteria cannot be applied reliably, and the Sgarbossa criteria provide only modest sensitivity, meaning a negative Sgarbossa score does not exclude MI and should not delay reperfusion when clinical suspicion is high, which is a critical pitfall in the ED [^b9c6890f].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management. Historically, new LBBB with ischemic symptoms warranted emergent reperfusion, and contemporary ACC/AHA/ACEP guidance continues to treat new LBBB as a high-risk presentation that mandates rapid ECG acquisition, prehospital cath lab activation when suspected, and primary PCI when feasible, with fibrinolysis if PCI cannot be achieved within guideline time frames, reflecting the large myocardium at risk and time-sensitive benefit [^9af516e1] [^b090073b] [^7629ad2e].

> Wait, let me verify the antithrombotic implications because I recall older data. The COMMIT trial, which included patients with STEMI or LBBB, showed that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced death and recurrent events, supporting dual antiplatelet therapy in this population, and this remains aligned with modern ACS antiplatelet strategies even as P2Y12 choices have evolved toward prasugrel or ticagrelor in STEMI when not contraindicated [^aec19c79] [^1406d577].

> I will now examine prognosis and special scenarios. New LBBB in AMI is associated with larger infarcts, more heart failure, and higher mortality, and even outside overt MI, LBBB is linked to incident heart failure and LV dysfunction over time, reinforcing the need for close follow-up and consideration of device therapy when indicated; additionally, septal branch compromise during LAD interventions can precipitate complete heart block in patients with preexisting LBBB, so I need to ensure vigilance for conduction deterioration post-PCI [^ee8bdcd0] [^dcca3b72].

> But wait, what if the LBBB is not new or the symptoms are atypical. I should double-check that intermittent or chronic LBBB can be misleading, and painful LBBB syndrome, while rare, can mimic ischemia without infarction, so comparing to prior ECGs and integrating troponins and echo is essential; conversely, missing a true occlusion MI behind LBBB is more dangerous than overtreating a mimic, so a low threshold for cath lab activation remains prudent in the right clinical context [^6792b4db] [^b9c6890f].

> Let me synthesize the relationship succinctly. New LBBB in the setting of suspected STEACS is a marker of proximal LAD occlusion and extensive anterior myocardium at risk, functioning as a STEMI-equivalent that mandates emergent reperfusion with primary PCI preferred when available, guideline-directed antithrombotic therapy, and rapid systems-of-care activation; because ECG diagnosis is unreliable in LBBB, clinical suspicion should drive treatment, and delays for confirmatory algorithms risk irreversible myocardial loss [^b9c6890f] [^9af516e1] [^b090073b].

---

New LBBB in STEACS is a **high-risk ECG marker** of proximal LAD occlusion and extensive anterior ischemia, warranting **immediate reperfusion** [^b090073b] regardless of symptoms or biomarkers [^9af516e1]. It is a **STEMI-equivalent** [^104248bd] because standard ST-segment criteria are obscured, so diagnosis relies on clinical context and prior ECGs. Early primary PCI is the **preferred strategy** [^da32112a] to reduce infarct size and mortality; fibrinolysis is reserved only if PCI is delayed [^7629ad2e]. New LBBB carries worse outcomes, including higher rates of heart failure, arrhythmias, and death, and mandates urgent cardiology involvement and close monitoring for conduction deterioration [^ee8bdcd0].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship

- **Proximal LAD occlusion**: New LBBB often reflects proximal LAD involvement, causing extensive anterior ischemia and conduction system injury [^cb733c2e].

- **Conduction system vulnerability**: The left bundle branch is supplied mainly by the LAD; ischemia can cause conduction block, manifesting as new LBBB [^dcca3d72].

- **Extent of myocardium at risk**: New LBBB signals a large ischemic burden and higher risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and mortality [^ee8bdcd0].

---

## Diagnostic implications

- **STEMI-equivalent**: New LBBB is a STEMI-equivalent; standard ST-segment criteria are unreliable, so diagnosis rests on clinical context and prior ECGs [^b9c6890f].

- **Sgarbossa criteria**: Concordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in leads with a positive QRS, concordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in V1–V3, or discordant ST elevation ≥ 5 mm can suggest MI in LBBB, but sensitivity is limited [^b9c6890f].

- **Serial ECGs and biomarkers**: Dynamic changes and rising troponins support ACS, but absence does not exclude occlusion [^b9c6890f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and management

- **Immediate reperfusion**: Primary PCI is recommended within 90 minutes of first medical contact [^b090073b]; fibrinolysis if PCI is not available within 120 minutes [^7629ad2e].

- **Antithrombotic therapy**: Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) [^1406d577] and anticoagulation are indicated [^notfound].

- **Close monitoring**: Watch for conduction deterioration, bradyarrhythmias, and hemodynamic compromise [^7bd7f14c].

---

## Prognostic significance

New LBBB is associated with **higher mortality**, larger infarcts, more heart failure, and more arrhythmias than STEMI without LBBB. Early reperfusion improves outcomes, but the risk remains elevated, underscoring the need for aggressive management and follow-up [^ee8bdcd0].

---

## Clinical approach

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm new LBBB by comparing with prior ECGs [^notfound] |
| 2 | Assess clinical context (symptoms, hemodynamics, biomarkers) [^f34ff975] |
| 3 | Activate cath lab for primary PCI if available [^9af516e1] |
| 4 | If PCI is delayed, consider fibrinolysis [^7629ad2e] |
| 5 | Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation [^1406d577] |
| 6 | Monitor for conduction deterioration and complications [^7bd7f14c] |

---

New LBBB in STEACS is a **STEMI-equivalent** [^104248bd] that signals proximal LAD occlusion and extensive ischemia; **immediate reperfusion** [^b090073b] is essential to reduce infarct size and mortality, and management should be aggressive with close monitoring for complications [^7bd7f14c].

Methods

Study design and conduct and reporting

This was a single-centre, retrospective study based on a real-world process improvement initiative performed in PUMCH, aiming at optimising the timeliness of STEMI care. It was conducted in strict adherence to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol received approval from the ethics committee of PUMCH. Given the retrospective design of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived. The reporting of this study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

Study population

Consecutive patients with STEMI who presented within 12 h of symptom onset and underwent primary PCI in PUMCH from 1 January to 31 December 2022 (control group) and those during the same period in 2023 (intervention group) were enrolled. As a 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy was implemented since 1 January 2023 in PUMCH, the control and intervention groups underwent primary PCI before and after implementing the 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy, respectively.

The diagnosis of STEMI was based on acute chest pain (or equivalent signs/symptoms), new ST-segment elevation at the J-points in at least two contiguous leads or a newly developed bundle branch block on ECG. This diagnosis was later corroborated by an increase in cardiac biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin, that is, exceeding the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit.

Treatment procedures

Once a patient with acute chest pain presented at the ED and acute coronary syndrome was suspected, an ECG was obtained as soon as possible. If the diagnosis of STEMI was indicated based on the symptoms and ECG results, the PCI team was activated immediately by the ED physicians. Once the cath lab was ready, the patient was transferred to the cath lab for primary PCI. All patients received aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and anticoagulants during the peri-procedural period according to guideline recommendations and local practice.All technical aspects concerning mechanical reperfusion were left to the discretion of the treating interventional cardiologists.

Data collection

Patient data were collected, including demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, prior history of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), comorbidities, arrival time and modes, vital signs and physical examinations, Killip classification, location of myocardial infarction, procedural characteristics, information on time intervals and clinical outcomes.

### Predictive effect of atypical right bundle-branch block on in-hospital sudden cardiac death and cardiac rupture and long-term prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [^88a8a177]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

This study revealed some very interesting phenomena reported for the first time. We found that patients with AMI and ARBBB had more vessel lesions and were older than those with LBBB, TRBBB, or NBBB, contributing to a more severe clinical condition in patients with AMI and ARBBB. Additionally, the door‐to‐balloon and onset‐to‐door times in patients with AMI and ARBBB were longer than those in patients with TRBBB, LBBB, and NBBB. This suggests that the longer onset‐to‐door times and delayed reperfusion are associated with a higher likelihood of ARBBB appearing on ECG, leading to a larger MI area. Furthermore, patients with AMI and ARBBB had significantly higher incidence rates of no reflow and cardiogenic shock compared with those with TRBBB, LBBB, or NBBB, resulting in more adverse cardiovascular events in this subgroup. Previous studies have shown that RBBB can independently predict the mortality in patients with STEMI, with a predictive value similar to that of LBBB.The presence of RBBB on ECG in patients with AMI may indicate more severe myocardial ischemic injury, as the right bundle branch has greater resistance to ischemia compared with the left bundle branch.Our study found that the incidence rates of in‐hospital SCD and CR in patients with AMI combined with ARBBB post‐DES‐PCI were higher than in those of patients with LBBB or TRBBB. This may be related to the appearance of a notch on the ascending segment of the R‐wave in lead V1 or an isolated upright R‐wave in lead V1, which may indicate severe damage to myocardial electrical conduction. The proximal portion of the right bundle branch receives blood supply from the LAD, with additional perfusion from the moderator band artery originating from the right coronary artery, and the distal portion is primarily supplied by the branches of the LAD.Thus, ARBBB on ECG suggests that a proximal lesion in a large coronary artery causes conduction dysfunction in the right bundle branch, potentially leading to conduction blockage of the right bundle branch across the interventricular septum, often due to proximal occlusion of the LAD or diffuse coronary artery disease.Our study confirmed that the culprit vessels in patients with AMI and ARBBB were predominantly the left main and LAD, and STEMI was more common in this patient subset.

A, TRBBB; B, LBBB. Performance of ARBBB on ECG: Notches were observed in the ascending segment of the R‐wave in the V1 lead, which can be classified into different types as qR (C, red arrow), QR (D, red arrow), and M (E, red arrow) according to the morphology of the QRS wave in the V1 lead. Additionally, a single R‐wave‐like change was also observed in the V1 lead without prominent Q and S waves, with no notch in either the rising or falling segment (F, red arrow). ARBBB indicates atypical right bundle‐branch block; BBB, bundle‐branch block; LBBB, left bundle‐branch block; NBBB, nonbundle‐branch block; and TRBBB, typical right bundle‐branch block.

In our study, only 4 (0.6%) cases had historical ECGs showing the presence of RBBB. RBBB in the healthy population predominantly presents as TRBBB, whereas ARBBB is almost absent. Therefore, we assumed that ARBBB cases were newly acquired in our study.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^aec19c79]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

COMMIT

In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of Plavix were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e., ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.

The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke or death.

The patient population was 28% women and 58% age ≥60 years (26% age ≥70 years). Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients received thrombolytics and only 3% underwent PCI.

As shown in Table 5 and Figure 4 and Figure 5 below, Plavix significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002).

The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various prespecified subgroups as shown in Figure 6. The effect was also similar in non-prespecified subgroups including those based on infarct location, Killip class or prior MI history. Such subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously.

### Painful left bundle branch block syndrome diagnosed in the emergency department [^6792b4db]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonischemic angina correlating with intermittent left bundle branch block (LBBB) is described in cardiology literature as "painful left bundle branch block syndrome," with pathophysiology, diagnostic features, and specific therapies proposed based on case series data.

Case Report

We present the case of a woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with intermittent chest pain correlating to LBBB on her smartwatch and electrocardiogram and was subsequently diagnosed with painful LBBB syndrome. We review the proposed pathophysiology, diagnostic features, and treatment for the syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although chest pain comprises one of the most prevalent ED presentations, this syndrome is not mentioned in emergency medicine literature.

### Clopidogrel [^19c82e72]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

COMMIT

In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e., ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block). Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.

The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke or death.

The patient population was 28% women and 58% age ≥ 60 years (26% age ≥ 70 years). Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients received thrombolytics and only 3% underwent PCI.

As shown in Table 5 and Figure 4 and Figure 5 below, clopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p = 0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p = 0.002).

### Left bundle branch block and ECG evidence of infarction (...) [^b9c6890f]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The presence of complete left bundle branch block is thought to limit the utility of the electrocardiogram in the evaluation of suspected myocardial infarction. In a 1996 study, Sgarbossa and colleagues reported on the use of an algorithm based on ST-segment changes that had a sensitivity of 78 percent and a specificity of 90 percent for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with LBBB. Shlipak and associates investigated the clinical utility of the algorithm by retrospectively studying a cohort of 83 patients with LBBB and symptoms of myocardial infarction. The study included patients with complete LBBB and acute chest pain, acute pulmonary edema or cardiac arrest. Excluded from the study were patients in whom creatine kinase or troponin I levels were not determined.

According to the algorithm developed by Sgarbossa, an ECG is considered positive for myocardial infarction if its score is at least 3 points on the basis of three criteria: ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm in the lead with concordant QRS complex—a score of 5 points; ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm in lead V. 1, V 2 or V 3—a score of 3 points; and ST-segment elevation of at least 5 mm in the lead with discordant QRS complex—a score of 2 points. A total of 103 events occurred in the 83 patients with LBBB. Of these presentations, 30 percent were classified as myocardial infarctions. On the basis of the scoring system of the proposed algorithm, only three of the ECGs met the criteria for myocardial infarction in these patients with LBBB. All of the patients did, in fact, have a myocardial infarction. A positive result therefore had a very high positive predictive value. However, a negative result did not decrease the likelihood of a myocardial infarction.

Of the nine ECG findings assessed, none was found to effectively identify the 30 percent of patients with myocardial infarction. The authors also performed a decision analysis to determine the optimal course of treatment for patients with LBBB and acute chest pain. Possible treatment strategies were to treat all patients with thrombolysis, to treat no patients with thrombolysis or to apply the proposed algorithm before deciding on thrombolysis. The analysis revealed that if 1, 000 patients with LBBB who presented with chest pain received thrombolysis, 929 would survive without a major stroke, whereas if the ECG algorithm were used, 918 would survive without stroke. The authors conclude that, although the proposed algorithm had a high sensitivity, it missed myocardial infarction in many patients who would benefit from aggressive treatment. The findings show that the ECG cannot reliably be used to rule out myocardial infarction in patients with LBBB.

This study supports the recommendations of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association: that all patients with LBBB and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction should receive reperfusion therapy if there are no contraindications.

### Predictive effect of atypical right bundle-branch block on in-hospital sudden cardiac death and cardiac rupture and long-term prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [^cb733c2e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions

AMI was diagnosed according to the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines,incorporating ECG monitoring and serial measurement of high‐sensitivity troponin T at admission and 3 hours later. The ECG was recorded immediately upon admission, following current guidelines. LBBB and TRBBB were classified as new or presumably new onset by the treating physician, whereas all ARBBB cases in this study were considered newly acquired. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were defined by prior documentation by a physician or the use of antihypertensive or lipid‐lowering drugs. Diabetes was based on the use of antidiabetic drugs or insulin. The final diagnosis was adjudicated blindly by 2 physicians, with a third physician reviewing cases of disagreement. In this study, MACCEs included all‐cause death, cardiac death, nonfatal recurrent MI, nonfatal stroke, malignant arrhythmia.
SCD and CR : SCD is generally defined as unexpected death due to cardiovascular causes in an individual with or without preexisting heart disease within 1 hour of a change in clinical status. Most instances of SCD may involve CR, ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation, advanced atrioventricular block, severe heart failure, or cardiogenic shock, followed by asystole. CR encompasses any of the following 3 conditions: free wall rupture, ventricular septal rupture, or papillary muscle rupture. Free wall rupture is the most common form of CR, which is a catastrophic complication of AMI. The diagnosis of CR primarily relies on bedside color Doppler ultrasound, X‐ray, other imaging examinations, and clinical manifestations.In our study, in‐hospital SCD was identified in all CR cases, and all CR cases were confirmed by bedside color Doppler ultrasound.
TRBBB : RBBB was defined according to the Minnesota Code criteria as a QRS duration ≥0.12 seconds in the majority of beats in any of leads I, II, III, augmented unipolar limb lead (aVL), or augmented unipolar limb lead (aVF), plus any 1 of the following conditions: (a) an RSR′ pattern in V1 or V2 with R′>R and an S‐wave ≥0.25 mm in most beats; (b) a predominantly positive QRS in V1 or V2 with an R peak duration ≥0.06 seconds in most beats; or (c) an S duration > R duration in all beats in either lead I or II (Figure 2A).
LBBB : The ECG characteristics of LBBB include (a) a wide R‐wave with a flat tip or notch in leads I and V5–V6, with a reduced or absent Q‐wave; (b) a wide, deep S‐wave in leads V1–V2, appearing as QS or rS type, with similar changes in leads II, III, and aVF; (c) secondary ST‐T wave changes, where the T‐wave direction is opposite to the main wave of the QRS; and (d) varying degrees of leftward deflection of the electrical axis, A QRS duration >0.12 seconds was considered complete LBBB, whereas a QRS duration <0.12 seconds was considered incomplete LBBB (Figure 2B).
ARBBB : ARBBB involves specific changes based on the RBBB that differ from typical RBBB. We defined ARBBB by 2 distinct ECG features. The first feature is a notch on the ascending segment of the R‐wave in lead V1, categorized into qR type, QR type, or M type based on the morphologies of the QRS wave in the lead V1 (Figure 2C through 2E, red arrow). The second feature is a single R‐wave upright deflection, characterized by an isolated upright R‐wave in lead V1 without prominent Q or S waves. This single R‐wave upright deflection lacks a notch on either the ascending or descending segment in the lead V1 (Figure 2F, red arrow). Additionally, ARBBB differs from TRBBB by the absence of an initial R‐wave on ECG.

### Heparin administration at first medical contact vs immediately before primary percutaneous coronary intervention: the HELP-PCI trial [^0f95257c]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The HELP-PCI trial was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at 36 clinical centres in 14 cities in China. Patients presenting with STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset undergoing PPCI were randomly assigned to receive UFH (100 U/kg) through intravenous administration either at FMC (in the ambulance, non-PPCI-capable hospital, emergency room) or in the Cath Lab through catheter sheath. The current study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and each participating site. All patients or their relatives provided written informed consent. The final study protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplementary data online, Study Protocol.

Patient selection

Briefly, patients who met the following STEMI criteria were as follows: (1) age of 18–80 years; (2) STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset (STEMI was defined as ST-segment elevation ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads (V2–V3 lead elevation ≥2 mm) or new left bundle branch block, or right bundle branch block with ST-segment elevation or Q-wave in leads V1–V3); (3) intended to perform PPCI (expected time interval from FMC to balloon dilation ≤120 min and without considering thrombolysis). Key exclusion criteria were as follows: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical complication, active bleeding, oral anticoagulation, history of coronary artery bypass grafting, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Clinical Outcomes of Patients WithWith Different

The mean in‐hospital observation time was 12.6±6.7 days. In‐hospital SCD occurred in 334 patients (2.4%), of which 98 cases (0.7%) were due to CR. Among all patients with AMI, the incidence rates of in‐hospital SCD and CR in the group with ARBBB were significantly higher than those in the groups with NBBB, TRBBB, and LBBB (SCD: ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 10.6% versus 5.7% versus 4.3% versus 2.0%, P =0.001 for all; CR: ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 5.7% versus 2.7% versus 1.3% versus 0.5%, P <0.001 for all; Table 2), a difference that persisted in patients with STEMI (SCD: ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 7.2% versus 3.2% versus 2.4% versus 1.2%, P <0.001 for all; CR: ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 3.2% versus 1.7% versus 0.5% versus 0.3%, P <0.001 for all; Table 2). Although the differences in the incidence of in‐hospital SCD were not significant between the groups with ARBBB and LBBB in patients with NSTEMI (ARBBB versus LBBB: 3.4% versus 2.5%, P =0.079; Table 2), both groups had higher rates than the groups with TRBBB and NBBB (P =0.019 for all; Table 2). Additionally, the incidence of in‐hospital CR in the group with ARBBB remained significantly higher than in the other 3 groups among patients with NSTEMI (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 2.5% versus 1.1% versus 0.8% versus 0.2%, P =0.001 for all; Table 2).

### Accuracy of cath lab activation decisions for STEMI-equivalent and mimic ECGs: physicians vs. AI (queen of hearts by PMcardio) [^fa9e7203]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Accurate ECG interpretation is crucial to identify occlusive myocardial infarction (OMI) to determine the need for immediate catheterization laboratory activation (CLA). STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECG patterns deviate from conventional STEMI criteria, risking misclassification of OMI cases. The diagnostic accuracy for these complex ECGs is unknown.

Objectives

This study aimed to measure physician accuracy for interpreting STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECGs for catheterization laboratory activation (CLA) and compare their performance to a machine learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm, Queen of Hearts AI (QoH AI).

Methods

Fifty-three EPs and 42 cardiologists interpreted 18 ECGs (eight STEMI-equivalents, eight STEMI-mimics, with one STEMI, and a normal ECG as controls) to determine the presence of OMI requiring immediate CLA. The same ECGs were analyzed by QoH AI. Interpretations were compared against a reference standard based on angiography, troponin, echocardiography, and clinical follow-up.

Results

Interpretation accuracies were similar between EPs and cardiologists (65.6 %, 95 % CI [51, 78]; 65.5 %, 95 % CI [51, 77], respectively; p = 0.969), and significantly lower than QoH AI (88.9 %, 95 % CI [82, 93]) vs. physicians overall, 65.6 %, 95 % CI [52, 77]; p < 0.001). Physicians most frequently misclassified de Winter, Transient STEMI, Hyperacute T-wave OMI, and bundle branch block ECGs. QoH AI only misclassified left bundle branch block with OMI and left ventricular aneurysm without OMI.

Conclusion

Physicians frequently misinterpret STEMI-equivalent and STEMI-mimic ECGs, potentially impacting CLA decisions. QoH AI demonstrated superior accuracy, suggesting a potential to reduce missed OMIs and unnecessary catheterization laboratory activations. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings in clinical practice.

### Cangrelor [^92c90db3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cangrelor significantly reduced the occurrence of primary composite endpoint events compared to clopidogrel (relative risk reduction [RRR] 22%). Most of the effect was a reduction in post-procedural MIs detected solely by elevations in CK-MB (type 4a MI). Cangrelor did not reduce the risk of death. Table 2 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint.

 Table 2: Primary Endpoint and Its Component Events at 48 Hours in CHAMPION PHOENIX (mITT population)

Note: if a subject had more than one event at 48 hours, then worst outcome counted (death >MI >IDR >ST)

aThe mITT population is all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and underwent the index PCI procedure

bBased on logistic model adjusted for loading dose and baseline patient status for primary endpoint

A supplementary analysis was also performed omitting two subcomponent events of the primary endpoint that were of lesser clinical significance: intraprocedural stent thrombosis (defined as a new or increasing thrombus within or adjacent to a deployed stent occurring during the index PCI procedure), and myocardial infarction with less than a 10-fold increase in CK-MB, or with less than a 5-fold increase in CK-MB in the presence of new Q waves or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). These results are shown in Table 3.

Comparison of Basic Patient Data

We analyzed complete in‐hospital data from 13 886 patients with first‐episode AMI who underwent DES‐PCI. Table 1 compares the basic characteristics among the 4 patient groups. Compared with those with TRBBB and NBBB, patients with ARBBB and LBBB were older (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 37.9% versus 38.6% versus 31.0% versus 29.1%, P =0.011 for all; Table 1), had a lower body mass index (<18.5 kg/m, 2 ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 9.0% versus 9.1% versus 6.0% versus 6.4%, P =0.033 for all; Table 1), had more vessel lesions (P <0.001 for all; Table 1), with higher proportions of hyperlipidemia (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 37.6% versus 40.5% versus 32.1% versus 32.8%, P =0.043 for all; Table 1), and family history of MI (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 18.4% versus 19.3% versus 10.2% versus 10.3%, P <0.001 for all; Table 1). However, there were no differences in age, body mass index, vessel lesions, vessel lesions, or family history of MI between the groups with ARBBB and LBBB. The group with ARBBB had a higher HR (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 86.9±19.1 versus 82.1±18.1 versus 77.2±17.1 versus 76.3±17.9, P =0.043 for all; Table 1), but lower systolic blood pressure (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 108.7±26.9 versus 115.9±22.9 versus 127.2±26.1 versus 129.1±29.7, P =0.012 for all; Table 1) and lower incidence rates of reperfusion arrhythmias (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 22.1% versus 25.0% versus 35.1% versus 36.2%, P <0.001 for all; Table 1) than the groups with LBBB, TRBBB, and NBBB. The groups with ARBBB and LBBB had similar door‐to‐balloon times (P =0.422) and onset‐to‐door times (P =0.541), which were longer than those in the groups with TRBBB and NBBB (P <0.05 for all). The CTnI (cardiac troponin I), creatine kinase (CK), CK myocardial band, and BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels in the ARBBB group were higher than those in the other 3 groups (P <0.05 for all). Compared with the groups with TRBBB and NBBB, more patients with ARBBB and LBBB had STEMI (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 69.1% versus 68.5% versus 59.5% versus 56.4%, P <0.001 for all; Table 1), with culprit vessels were located in the LAD and left main coronary arteries (P <0.001 for all). There were no significant differences in mean QRS duration between the groups with ARBBB, LBBB, and TRBBB (133.8±18.9 milliseconds versus 134.1±19.5 milliseconds versus 133.5±18.5 milliseconds. P >0.05 for all), but these durations were higher than in patients with NBBB (79.4±10.5 milliseconds). Additionally, the use of an intra‐aortic balloon pump and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher in the group with ARBBB compared with the other 3 groups (P <0.001 for all). Furthermore, the incidence rates of no reflow (P <0.001 for all) and cardiogenic shock (P <0.001 for all) were higher in the group with ARBBB. The proportions of thrombolysis in MI<grade 2 post‐PCI, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and Killip class 3 to 4 were also higher in the group with ARBBB than in the other 3 groups (P <0.001 for all).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 24.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Categorical variables data were expressed as frequency (%), and differences between groups were assessed using the chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test. Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean±SD, with differences between groups assessed using the t test. Nonnormally distributed continuous variables were expressed as median (25th and 75th percentiles), and differences between groups were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Unadjusted cumulative event rates were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups with log‐rank test. After verifying proportional hazard assumptions and conducting multicollinearity testing, the Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable regression analysis, calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each variable. Predictors of different BBB types for SCD and CR in patients with AMI undergoing DES‐PCI were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusting for variables with statistically significant (P < 0.05) comparisons and considering clinical relevance. Two Cox models were used for adjustment. Model 1 adjusted only for factors related to BBB (NBBB, TRBBB, LBBB, and ARBBB). Model 2 adjusted for the following factors: NBBB, TRBBB, LBBB, ARBBB, female sex, age >65 years, current smoker status, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history of MI, ST‐segment–elevation MI (STEMI), left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) as the culprit vessel, door‐to‐balloon time, onset‐to‐door time, left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, right heart failure, postoperative thrombolysis in MI ≤ grade 2, Killip class 3 to 4, cardiogenic shock, no reflow, reperfusion arrhythmia, and multiple vessel lesions. HRs and 95% CIs with P <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

We analyzed the onset times of in‐hospital SCD and CR across all patients and found that the onset time of SCD in the group with ARBBB was earlier than that in the group with LBBB, although the difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (<12 hours, ARBBB versus LBBB: 24.3% versus 22.4%, P =0.236; 12–24 hours, ARBBB versus LBBB: 35.7% versus 34.6%, P =0.144; Figure 4C). The early onset of SCD (within 24 hours) in the groups with ARBBB and LBBB were earlier than those in the groups with TRBBB and NBBB (<24 hours, ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 60.0% versus 57.0% versus 38.7% versus 31.9%, P =0.001 for all; Figure 4C).

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^46499a7e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes—beta-blocker therapy: In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, early (<24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias, and a low dose should be started early after diagnosis of ACS (<24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit; examples of contraindications include acute heart failure (HF) [Killip class II–IV], low cardiac output or risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval >0.24 milliseconds, second- or third-degree heart block without a pacemaker, severe bradycardia, and active bronchospasm. Use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication, but routine use prior to PPCI is not supported because of inconsistent results regarding infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication can be reassessed after 24 hours for initiation if the contraindication has resolved, although the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a randomized trial did not confirm long-term benefit after hospital discharge in lower risk patients with preserved LV function who had undergone coronary revascularization.

### Comparison of angioplasty with infusion of tirofiban or abciximab and with implantation of sirolimus-eluting or uncoated stents for acute myocardial infarction (...) [^af192bb3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

PCI indicates percutaneous coronary intervention; SES, sirolimus-eluting stent; DES, drug-eluting stent; LBBB, left bundle-branch block; ECG, electrocardiogram; and NSTEMI, non−ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Context Abciximab infusion and uncoated-stent implantation is a complementary treatment strategy to reduce major adverse cardiac events in patients undergoing angioplasty for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. It is uncertain whether there may be similar benefits in replacing abciximab with high-dose bolus tirofiban. Similarly, the use of drug-eluting stents in this patient population is currently discouraged because of conflicting results on efficacy reported in randomized trials and safety concerns reported by registries. Objective To evaluate the effect of high-dose bolus tirofiban and of sirolimus-eluting stents as compared with abciximab infusion and uncoated-stent implantation in patients with STEMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Design, Setting, and Patients An open-label, 2 × 2 factorial trial of 745 patients presenting with STEMI or new left bundle-branch block at 16 referral centers in Italy, Spain, and Argentina between October 2004 and April 2007. Ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes were similar in the tirofiban and abciximab groups. At 8 months, major adverse cardiac events occurred in 54 patients with uncoated stents and 29 with sirolimus stents, predominantly reflecting a reduction of revascularization rates. The incidence of stent thrombosis was similar in the 2 stent groups.

Conclusions In patients with STEMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, compared with abciximab, tirofiban therapy was associated with noninferior resolution of ST-segment elevation at 90 minutes following coronary intervention, whereas sirolimus-eluting stent implantation was associated with a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiac events than uncoated stents within 8 months after intervention. The value of tirofiban at optimal bolus dose5, 6 as an alternative to abciximab in patients undergoing angioplasty for ST-elevation myocardial infarction is uncertain. This may carry relevant clinical and economical implications. Drug-eluting stents further reduce the risk of target-vessel revascularization after elective PCI compared with uncoated stents. However, the use of drug-eluting stents in this patient population is discouraged7 because of conflicting efficacy results reported in randomized trials8, 9 and safety concerns reported by registry studies.
10.

We therefore performed a multicenter, prospective, randomized trial to determine the optimal pharmaco-mechanical reperfusion strategy in patients with evolving STEMI. Two primary hypotheses were prespecified: tirofiban is noninferior to abciximab for the cumulative ST-segment resolution, expressed as the proportion of patients who achieve at least 50% recovery within 90 minutes after intervention, and sirolimus-eluting stent is superior to uncoated stent in terms of the composite of MACE, defined as death from any cause, reinfarction, and clinically driven target-vessel revascularization within the first 8 months. Changes in the ST-segment of the electrocardiogram were evaluated cumulatively before and 90 minutes after intervention. ST-segment elevation was measured to the nearest 0. 5 mm at 60 milliseconds after the J point by a single experienced cardiologist who was blinded to treatment assignments. The intraobserver agreement was 94. 1% (κ = 0.

Relationships Among the Different Types ofand the In‐Hospitaland

Unadjusted Kaplan–Meier analysis, followed by the log‐rank test, was performed to compare the incidence rates of in‐hospital SCD and CR among all patients. The incidence rate of SCD in the group with ARBBB was significantly higher than those in the groups with NBBB, TRBBB, and LBBB (log‐rank P <0.001; Figure 4A). A significant difference was also observed in the incidence of CR among the 4 groups (log‐rank P <0.001; Figure 4B).

The log‐rank comparison test showed significant differences in the cumulative rates of SCD and CR among the 4 groups stratified by BBB type. A, SCD, P <0.001; B, CR, P <0.001. The time of occurrence of SCD in the groups with ARBBB and LBBB was similar and were earlier than in the groups with TRBBB and NBBB (C, P <0.05).

### Septal branch occlusion leading to complete heart block post-percutaneous intervention: a cautionary tale in left bundle branch block patients [^dcca3b72]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

A 66-year-old man with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showing left bundle branch block developed persistent complete atrioventricular block following stent placement in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD), necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation. The complication is believed to have resulted from occlusion of the second septal branch, which likely supplied the right bundle of the His system. During elective interventions targeting the LAD in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities, it is crucial to maintain adequate blood flow to the septal perforators.

Table 2 
Comparison of the Incidence Rates of In‐Hospital SCD and CR and 2‐Year MACCEs in Patients With AMI and Different Types of Bundle‐Branch Block

We also observed the incidence rates of MACCEs within 2 years after discharge in all survivors from hospitalization. The incidence of all MACCEs in patients with ARBBB was higher than that in the other 3 groups (ARBBB versus LBBB versus TRBBB versus NBBB: 11.0% versus 6.8% versus 6.8% versus 2.1%, P <0.001 for all; Table 2). The incidence rates of all‐cause death, cardiac death, nonfatal recurrent MI, and malignant arrhythmia in the group with ARBBB were also higher than that of those in the other 3 groups (P <0.05 for all. Table 2).

The ECG and coronary angiogram of a typical AMI case with ARBBB, in which CR developed after DES‐PCI, is shown in Figure 3. In this case, a notch appeared in the ascending segment of the R‐wave in lead V1 on ECG (Figure 3A, red arrow). Coronary angiography revealed proximal acute occlusion of the LAD (Figure 3B, red arrow). The LAD lesion was successfully treated with DES‐PCI (Figure 3C, red arrow). However, the patient subsequently developed SCD due to CR post‐DES‐PCI. Left ventriculography using a pigtail catheter indicated contrast agent leakage into the pericardium through the free wall of the left ventricle (Figures 3D and 3E, red arrow). The CR was also confirmed by bedside color Doppler ultrasound.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^104248bd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ASSENT-2

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) study was an international, randomized, double-blind trial that compared 30-day mortality rates in 16,949 patients assigned to receive an IV bolus dose of TNKase or an accelerated infusion of Activase®(alteplase). Eligibility criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of randomization and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients were to be excluded from the trial if they received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the previous 12 hours. TNKase was dosed using actual or estimated weight in a weight-tiered fashion as described in Dosage and Administration (2.1) . All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤ 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing > 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. Heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged for the first 24 hours following randomization. The results of the primary endpoint (30-day mortality rates with non-parametric adjustment for the covariates of age, Killip class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and infarct location) along with selected other 30-day endpoints are shown in Table 2 .

Rates of mortality and the combined endpoint of death or stroke among pre-specified subgroups, including age, gender, time to treatment, infarct location, and history of previous myocardial infarction, demonstrate consistent relative risks across these subgroups. There was insufficient enrollment of non-Caucasian patients to draw any conclusions regarding relative efficacy in racial subsets.

Rates of in-hospital procedures, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent placement, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, were similar between the TNKase and Activase (alteplase) groups.

Recommendation-specific supportive text—pathophysiology, trial scope, and risk factors note that the presence of STEMI or STEMI-equivalent pattern on ECG after cardiac arrest implies transmural myocardial ischemia and a high probability of acute coronary occlusion, which can result in worsening cardiovascular instability if not promptly revascularized; randomized controlled trials examining the optimal timing of coronary angiography after OHCA systematically excluded patients with STEMI; evaluating for CAD prior to hospital discharge with invasive coronary angiography in cardiac arrest survivors with a presumed cardiac etiology is supported by other cardiology-focused guidelines and scientific statements and trials of timing performed invasive coronary angiography in all patients with neurological awakening; cardiogenic shock or recurrent ventricular arrhythmias after cardiac arrest can be caused by severe myocardial ischemia and patients with these unstable conditions are at high risk of re arrest if ischemia goes untreated; randomized clinical trials allowed crossover to the emergent arm for shock, recurrent VF, or evidence of severe myocardial ischemia, while elevated serum troponin levels and ischemic ECG abnormalities other than STEMI have inadequate sensitivity or specificity for unstable CAD and do not predict the benefit of invasive coronary angiography.

### Left bundle branch block as a risk factor for heart failure (...) [^ee8bdcd0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The presence of LBBB as confirmed by 12-lead electrocardiograms obtained on all participants at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the associations of LBBB with the risk of incident HF, hospital admission for HF with reduced EF or HF with preserved EF, 5-year LVEF decline, and death. In the adjusted model, those with baseline LBBB had an increased risk of incident HF and greater odds of 5-year LVEF decline, but no statistically significant increased risk of death was observed.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of individuals with structurally normal hearts, LBBB was associated with an increased risk of HF and a decrease in LVEF, suggesting that LBBB could be a potential target for early interventions to prevent deterioration of cardiac function and, ultimately, progression to HF. Left bundle branch block is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. 1-4 Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a well-established treatment to mitigate the morbidity and mortality of LBBB in these patients. 5-7 However. Myocardial infarction was defined by self-report and confirmed with medical record verification. 18, 19 Prevalent AF was considered present given an extant AF diagnosis, AF on the baseline 12-lead ECG, or on baseline Holter monitoring available from a random subgroup of participants.

Twelve-lead resting ECGs were obtained on all participants at baseline using the MAC PC-DT ECG recorder. ECG wave measurements and classification of LBBB followed the guidelines from the Minnesota Code Manual of Electrocardiographic Findings and were overread by a core facility.
21. In addition, the CHS Events Committee reviewed the symptoms, signs, and chest radiograph findings of HF. For each event of incident HF, all medical records 2 weeks before and 30 days after the event were reviewed for LVEF assessments and were considered as systolic dysfunction if the LVEF assessment closest in time was either described qualitatively as below normal or clinically quantified as LVEF less than 45%. Admission with HF with reduced EF vs HF with preserved EF was based on only clinical assessments of LVEF at or around the admission.

% of the initial CHS cohort, with an interreader agreement of 94% and an intrareader agreement of 98% in paired studies. 22 Echocardiography was repeated after 5 years. 17 Results from the 5-year echocardiography, overread using the same protocol as baseline, were dichotomized into normal or decreased for the purposes of the current analysis. A decrease in LVEF was defined as a baseline echocardiogram assessed as normal, and a 5-year echocardiography assessed as mildly reduced, moderately reduced, or severely reduced as previously defined. We performed unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression to calculate the odds of a decrease in LVEF after 5 years using the study echocardiograms performed at baseline and the 5-year visit. We performed 2 sensitivity analyses.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrical complications after acute coronary syndromes (ACS)—implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and pacing guidance: In patients post myocardial infarction (MI), ICD implantation is recommended in selected patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% at least 40 days post MI and at least 90 days postrevascularization to reduce death. In patients post ACS with clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias >48 hours and within 40 days post MI, ICD implantation is reasonable. In patients early after MI, usefulness of a temporary wearable cardioverter‑defibrillator is uncertain in patients with an LVEF ≤35% to improve survival. For bradyarrhythmias, in patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with second‑degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high‑grade atrioventricular block, alternating bundle‑branch block, or third‑degree atrioventricular block (persistent or transient), permanent pacing is indicated.

Heart failure—cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) without prior implant—assumptions and class-based indications specify that non–left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) is defined as right bundle branch block (RBBB) or nonspecific intraventricular conduction block and that assessments occur after ≥3 months of optimized guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT); if persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is present, it should be assumed that CRT pacing can be maximized with a high percentage of pacing (≥98%). The strongest recommendations (Class I) for CRT are for patients who have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, sinus rhythm, LBBB with a QRS ≥150 ms, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or ambulatory IV symptoms on GDMT. Less strong recommendations (Class IIa) include LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, a non-LBBB pattern with QRS ≥150 ms and NYHA class III/ambulatory class IV on GDMT; LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, LBBB with a QRS 120 to 149 ms and NYHA class II, III, or ambulatory IV on GDMT; AF with LVEF ≤35% on GDMT if ventricular pacing is required or CRT criteria are otherwise met and atrioventricular nodal ablation or rate control allows near 100% ventricular pacing with CRT; and those on GDMT with LVEF ≤35% undergoing new or replacement device implantation with anticipated ventricular pacing (>40%). Even less strong recommendations (Class IIb) include LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, a non-LBBB pattern with a QRS duration of 120 to 149 ms and NYHA class III/ambulatory class IV on GDMT; LVEF ≤35%, sinus rhythm, a non-LBBB pattern with QRS ≥150 ms and NYHA class II on GDMT; and LVEF ≤30%, ischemic etiology of heart failure, sinus rhythm, LBBB with QRS ≥150 ms and NYHA class I on GDMT. CRT is not recommended (Class III, no benefit) for those with NYHA class I or II symptoms and non-LBBB with QRS <150 ms and for those whose comorbidities and/or frailty limit survival to <1 year.

Acute coronary syndromes—prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) triage emphasizes that patients should be managed based on the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation (or suspected equivalent) on the 12-lead ECG. When possible, electrocardiographic tracings can be transmitted to the PPCI center while en route to help expedite coronary reperfusion upon arrival, and because patients with ACS and evidence of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock in the prehospital setting are at highest risk for death, identification of these complications with subsequent triage of these patients to a PCI-capable facility when possible is important. Recommendation-specific supportive text states that the early acquisition and recording of prehospital 12-lead ECGs by trained personnel is associated with shorter reperfusion times and lower mortality rates from STEMI if this diagnostic information is integrated in patients’ care, and that appropriately trained EMS personnel (ie, paramedics) can interpret 12-lead ECGs for the identification of STEMI.

### ECG patterns of occlusion myocardial infarction: a narrative review [^faa7fbcf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The traditional management of acute coronary syndrome has relied on the identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as a proxy of acute coronary occlusion. This conflation of STEMI with acute coronary occlusion has historically overshadowed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), despite evidence suggesting 25% to 34% of NSTEMI cases may also include acute coronary occlusion. Current limitations in the STEMI/NSTEMI binary framework underscore the need for a revised approach to chest pain and acute coronary syndrome management. The emerging paradigm distinguishing occlusion myocardial infarction from nonocclusion myocardial infarction (NOMI) seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic effect in acute coronary syndrome care. This approach not only emphasizes the urgency of reperfusion therapy for high-risk ECG patterns not covered by current STEMI criteria, but also emphasizes the broader transition from viewing acute coronary syndrome as a disease defined by the ECG to a disease defined by its underlying pathology, for which the ECG is an important but insufficient surrogate test. This report outlines the emerging occlusion myocardial infarction paradigm, detailing specific ECG patterns linked to acute coronary occlusion, and proposes a new framework that could enhance triage accuracy and treatment strategies for acute coronary syndrome. Although further validation is required, the occlusion myocardial infarction pathway holds promise for earlier acute coronary occlusion detection, timely cath lab activation, and improved myocardial salvage-offering potentially significant implications for both clinical practice and future research in acute coronary syndrome management.

Risk stratification tools for patients with STEMI and NSTE-ACS emphasize validated use and limitations. “Substantial variability in short-term mortality and MACE risk exists among patients with ACS,” and “Individual risk assessment can inform discussions with patients and decisions regarding therapeutic interventions.” The GRACE and TIMI Risk Scores “are well validated and may be useful for helping to guide some therapeutic decisions,” but “These scores are not to be used as diagnostic tools.” The GRACE Risk Score “has been found to be superior to subjective clinical assessment for the prediction of death or MI,” yet “there is insufficient evidence that routine use of risk scores in patients hospitalized for STEMI/NSTE-ACS translates into reduced risk of cardiovascular events.” Table 5 target outcomes are specified as GRACE: “In-hospital, 6-mo, 1-y, 3-y, death/MI”; TIMI Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: “14-d all-cause death, MI, or urgent revascularization”; TIMI STEMI: “30-d all-cause death.” Variables include, for Unstable Angina/NSTEMI, “Age ≥65 y … ST-segment deviation ≥0.5 mm … ≥2 anginal events in prior 24 h … Aspirin use in prior 7 d,” and for STEMI, “Systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg, 3 points) … Heart rate >100 bpm (2 points) … Anterior ST-segment elevation or LBBB (1 point) … Diabetes/hypertension/angina (1 point) … Weight <67 kg (1 point) … Time to treatment >4 h (1 point).”

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^5830192e]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest care—Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of cardiac arrest as well as identification and treatment of complications from cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are important considerations in postresuscitation care. Twelve-lead ECG, echocardiography, point-of-care cardiac ultrasound, and CT imaging are used in postarrest patients to identify clinically significant diagnoses requiring intervention, and these diagnostic modalities are complementary, with patients often receiving multiple studies. While the majority of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest have abnormal findings on these studies, these are not always diagnostic for the specific etiology of cardiac arrest and may not change clinical management, and the performance, timing, and interpretation of each study is guided by the clinical context. It is also important to note that the considerations regarding diagnostic imaging for an in-hospital cardiac arrest may differ from those in OHCA and that most of the available literature focuses on OHCA. A 12-lead ECG obtained after ROSC can identify arrhythmia, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and other diagnoses associated with cardiac arrest for which treatment or monitoring is indicated, yet while the ECG is critical in identifying patients with STEMI or STEMI-equivalent patterns, its accuracy for these diagnoses in the immediate post-ROSC period has limitations.

5.4     Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays

Since initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, an up-titration scheme should be used to reach the maintenance dosage of MAYZENT [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

MAYZENT was not studied in patients who had:

In the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization
New York Heart Association Class II-IV heart failure
Cardiac conduction or rhythm disorders, including complete left bundle branch block, sinus arrest or sino-atrial block, symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, Mobitz type II second degree AV-block or higher-grade AV-block (either history or observed at screening), unless patient has a functioning pacemaker
Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)
Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]

Reduction in Heart Rate

After the first titration dose of MAYZENT, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour, and the Day 1 decline is maximal at approximately 3 to 4 hours. With continued up-titration, further heart rate decreases are seen on subsequent days, with maximal decrease from Day 1-baseline reached on Day 5 to Day 6. The highest daily post-dose decrease in absolute hourly mean heart rate is observed on Day 1, with the pulse declining on average 5 to 6 bpm. Post-dose declines on the following days are less pronounced. With continued dosing, heart rate starts increasing after Day 6 and reaches placebo levels within 10 days after treatment initiation.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends beta-blockers for patients with STEMI or NSTEMI and reduced LVEF (<40%),,and suggests long-term treatment for those with a history of prior MI, though without specifying duration. Its current guideline for ACS management recommends beta-blocker use in patients with LVEF ≤40% but does not distinguish between STEMI and NSTEMI or provide guidance on long-term therapy (Figure 2).Similarly, the current AHA/ACC guideline for chronic coronary disease management recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF <50% but advises reassessing the indication of treatment at 1-year post-MI for patients without reduced LVEF. They do not recommend long-term therapy for those with LVEF >50%.The National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (NHFA/CSANZ) Guidelines for ACS management (Figure 3) recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF <40%, without differentiating between STEMI and NSTEMI, and lacks clear guidance for those with LVEF >40%.

### New ECG morphologic criteria for the identification of left bundle branch capture [^099f0ea6]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Identification of left bundle branch capture (LBBc) during left bundle branch area pacing remains challenging.

Objectives

This study sought to validate the utility of new simple morphologic criteria for the identification of LBBc.

Methods

Patients with proven LBBc based on the presence of QRS transition during decremental output pacing were included. The paced V 6 QRS upstroke/downstroke was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated, and classified as fast or slow, with fast upstroke patterns associated with LBBc and slow upstroke patterns with left ventricular septal capture (LVSc). Additionally, the appearance of a paced QRS downstroke slurring/notching in any lead not previously present during lead penetration and/or an "M" QRS pattern in inferior leads was also considered suggestive of LBBc. Accuracy of these criteria was tested by independent evaluators using exclusively qualitative electrocardiogram morphologic features.

Results

115 patients with proven LBBc were included. Mean V 6 QRS upstroke duration during LBBc was significantly shorter than during LVSc (34.6 ± 10.1 ms vs 63.2 ± 12.1 ms; P < 0.001). A paced V 6 upstroke/downstroke ratio <1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.95 for the identification of LBBc. A slurred/notched QRS downstroke or "M" pattern in inferior leads was present in 91.1% during LBBc in baseline narrow QRS patients with inferior paced QRS axis, with sensitivity and specificity being 0.91 and 0.87, respectively. Using exclusively qualitative criteria, independent evaluators were able to identify the correct capture pattern in 87% of LBBc and 89% of LVSc cases, with diagnostic accuracy being significantly lower among dilated cardiomyopathy patients: 70.4% vs 93%; P = 0.004.

Conclusions

Simple electrocardiogram morphologic criteria can accurately identify LBBc during left bundle branch area pacing in patients with baseline narrow QRS and/or without cardiomyopathy.

Electrocardiogram in suspected myocarditis: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used as an initial screening tool for diagnosis of myocarditis with a low sensitivity of 47%, and a normal or nonspecific ECG does not rule out myocarditis. Presence of pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block, wide complex QRS ≥120 ms, prolonged QT interval, high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, malignant tachyarrhythmias, fragmented QRS, and T-wave inversion are often associated with decreased left ventricular function, left ventricular scar, and overall poor clinical prognosis; involvement of the conduction system raises suspicion for sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis (GCM), or Lyme disease. ECG should be performed in cases of suspected myocarditis, but a normal ECG would not rule out presence of myocarditis.

### Acute coronary-occlusion myocardial infarctions: performance of the STEMI criteria and evolving alternative approaches [^1abe1865]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA), which occur predominantly due to atherothrombosis with varying degrees of acute occlusion of coronary vasculature. Coronary angiogram and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are central to management of acute coronary occlusions; however, the timing of coronary angiogram varies significantly across these pathologies based on current guidelines. The STEMI criteria are electrocardiographic features utilized to rapidly triage patients to catheterization laboratories, because these criteria are felt to be specific for acute coronary occlusion of culprit coronary vessels. Patients who do not fulfill STEMI criteria are triaged as NSTEMIs with delayed coronary reperfusion strategies. A significant proportion of patients with NSTEMI ACS are found to have acute coronary occlusion (ACO) of coronary vessels. Some NSTEMI patterns on electrocardiogram that are considered specific for acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction (ACOMI) have been aptly labeled "STEMI-equivalents" and are thus recognized as high-risk features in expert statements but, as of yet, not formally adopted in guidelines. Here, we review the current literature on ACOMI in NSTEMI ACS and the "STEMI Equivalents". We discuss the potential role for additional studies, revised diagnostic criteria, and predictive tools to better stratify patients with NSTEMI ACS for urgent versus delayed reperfusion.

1-19 Therefore, we performed a matched control cohort study to determine whether exercise-induced LBBB is an independent predictor for major cardiovascular. Rest and exercise electrocardiograms were independently reviewed by 3 physicians to confirm the diagnosis of exercise-induced LBBB. The diagnosis of complete LBBB was made from the 12-lead ECG if all the following criteria were met: conduction originating above the atrioventricular node; a QRS duration. excluded. Patients with permanent pacemakers and/or evidence of preexcitation were also excluded. Exercise-induced LBBB was defined by LBBB that was documented only during treadmill exercise stress testing.

PPCI in STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals—For patients with STEMI presenting ≤12 hours after symptom onset, PPCI should be performed with a goal of FMC to device activation of ≤90 minutes, or ≤120 minutes in patients requiring hospital transfer, to improve survival (COR 1; LOE A). In patients with ACS and cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel by PCI or CABG is indicated to improve survival, irrespective of time from symptom onset (COR 1; LOE B-R). In patients with STEMI presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). In patients with STEMI presenting >24 hours after symptom onset with the presence of ongoing ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). In patients who are stable with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct-related artery >24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life-threatening arrhythmia, PCI should not be performed due to lack of benefit (COR 3: No Benefit; LOE B-R).

### Challenging the STEMI paradigm: the case of total coronary occlusion in non-STEMI presentations [^c251ce01]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the emergency department (ED) is essential, as delayed treatment worsens patient outcomes. Current ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria rely on ST-elevation (STE) in contiguous leads, yet emerging evidence suggests these criteria often miss acute coronary occlusion (ACO) in patients with atypical electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. We report the case of a 62-year-old male presenting to the ED with progressive chest pain radiating to left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis. His initial ECG showed isolated STE in lead II and ST depression in leads V4 and V5 but lacked the full STEMI criteria for diagnosing acute MI. During his ED stay, the patient suffered a sudden cardiac arrest from torsade de pointes and was successfully resuscitated. Urgent angiography revealed a 100 % occlusion in the obtuse marginal 1 (OM1) artery, along with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA). The patient underwent successful OM1 stenting and was discharged in stable condition. This case emphasizes the limitations of the STEMI paradigm in identifying ACO in cases without classic STE, highlighting the importance of recognizing atypical ECG patterns by emergency physician to facilitate timely intervention. The emerging Occlusion MI (OMI) paradigm broadens diagnostic criteria to better identify high-risk patients, potentially improving early diagnosis, reducing missed ACO cases, and enhancing outcomes for those who do not meet traditional STEMI criteria.

If patients self-transport to a non-PCI center, perform “Door-to-ECG ≤10 min (Class 1)” and diagnose STEMI, then the non-PCI center “commits to reperfusion strategy.” For a fibrinolysis pathway: “If PPCI not feasible within 120 min of FMC (Class 1) • Goal door-to-lysis ≤30 min,” followed by transfer: “If lysis failed or patient unstable, arrange for urgent angiography for rescue PCI (Class 1) • If lysis successful and patient stable, arrange for early angiography (Class 1).” For a primary PCI pathway: “If PPCI feasible within 120 min of FMC, or lysis contraindicated (Class 1) • Activate cath lab for PPCI • Urgent transfer to PCI center (bypass ED, direct to cath lab, if feasible)” with “Goal FMC-to-device ≤90 min (direct presenters) or ≤120 min (transfers) (Class 1)” and Primary PCI. If FMC occurs at a PCI center, perform “Door-to-ECG ≤10 min (Class 1),” diagnose STEMI, and “Activate cath lab.”

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^9c84a2a7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4     First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions

Because initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring

Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring

If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.

Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients:

With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]

### Association between cumulative body mass index exposure and the risk of incident cardiac conduction block [^f310a1b2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between cumulative body mass index (cumBMI) exposure and cardiac conduction block (CCB) is not fully understood. This study aimed to explore the association between cumBMI and the risk of CCB.

Methods and Results

A total of 107 860 participants of the Kailuan Study were included. Participants were then categorized into 4 groups based on their quartile of cumBMI. The association of cumBMI with CCB was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. During a median follow‐up of 8.36 years, 1894 CCBs, 586 atrioventricular blocks (AVBs), 1273 intraventricular blocks, 851 right bundle branch blocks, and 319 any left bundle branch blocks occurred. After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratios for CCB, atrioventricular block, intraventricular block, right bundle branch block, and any left bundle branch block were 1.86 (95% CI, 1.60–2.18), 2.51 (95% CI, 1.90–3.32), 1.55 (95% CI, 1.28–1.87), 2.14 (95% CI, 1.69–2.71), and 1.18 (95% CI, 0.81–1.72) for individuals in the highest quartile of cumBMI compared with those in the second quartile, respectively. Additionally, the subgroup analyses showed significant interactions between age, sex, and cumBMI for developing CCB (P for interaction<0.05).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that higher cumulative BMI exposure significantly increased the risk of CCB, especially atrioventricular block. Monitoring cumulative BMI may help to identify high‐risk CCB populations.

5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences

False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies

A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies).

False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity

Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level.

False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid

Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds

Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna.

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiogenic shock—recommendations are as follows: For selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and severe or refractory cardiogenic shock, insertion of a microaxial intravascular flow pump “is reasonable to reduce death” (Class 2a, Level B-R). In patients with mechanical complication of ACS, short-term MCS devices “are reasonable for hemodynamic stabilization as a bridge to surgery” (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiogenic shock, the routine use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) “is not recommended due to a lack of survival benefit” (Class 3: No benefit, Level B-R).

### Impact of a 24 / 7 on-site percutaneous coronary intervention team strategy on door-to-wire time [^30d760be]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

For patients with STEMI presenting at the ED, the D2W time was arbitrarily divided into five individual components in the present study: time to obtain ECG, time to make STEMI diagnosis, time to make the cath lab ready, time to transfer the patient and time to cross the lesion. Among the above time intervals, time to make the cath lab ready, that is, the time interval between the time when the PCI team is activated and that when the cath lab is ready for PCI, represents the response time of the PCI team. This response time would be a key contributor to the overall D2W time, particularly during off-hours. Therefore, a 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy was introduced and implemented in PUMCH to decrease the response time of the PCI team and, in consequence, the overall D2W time in patients with STEMI. This study demonstrated that this strategy was associated with reductions in both the D2W time and the rate of delayed primary PCI. In addition, these reductions seemed to be even more prominent in patients presenting at the ED during off-hours compared with those presenting at the ED during on-hours. Considering the association between the D2W time and the outcomes of patients with STEMI, implementing the 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy might improve the prognosis of these patients, especially those presenting during off-hours who demonstrated worse outcomes compared with patients admitted during on-hours.Although the in-hospital mortality rate was not reduced by the 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy in this study, it might be due to the relatively small sample size and the low event rates, as well as the retrospective and observational design of this study. Randomised, adequately powered outcomes studies are necessary to clarify the clinical effect of the 24/7 on-site PCI team strategy in patients with STEMI.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Prasugrel tablets is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:

Patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (1.1).
Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with either primary or delayed PCI (1.1).

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome

Prasugrel tablet is indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:

Patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with primary or delayed PCI.

Prasugrel tablet has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke compared to clopidogrel. The difference between treatments was driven predominantly by MI, with no difference on strokes and little difference on CV death [see Clinical Studies (14)] .
