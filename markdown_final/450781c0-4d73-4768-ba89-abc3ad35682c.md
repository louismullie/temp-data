## Question

Can dapagliflozin be used for central diabetes insipidus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dapagliflozin can be used to treat central diabetes insipidus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the opposing mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition versus arginine vasopressin deficiency in CDI. Then, I should review clinical evidence, especially case reports describing diagnostic interference or harm. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines and FDA labeling to confirm indications and recommended therapies. After that, I need to analyze the physiological risks, including effects on polyuria, urine osmolality, and serum sodium. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation for management when CDI is suspected or confirmed in a patient taking dapagliflozin [^111GiDN8] [^113ifqV2] [^114NnP5Z] [^11292txb].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanisms, because if I mix these up I could reach the wrong conclusion. Dapagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that reduces proximal tubular glucose and sodium reabsorption, producing glycosuria with osmotic diuresis and some natriuresis, which contracts intravascular volume and lowers blood pressure, whereas central diabetes insipidus is defined by deficient AVP secretion causing an inability to concentrate urine, hypotonic polyuria, and compensatory polydipsia; these mechanisms are directionally opposite in terms of renal water handling, so I need to be careful not to conflate glycosuric diuresis with antidiuresis [^111GiDN8] [^113ifqV2] [^114NnP5Z] [^11292txb].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical consequences of that mechanistic clash. If dapagliflozin adds an osmotic diuresis on top of the existing water diuresis in AVP deficiency, urine volume should increase further and free water losses should intensify, which would tend to worsen hypernatremia risk in CDI rather than improve it; the FDA labeling for dapagliflozin warns about volume depletion, and the core CDI pathophysiology places patients at risk of hypernatremia when intake does not keep up, so combining the two is physiologically hazardous rather than therapeutic [^115vuKj5] [^114NnP5Z] [^113ifqV2].

> Next, I should review real-world evidence, because mechanistic reasoning can mislead if contradicted by clinical data. Case reports describe that in patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes and CDI, dapagliflozin not only accelerated polyuria but also obscured the hallmark hypotonic urine of CDI by raising urine specific gravity and osmolality via glycosuria; crucially, CDI was unmasked only after dapagliflozin discontinuation, allowing a water deprivation test to confirm the diagnosis within 48 hours, which strongly suggests diagnostic interference and clinical exacerbation while on SGLT2 therapy [^1179DiTa] [^114KaAKJ] [^115mfVgK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking guidelines and labels. I need to ensure whether any professional guidance supports SGLT2 use in CDI or if desmopressin remains the standard; the Society for Endocrinology inpatient guidance repeatedly centers CDI management on fluid optimization and desmopressin administration, and U.S. FDA labeling explicitly indicates desmopressin for CDI while dapagliflozin has no indication for CDI, instead being indicated for type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, which confirms that SGLT2 inhibitors are not recognized therapies for CDI [^114Nr1Wb] [^116fx2D8] [^113nPcfZ] [^113cTPrj] [^116Tfjqu] [^1142VXiU] [^11784a6o].

> I will now examine whether there is any plausible physiological rationale for SGLT2 benefit in CDI, just to be thorough. But wait, what if mild natriuresis could theoretically reduce serum sodium by obligating water excretion to match solute; hmm, wait a minute, in CDI the dominant problem is failure of antidiuresis at the collecting duct, so adding an osmotic diuresis from glycosuria increases urine flow and water losses, aggravating the free-water deficit rather than correcting it, which aligns with the observed hypernatremia risk and contradicts any utility as antidiuretic therapy [^113ifqV2] [^114NnP5Z].

> Let me consider the diagnostic dimension more carefully, because missing CDI is dangerous. Dapagliflozin-driven glycosuria can artifactually raise urine specific gravity and osmolality, masking the dilute urine one expects in CDI and thereby confounding the water deprivation test and delaying diagnosis; in the reported cases, stopping dapagliflozin for 48 hours restored hypotonic polyuria and enabled definitive testing, which argues for temporarily discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors when CDI is suspected to preserve diagnostic accuracy with water deprivation or copeptin-based stimulation protocols [^1179DiTa] [^114NnP5Z] [^111SE5FU].

> I should confirm safety signals specific to CDI phenotypes, including adipsic CDI, because thirst impairment changes the risk calculus. Patients with CDI are vulnerable to hypernatremia when thirst is impaired or access to water is limited, and adding dapagliflozin's volume-depleting osmotic diuresis compounds free water losses, which can precipitate severe hypernatremia; this has been described clinically in CDI contexts with transient adipsia and is consistent with volume depletion warnings on dapagliflozin's label, reinforcing that SGLT2 therapy can be particularly dangerous in CDI [^1179DiTa] [^115vuKj5] [^114NnP5Z].

> Let me double-check potential confounding by other approved SGLT2 indications, because I don't want to overgeneralize. Dapagliflozin is beneficial for type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, but those approvals and guideline endorsements do not extend to CDI, which is a disorder of AVP deficiency requiring hormone replacement; thus, any coexistence of T2DM or HF with CDI does not transform dapagliflozin into an antidiuretic therapy, and its use should be reconsidered if CDI is suspected or confirmed due to the risks and diagnostic interference described above [^11784a6o] [^114Gnmga] [^114NnP5Z].

> I need to ensure the therapeutic recommendation is precise and practical. When CDI is suspected in a patient taking dapagliflozin, the prudent approach is to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor to avoid diagnostic masking and exacerbation of polyuria, proceed with appropriate diagnostic testing such as water deprivation or hypertonic-saline/arginine-stimulated copeptin when indicated, and initiate desmopressin with careful fluid and sodium monitoring per endocrine guidance; this sequence both clarifies diagnosis and mitigates the risk of hypernatremia associated with ongoing osmotic diuresis [^1179DiTa] [^114NnP5Z] [^114Nr1Wb] [^116Tfjqu].

> Final synthesis, with one more self-check for coherence and consistency: No, dapagliflozin should not be used to treat central diabetes insipidus, because its glycosuric osmotic diuresis worsens polyuria and free-water loss, can mask the hypotonic urine that anchors diagnosis, lacks any regulatory or guideline support for CDI, and contrasts with the established standard of care of desmopressin plus fluid management; therefore, discontinue dapagliflozin when CDI is suspected or diagnosed to permit accurate testing and to reduce the risk of hypernatremia, and manage CDI with desmopressin under endocrinology guidance [^113ifqV2] [^1179DiTa] [^11784a6o] [^114Nr1Wb] [^116Tfjqu].

---

Dapagliflozin is **not recommended** for central diabetes insipidus (CDI) because it increases osmotic diuresis [^113ifqV2] and can worsen polyuria, dehydration, and hypernatremia. There is no evidence that dapagliflozin reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms, and it may mask hypotonic polyuria and delay diagnosis [^1179DiTa] [^115mfVgK]. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy** [^114NnP5Z], and dapagliflozin should be avoided in these patients.

---

## Mechanism of action of dapagliflozin

Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2✱* [^111GiDN8] in the proximal renal tubules, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion, causing osmotic diuresis and natriuresis [^113ifqV2]. This mechanism is beneficial in T2DM but can increase urine output and dehydration risk in CDI [^115vuKj5].

---

## Pathophysiology of central diabetes insipidus

CDI is characterized by **AVP deficiency**, leading to impaired water reabsorption, large volumes of dilute urine, and compensatory polydipsia [^114NnP5Z]. Standard treatment is **desmopressin**, a vasopressin analog that reduces urine output and concentrates urine [^113cTPrj].

---

## Potential therapeutic rationale for dapagliflozin in CDI

There is **no clear therapeutic rationale** for dapagliflozin in CDI. Its osmotic diuresis [^113ifqV2] could worsen polyuria and dehydration, and there is no evidence that it reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms [^114NnP5Z].

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Limited clinical evidence suggests dapagliflozin is **not beneficial** in CDI and may worsen symptoms [^1179DiTa]. Case reports include a patient with T2DM and CDI who developed persistent hypernatremia and polyuria after dapagliflozin initiation, with symptoms improving after the medication was discontinued and desmopressin started. Another report noted that SGLT2 inhibitors can mask hypotonic polyuria, complicating CDI diagnosis and management [^115mfVgK]. Together, these reports indicate dapagliflozin **may exacerbate polyuria**, dehydration, and hypernatremia in CDI [^113ifqV2].

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

Dapagliflozin use in CDI raises **significant safety concerns** [^115vuKj5]:

- **Osmotic diuresis**: Increased urine output and dehydration risk [^113ifqV2].
- **Hypernatremia**: Worsening sodium imbalance due to fluid loss [^114NnP5Z].
- **Delayed diagnosis**: Masking of hypotonic polyuria, complicating diagnosis and management [^1179DiTa].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Desmopressin is the **standard treatment** for CDI, effectively reducing urine output and concentrating urine [^113cTPrj]. Dapagliflozin does not address the underlying AVP deficiency and may worsen symptoms, making it **inferior to desmopressin**.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert opinions

Current guidelines and expert opinions **do not recommend** dapagliflozin for CDI. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy** [^114Nr1Wb], and dapagliflozin should be avoided due to potential adverse effects and lack of evidence for efficacy.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials or research studies

There are **no known ongoing clinical trials** or research studies investigating dapagliflozin for CDI. The limited available evidence suggests it is not beneficial and may be harmful in this population.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dapagliflozin is **not recommended for CDI** due to its osmotic diuresis [^113ifqV2], which can worsen polyuria, dehydration, and hypernatremia. There is no evidence that it reduces urine output or improves CDI symptoms, and it may mask hypotonic polyuria, delaying diagnosis [^1179DiTa]. Desmopressin remains the **standard therapy**, and dapagliflozin should be avoided in CDI.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impaired vasopressin physiology, often accompanied by hypernatremia and hyperosmolality if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Discriminating CDI from primary polydipsia can be challenging. A water deprivation test remains a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. In this case, polyuria was not initially associated with hypotonic urine (maximum specific urine gravity: 1.018) while the patient was on dapagliflozin. However, two days after discontinuing dapagliflozin, hypotonic polyuria became evident, and a water deprivation test confirmed CDI, showing an increase in urine specific gravity from 1.005 to 1.010 and urine osmolality from 19 to 86 mOsm/kg.

Several intriguing features were observed in this patient. During her second admission, she presented with hypernatremia without thirst, but by her third admission, she developed significant polydipsia (up to 10 L/day). This transient adipsia may have resulted from temporary damage to thirst-regulating neurons and osmoreceptors due to hypovolemia, which resolved over time. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis caused by poorly controlled diabetes and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors likely exacerbated her polydipsia and polyuria. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, contributing to osmotic diuresis. A similar case was reported in a patient with adipsic CDI following traumatic brain injury, where empagliflozin obscured low urine osmolality (a relatively high urine osmolality: 529 mOsm/kg) and partially attenuated the antidiuretic effect.

Regarding the medical management for arginine vasopressin deficiency, specifically concerning fluid therapy, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend determining the type and volume of fluid therapy for patients unable to manage their fluid intake and medication due to impaired consciousness. This should be equivalent to the daily requirements appropriate for other patients without central diabetes insipidus and administered alongside the agreed, prescribed dose of desmopressin.

### Ddavp [^113cTPrj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

DDAVP tablets contain, as their active substance, desmopressin acetate, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone arginine vasopressin.

- **Central diabetes insipidus**: Dose-response studies in patients with diabetes insipidus have demonstrated that oral doses of 0.025 mg to 0.4 mg produced clinically significant antidiuretic effects. In most patients, doses of 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg produced optimal antidiuretic effects lasting up to eight hours. With doses of 0.4 mg, antidiuretic effects were observed for up to 12 hours; measurements beyond 12 hours were not recorded. Increasing oral doses produced dose-dependent increases in the plasma levels of DDAVP (desmopressin acetate).

The plasma half-life of DDAVP followed a monoexponential time course with t1/2 values of 1.5 to 2.5 hours, which was independent of dose. The bioavailability of DDAVP oral tablets is about 5% compared to intranasal DDAVP and about 0.16% compared to intravenous DDAVP. The time to reach maximum plasma DDAVP levels ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 hours following oral or intranasal administration, respectively. Following administration of DDAVP tablets, the onset of antidiuretic effect occurs at around 1 hour, and it reaches a maximum at about 4 to 7 hours based on the measurement of increased urine osmolality.

Use of DDAVP tablets in patients with an established diagnosis will result in a reduction in urinary output with an accompanying increase in urine osmolality. These effects usually will allow resumption of a more normal lifestyle, with a decrease in urinary frequency and nocturia.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycemic therapies. Because of their unique glycosuric mechanism, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce weight. Perhaps more important are the osmotic diuretic and natriuretic effects contributing to plasma volume contraction and decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 6 and 1 to 2 mmHg, respectively, which may underlie cardiovascular and kidney benefits.

SGLT2 inhibition is also associated with an acute, dose-dependent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate by approximately 5 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2) and a 30% to 40% reduction in albuminuria. These effects mirror preclinical observations suggesting that proximal tubular natriuresis activates renal tubuloglomerular feedback through increased macula densa sodium and chloride delivery, leading to afferent vasoconstriction. Based on reduced glomerular filtration, glycosuric and weight loss effects are attenuated in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). In contrast, blood pressure lowering, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuric effects are preserved, and perhaps exaggerated, in chronic kidney disease.

Regarding long-term clinical outcomes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease randomly assigned to empagliflozin versus placebo reported a 14% reduction.

### Xigduoxr [^115vuKj5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with several adverse reactions.

- **Volume depletion**: Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion, including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension, for the 12-trial and 13-trial short-term, placebo-controlled pools and for the DECLARE trial are provided in Table 4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Hypoglycemia**: The frequency of hypoglycemia in adult patients by trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] is shown in Table 5. Hypoglycemia was more frequent when dapagliflozin was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In the DECLARE trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], severe events of hypoglycemia were reported in 58 (0.7%) out of 8574 adult patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg and 83 (1.0%) out of 8569 adult patients treated with placebo.

- **Genital mycotic infections**: In the glycemic control trials in adults, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin treatment. These infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on dapagliflozin 5 mg, and 4.8% on dapagliflozin 10 mg, in the 12-trial placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 3). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^114NnP5Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome resulting from the loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, which leads to impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency causes an inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI can be attributed to diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons.

This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, offering insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have enhanced the accuracy and acceptability of diagnosing the hypotonic polyuria syndrome.

- **Management of CDI**: We emphasize fluid intake management and the pharmacological replacement of AVP.
- **Specific clinical syndromes**: We explore adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus during pregnancy, as well as management strategies for perioperative patients with diabetes insipidus.

### Xigduoxr [^111GiDN8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**:

	- **Dapagliflozin**: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion. Furthermore, dapagliflozin reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart, downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure, which are believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.

	- **Metformin HCl**: Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

	- **General**: Dapagliflozin increases the amount of glucose excreted in the urine. This is observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 dia-

### Sglt2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^115mfVgK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the pituitary were conducted at the first month and six months since abortion. In the sagittal view, scans A and B showed an absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot on the T1-weighted images. The coronal view scan C showed slight pituitary hyperplasia in response to estrogen stimulation, which later resolved as seen in scan D.

As her gastrointestinal function improved, increased food intake led to a 5 kg weight gain (body weight: 80 kg) and worsening glycemic control despite higher insulin doses. Dapagliflozin (10 mg daily) was added to her regimen at a local hospital to address obesity and hyperglycemia. Shortly after initiating dapagliflozin, she developed progressive thirst and polydipsia, with a daily fluid intake of up to 10 L. Notably, her hypernatremia resolved during this period. She was readmitted to our endocrinology department for evaluation of hyperglycemia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Her HbA1c had risen to 13.6%, and random blood glucose was 36.07 mmol/L with negative urinary ketones. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was initiated to optimize glycemic control.

- **Urine analysis**: Urine specific gravity, measured every three hours, fluctuated between 1.008 and 1.018, with a total 24-hour urine output of 7.45 L. The maximum urine specific gravity exceeded 1.015, which was inconsistent with the expected low specific gravity (< 1.015) in diabetes insipidus. We hypothesized that the hypotonic polyuria characteristic of diabetes insipidus was masked by excessive urinary glucose excretion.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^1179DiTa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare complication following a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The coexistence of T2DM and CDI can lead to diagnostic challenges, particularly when the patients present with persistent hypernatremia without a sense of thirst.

- **Case presentation**: This case report describes a young woman with T2DM and HHS who developed persistent hypernatremia without thirst. The diagnosis of CDI was delayed until she exhibited polydipsia, consuming up to 10 L of water per day, following the administration of dapagliflozin for glucose control. Initially, the low specific gravity of urine was not evident during dapagliflozin treatment. However, after discontinuing dapagliflozin for 48 hours, CDI was confirmed through a water deprivation test, which revealed polyuria with low urine specific gravity and osmolality. The patient was successfully treated with oral desmopressin.

- **Conclusions**: This case highlights that SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, may accelerate polyuria and alter urine osmolality by inhibiting glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubular. Therefore, it is crucial to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors when CDI is suspected or diagnosed.

### Dapagliflozin's effects on glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes: A 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 28-week extension [^112drJca]. Diabetes Care (2015). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), documented pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD), and a history of hypertension, a study was conducted.

Patients (N = 922) were randomized to receive 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo in a double-blind trial for 24 weeks, followed by a 28-week extension period. In patients receiving insulin, the insulin dose was reduced by 25% at randomization. Patients were stratified by age, insulin use, and time from the most recent qualifying cardiovascular (CV) event. The co-primary endpoints were a change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the proportion of patients achieving a combined reduction in HbA1c of ≥ 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol), body weight (BW) of ≥ 3%, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 3 mmHg.

At 24 weeks, dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.38% [-4.2 mmol/mol]) from baseline (8.18%) compared with a slight increase with placebo from baseline (8.08%) (0.08% [0.9 mmol/mol]). Significantly more patients met the three-item endpoint with dapagliflozin treatment than with placebo (11.7% vs. 0.9%, respectively). Changes were maintained over 52 weeks. Although approximately 42% of patients were ≥ 65 years old, similar results were observed in both age-stratified groups. Serious adverse events, hypoglycemia, urinary tract infections, and cardiac disorders were similar between groups. Adverse events of hypotension, dehydration, hypovolemia, genital infection, and renal failure or impairment were also analyzed.

### Dapagliflozin: A sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in development for type 2 diabetes [^116W7rZq]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

- **Tolerability and side effects**: In T2DM patients, adverse events observed in the dapagliflozin treatment and placebo groups were similar in frequency and were generally mild in nature, whether for patients who were treatment-naïve or for those receiving ongoing metformin or insulin plus insulin sensitizer therapy. Few cases of hypoglycemia were observed, and these were generally mild, self-limiting, and occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo group; none were severe.

A mild diuretic effect of dapagliflozin was observed at week 12 in the treatment-naïve patients (an increase in urinary output of up to 470 mL/day above baseline compared with a 112 mL/day decrease in placebo). In those T2DM patients taking insulin plus oral insulin sensitizers, there was an increase in urine output of up to 444 mL/day above baseline compared with 255 mL/day with placebo, although the difference was not reported as being significant. Consistent with this observation, dapagliflozin appears to be associated with a mild reduction in mean blood pressure with no evidence of orthostatic hypotension.

The long-term effects of dapagliflozin on renal function are as yet unknown, as are the effects of dapagliflozin when used in cases of compromised renal function or when coadministered with certain antihypertensive drug classes that may affect renal physiology. However, no clinically relevant changes in glomerular filtration rate have been reported with dapagliflozin treatment. Owing to the inhibition of the cotransportation of sodium and glucose, dapagliflozin administration may result in an increase.

### Management of disorders of water metabolism in patients with pituitary tumors [^113BCdCC]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Disorders of body fluids, notably central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), are relatively uncommon as a presenting symptom of sellar and suprasellar masses, but quite common following surgical resection of such lesions. It therefore behooves clinicians treating such patients to have a good understanding of the pathophysiology, the differential diagnosis, and the management of these disorders. This review discusses some general issues concerning the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and therapy of hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar syndromes, including CDI and SIADH, and then more specifically addresses the evaluation and treatment of pre- and postoperative disorders of water metabolism in patients with pituitary adenomas.

### Dapagliflozin, a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, induces dose-dependent glucosuria in healthy subjects [^113FcSv7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin selectively inhibits renal glucose reabsorption by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2). It was developed as an insulin-independent treatment approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the drug were evaluated in single-ascending-dose (SAD; 2.5–500 mg) and multiple-ascending-dose (MAD; 2.5–100 mg daily for 14 days) studies in healthy subjects. Dapagliflozin exhibited dose-proportional plasma concentrations with a half-life of approximately 17 hours. The amount of glucosuria was also dose-dependent.

- **Glucose excretion**: Cumulative amounts of glucose excreted on day 1, relating to doses from 2.5–100 mg (MAD), ranged from 18 to 62 grams; day 14 values were comparable to day 1 values, with no apparent changes in glycemic parameters. Doses of approximately 20–50 mg provided close-to-maximal SGLT2 inhibition for at least 24 hours.

Dapagliflozin demonstrates pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and dose-dependent glucosuria that are sustained over 24 hours. This indicates that it is suitable for administration in once-daily doses and suggests that further investigation of its efficacy in T2DM patients is warranted.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists may enhance the effects of desmopressin in individuals with AVP deficiency: A case series and proposed mechanism [^114K7dTU]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a multifaceted role in maintaining sodium and water homeostasis in humans. In the brain, GLP-1 directly modulates thirst perception, leading to decreased water intake, and is thought to inhibit arginine vasopressin (AVP) production. In the gut, GLP-1 reduces sodium absorption, while in the kidney, it has a natriuretic effect and can potentially enhance renal hemodynamics.

The viability of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as a potential treatment for primary polydipsia has recently come to attention. Winzeler et al. presented evidence suggesting the potential of GLP-1 RAs as a therapeutic option for primary polydipsia. Patients with primary polydipsia administered dulaglutide, a GLP-1 RA, showed significant reductions in fluid intake and thirst perception compared to those given a placebo.

AVP deficiency (AVP-D), also known as central diabetes insipidus, is another cause of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. This condition is characterized by hypotonic polyuria (50 ml/kg body weight per 24 h) and polydipsia (> 3 L per day). Desmopressin is the primary treatment for AVP-D as it targets AVP receptor 2, improving excessive urination and thirst.

In this report, we present three patients diagnosed with AVP-D who required a reduction in their desmopressin dosage following the initiation of GLP-1 RA. We propose a hypothesis to explain why desmopressin's antidiuretic effect may be increased when combined with GLP-1 RA.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on hospitalisations in people with type 2 diabetes: post-hoc analyses of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial [^111NVGcy]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

The DECLARE-TIMI 58 study, a post-hoc analysis, was published in 2023 in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology. This study focuses on diabetes mellitus type 2.

- **Study question**: What is the effect of dapagliflozin on hospitalizations in adults with T2DM? - **Study design**: The trial was multi-center, double-blinded, and an RCT.

- **Population**: The study involved 17,160 patients, comprising 6,422 females and 10,738 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients aged ≥ 40 years with T2DM and either risk factors for, or established ASCVD.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Diagnosis of T1DM, chronic cystitis, recurrent urinary tract infections, and pregnancy.

- **Interventions**: 8,582 participants received dapagliflozin at an oral dose of 10 mg once daily, while 8,578 received a matching placebo once daily.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the first non-elective hospitalization for any cause (32.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 35.4% with placebo; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.94).

- **Conclusion**: In adults aged ≥ 40 years with T2DM and either risk factors for, or established ASCVD, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo concerning the first non-elective hospitalization for any cause.

- **Indications and usage**: DDAVP tablets are indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central diabetes insipidus and for the management of temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region. DDAVP is ineffective for the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Patients were selected for therapy based on the diagnosis by means of the water deprivation test, the hypertonic saline infusion test, and/or response to antidiuretic hormone. Continued response to DDAVP can be monitored by measuring urine volume and osmolality.

DDAVP tablets are also indicated for the management of primary nocturnal enuresis. DDAVP may be used alone or as an adjunct to behavioral conditioning or other non-pharmacologic interventions.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^113nPcfZ]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, particularly in patients with central diabetes insipidus, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend administering IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg to patients with known central diabetes insipidus who have excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output. Thorough observation of the clinical and biochemical response is crucial. Consider administering additional doses of desmopressin when higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine are produced again. This is to prevent the overly rapid correction of hypernatremia that can result from a combination of high fluid loads and the obligate antidiuresis caused by exogenous desmopressin.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Effect of exenatide twice daily and dapagliflozin, alone and in combination, on markers of kidney function in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: A prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113KdJaJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- This study represents a prespecified secondary analysis of the DECREASE (Dapagliflozin Plus Exenatide on Central Regulation of Appetite in Diabetes Type 2) study. It was a 16-week, single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, primarily designed to assess the separate and combined effects of dapagliflozin and exenatide on activity in central reward and satiety circuits in response to food-related stimuli. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Amsterdam, the Netherlands (METc number 2017.307). It was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03361098) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided informed consent before any study-specific procedure commenced.

- **Study population**:

	- Participants with type 2 diabetes, aged between 18 and 75 years with a body mass index between 27 and 40 kg/m², were recruited. They were using stable doses of metformin and/or sulfonylurea derivatives for at least three months. HbA1c levels for participants treated with metformin monotherapy ranged from 53 to 86 mmol/mol (7%-10%), while for those on metformin plus sulfonylurea, levels were from 58 to 86 mmol/mol (7.5%-10%). Exclusion criteria included an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², a history of serious cardiovascular, renal or liver disease, malignancies (excluding basal cell carcinoma), and uncontrolled thyroid disease.

### Vasopressin-v2 receptor stimulation reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans [^113oX5Mn]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

In addition to its effect on water permeability, vasopressin, through its V2 receptors (AVPR2), stimulates Na reabsorption in the collecting duct by increasing the activity of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel ENaC. This study evaluated whether dDAVP (a potent AVPR2 agonist) reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans (n = 6) and in patients with central (C; n = 2) or nephrogenic (N) diabetes insipidus (DI) as a result of mutations of either the aquaporin 2 gene (AQP2; n = 3) or AVPR2 (n = 10). dDAVP was infused intravenously (0.3 microg/kg body wt in 20 min), and urine was collected for 60 min before (basal) and 150 min after the infusion. dDAVP markedly reduced both urine flow rate and sodium excretion in healthy individuals. A reduction in sodium excretion was also observed in CDI and NDI-AQP2 patients but not in NDI-AVPR2 patients. The magnitude of the fall in sodium excretion correlated with the rise in urine osmolality and the fall in urine output but not with the simultaneously observed fall in mean BP. These results suggest that the dDAVP-induced antinatriuresis is due to a direct V2 receptor-dependent stimulation of sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and is not secondary to a hemodynamic effect. In conclusion, this study reveals a potent V2-dependent antinatriuretic effect of vasopressin in humans. The possibility that an inappropriate stimulation of ENaC by vasopressin might lead to significant sodium retention in chronic situations remains to be determined.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^1144SpiN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly affects the lungs but can involve several other organs. The diagnosis of acute and chronic sequelae is one of the challenges of COVID-19. The literature proposes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In this case report, we present a unique case of new-onset central diabetes insipidus secondary to the COVID-19 disease in a 54-year-old woman.

- **Case presentation**: A 54-year-old woman presented with a history of excessive thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia six weeks after being infected by COVID-19. Laboratory tests revealed low urine osmolarity and increased serum osmolarity, and the patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. After the administration of nasal desmopressin, urinary osmolarity increased, and the patient's symptoms improved. However, to stabilize her condition, desmopressin treatment was required.

- **Conclusions**: We reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a COVID-19 patient. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of COVID-19, in the case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, a causal relationship has not been established between the symptoms of the patient and the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Synjardy [^1126M7YC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The data are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and an 18-week placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

These data reflect the exposure of 1,976 adult patients to empagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo (N = 995), empagliflozin 10 mg (N = 999), or empagliflozin 25 mg (N = 977) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years, and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half (55%) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8%.

Established microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (7%), retinopathy (8%), and neuropathy (16%). Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients, with a mean eGFR of 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m².

Table 2 shows adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) that were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly in empagliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients, and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of empagliflozin-treated patients. Thirst (including polydipsia) was reported in 0%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively.

### Antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is associated with upregulation of aquaporin-2, Na-Cl co-transporter, and epithelial sodium channel [^116gj9Nd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Thiazides have been used in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) to decrease urine volume, but the mechanism by which it produces the paradoxical antidiuretic effect remains unclear. Previous studies have reported that downregulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is important for the development of lithium-induced (Li-induced) polyuria and that hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) increases renal papillary osmolality and Na(+) concentration in Brattleboro rats.

To elucidate the molecular basis of the antidiuretic action of HCTZ in diabetes insipidus, the effect of HCTZ on the expression of AQP2 and major renal Na(+) transporters in Li-induced NDI rats was investigated using semiquantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. After feeding male Sprague-Dawley rats a Li chloride-containing diet for four weeks, HCTZ or a vehicle was infused subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump. Urine output was significantly decreased by HCTZ treatment, whereas no change was observed in vehicle-treated rats. Urine osmolality was also higher in HCTZ-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats.

Semiquantitative immunoblotting using whole-kidney homogenates revealed that HCTZ treatment caused a significant partial recovery in AQP2 abundance from Li-induced downregulation. AQP2 immunohistochemistry showed findings compatible with the immunoblot results in both the cortex and medulla. The abundances of thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter and alpha-epithelial sodium channel were increased by HCTZ treatment. Notably, HCTZ treatment induced a shift in the molecular weight of the gamma-epithelial sodium channel.

### Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin used in conjunction with sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized, controlled trial [^113pYXN9]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

The observed additive glycemic effects of canagliflozin on top of sulfonylurea are anticipated based on its complementary mechanism of action. While the efficacy of sulfonylurea depends on adequate pancreatic insulin-secretory capacity, this is not the case with SGLT2 inhibitors. For this reason, it is hypothesized that canagliflozin will be an effective treatment choice at most stages of the disease and in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies. The 300-mg dose of canagliflozin was associated with numerically greater effects on several parameters compared with the 100-mg dose, including a modest increase in the percentage of patients achieving a target HbA1c < 7.0% (placebo-subtracted differences of 28.3% vs. 20.0%, respectively).

We and others have previously reported that the additional efficacy effects of the 300-mg over the 100-mg dose were achieved at the expense of an increased risk of drug-related adverse events (AEs). By contrast, likely due to the much smaller study numbers, osmotic diuresis-related AEs (e.g. polyuria, pollakiuria, thirst) and volume-related AEs (e.g. postural dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, syncope, presyncope) were similar in all treatment groups, with no difference between the two canagliflozin doses. We should not conclude that the combination of canagliflozin with a sulfonylurea provides a protective effect against these side effects. Identifying patients potentially susceptible to AEs will be an important component of a patient-centered approach to diabetes management.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^11292txb]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI, resulting from a deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary gland. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI), or AVP-resistance, develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited or familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described.

Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP-independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs, and, in some cases, administration of diuretics.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^116DgybL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities must be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus, resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus; nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys; gestational diabetes insipidus, resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase; and finally, primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action.

Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies are necessary to detect the etiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central diabetes insipidus, close follow-up is needed since central diabetes insipidus can be the first sign of an underlying pathology.

Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying etiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and the newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^111SE5FU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, the distinction between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia is not quite so straightforward because of the considerable overlap in baseline copeptin levels. In particular, distinguishing partial central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia is very challenging. Two new copeptin-based test procedures with high diagnostic accuracy have been proposed to overcome these difficulties: the hypertonic saline stimulation test and the arginine stimulation test.

Using osmotically stimulated copeptin levels as a diagnostic measure for diabetes insipidus was first described by our group in a study involving 55 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. Here, the cut-off value for copeptin of 4.9 mmol/L, measured following a rise in plasma sodium levels above 147 mmol/L, showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. We have recently validated this derived copeptin cut-off level in an international multicenter study including 156 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. For this study, plasma sodium levels were increased up to 150 mmol/L by an infusion of 3% hypertonic saline adjusted for body weight. The diagnostic value of the osmotically stimulated copeptin level was confirmed, with a threshold of 4.9 pmol/L showing a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus. The diagnostic accuracy was only slightly lower at 95% when comparing partial central diabetes insipidus with primary polydipsia. In addition, the test proved to be safe and well tolerated.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: How to define and grade this complication [^1176fvrs]. Pituitary (2021). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by the inability to sufficiently concentrate urine due to impaired vasopressin release. It can be caused by injury to the posterior pituitary gland, pituitary stalk, or hypothalamus. DI leads to extreme thirst, most typically for cold water, to compensate for fluid loss. When fluid loss exceeds the patient's ability to drink, dehydration and hypernatremia may occur.

Adipsic DI can occur in patients with an impaired sense of thirst. It is extremely rare, most likely caused by hypothalamic damage, and can occur after extensive surgery in the hypothalamic region. This is more often seen in patients with large craniopharyngiomas and giant adenomas. These patients do not feel an urge to compensate for fluid loss by drinking water; hence, adipsic DI renders the patient at risk of hypernatremia and severe dehydration.

Postoperative DI may be transient or permanent. Transient DI typically occurs within 24–48 hours after surgery and resolves in the subsequent days. It is most likely caused by mild and reversible injury to the pituitary stalk or posterior pituitary lobe. Permanent DI occurs when the hypothalamus and/or pituitary stalk are irreversibly injured.

Postoperative DI can occur in combination with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH occurs as injured neurons of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract degenerate and release all stored vasopressin, typically manifesting 5–8 days postoperatively as it takes time for neurons to fully degenerate.

### Anti-PD-L1 treatment induced central diabetes insipidus [^1137wEzs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1), and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies, have been widely used in cancer treatment. They are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which resemble autoimmune diseases. Anterior pituitary hypophysitis with secondary hypopituitarism is a frequently reported irAE, especially in patients receiving anti-CTLA4 treatment. In contrast, posterior pituitary involvement, such as central diabetes insipidus (DI), is relatively rare and is unreported in patients undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.

- **Case description**: We describe a case of a 73-year-old man with Merkel cell carcinoma who received the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody avelumab and achieved partial response. The patient developed nocturia, polydipsia, and polyuria 3 months after starting avelumab. Further laboratory testing revealed central DI. Avelumab was held and he received desmopressin for the management of central DI. Within 6 weeks after discontinuation of avelumab, the patient's symptoms resolved and he was eventually taken off desmopressin. The patient remained off avelumab and there were no signs or symptoms of DI 2 months after the discontinuation of desmopressin.

- **Conclusion**: To our knowledge, this is the first report of central DI associated with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. The patient's endocrinopathy was successfully managed by holding treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and management of such rare irAEs in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes: Pooled 52-week outcomes from the DEPICT-1 and -2 studies [^111URVxq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Safety assessments**: Safety assessments, including adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), were monitored throughout the long-term study period, up to the week 56 follow-up visit. These assessments are reported for the pooled population as well as for the subgroups. AEs of special interest, including hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genital infections, urinary tract infections, fractures, and cardiovascular AEs, were also recorded.

- **Details of hypoglycemia and DKA assessment**: Hypoglycemic events were defined according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification criteria. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event resulting in unconsciousness caused by hypoglycemia or an event requiring the assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or to take other corrective actions to promote neurological recovery.

- **DKA identification and adjudication**: Patients were advised on identifying potential DKA events and were provided with blood ketone meters, along with instructions for their use to record ketone levels. Potential DKA events were identified based on investigator review of home ketone meter readings, review of symptoms and diagnoses, and queries according to predefined terms in the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. An independent DKA Adjudication Committee adjudicated all reported DKA events. Criteria for definite DKA included acidosis diagnosed by low blood pH (< 7.3) and/or decreased serum bicarbonate levels (≤ 18 mEq/L). Symptoms and signs listed in the ADA consensus statement on the diagnosis of DKA were also assessed.

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^111yLAAm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Daily renal K+ excretion was greater during combined therapy than during dapagliflozin alone. Accordingly, serum potassium was reduced more when dapagliflozin was administered with bumetanide. Hypokalemia with loop diuretics has been attributed variously to flow-mediated K+ secretion in the distal nephron or to the effects of K+ arginine vasopressin or hyperaldosteronism. The greater K+ excretion and hypokalemia with combined therapy may be a consequence of hyperaldosteronism because there were high levels of PRA. Serum potassium should be monitored during combined therapy.

Dapagliflozin enhanced urate excretion and urate clearance and reduced serum urate substantially, whereas bumetanide alone reduced urate clearance. An enhanced proximal urate reabsorption with loop diuretics has been ascribed to volume depletion. Moreover, both uric acid and loop diuretics are substrates for the apical proximal tubule human sodium phosphate transporter 4 (SLC17A3) and the proximal multidrug resistance protein 4. Thus, loop diuretics might compete for the renal secretion of uric acid. Glucose reabsorption enhances urate reabsorption via the sugar-related human uric acid transporter/channel. Thus, an increase in proximal tubule fluid glucose delivery with dapagliflozin may decrease proximal tubular urate transport and thereby increase urate clearance.

There was no apparently significant pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin and bumetanide. There was a relatively high frequency of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness that may have been related to the administration.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic diabetes insipidus [^113n9FyC]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disease characterized by the excretion of excessive volumes of dilute urine due to reduced levels of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) caused by an acquired or genetic defect in the neurohypophysis. The aim of this study was to identify any autonomic dysfunction (AD) in patients with DI as a possible cofactor responsible for their reportedly higher mortality.

- **Methods**: The study involved 12 patients (6 females) with central idiopathic DI and a well-controlled electrolyte balance, and 12 controls matched for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. They were assessed using the tilt, lying-to-standing, hand grip, deep breath, Valsalva maneuver, and Stroop tests.

- **Results**: The tilt test showed a significantly more pronounced decrease in both systolic (-20.67 ± 18 vs. -1.92 ± 6.99 mmHg, p = 0.0009) and diastolic blood pressure (-10.5 ± 14.29 vs. -1.5 ± 5 mmHg, p = 0.012) in patients than in controls. Three patients with DI had to suspend the test due to the onset of syncope. The lying-to-standing test also revealed a marked reduction in blood pressure in patients with DI (1.05 ± 0.13 vs. 1.53 ± 0.14, p = 0.0001). Similar results emerged for the Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva ratio, 1.24 ± 0.19 vs. 1.79 ± 0.11, p < 0.0001) and deep breath test (1.08 ± 0.11 vs. 1.33 ± 0.08, p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: All the principal autonomic tests performed in the study were concordant in indicating that patients with central DI have an impaired autonomic nervous system function despite a normal hydroelectrolytic balance under desmopressin therapy.

### Ddavp [^1117RqgN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Infrequently, large doses of the intranasal formulations of DDAVP and DDAVP Injection have produced transient headache, nausea, flushing, and mild abdominal cramps. These symptoms have disappeared with a reduction in dosage.

- **Central diabetes insipidus**: In long-term clinical studies in which patients with diabetes insipidus were followed for periods of up to 44 months of DDAVP Tablet therapy, transient increases in AST (SGOT) no higher than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were occasionally observed. Elevated AST (SGOT) returned to the normal range despite continued use of DDAVP Tablets.

- **Primary nocturnal enuresis**: The only adverse event occurring in ≥ 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials with DDAVP Tablets that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to the study drug was a headache (4% DDAVP, 3% placebo).

- **Other**: The following adverse events have been reported; however, their relationship to DDAVP has not been established: abnormal thinking, diarrhea, and edema-weight gain. See WARNINGS for the possibility of water intoxication and hyponatremia.

Post-marketing: There have been rare reports of hyponatremic convulsions associated with the concomitant use of the following medications: oxybutinin and imipramine.

### Opioid-induced hyponatremia in a patient with central diabetes insipidus: Independence from ADH [^113UxTmH]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia can be a complication of opioid therapy, which has been postulated to occur secondary to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [SIADH]). We report severe hyponatremia following wisdom teeth extraction with opioid analgesia in a 19-year-old female with diabetes insipidus (DI) and acquired panhypopituitarism, challenging this theory. As this patient has DI, we believe opioid treatment caused severe hyponatremia by the following mechanisms:

- **Direct antidiuretic effect**: Opioids have a direct antidiuretic effect independent of changes in ADH, as demonstrated in Brattleboro rats with central DI.
- **Stimulation of thirst center**: Hydrocodone may have stimulated this patient's thirst center contributing to hyponatremia, as demonstrated in animal studies.

Opioid use can cause hyponatremia in patients independent of ADH. It is important for clinicians to be aware of this so that patients can be appropriately counseled.

### Central diabetes insipidus secondary to COVID-19 infection: a case report [^112J4CfW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In specific regions of the brain, particularly in periventricular areas, the blood-brain barrier is adjusted to allow the required compounds in the systemic circulation to enter the central nervous system. In such areas, the blood-brain barrier vessels exhibit fewer tight junctions, resulting in a more permeable barrier. Our patient revealed chronic small vessel infarction in the periventricular region, which may be a potential cause of SARS-CoV-2 accessing the hypothalamus. However, due to the limitations of our case study, we could not prove the underlying mechanism. Unknown etiologies also cannot be ruled out.

A previously published case report described a 44-year-old female diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and central diabetes insipidus 24 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. Another case reported by the same author involved a 28-year-old male who developed diabetes insipidus and myocarditis after COVID-19 recovery. Another case report described polydipsia and polyuria in a critically ill 68-year-old patient with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed central diabetes insipidus about one month after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The brain MRI of these patients showed no abnormal findings. However, Misgar et al. reported evidence of infundibuloneurohypophysitis in the brain MRI of a 60-year-old woman. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, the patient developed central diabetes insipidus. Notably, all patients developed diabetes insipidus as a late sequel to COVID-19. Nevertheless, the role of viral infection was considered significant.

Regarding medical management for arginine vasopressin deficiency, particularly in fluid therapy, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend prioritizing the optimization of fluid replacement. This should be followed by assessing the need for desmopressin administration in significantly unwell patients with intercurrent illness or decompensated central diabetes insipidus.

### Neuroimaging of central diabetes insipidus: When, how, and findings [^111BuKLA]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (CDI) results from deficient synthesis or secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin peptide (AVP). It is clinically characterized by polydipsia and polyuria, with urine output exceeding 30 mL/kg/day of dilute urine measuring less than 250 mOsm/L. CDI occurs due to a defect in one or more sites involving the hypothalamic osmoreceptors; supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus; median eminence of the hypothalamus; infundibulum; or the posterior pituitary gland. A focused MRI of the pituitary gland or sella protocol is essential.

Several neuroimaging correlates and causes of CDI are illustrated in this review. The most common causes include:

- **Benign or malignant neoplasms (25%)**: Involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
- **Surgery (20%)**
- **Head trauma (16%)**
- **Familial causes (10%)**

No cause is identified in up to 30% of cases. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal axis is crucial when evaluating a patient with CDI. Establishing the etiology of CDI with MRI, in combination with clinical and biochemical assessments, facilitates appropriate targeted treatment. The aim of this pictorial review is to illustrate the wide variety of causes of CDI on neuroimaging, highlight the optimal MRI protocol, and revise the detailed neuroanatomy and neurophysiology required to interpret these studies.

### Dapagliflozin (SGLT2-i) induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^114z2CxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) have become a popular therapeutic strategy in the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary site of action of SGLT2-i is at the proximal renal convoluted tubule. They work by blocking SGLT2 receptors, sodium-dependent glucose co-transport molecules, which in turn prevents glucose reabsorption, facilitating glucosuria, improving glycemic control, as well as a moderate degree of weight loss.

We report the case of a 51-year-old woman admitted to the acute medical unit with abdominal pain and vomiting, who was diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to recent initiation of an SGLT2-i medication (dapagliflozin). Clinicians should be aware of this rare side effect of SGLT2-i to circumvent delays in patient management.

### Pemetrexed-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^111nVMjX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Pemetrexed is an approved antimetabolite agent, now widely used for treating locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. Although no electrolyte abnormalities are described in the prescribing information for this drug, several case reports have noted nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with associated acute kidney injury. We present a case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus without severely reduced kidney function and propose a mechanism for the isolated finding. Severe hypernatremia can lead to encephalopathy and osmotic demyelination, and our report highlights the importance of careful monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function in patients with lung cancer receiving pemetrexed.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^117T8Yan]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

- **The role of copeptin in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus**: Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome is a common problem in clinical practice, with the main entities being central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.

While central diabetes insipidus is characterized by a complete (complete central diabetes insipidus) or partial (partial central diabetes insipidus) insufficient vasopressin (AVP) secretion from the pituitary, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from an AVP resistance of the kidneys, both leading to hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia. Central diabetes insipidus can result from various conditions affecting the hypothalamic‐neurohypophyseal system, such as trauma resulting from surgery or accident, local tumors or metastases, and inflammatory/autoimmune or granulomatous diseases. Several reports also describe genetic defects in AVP synthesis leading to inherited forms of central diabetes insipidus. The most challenging form of central diabetes insipidus involves an impairment of thirst perception and consecutive hypodipsia, which can result in severe hypernatremia.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from a lack of aquaporin 2 (AQP2)‐mediated water reabsorption in the collecting duct. This is either a consequence of gene mutations in key proteins like the vasopressin V2 receptor or AQP2, is secondarily triggered by electrolyte disorders, or is induced by certain drugs, especially lithium.

### Dapagliflozin: a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in development for type 2 diabetes [^117Vu9UY]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing worldwide epidemic. Patients face lifelong therapy to control hyperglycemia and prevent the associated complications. There are many medications, with varying mechanisms, available for the treatment of T2DM; however, almost all target the declining insulin sensitivity and secretion that are associated with disease progression. Medications with such insulin-dependent mechanisms of action often lose efficacy over time, leading to increasing interest in the development of new antidiabetes medications that are not dependent upon insulin.

One such approach is through the inhibition of renal glucose reuptake. Dapagliflozin, the first of a class of selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, reduces renal glucose reabsorption and is currently under development for the treatment of T2DM. Here, we review the literature relating to the preclinical and clinical development of dapagliflozin.

### The management of central diabetes insipidus in infancy: Desmopressin, low renal solute load formula, thiazide diuretics [^116rkRr8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Infants consume most of their calories as formula. Because of this large fluid intake, infants normally produce dilute urine, similar to individuals with diabetes insipidus (DI). Infants with DI are therefore prone to water intoxication if fixed antidiuresis is achieved using the long-acting vasopressin analog desmopressin (DDAVP), which induces a state of high urine concentration. DI treatment approaches applied to older children and adults, who consume their calories as solids, are difficult to apply to infants with DI. When used in infants, oral and intranasal DDAVP can be associated with broad swings in serum sodium concentration (SNA). In comparison, precisely administered subcutaneous doses of DDAVP can be successfully used in infants with DI and appear to be superior to oral or intranasal DDAVP therapy.

Alternatively, consistent eunatremia can be achieved in infantile DI using low renal solute load (RSL) formula and thiazide diuretics. Low RSL formula reduces obligatory urinary water losses, and thiazide diuretics concentrate the urine to levels seen in normal formula-fed infants. This report addresses treatment options for DI in infancy and the delicate management issues involved.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, the Society for Endocrinology 2018 guidelines recommend correcting serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve). This correction should be limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in symptomatic patients with hypernatremia that developed within 48 hours (acute hypernatremia).

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on the association of SGLT-2 inhibitors and diabetic ketoacidosis [^113Tp7ND]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This is particularly relevant for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Their findings indicate a potential association between the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and the onset of DKA.

The position statement outlines several key points:

- **Understanding SGLT-2 inhibitors**: These medications function by preventing the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, promoting its excretion, which can help manage blood glucose levels.

- **Potential risks**: There is a concern regarding an increased risk of DKA in individuals using SGLT-2 inhibitors, with cases reported in both T1D and T2D patients. Instances of severe and life-threatening DKA have highlighted the need for careful monitoring.

- **Regulatory evaluations**: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have both acknowledged these risks. Both bodies are evaluating the safety profiles of these drugs to ensure patient safety.

The AACE and ACE recommend that clinicians remain vigilant in monitoring patients who are on SGLT-2 inhibitors, particularly for signs and symptoms of DKA.

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^114fy2vr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The modest natriuresis with dapagliflozin in euglycemic subjects is consistent with prior studies in normal subjects. However, dapagliflozin increased glycosuria significantly, suggesting enhanced delivery of fluid and Na+ out of the proximal tubule that should have increased reabsorption in the loop of Henle by the Na+/K+/2Cl transporter, which is load dependent. Any increased Na+ delivery from the proximal tubule was likely modest because natriuresis with the first dose of dapagliflozin was not enhanced by blockade of Na+/K+/2Cl with bumetanide. Similarly, blockade of Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule by acetazolamide caused only a minor first-dose additive increase in Na+ excretion with furosemide. We conclude that there is no significant additive natriuresis with dapagliflozin and bumetanide on first administration. However, there is an adaptive natriuresis over one week that is reminiscent of the synergy between loop and thiazide diuretics in subjects adapted to loop diuretics. Interestingly, despite rather modest natriuresis, administration of dapagliflozin to patients with T2DM reduced the blood volume, whereas treatment with a thiazide was not effective. It is possible that the relatively better volume-depleting effects of dapagliflozin were attributable to volume loss without an increase in renin.

### Clinical review: Treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus [^116inXMr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, there have been several improvements in the treatment of neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (DI). These improvements include new formulations of the vasopressin analog, desmopressin; a better understanding of the effect of fluid intake on dosing; and more information about treatments for infants, children, and pregnant women who present special challenges. This review aims to summarize past and current information relative to the safety and efficacy of treatments for types of DI caused by a primary deficiency of vasopressin.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The review is based on publications identified primarily by a PubMed search of the international literature without limitations of date.

- **Evidence synthesis**: In acute settings where fluid intake is determined by factors other than thirst, desmopressin should be given intravenously in doses that have a short duration of action and can be adjusted quickly in accordance with changes in hydration as indicated by plasma sodium. In ambulatory patients, the oral formulations (tablet or melt) are preferred for their convenience. If fluid intake is regulated normally by the thirst mechanism, the tablets or melt can be taken safely 1 to 3 times a day in doses sufficient to completely eliminate polyuria. However, if fluid intake consistently exceeds replacement needs as evidenced by the development of hyponatremia, the dose should be reduced to allow higher than normal rates of urine output or intermittent breakthrough diuresis. This regimen is often indicated in infants or children because their rate of fluid intake tends to be greater.

### Effects of salt and protein intake on polyuria in V2RA-treated ADPKD patients [^116YaMvG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

In subjects with debilitating polyuria due to central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), it is general practice to lower osmolar intake to decrease urinary volume. The mechanism by which a V2 receptor antagonist (V2RA) causes polyuria is very similar to the pathophysiology of NDI. In NDI, the collecting duct is relatively impermeable to water due to insensitivity to vasopressin, caused either by defects in the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) or defects downstream. V2RAs cause a similar effect by competitively binding to the V2R, inhibiting vasopressin.

V2RA use is so similar to NDI that in animal experiments, treatment with tolvaptan is used to simulate NDI. Because of these similarities in pathophysiology between NDI and a V2RA, we hypothesized that the influence of osmotic load on urinary volume was equal to that of NDI. In a study including patients with complete nephrogenic or central diabetes insipidus, a decrease in osmolar intake of −724.6 mOsm/24-h caused a decrease in urine volume of −3.7 L/24-h. In our study, a decrease in osmolar excretion of −344 mOsm/24-h decreases urine volume by −0.7 L/24-h; thus, the effect is 2 to 3 times less.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin versus insulin glargine over 52 weeks as add-on to metformin with or without sulphonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes: A randomized, parallel-design, open-label, Phase 3 trial [^116tNFjg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. It was approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees. All participants gave informed consent for both the short‐ and long‐term study periods before inclusion.

Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with T2D and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 8% to ≤ 12%), who were receiving stable metformin therapy (≥ 1500 mg/day) with or without sulphonylurea (≥ 50% of the maximal dose) for at least 8 weeks before screening, were eligible. Participants had body mass index (BMI) ≤ 45.0 kg/m² at screening and baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 270 mg/dL. Major exclusion criteria included type 1 diabetes, maturity‐onset diabetes of the young, secondary diabetes, or diabetes insipidus, and a history of diabetic ketoacidosis or renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women). Participants were randomized 1:1 using an interactive voice response system, stratified by sulphonylurea use with background metformin treatment, to receive either DAPA + SAXA or INS for 24 weeks, with a long‐term extension.

### Approach to the pediatric patient: Central diabetes insipidus [^116nDspL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder characterized by the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency. This condition is caused by various disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis of CDI is challenging and requires a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, biochemical analysis, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Although pituitary stalk size at presentation might be normal, it can change over time depending on the underlying condition. Other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent central nervous system damage, germ cell tumor dissemination, and complications from multiple pituitary hormone defects.

We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI, highlighting potential pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. Close and careful follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may become evident over time. The clinical scenario outlined at the beginning of this article forms the basis for discussing how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked. It demonstrates how improvements in water intake and urine output can indicate disease progression.

### Effect of short-term use of dapagliflozin on impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes [^111c8rj9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Participants first attended a screening visit that included a medical history assessment and a standard physical examination (including body weight, height, blood pressure, pulse rate, and screening for peripheral neuropathy). Blood samples were collected to determine HbA1c and serum creatinine levels.

After inclusion, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with dapagliflozin or a matching placebo for 8 weeks in a cross-over manner, with a 2-week washout period between treatments. The investigator enrolled participants and assigned them to dapagliflozin or placebo treatments according to a randomization list managed by the pharmacy department of our hospital to ensure the double-blind study design. Randomization was executed via a computer program using blocks of two subjects to ensure equal numbers of participants started treatment with either dapagliflozin or placebo.

Before starting the study medication, patients received ketone meters and were educated about identifying potential symptoms of normoglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, such as nausea and vomiting. Patients were instructed to contact the study site if they suspected symptoms of ketoacidosis, particularly if self-measured blood ketone readings were ≥ 1.5 mmol/L, regardless of blood glucose levels. Dapagliflozin and placebo capsules were administered at a dosage of 10 mg once daily. After initiating the study medication, patients were advised to reduce prandial insulin levels by 10% to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia. Participants were also asked to perform a four-point daily blood glucose profile.

### Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving high doses of insulin: A randomized trial [^116UXkcX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, may improve glycemic control with a lower dose of insulin and attenuate the associated weight gain in patients with inadequate control despite high doses of insulin.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding dapagliflozin therapy in patients whose type 2 diabetes mellitus is inadequately controlled with insulin, with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Design**: A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial followed by a 24-week extension period. An additional 56-week extension period is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00673231).

- **Setting**: 126 centers in Europe and North America from 30 April 2008 to 19 November 2009.

- **Patients**: 808 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving at least 30 U of insulin daily, with or without up to two oral antidiabetic drugs.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and allocated with a computer-generated scheme to receive placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of dapagliflozin, once daily, for 48 weeks.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, insulin dose, and fasting plasma glucose level at 24 weeks and during the 24-week extension period. Adverse events were evaluated throughout both 24-week periods.

- **Results**: 800 patients were analyzed. After 24 weeks, mean hemoglobin A(1c) decreased by 0.79% to 0.96% with dapagliflozin compared with 0.39% with placebo.

### Effect of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114F5Lfo]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

Correction of hyperglycaemia and prevention of glucotoxicity are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces renal glucose reabsorption in an insulin-independent manner. We assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial, 546 adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving daily metformin (≥ 1500 mg per day) and had inadequate glycaemic control were randomly assigned to receive one of three doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, n = 137; 5 mg, n = 137; or 10 mg, n = 135) or placebo (n = 137) orally once daily. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by site, implemented with a central, telephone-based interactive voice response system. Patients continued to receive their pre-study metformin dosing. The primary outcome was change from baseline in haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) at 24 weeks. All randomised patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and who had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement (last observation carried forward) were included in the analysis. Data were analysed by use of ANCOVA models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00528879.

- **Findings**: 534 patients were included in analysis of the primary endpoint (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, n = 135; dapagliflozin 5 mg, n = 133; dapagliflozin 10 mg, n = 132; placebo, n = 134). At week 24, mean HbA(1c).
