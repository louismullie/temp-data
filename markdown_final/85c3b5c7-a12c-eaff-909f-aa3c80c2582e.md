## Question

Heartache

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "heartache". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the term itself because "heartache" can mean literal cardiac pain, metaphorical emotional pain, or a specific syndrome like Takotsubo. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that connect emotion to the heart. Next, I will review clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria, including how to distinguish Takotsubo from acute coronary syndrome. After that, I should consider risk factors, triggers, and vulnerable populations. Finally, I will outline evidence-informed management, prognosis, and prevention, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these threads together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the term so I don't conflate meanings. "Heartache" in common usage can denote emotional grief or sorrow, but in clinical contexts it may refer to chest pain or discomfort, and in cardiology it is sometimes used colloquially for stress cardiomyopathy, i.e. Takotsubo syndrome, which mimics myocardial infarction but lacks obstructive coronary disease and is linked to acute emotional or physical stressors, so I need to keep all three senses in view and specify which I mean as I proceed [^6bafc46b] [^be637324].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, starting with the brain–heart axis. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: acute psychological stress activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, increasing catecholamines and causing direct myocardial toxicity, coronary vasospasm, and autonomic dysregulation; this mechanistic framework is well supported and helps explain both negative and positive emotional triggers of Takotsubo and the broader link between stress and cardiovascular events [^be637324] [^6bafc46b] [^fa538252].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reversibility. I initially thought Takotsubo was uniformly transient, but I should double-check longitudinal data. Recent high-quality evidence shows that a single stress insult can produce long-term metabolic reprogramming and structural remodeling with persistent functional deficits in animal models, and clinical cohorts demonstrate ongoing symptoms and measurable cardiac abnormalities months after the acute episode, so I need to correct the assumption of universal full recovery and emphasize surveillance and secondary prevention [^8761d7ea] [^d1e6ce08].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach. Let me think about mimics: Takotsubo typically presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and sometimes syncope, with ECG changes and troponin elevation, but coronary angiography shows no obstructive disease; echocardiography reveals characteristic apical ballooning, though variants exist, and cardiac MRI can help confirm the diagnosis and exclude myocarditis or infarction, so I need to ensure we do not anchor on ischemia without imaging correlation [^6bafc46b] [^3af72318].

> I need to check who is most vulnerable and why. Women are disproportionately affected, with female predominance around 80–90% in many series, and postmenopausal status is common, suggesting hormonal modulation of the stress response; additionally, individuals with anxiety or depression, those exposed to chronic psychosocial stressors, and patients with neurologic injury such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or ischemic stroke are at higher risk, reinforcing the brain–heart vulnerability model [^6bafc46b] [^9e84501d] [^be637324].

> Let me consider triggers carefully, and I should confirm both poles of the emotional spectrum. Negative stressors like grief, anger, or fear are classic, but positive emotional events can also precipitate Takotsubo ("happy heart syndrome"), and physical stressors such as surgery, trauma, or critical illness are well recognized; noise-related stress and even birthday-associated excitement have been implicated, so I need to ask about both negative and positive life events and contextual stressors during history taking [^eb87f3f6] [^b2322384] [^6bafc46b].

> Now, I should review management principles and verify what is evidence-based versus expert consensus. Acute care mirrors ACS protocols with supportive therapy, hemodynamic stabilization, and treatment of complications; beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are commonly used, though randomized trial data are limited, and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure is reasonable if LV dysfunction persists; importantly, I need to ensure we address the emotional trigger and coordinate mental health support, as stress management and treatment of anxiety or depression are integral to recovery and recurrence prevention [^6bafc46b] [^3af72318] [^be637324].

> I should confirm prognosis and follow-up. In-hospital complications can be substantial, with arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and even death, and long-term outcomes are not benign; recurrence rates approximate 5–10% at 1–5 years, and persistent symptoms or subtle LV dysfunction may persist, so I need to arrange structured follow-up with echocardiography, consider cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, and maintain vigilance for recurrent episodes triggered by stress [^6bafc46b] [^d1e6ce08].

> But wait, what if the "heartache" is purely metaphorical emotional pain rather than a cardiac syndrome? I should address that explicitly. Emotional grief and chronic stress are associated with increased cardiovascular risk through autonomic, inflammatory, and behavioral pathways, and patients may somatically experience chest discomfort during intense emotions; distinguishing functional or psychogenic chest pain from ischemia requires careful history, ECG, and biomarkers, and when cardiac disease is excluded, compassionate care for grief, anxiety, or depression remains essential [^be637324] [^a57daec7].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. Heartache, in the cardiac sense, reflects a mind–body phenomenon wherein acute emotional or physical stressors activate neurohormonal pathways that transiently injure the myocardium, producing a clinical syndrome that mimics myocardial infarction but lacks obstructive coronary disease; recognition hinges on integrating clinical context, ECG and troponin findings, and imaging to confirm Takotsubo, followed by supportive cardiology care and targeted psychosocial interventions to reduce recurrence and improve long-term outcomes [^6bafc46b] [^be637324] [^3af72318].

---

Heartache — whether emotional or physical — is linked to **measurable cardiac effects** via the brain–heart axis, including stress-induced catecholamine surges that can cause Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [^6bafc46b] and autonomic dysregulation that alters heart rate and rhythm [^a1333f78]. Emotional pain activates the same neural pathways as physical pain [^notfound], and chronic stress increases cardiovascular risk through inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and arrhythmias [^be637324] [^fa538252]. Clinically, heartache can present as chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea; evaluation should exclude ischemia and arrhythmias, and management includes stress reduction, mental health support, and cardioprotective care when indicated [^a57daec7] [^be637324].

## Physiological mechanisms linking heartache to cardiac effects

### Emotional stress and the brain–heart axis

- **Brain–heart axis**: Emotional stress activates the HPA axis and sympathetic system, increasing catecholamines and causing vasoconstriction, ischemia, and arrhythmias [^be637324] [^fa538252].
- **Takotsubo cardiomyopathy**: Acute emotional stress can trigger transient LV dysfunction ("broken heart syndrome") via catecholamine surge and autonomic dysregulation [^6bafc46b] [^8761d7ea].
- **Autonomic imbalance**: Chronic stress shifts sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance, reducing HRV and increasing arrhythmia risk [^2cc78855] [^65051eaf].

---

### Neurohormonal and inflammatory responses

- **Catecholamines**: Stress elevates epinephrine/norepinephrine, causing direct myocardial toxicity, vasospasm, and ischemia [^6bafc46b] [^eb87f3f6].
- **Cortisol**: Chronic stress increases cortisol, promoting hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis [^notfound].
- **Inflammation**: Stress upregulates cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α), contributing to endothelial dysfunction and plaque instability [^notfound].

---

### Structural and functional cardiac changes

Chronic stress is associated with **remodeling** — including myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ventricular dysfunction — and with **arrhythmias** via prolonged QT, repolarization instability, and increased risk of atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death [^8761d7ea] [^2cc78855].

---

## Clinical manifestations of heartache

Heartache can present with **cardiac symptoms** that require evaluation:

| **Symptom** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Chest pain or discomfort | - Substernal <br/> - Pressure-like <br/> - May radiate to arms, neck, jaw, or back [^a57daec7] [^6213cc51] |
| Palpitations | Sensation of irregular or rapid heartbeat [^notfound] |
| Dyspnea | Shortness of breath, especially with exertion or emotional stress [^notfound] |
| Fatigue | Unusual tiredness or lack of energy [^notfound] |
| Syncope or presyncope | Fainting or near-fainting episodes [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When heartache presents with cardiac symptoms, a **structured evaluation is essential**:

- **History and physical examination**: Characterize symptoms, triggers, and risk factors [^a57daec7].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify ischemia, arrhythmias, or Takotsubo changes [^notfound].
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Troponin to assess myocardial injury; natriuretic peptides if heart failure suspected [^0285fc24].
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate ventricular function and wall motion abnormalities [^notfound].
- **Coronary angiography**: Exclude obstructive coronary disease in suspected Takotsubo or ACS [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management addresses both emotional and cardiac components:

- **Stress reduction**: Mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation techniques to lower sympathetic activity [^0c19c4ee].
- **Mental health support**: Counseling and pharmacotherapy for anxiety, depression, or grief [^notfound].
- **Cardioprotective therapy**: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or statins as indicated for cardiovascular risk or Takotsubo recovery [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Exercise, nutrition, sleep hygiene, and substance use reduction [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on underlying cardiac pathology and stress management. Takotsubo generally recovers with supportive care, but recurrence and chronic heart failure can occur, especially with ongoing stress [^6bafc46b] [^d1e6ce08]. Chronic stress-related cardiac effects may persist without intervention, underscoring the need for **comprehensive care** [^be637324].

---

Heartache reflects a **real, biologically mediated cardiac vulnerability** to emotional stress. Recognizing and treating both the emotional and cardiovascular dimensions improves outcomes and reduces recurrence.

3. Symptom perception and “medically unexplained symptoms”

The idea that what we perceive is not the world as it is but our own best hypothesis of it equally applies to the body, and subjective bodily states such as medical symptoms. We do not necessarily feel pain—this framework suggests—because we “sense” it directly from the peripheral body. To put it emphatically, we feel pain because we predict that we are in pain, based on an integration of sensory inputs, prior experience, and contextual cues.

The experience of symptoms arises out of the inference that the body has deviated from the physiological constants that define health. From a Bayesian perspective, the experience of health depends on the fact that we maintain a general “healthy body condition” hypothesis (partly determined by evolution, partly by development) that explains away a certain range of normal variations in somatic input (eg, variations in heartbeat frequency, bodily aches, etc.).So long as these variations are kept within the bounds predicted by the “healthy body condition” hypothesis, the brain treats them as “noise” and no symptom is perceived. When, due to a disrupting cause such as disease, the variation of somatic inputs is too large to be successfully predicted by the general hypothesis and prediction error increases, the brain must generate another hypothesis that accounts for the new evidence. According to the theory, we feel symptoms, including pain, when the hypothesis with the lowest prediction error represents an abnormal somatic event.This framing ultimately shows that pathophysiology may be only loosely coupled with symptoms perception because the latter is mediated by internally generated hypotheses about the causes of inputs, not solely determined by inputs themselves. The degree of the correlation between pathophysiology and symptoms will vary according to the relative precision assigned to inputs and hypotheses, respectively.

### Importance of resting heart rate [^2a464dcf]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Resting heart rate is a determinant of cardiac output and physiological homeostasis. Although a simple, but critical, parameter, this vital sign predicts adverse outcomes, including mortality, and development of diseases in otherwise normal and healthy individuals. Temporal changes in heart rate can have valuable predictive capabilities. Heart rate can reflect disease severity in patients with various medical conditions. While heart rate represents a compilation of physiological inputs, including sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, aside from the underlying intrinsic sinus rate, how resting heart rate affects outcomes is uncertain. Mechanisms relating resting heart rate to outcomes may be disease-dependent but why resting heart rate in otherwise healthy, normal individuals affects outcomes remains obscure. For specific conditions, physiologically appropriate heart rate reductions may improve outcomes. However, to date, in the normal population, evidence that interventions aimed at reducing heart rate improves outcomes remains undefined. Emerging data suggest that reduction in heart rate via vagal activation and/or sympathetic inhibition is propitious.

### Heartache [^2cc78855]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Are heart attacks an emotional regulation problem?

People who are depressed also have a higher rate of cigarette smoking.

And unhealthy drinking.

And drug use.

And decreased heart rate variability predisposing to arrhythmias.

And coronary artery disease.

And diabetes.

And the latter is associated with a greater prevalence of atherosclerotic and microvascular disease.

All of which can increase the likelihood of the disease myocardial infarction.

However, the illness, heart attack, is experienced through the confluence of biochemistry, cellular physiology, interpersonal relationships, and social drivers of health.This is the lens of George Engel’s Biopsychosocial Model: You are a wage earner, have diabetes, and were laid off from your job because the economy took a downturn. You and your family become food insecure, and you feel diminished as a human being, arguing with your spouse about things outside of your control. Oxygen supply and demand shift toward a deficit. Cardiac muscle dies.

The deeper appreciation of a heart attack emerges from a narrative co-authored by patient and physician, influenced by societal “isms” (racism, gender bias, classism, and so on), challenges in health literacy, and the presence or absence of the clinical team’s cultural humility and unconscious biases.

What a patient needs before or after a heart attack is an empathetic doctor who calls upon a caring interdisciplinary team because perceived social support enhances recovery.Such empathy can be challenging: the patient’s illness narrative can create a heartache shared between physician and patient, tempting the doctor to focus on pathophysiology rather than suffering. Compassion resilience depends in part on acceptance that a single clinician can’t solve someone’s financial problems, exposure to structural racism, and the larger limitations of life such as mortality. We also cannot solve the limitations people put on their own lives. What we can do is provide compassion, connection, partnership, and interdisciplinary care. And we can advocate for more social services, more psychological support, and more substance use treatment.

More equity for all our patients.

### Cardiac endocrinology: heart-derived hormones in physiology and disease [^9afa1198]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

The vital function of the heart has been known for thousands of years. The heart beats continuously to pump blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to every cell of our body. An unhealthy heart, such as one with heart failure, has significantly reduced contractile function that reduces its ability to perform such a task. As a result, cells in our body receive less oxygen, nutrients, and other factors critical for their survival, growth, and normal function. In contrast, during exercise, the heart needs to elevate its rate and capacity to satisfy the increased whole body oxygen and energy demand. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the heart communicates its functional status to the rest of the body to coordinate nutritional needs and functions.

Such heart-derived signals can take many forms and can be neuronal or endocrine in nature. Neuronal signals tend to be fast-acting, whereas endocrine signals can stimulate long-term changes. The heart can signal its functional status to the brain through sensory nerves; the brain then integrates and relays this information to the rest of the body through efferent nerves or endocrine signals (e.g. change in growth hormone level). Alternatively, the heart can secrete signals into the circulation that travel to distant sites of the body to directly affect their biology, thus functioning as heart-derived hormones. Such heart-derived hormones can be proteins, lipids, metabolites, or other forms of molecules. Most cell types routinely secrete many factors into the extracellular space, but most of them are often trapped there without going into the systemic circulation, or they go into circulation as mere biomarkers without specific biological functions through activating distinct receptors on specific target organs. Due to space limitations, this review mainly focuses on heart-derived endocrine hormones with systemic effects.

### Heartache [^af17b809]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Dr Eric Cassell has contrasted disease and illness.Disease, he suggested, is a pathophysiologic process, while illness is an experience of disease over time.

In the early 1980s, we learned in medical school that cheeseburger diets contribute to cholesterol deposits in coronary arteries. Cheeseburger fat also activates inflammatory cells, which clump, intertwining with cholesterol deposits, clogging coronary arteries, and strangling the heart’s blood supply, generating an imbalance between oxygen demand and availability. When the imbalance is severe, cardiac cells die. The diagnosis, myocardial infarction, means “death of heart muscle.”

In Cassell’s framework, myocardial infarction is a disease, but what is the illness? We have a better conceptualization now.

Consider the following question: Why does the person who will get a heart attack eat cheeseburgers to begin with?

Japan has among the lowest rates of heart attacks in the world, often attributed to a healthy diet. When people from Japan move to the United States and their descendants become acculturated, heart attacks increase.

Are heart attacks a cultural problem?

Immigrants sometimes have a hard time finding employment in a new country. Unemployment increases financial stress, and stress increases inflammation, which can contribute to coronary artery blockages.

Are heart attacks an economic problem?

Black people have a high unemployment rate in the United States. When 2 job applicants have equal qualifications, a White person is more likely to be hired.

Are heart attacks a race relations problem?

When someone experiences sustained unemployment, depression often emerges. Depression correlates with measures of increased platelet activation,possibly explaining part of the association between depression and coronary artery disease.

### Tackling heart failure in the twenty-first century [^f29cab17]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure, or congestive heart failure, is a condition in which the heart cannot supply the body's tissues with enough blood. The result is a cascade of changes that lead to severe fatigue, breathlessness and, ultimately, death. In the past quarter century, much progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular processes that contribute to heart failure, leading to the development of effective therapies. Despite this, chronic heart failure remains a major cause of illness and death. And because the condition becomes more common with increasing age, the number of affected individuals is rising with the rapidly ageing global population. New treatments that target disease mechanisms at the cellular and whole-organ level are needed to halt and reverse the devastating consequences of this disease.

### Classic and cutting-edge strategies for the management of early pregnancy loss [^9090f701]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

There are few conditions in medicine associated with more heartache to patients than recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The management of early RPL is a formidable clinical challenge for physicians. Great strides have been made in characterizing the incidence and diversity of this heterogeneous disorder, and a definite cause of pregnancy loss can be established in more than half of couples after a thorough evaluation. In this review, current data are evaluated and a clear roadmap is provided for the evaluation and treatment of RPL.

### Brain-heart connections in stress and cardiovascular disease: implications for the cardiac patient [^fa538252]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

The influence of psychological stress on the physiology of the cardiovascular system, and on the etiology and outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the object of intense investigation. As a whole, current knowledge points to a "brain-heart axis" that is especially important in individuals with pre-existing CVD. The use of acute psychological stress provocation in the laboratory has been useful to clarify the effects of psychological stress on cardiovascular physiology, immune function, vascular reactivity, myocardial ischemia, neurobiology and cardiovascular outcomes. An emerging paradigm is that dynamic perturbations of physiological and molecular pathways during stress or negative emotions are important in influencing cardiovascular outcomes, and that some patient subgroups, such as women, patients with an early-onset myocardial infarction, and patients with adverse psychosocial exposures, may be at especially high risk for these effects. This review summarizes recent knowledge on mind-body connections in CVD among cardiac patients and highlights important pathways of risk which could become the object of future intervention efforts. As a whole, this research suggests that an integrated study of mind and body is necessary to fully understand the determinants and consequences of CVD.

### Cardiac autonomic innervation [^a1333f78]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system plays a key role in regulating changes in the cardiovascular system and its adaptation to various human body functions. The sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system is associated with the fight and flight response, while the parasympathetic division is responsible for the restorative effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. Disorders involving these two divisions can lead to, and are seen as, a manifestation of most common cardiovascular disorders. Over the last few decades, extensive research has been performed establishing imaging techniques to quantify the autonomic dysfunction associated with various cardiovascular disorders. Additionally, several techniques have been tested with variable success in modulating the cardiac autonomic nervous system as treatment for these disorders. In this review, we summarize basic anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of the cardiac autonomic nervous system including adrenergic receptors. We have also discussed several imaging modalities available to aid in diagnosis of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and autonomic modulation techniques, including pharmacologic and device-based therapies, that have been or are being tested currently.

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^692a12b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Though somewhat crude, ours are among the first empirical estimates of heat strain to systematically consider the breadth of physiological data collected using highly specialized equipment and, perhaps more importantly, quantify uncertainty in model outputs. That said, there are important knowledge gaps that must be addressed to improve the utility and generalizability of such empirical models. Although accounting for design characteristics and demographic factors and between-modality differences in skin temperature reduced unexplained variance, most notably on the between-study level, considerable heterogeneity was still detected (Figure S86). These findings highlight the well-established variability in physiological responses to heat stress –. Delineating sources of this variation, particularly under ecologically relevant exposure conditions and durations (e.g. over several hours to days),, is needed to not only improve our understanding of heats effects on the body, but also to identify factors for improving the accuracy and representativeness of physiological models.

### Pacemaker channels and the chronotropic response in health and disease [^65051eaf]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A regular and rhythmic heartbeat is one of the most fundamental processes of life. Around embryonic day 36, the developing heart starts beating and the heartbeat does not stop until the person dies. Remarkably, the rhythmicity of cardiac contractions is controlled with high precision, making the normal heartbeat almost perfectly regular on palpation, with physiological baseline fluctuations known as heart rate variability.This regularity persists even if the heart rate (HR) changes due to respiration or a change in activity level. The body’s need for blood supply varies depending on physical exertion or emotional activity. To meet such varying demands, cardiac output is mainly regulated by adjusting the HR, which, in turn, is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS): increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system accelerates, while increased activation of the parasympathetic nervous system slows down the heart. This mechanism is termed chronotropic effect and enables smooth changes in HR, without rapid fluctuations or rhythm disturbances. Three components are associated with the chronotropic response, which are (1) the actual HR, (2) the variability of HR at a given time, and (3) the initiation site of pacemaker activity (Figure 1). When the activity state changes from rest to physical activity and back, all 3 parameters are changed by the ANS and need to be considered.

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^0a0af64e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Heat waves are associated with increased fatalities from adverse cardiovascular events attributed to the negative effects of heat on cardiac function. However, scientific understanding of acute cardiac adjustments to heat has come primarily from laboratory experiments employing insulated and encapsulated heating modalities, most commonly water-perfused suits. We evaluated whether findings from those studies reflect cardiac responses during more natural exposures to hot ambient conditions simulated in climate-controlled chambers by synthesizing the findings from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies (6858 participant-exposures) published between 1961-2024. Among all included studies, median (interquartile range) elevations in core temperature and heart rate from baseline to end-exposure were 0.9 (0.5-1.3)°C and 27 (15-40) beats/min. Multilevel mixed-effects meta-analyses revealed exacerbated elevations in heart rate, cardiac output, and rate pressure product (estimate of cardiac workload) and blunted falls in systolic pressure in participants heated via encapsulated modalities. Leveraging the large dataset, we also provide empirical estimates of body temperature and cardiovascular responses to a wide range of conditions experienced during heat waves. With rising global temperatures, ecologically-minded physiological research is needed to improve understanding of the effects of heat stress on cardiac responses and further the development of robust climate health models and evidence-based heat-health guidance.

### The bhagavad gita, psychological safety, and the medical learning environment: hitting the sweet spot [^5711d075]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The Opportunity

The human body is a miracle.

As physicians, we are gifted with the opportunity to learn about its myriad functions, to protect it, and to care for it. In this process, the learning is both vast and eternal—noble in purpose, intimidating in scope. Books provide necessary information, but we rely on clinician educators to teach medicine by example. We observe, absorb, practice, and mature in the practical application of medical knowledge at the bedside. There is no formula, no one “right way” to teach, or to learn medicine. This lifelong process renders vulnerability, heartache, and exhilaration—necessitating a rigorous and safe system to optimize both learning and patient care.

Along the way, we come across mentors and clinical educators whose styles we find personally effective, and whose interactions with patients leave us with durable lessons that stay with us for years. These teachers seamlessly integrate medical knowledge and patient management in an inimitable manner, weaving complex biomedical concepts with extraordinary care and compassion. Such experiences can be uniquely gratifying, and almost intimate, as we all develop our own skills and styles.

We all also experience educational scenarios that may feel counterproductive to effective learning. Such educators or circumstances may trigger excessive anxiety or pressure, thereby creating a suboptimal learning environment, and potentially giving rise to negative emotions of apathy, frustration, or even dejection. So how then, do we optimize the bidirectional educational experience for both students and teachers in the modern-day field of medicine?

### Physiological effects of human body imaging with 300 mT / M gradients [^a3b81dc1]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The use of high-performance gradient systems (i.e. high gradient strength and/or high slew rate) for human MRI is limited by physiological effects (including the elicitation of magnetophosphenes and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)). These effects, in turn, depend on the interaction between time-varying magnetic fields and the body, and thus on the participant’s position with respect to the scanner’s isocenter. This study investigated the occurrence of magnetophosphenes and PNS when scanning participants on a high-gradient (300 mT/m) system, for different gradient amplitudes, ramp times, and participant positions.

Methods

Using a whole-body 300 mT/m gradient MRI system, a cohort of participants was scanned with the head, heart, and prostate at magnet isocenter and a train of trapezoidal bipolar gradient pulses, with ramp times from 0.88 to 4.20 ms and gradient amplitudes from 60 to 300 mT/m. Reports of magnetophosphenes and incidental reports of PNS were obtained. A questionnaire was used to record any additional subjective effects.

Results

Magnetophosphenes were strongly dependent on participant position in the scanner. 87% of participants reported the effect with the heart at isocenter, 33% with the head at isocenter, and only 7% with the prostate at isocenter. PNS was most widely reported by participants for the vertical gradient axis (67% of participants), and was the dominant physiological effect for ramp times below 2 ms.

Conclusion

This study evaluates the probability of eliciting magnetophosphenes during whole-body imaging using an ultra-strong gradient MRI system. It provides empirical guidance on the use of high-performance gradient systems for whole-body human MRI.

### Characterizing the causal pathway from childhood adiposity to right heart physiology and pulmonary circulation using Lifecourse mendelian randomization [^75f54450]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
Schematic diagrams depicting different scenarios whereby childhood adiposity may exert an effect on cardiac outcomes in adulthood using a lifecourse Mendelian randomization approach.

A, Univariable Mendelian randomization was conducted to estimate the “total effect” of childhood body size on cardiac outcomes in adulthood. B, Multivariable Mendelian randomization was subsequently applied to estimate “direct effects” of childhood body size on cardiac outcomes (ie, an effect independent of adulthood body size), as well as simultaneously estimating (C) “indirect effects,” which are mediated along the causal pathway involving adulthood body size.

In the current study, we applied lifecourse MR to separate the direct and indirect effects of childhood body size on 11 measures relevant to the right heart and pulmonary circulation, encompassing the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and aorta. After initially accounting for adulthood body size in our multivariable model, we next evaluated whether other measures of lifecourse body composition may be responsible for childhood body size effects (ie, childhood height, birth weight, and adulthood fat‐free mass). In doing so, we sought to develop granular insight into the lifelong consequences of childhood body size on cardiovascular system physiology.

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^32cd017a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

These findings have important implications for translational efforts directed at linking cardiovascular adjustments to acute environmental heat stresswith the elevated risk of cardiovascular events seen during heat waves,. Discussions in this area have focused on the profound cardiovascular strain observed in studies using water-perfused suits –, most commonly the early work by Rowell et al.which showed increases in cardiac output of 5-7 L/min. Our analyses, however, suggest that rises in cardiac output do not surpass 3 L/min when participants are heated with a climate chamber. In fact, only 1 in 14 effect estimates of the heat-induced elevation in cardiac output in the chamber studies exceeded 2.0 L/min (Fig. 4),,,,,,,,,,,, and those data were collected under extreme conditions (42 °C, 70% relative humidity). Further, despite comparable heart rate responses (Fig. 3), systolic pressure and rate pressure product were elevated >10 mmHg and >1800 mmHg·beats/min in perfusion suits relative to chamber studies at core temperature elevations >1.0 °C (Fig. 4), differences that, on average, exceeded previously suggested thresholds for clinical significance. These findings highlight that while perfusion suits have played a central role in developing mechanistic understanding of the physiological adjustments to extreme heat, they have limited utility for quantifying the cardiovascular burden of hot weather and heat waves.

Extreme increases in skin temperature are the most likely explanation for the exacerbated cardiac strain seen with perfusion suits. In our primary analyses, we normalized cardiac responses to the rise in core temperature, the most relevant body temperature when discussing the clinical implications of heat –. However, cardiovascular adjustments are also influenced by skin temperatures through autonomic- and locally-mediated mechanisms acting to facilitate blood redistribution from the central to peripheral circulation to aid in heat dissipation,,. Since perfusion suits heat participants by passing hot water over the skin surface, cutaneous heat gain is substantial,. As a result, skin temperatures often reach levels considerably higher than those seen during exposure to hot conditions where the skin can readily participate in heat exchange (Figure S83). Our secondary analyses clearly demonstrate the importance of skin temperature. While correcting for posture, worn clothing, and participant demographics had little impact on heart rate differences between heating modalities, adjusting for skin temperature nullified between-modality differences (Figure S31).

### Effects of music on the cardiovascular system [^85c78455]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Listening to music is a complex phenomenon, involving psychological, emotional, cardiorespiratory, and likely other body system changes. Individual responses to music can be influenced by personal preferences, familiarity with music, environment, prior music experience, and other health factors. This review highlights the need for well-controlled randomized clinical trials in subjects with preexisting medical conditions and appropriate controls. Comparison of individualized music sessions to preferred or random music selections, and duration of therapies needed for therapeutic benefit, are important variables for future studies. The promising effects of music interventions on cardiovascular physiology, coupled with their low cost and a high degree of safety, warrant further exploration in both healthy populations and especially those with cardiovascular disease.

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^13068ff6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We synthesized the findings of over 400 laboratory-based studies to compare heat-induced changes in heart rate, cardiac output, systolic pressure, and rate pressure product between studies using encapsulated and extreme heating modalities and those exposing participants to hot ambient conditions in a climate-controlled chamber. The employed modality had marked effects on cardiac responses. Of key importance, water-perfused suits, the most common passive heating modality in thermophysiological research, were associated with exacerbated cardiac responses compared to resting exposure in climate chambers. While perfusion suits play an integral role in mechanistic investigations, our findings suggest that they are less useful for quantifying the cardiac effects of more natural exposures. Ecologically-minded studies simulating or conducted in real-world settings are needed to improve scientific understanding of the cardiac impacts of hot weather and support the development of robust climate-health models. As a step toward this goal, we provide empirical quantifications of the acute thermal and cardiac strain experienced in conditions reflective of deadly heat waves.

Following foundational work by Rowell et al., water-perfused suits quickly became the most common heating modality in research evaluating the cardiovascular adjustments supporting thermoregulation and homeostasis during acute heat stress. In addition to their accessibility, their popularity is owed to their encapsulated design, which, when combined with the high thermal conductivity of water perfused in near-direct contact with the skin, allows for precise control of body temperature. While these features have clear benefits for mechanistic research (Table S2), we questioned whether perfusion suits provide a suitable model for evaluating the cardiovascular consequences of more natural heat exposures like those occurring during hot weather and heat waves. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged data from over 400 studies conducted over 60 years to evaluate how cardiac responses were modified by the employed heating modality. As anticipated, we found exacerbated elevations in heart rate, cardiac output, and rate pressure product along with blunted reductions in systolic pressure in studies using perfusion suits compared to those exposing participants to hot conditions in climate-controlled chambers (Figs. 2 – 4).

### Pain and respiration: a systematic review [^f676ba25]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Breathing techniques are commonly used to alleviate pain. Despite their frequent use, surprisingly little is known about their efficacy as well as their underlying physiological mechanisms. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the results of existing studies on the association between respiration and pain, and to highlight a potential physiological mechanism underlying the respiration-pain connection. A total of 31 publications from between 1984 and 2015 were retrieved and analyzed. These articles were classified into 4 groups: experimental and clinical studies of the effect of pain on respiration, clinical studies of the effects of breathing techniques on pain, and experimental studies of the influence of various forms of respiration on laboratory-induced pain. The findings suggest that pain influences respiration by increasing its flow, frequency, and volume. Furthermore, paced slow breathing is associated with pain reduction in some of the studies, but evidence elucidating the underlying physiological mechanisms of this effect is lacking. Here, we focus on the potential role of the cardiovascular system on the respiratory modulation of pain. Further research is definitely warranted.

### Cannabinoids, the heart of the matter [^1ce68067]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Summary: Promise and Challenges for Cannabinoid Therapeutics and CVD

Endocannabinoids and cannabinoid‐related compounds may be a promising approach as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases. However, there are several challenges that arise when considering these targets.

Likely Side Effect Profiles of Drugs Targeting Broadly Expressed Metabotropic and Ionotropic Cannabinoid Receptors

Putting the striking progress aside when it comes to understanding the functions of the TRP channel family, some problems persist. TRPV1 channel ligation can be beneficial in one organ and induce unacceptable adverse side effects in another. 56 For example, in clinical trials, small molecule TRPV1 (TRPV3 and TRPA1) antagonists were used to treat inflammatory, neuropathic, and visceral pain, but studies were terminated because of adverse effects induced by TRPV1 antagonists. 100 Hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation placed patients at risk for scalding injury. Second generation TRP antagonists that do not induce an increase in core body temperature has been reported, nevertheless the therapeutic utility is not yet known. 100 Administration of CB1 agonists in vivo causes complex hemodynamic changes, including changes of heart rate as well as increased and decreased blood pressure. 101

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^b7020101]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Information on numerous additional study-level variables was also extracted, including participant characteristics and posture, duration of heat stress, additional indices of body temperature (mean skin temperature and mean body temperature), indices of body fluid status (change in body weight and/or plasma volume), and methods of exposure/outcome ascertainment. Regarding the latter, the body location in which core temperature was measured was recorded and grouped into three categories: i) direct, slow-responding (rectum, gastrointestinal tract); ii) direct, fast-responding (pulmonary artery, esophagus, or tympanic membrane); or iii) indirect (oral cavity, aural canal). This was done to account for differences in the absolute and temporal responses to body heating among common core temperature indices (see “ Meta-analyses ” below). Ascertainment methods for all exposure and outcome variables are described in supplemental Table S9 (pp 17–18).

The quality of studies including only a heat stress arm were assessed using the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Quality Tool for Before-After Studies. Risk of bias in the controlled studies was evaluated using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB 2). Information on the use of these scales along with adaptations made for the current review are described in the supplement (Tables S12 – S14).

Meta-analyses

Individual study effect estimates (unit of analysis)

Analyzed effect estimates were the change in heart rate (primary outcome) and secondary cardiac outcomes from pre-heating (baseline) values to the end of heating. If the baseline-to-end-heating change and its standard deviation were not directly reported, they were derived from data presented for the baseline and end-heating timepoints. Data presented in figures were extracted using open-source software (WebPlotDigitizer). Secondary variables reflecting a composite of other exposures (e.g. mean body temperature) or outcomes (e.g. cardiac output, rate pressure product) were imputed from the composite variables if sufficient data were available (Tables S15 – S16). Secondary outcomes reported in the main article included cardiac output, systolic pressure, and rate pressure product, with analyses for stroke volume confined to the supplement.

### Ketone bodies in cardiovascular disease: the vasculature as a therapeutic target [^de11bce8]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular Effects of Ketone Bodies

Ketone bodies exert multiple effects on several critical aspects of vascular physiology and pathophysiology, including SVR and PVR, blood flow in specific vascular beds (such as the coronary, renal, and cerebral arteries), endothelial and microvascular function, vascular senescence, atherosclerosis, and vascular calcification (Figure 2, Central Illustration). The vascular effects of KBs along with proposed mechanisms are discussed later.

Figure 2 
The Beneficial Vascular, Cardiac, and Systemic Effects of Exogenous KBs

Vasculoprotective properties of exogenous ketone bodies include vasodilation of systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulation, enhancing endothelial function; decreasing blood pressure; promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis; and preventing vascular senescence, calcification, and atherosclerosis. Cardiac effects of KBs include improving cardiac energetics, ameliorating pathological remodeling, and enhancing cardiac function. Systemic metabolic effects of KBs include decreasing glucose and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, suppressing appetite, and weight loss. KBs may also improve exercise tolerance and inhibit the sympathetic nervous system. Cellular mechanisms for the above activities include roles as a fuel source, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and promoter of mitochondrial function.

Central Illustration 
The Vascular and Cardiac Effects of Ketones Bodies

Ketone bodies (KBs) serve as an alternate fuel source for the myocardium but also possess pleiotropic activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and enhancing mitochondrial function among others. KBs accomplish these functions via several mechanisms, including inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC), acting via their G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs), β-hydroxybutyrylation of cellular proteins and histones, and activation of voltage-gated potassium channels (V-gated K+ channels). The vasculature is the main target of the pleiotropic activities of KBs. The effects of KBs on the vasculature include systemic, pulmonary, and coronary vasodilation, enhancing endothelial function, and promoting angiogenesis. The vascular effects of KBs contribute to the beneficial effects of KBs in ischemia-reperfusion injury, pathological cardiac remodeling, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

### Grandparenting in the United States [^82efc087]. Innovation in Aging (2017). Low credibility.

Gandparenting can be a source of great joy and great heartache. Given the lack of supports for working families in the United States, grandparents are often called upon to provide substantial assistance. The impact of grandparenting on emotional, physical, and financial wellbeing varies widely. Those with fewer resources tend to feel any adverse impacts more readily. U.S. social policy lags behind that of most countries; federally guaranteed paid vacation, sick leave, parental leave, flex time, and affordable quality child care, would greatly reduce the burden on working families and grandparents. Such policies would be particularly beneficial for families with fewer resources, and more care demands, who are currently facing the most adverse impacts.

### Characterizing the causal pathway from childhood adiposity to right heart physiology and pulmonary circulation using Lifecourse mendelian randomization [^d3b337a8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

While our lifecourse MR framework provides a powerful framework to separate direct and indirect effects of childhood body size on disease outcomes and traits, we note that further research is required to pinpoint the critical windows in the lifecourse when changes to cardiac physiology may become irreversible. In addition, our study benefitted from the largest study to date with MRI‐derived measures of cardiac physiology made possible by the UKB study. That said, the subsample of individuals who attended the UKB imaging clinic have been reported to have a “healthy bias,”which is a caveat that comes from biobank‐level scale data collection. Likewise, the UKB participants were predominantly born in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, meaning that effect estimates derived in this study may not directly translate to individuals born in more recent decades where factors such as the prevalence of childhood obesity are different.

Furthermore, we did not evaluate sex differences between body size and cardiac traits in this study due to data availability, which should therefore be the focus of future investigations. Finally, although our findings are consistent with our previous research regarding left heart structure traits, we were unable to assess whether effects of childhood body size act independently on left and right heart traits. This should therefore also be the aim of future research once larger sample sizes of MRI‐derived cardiac traits facilitate a larger number of genetic loci to analyze within a multivariable MR framework.

In conclusion, findings from this study support those from our previous investigations, suggesting that body size in early life has a lifelong influence on heart structure. Conversely, associations between childhood body size and the other measures of cardiac physiology assessed in this study are likely attributed to measures of body composition over the lifecourse. Future research should focus on the downstream consequences of adiposity on cardiac morphology and how these changes contribute to overall cardiovascular disease risk.

### Meta-analysis of heat-induced changes in cardiac function from over 400 laboratory-based heat exposure studies [^981e3486]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In sensitivity analyses (Table S19 – S28, Figure S32), interpretations of the primary analysis were not markedly altered when studies omitted from the primary analysis were included, a laboratory identifier was incorporated as a random effect, or we varied the within-study correlation modeled in robust variance estimation. Findings were also robust to removal of potentially influential effect estimates, modeling non-linear associations between core temperature and heart rate, restricting suit and immersion studies to those employing full body coverage, and variation in measurement timing for heart rate, study quality, and date of publication. By contrast, between-modality differences in heart-rate responses were blunted when core temperature was replaced with estimated mean body temperature. Finally, analyses of the 51 studies including a control arm were similar when data were analyzed for the heat stress arm only (as in the primary analysis) and as the difference in heart rate responses between the heat and control arms. That said, relations between heating modalities were altered considerably in these analyses compared to primary analysis of the 400 included studies.

Cardiac output, systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product (secondary outcomes)

Cardiac output, systolic pressure, and rate pressure product in the climate chamber and perfusion suit studies are shown in Fig. 4. At any given increase in core temperature, cardiac output was elevated an average of 1.0 [0.4, 1.6] L/min in the perfusion suit studies (P = 0.003). Systolic pressure changed by −8 [−15, 0] and 2 [−2, 7] mmHg per 1 °C rise in core temperature in the climate chamber and perfusion suit studies, respectively. While those within-modality associations between systolic pressure and core temperature were not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.054), the between-modality difference in slopes was (slope difference: 10 [1, 18] mmHg/°C, P = 0.025). Heat-induced increases in rate pressure product were exacerbated 1841 [32, 3650] mmHg·beats/min/°C in the suit studies (P = 0.046).

The heart is a target of injury for many chemical compounds, both medically prescribed and not medically prescribed. Pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the development of chemical-induced cardiomyopathies vary depending on the inciting agent, including direct toxic effects, neurohormonal activation, altered calcium homeostasis, and oxidative stress. Numerous chemicals and drugs are implicated in cardiomyopathy. This article discusses examples of medication and nonprescribed drug-induced cardiomyopathies and reviews their pathophysiologic mechanisms.

### Characterizing the causal pathway from childhood adiposity to right heart physiology and pulmonary circulation using Lifecourse mendelian randomization [^2e9ab095]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Disentangling the Direct and Indirect Effects of Childhood Body Size on Pulmonary Artery Physiology

Childhood body size provided strong evidence of a total effect on measures of aorta structure (eg, maximum ascending aorta diameter: β=0.24 [95% CI, 0.14–0.33]; P =1×10 −6), pulmonary artery traits (eg, short‐axis pulmonary artery: β=0.35 [95% CI, 0.25–0.45]; P =2×10 −12), and their ratio (β=0.12 [95% CI=0.03–0.22]; P =0.01). Effect estimates on aorta structure outcomes attenuated upon accounting for adult body size in the multivariable model (eg, maximum ascending aorta diameter: β=0.11 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.23]; P =0.09), suggesting that being overweight in childhood likely has an indirect effect on later life aorta structure due to a sustained consequence of body size over the lifecourse (Figure 3).

Figure 3 
Forest plots illustrating (A) univariable and (B) multivariable Mendelian randomization effect estimates of childhood and adult body size on measures of the pulmonary artery, the thoracic aorta, and their ratio.

Estimates for childhood (blue) and adult (orange) body size per change in body size category with their corresponding 95% CIs. The data underlying these figures can be found in Table S4.

Next, we found that childhood body size typically provided evidence of an independent effect on measures of the pulmonary artery after accounting for adult body size, childhood height, and birthweight in a multivariable setting (eg, short‐axis pulmonary artery after accounting for childhood height: β=0.33 [95% CI, 0.24–0.42]; P =2×10 −12 ; Figure 3). However, central effect estimates on pulmonary artery traits were reduced by approximately half when accounting for fat‐free mass index in adulthood (eg, short‐axis pulmonary artery: β=0.19 [95% CI, 0.06–0.20]; P =0.003), suggesting that lean and muscle mass in adulthood may have a predominating effect on pulmonary artery physiology in later life compared with overall adulthood adiposity.

### Characterizing the causal pathway from childhood adiposity to right heart physiology and pulmonary circulation using Lifecourse mendelian randomization [^d045a056]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

We also found evidence to suggest that childhood body size may have a long‐term adverse effect on cardiac function independent of adulthood body size on the basis of right atrium fractional area change, which is the percentage change in the right atrium between systole and diastole. That said, findings from the literature suggest that childhood body size has little impact on later life cardiovascular disease upon accounting for the contribution of body size in adulthood.However, these studies mainly focused on outcomes related to systemic circulation, and therefore further investigation into outcomes relevant to cardiac function (such as heart failure) is warranted.

Evidence of a total effect of childhood body size on measures of aorta physiology attenuated upon accounting for body size in adulthood, suggesting that this finding is likely explained by individuals who are larger in childhood typically remaining so throughout the lifecourse. Total effect estimates between childhood body size and pulmonary artery traits most strongly attenuated upon accounting for fat‐free mass in adulthood, which may suggest that lean and muscle mass play a more influential role in pulmonary artery physiology in later life compared with adiposity. Effect estimates between childhood body size and pulmonary artery–to–aorta ratio, which is used as a proxy for pulmonary hypertension risk,most strongly attenuated when accounting for height in childhood. These findings therefore suggest that being an overall larger individual in early life may be a stronger indicator of this cardiac trait in comparison with childhood adiposity. However, previous applications of these scores have provided evidence of an indirect effect on outcomes, such as atherosclerosis and heart failure,in contrast to evidence of a direct effect found in our analyses of right heart structure traits. Taken together, these findings do not indicate a clear pathophysiological connection between childhood body size, right heart structure, and risk of heart failure in later life. Further research is therefore necessary to explore this potential causal pathway and determine whether findings may be of clinical relevance.

### Take a deep, resisted, breath [^bf6a8362]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular and respiratory systems exist in series with the lungs, situated between the right and left sides of the circulation. Thus, breathing directly effects the cardiovascular system. How the circulation and respiration became separated into different “systems,” disciplines of study, and specialties in clinical medicine is an interesting epistemological and historical question, but the separation aside, one of the main symptoms of congestive heart failure is shortness of breath. Likewise, patients with structural lung disease frequently develop pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right‐sided heart failure. In addition, the outcome of a simple cardiopulmonary exercise test is a remarkable predictor of all‐cause mortality, and exercise is one of the best things an individual can do to promote cardiovascular health.

The pressure generated with a breath and the expansion of the lungs influence the volumes and pressures in the chambers of the heart and blood vessels. These changes, in turn, stimulate sensory nerves that influence the autonomic nervous system and the rate and depth of breathing.The pattern generators in the brainstem that drive and regulate heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing are also closely aligned.With exercise, a “central command” from higher brain centers accelerates the activity of “both” systems and sends feed‐forward signals to the brain stem in preparation for the increased metabolic demands of exercise.

Breathing can also be therapeutic. This ranges from the simple advice to “take a deep breath,” to ancient meditative and religious traditions, to studies showing that structured deep breathing programs can reduce anxiety,help manage pain,improve blood glucose,and lower blood pressure.Patients with lung disease and sleep apnea can also benefit from respiratory muscle training.Respiratory frequency is a key component of perceived exertion, and anecdotal reports indicate that elite athletes sometimes attempt to control or regulate their breathing during competition to maximize their focus and relaxation during peak competitive efforts.

During whole body exercise, minute ventilation can exceed 100 L/min in healthy young subjects during high‐intensity exercise, and values exceeding 250 L/min have been reported in large male rowers.Minute ventilations of this magnitude require substantial muscular work and oxygen consumption by the respiratory muscles.They also require, like all skeletal muscles, blood flow to sustain the contractions without fatigue.

### Mitochondrial structure and function in human heart failure [^c788bbf3]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which affect blood vessels or the heart, are the leading cause of death globally,accounting for 25% of US deaths.Although CVD generally affects the left ventricle, the right ventricle plays a crucial role in cardiovascular diseases, including pulmonary hypertension.Other forms of heart disease include valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias. The most common form of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which results from the buildup of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Coronary artery disease leads to chest pain, heart attacks, and heart failure (HF), – which is defined by the American Heart Association as a condition in which the heart pumps insufficient blood to meet the body’s needs.HF, which presents clinically with or without preserved ejection fractionand is the result of cardiomyocyte injury, is characterized by the inability of the heart to fill and expel blood from the left ventricle effectively. Injury to the myocardium can result from hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.Various types of HF present with different symptoms that can include shortness of breath, fatigue, congestion, and peripheral edema (Figure 1).

### Prediction of MDMA response in healthy humans: a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies [^a26587be]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the influence of 20 predictor variables on the physiological and psychological response to MDMA in healthy humans. We found that physiological as well as most psychological effects were most strongly dependent on MDMA plasma levels, which in turn was most strongly dependent on drug dose and body weight. When adjusted for drug dose per body weight and corrected for multiple testing, only age and the genetically determined activity of the enzyme CYP2D6 had an influence on the physiological response to MDMA. Specifically, younger subjects responded to MDMA with a stronger increase in heart rate than older subjects and a higher activity of the enzyme CYP2D6 predicted lower MDMA plasma concentration. With regard to psychological effects, subjects with a high score in “openness to experience” responded with more “closeness”, a stronger decrease in “general inactivation” and higher scores in the 5D-ASC scales “oceanic boundlessness” and “visionary restructuralization” in response to MDMA, whereas subjects with high “neuroticism” or trait anxiety experienced more “anxious ego dissolution” and “impaired control and cognition”. Furthermore, being more anxious-depressive or introverted immediately before MDMA intake was associated with more anxiety in response to MDMA.

Our finding that the MDMA plasma concentration – and indirectly MDMA dose per body weight – is the most important predictor for the response to MDMA is in line previous dose-response studies (;;;). However, as can be seen in, there were also several outcome variables that were not or only weakly predicted by MDMA plasma concentration. In general, MDMA plasma level tended to be most predictive for positive or neutral MDMA effects, as measured by the VAS scales “any drug effects”, “good drug effects”, “liking” and “stimulated” or the 5D-ASC scale “oceanic boundlessness”, and less so for negatively experienced MDMA effects, such as the VAS scale “bad drug effects” or the 5D-ASC scales “anxiety”, “impaired control and cognition” or “anxious ego dissolution”. This supports the study of, which found that MDMA dose correlated with subjective “energy level”, “feelings of closeness to others”, “mind racing”, “heightened senses” and “high”, but not with “ability to concentrate”. We also found that the MDMA plasma concentration was positively associated with mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate, but not with body temperature, which is again in line with the study of.

### When the worst headache becomes the worst heartache! [^91503bc1]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although a great deal of literature has been generated regarding left ventricular wall abnormalities, ECG changes and cardiac enzyme leaks associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), there have been only a few reports of true transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in patients with SAH. Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the unusual features of this syndrome, such as multivessel coronary vasospasm, abnormalities in coronary microvascular function, and catecholamine-mediated cardiotoxicity. Summary of Case- A previously healthy 64-year-old woman with no history of vascular disease was found unresponsive at home. She was taken to the emergency room where a CT head revealed an SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. On admission, an ECG showed deeply inverted T-waves and QT prolongation, typical of SAH. Cardiac troponin was measured at 1.2 ng/mL, and later increased to 3.7 ng/mL. A transthoracic echocardiogram on the next day revealed a large left ventricular wall abnormality, characteristic of apical ballooning with an ejection fraction of 25% to 30%. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was started on low dose beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She had an uneventful cardiac recovery within 5 days at which time a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormality.

Conclusions

This report adds to the growing list of "stressors" for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Clinicians should be aware of the existence and the typical clinical manifestations of this syndrome, which is increasingly recognized in various populations. In particular, neurologists should consider this syndrome in the differential diagnosis of ECG changes and apical wall motion abnormalities in patients with SAH. Prognosis is generally very good with full recovery in most patients; however, there may be increased morbidity associated in patients with SAH.

### Basic mechanisms of diabetic heart disease [^f7459966]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus predisposes affected individuals to a significant spectrum of cardiovascular complications, one of the most debilitating in terms of prognosis is heart failure. Indeed, the increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus and an aging population has given rise to an epidemic of diabetes mellitus-induced heart failure. Despite the significant research attention this phenomenon, termed diabetic cardiomyopathy, has received over several decades, understanding of the full spectrum of potential contributing mechanisms, and their relative contribution to this heart failure phenotype in the specific context of diabetes mellitus, has not yet been fully resolved. Key recent preclinical discoveries that comprise the current state-of-the-art understanding of the basic mechanisms of the complex phenotype, that is, the diabetic heart, form the basis of this review. Abnormalities in each of cardiac metabolism, physiological and pathophysiological signaling, and the mitochondrial compartment, in addition to oxidative stress, inflammation, myocardial cell death pathways, and neurohumoral mechanisms, are addressed. Further, the interactions between each of these contributing mechanisms and how they align to the functional, morphological, and structural impairments that characterize the diabetic heart are considered in light of the clinical context: from the disease burden, its current management in the clinic, and where the knowledge gaps remain. The need for continued interrogation of these mechanisms (both known and those yet to be identified) is essential to not only decipher the how and why of diabetes mellitus-induced heart failure but also to facilitate improved inroads into the clinical management of this pervasive clinical challenge.

### The impact of depression in heart disease [^cf539b11]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Depression and heart disease affect millions of people worldwide. Studies have shown that depression is a significant risk factor for new heart disease and that it increases morbidity and mortality in established heart disease. Many hypothesized and studied mechanisms have linked depression and heart disease, including serotonergic pathway and platelet dysfunction, inflammation, autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis imbalance, and psychosocial factors. Although the treatment of depression in cardiac patients has been shown to be safe and modestly efficacious, it has yet to translate into reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding the impact and mechanisms behind the association of depression and heart disease may allow for the development of treatments aimed at altering the devastating consequences caused by these comorbid illnesses.

### A cry for survival? Rhythmic and periodic EEG discharges as treatment targets following cardiac arrest [^9378a357]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary study outcome was neurological disability based on a dichotomized Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale score at 3 months. The outcome was considered good when no to moderate neurological disability (CPC score 1-2) and poor if severe disability, coma, or death (CPC score 3-5).

Ultimately, the investigators found no significant difference between the treatment and standard-care group. A good outcome occurred in 10% and 8%, respectively; 80% and 82% of patients died in each group. Secondary outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) stay duration and mechanical ventilation were slightly longer in the treatment group.

Comatose survivors of cardiac arrest are a medically complex and heterogenous group of patients. Studying this population is difficult for both conceptual and logistical reasons. The TELSTAR investigators successfully overcame these limitations to design and implement a high-quality trial that answers an important clinical question that neurologists face on a regular basis. The inclusion criteria were clear and rationally selected, the treatments painstakingly tracked, the presence of continuous EEG recordings allowed for careful observation of the effect of treatments, and the outcomes were collected in a blinded fashion. Considering the difficulty of introducing a trial in the ICU, and the necessity of maintaining communication with treating teams as well as with families during a desperate moment in the lives of their loved ones, the investigators should be applauded for their extraordinary accomplishment. Although the negative results are disappointing, knowing that aggressive anti-seizure treatment is not useful in this context will allow for better allocation of resources, and reduce patient suffering and family heartache in service of futile treatments.

With long distance grandparenting, the relationship between grandparents and parents is particularly pivotal.found that long distance grandparents maintained healthy positive relationships with their grandchildren as long as the grandparents had healthy positive relationships with the parents. But when relationships with the parents were strained, they were less likely to be able to maintain positive relationships with their grandchildren. Though long distance can lead to heartache, it often leads to satisfying relationships for those who employ technological solutions, favor longer and more intense visits, redefine grandparenting roles, and maintain positive multigenerational relationships.

### Whole body physiology model to simulate respiratory depression of fentanyl and associated naloxone reversal [^2fb0c9ff]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This effectively models the transport of the drug from the systemic circulation to the site of action, or binding site. Here ke is a first-order rate constant, buffering the binding of the drug to the effect site, Cp and Ce are the concentration of the drug in the plasma and the effect site. To compute the pharmacodynamics of the drug, or the physiological response in the body, we define the variable E as the effect of the drug. We model E, the effect of the drug, by creating a functional relationship between an opiate, for this study fentanyl, with its antagonist, naloxone:Here Eb is the baseline of the given physiological effect the drug is exerting on the patient, such as cardiovascular or pulmonary effects. Emax is the maximal possible effect, EC50 is the half-maximal effect, and lastly Ci and ki are the inhibitor concentration and constant. For example, in the case of fentanyl, the inhibition concentration is the concentration of naloxone in the effect compartment. There are numerous possible effects that can be mapped to a specific drug in the BioGears physiology engine, Supplementary Table 1. This generic method of drug modeling has shown good correlation for a number of different drugs, given that the physiochemical properties detailed in Supplementary Table 2 are known and accurately measured in the literature. The way the drug is administered will affect the concentration profile in the blood and our model will consider diffusion and release of the drug through the various nasal compartments to enter the bloodstream.

Nasal deposition model: Nasal drug administration offers an effective alternative drug delivery route by utilizing the large surface area of the nasal canals and the porous endothelial membrane, which lines them. The unique physiology of the nasal canal offers a vasculature space, which clears drugs rapidly. Much like the intravenous or intramuscular delivery methods, nasal drug delivery skips the first-pass effect of the metabolism. However, it provides similar benefits to oral dosing in that the nasal canal is a noninvasive pathway for rapid systemic drug absorption. While the narrow and nonlinear structure of the nasal canal can cause some challenges in drug retention, the nasal delivery method provides an excellent opportunity for drug exposure in a readily accessible system. In addition, most emergency rescue equipment kits include at least one form of nasal rescue spray, we will focus this paper on nasal delivery methods. We note, that the BioGears physiology engine also supports intramuscular, intravenous, and intraartial administrations in addition to the nasal route described here.

### Long COVID: post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 with a cardiovascular focus [^6a9d44db]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The crippling effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on healthcare and economies globally has undoubtedly been one of the worst disasters experienced by humans in the last decades. Worldwide, survivors of COVID-19 now exceed hundreds of millions,with some reporting incomplete recovery months beyond the acute illness, a condition commonly referred to as long COVID. Persistent symptoms of breathlessness, chest pain, fatigue, headaches, brain fog, and palpitations are a constant reminder of the devastation caused by this virus and the need to remain vigilant for any long-term damage. Now, more than ever before, management of cardiometabolic risk factors should become a priority for physicians, as their formidable power in intensifying COVID-19 illness severity has been convincingly documented. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular (CV) health and mortality is also emerging as a major global concern.

In this review, we discuss the definition of long COVID, epidemiology of cardiopulmonary manifestations in the context of long COVID, pathophysiological mechanisms for acute and chronic cardiac injury secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, its management, and future directions.

### American heart month-February 2019 [^887d6395]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, and heart attacks are a major category of heart disease; someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds (1). February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to remind all adults to focus on their hearts and encourage them, their families, friends, and communities to learn the important signs and symptoms of heart attack and how to respond. Recognizing that someone might be having a heart attack and calling emergency services (9-1-1) are crucial for optimizing access to lifesaving emergency cardiac care and receipt of advanced treatments and improving survival. Five common symptoms of a heart attack are 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. If someone is suspected to be having a heart attack, 9-1-1 should be called immediately.

### Physiological pacing: mechanisms, clinical indications, and perspectives [^bc184307]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Normal cardiac function depends on a highly efficient cardiac conduction system. Conduction system disease impairs cardiac function, which can reduce exercise capacity, cause symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue, and, if severe, result in syncope and death. Pacemakers were originally developed to treat profound bradycardia caused by complete heart block. However, pacing the right ventricle leads to non-physiological activation of the ventricular myocardium, reducing global cardiac performance. Early developments in physiological pacing focused on promoting intrinsic activation, delivering more physiological heart rate responses during exercise, and co-ordinating atrial and ventricular activation. More recently, the focus has shifted to delivering pacing which preserves or restores normal ventricular activation patterns, including atrio-biventricular pacing, conduction system pacing by His-bundle pacing, left bundle branch pacing, left septal pacing, and Bachmann's bundle pacing. Adoption of these more physiological approaches might reduce the adverse effects of pacing, as well as expanding pacing indications to treatment of other forms of conduction system disease. This paper reviews the evolving field of physiological pacing.

### From hesitancy to hope: one physician's experience with the moderna trial [^c7aac360]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Because the long runway to any discussion on vaccines with communities of color is littered with systemic racism and difficult truths about clinical trials, like the Tuskegee Experiment in which black men with syphilis remained untreated even after penicillin was found effective, I knew I would have an uphill battle asking my patients to be vaccinated. It seemed reasonable that my participation in a vaccine trial could provide a credible context in which to have these important discussions.

Fortunately, my institution is one of ninety sites for the Moderna Trial, but it wasn't until my vibrant stepmother died of COVID-19 and my step siblings’ raw heartache was laid bare that I was jolted into action. My first task was to convince my husband that the vaccine contained no virus. With a brief explanation about mRNA technology, he was supportive. The first of seven trial visits was three hours: a physical, informed consent, and randomization to placebo or vaccine. Via phone app, enrollees were asked to record any of seventeen symptoms including fatigue, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache. The second dose was expected to be more reactogentic than the first, so when I had a heavy arm for the following twenty-four hours, I suspected I had received more than the normal saline placebo. It wasn't until the unblinding visit that my suspicion was confirmed – I had received the trial vaccine. That visit was an unexpectedly emotional one since I had been a staunch advocate that our residents and fellows in training at our institution be prioritized to receive vaccines that were in scarce supply.

### Happy heart syndrome: role of positive emotional stress in Takotsubo syndrome [^bc6ee382]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

It is now generally accepted that one's emotional state plays a role in the overall health of the individual. Therefore, our findings may broaden the whole spectrum of the nature of this multifaceted disease. However, the exact consequences of psychological states and their manifestations in various clinical syndromes such as TTS have not been thoroughly explored. As such, the exact molecular pathways and functional anatomy of the central nervous system involved in emotional processing, which are likely to be responsible for their systemic effects, remain poorly understood.

Similarly, our knowledge regarding the involvement of the central nervous system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease remains insufficient. However, ample epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the central nervous system indeed plays a prominent role in cardiovascular disease. Earlier imaging studies have revealed activation of specific cortical and subcortical areas of the brain associated with distinct emotional processingsuch as extended activation in both temporal lobes during certain emotions including happiness, sadness, and fear, but not during disgust or anger.Subcortical structures including the amygdala, hippocampus, and basal ganglia have also been implicated in emotional processing. The amygdala is not only associated with negative emotions but has been recently also implicated in the processing of pleasant emotions such as happiness.

Given that the prevalence of the ‘ happy heart syndrome ’ is only 1.1% among all TTS cases, ‘ happy ’ events may necessitate more potent stimuli to induce a substantial emotional response than negative emotions. Perhaps the threshold to influence the cardiovascular system is higher when happy events are processed. Alternatively, this might be simply explained by the propensity of certain individuals to emotional events. At this point, given the lack of data, we cannot speculate if individuals with preceding happy events developing TTS would have suffered similar consequence with preceding negative emotions. Therefore, it is plausible that the individual's brain biochemistry, processing, and response to emotions are distinct and can explain this observed phenomenon.

### About heart attack symptoms, risk, and recovery (...) [^6213cc51]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t get enough blood.
- Coronary artery disease is the main cause of heart attack. What it is A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease is the main cause of heart attack. A less common cause is a severe spasm, or sudden contraction, of a coronary artery that can stop blood flow to the heart muscle. Symptoms The major symptoms of a heart attack are:
- Chest pain or discomfort. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or that goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain.
- Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint.

You may also break into a cold sweat.
- Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back.
- Pain or discomfort in one or both arms or shoulders.
- Shortness of breath. This often comes along with chest discomfort, but shortness of breath also can happen before chest discomfort. Other symptoms of a heart attack could include unusual or unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. Women are more likely to have these other symptoms. Learn more about women and heart disease. In some cases, a heart attack requires cardiopulmonary resuscitation or an electrical shock to the heart to get the heart pumping again. Bystanders trained to use CPR or a defibrillator may be able to help until emergency medical personnel arrive. Remember, the chances of surviving a heart attack are better the sooner emergency treatment begins. What to do to recover after a heart attack If you've had a heart attack, your heart may be damaged.

This could affect your heart's rhythm and its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. You may also be at risk for another heart attack or conditions such as stroke, kidney disorders, and peripheral arterial disease.

### Heart failure subtypes and cardiomyopathies in women [^8754aaa8]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure affects over 2.6 million women and 3.4 million men in the United States with known sex differences in epidemiology, management, response to treatment, and outcomes across a wide spectrum of cardiomyopathies that include peripartum cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some of these sex-specific considerations are driven by the cellular effects of sex hormones on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, endothelial response to injury, vascular aging, and left ventricular remodeling. Other sex differences are perpetuated by implicit bias leading to undertreatment and underrepresentation in clinical trials. The goal of this narrative review is to comprehensively examine the existing literature over the last decade regarding sex differences in various heart failure syndromes from pathophysiological insights to clinical practice.

### Nitroglycerin transdermal system [^ef8646f8]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic Effects

The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the result of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.

No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward an increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary.

The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.

In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.

### The meaning of losing a child in older adults: a qualitative study [^edf76ecc]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Separation of a part of your body

According to most mothers, the child was likened to a part of the mother’s body, especially her heart and, thus, a part of the mother’s being had been separated from her by losing her child. This loss was described as a never-healed wound.

“My child was part of my body. Losing him was like a wound which never will be healed.” (P #11)

One of the participants likened the grief of losing their child to heartache. Many parents developed heart disease after this incident, which they attributed to grief caused by losing their child.

“It is really unbelievable. After losing my child, I felt that one part of my heart was removed or I had no heart at all. I didn't think I would be alive after he left. I'm suffering from heart disease after that. ” (P #5)

Searching for a positive meaning in losing a child

The parents of this study sought positive meanings in losing their child. Based on the experiences of the parents, positive meanings in losing a child included “liberation from worldly sufferings”, “joining the beauties”, “divine providence”, and “divine trial”. Finding this meaning was an incentive for them to continue living without their children.

Liberation from worldly sufferings

This subcategory emerged from the experiences of the participants whose child had died because of an incurable disease. For them, liberation from worldly sufferings meant relief from the pain and suffering their child was going through. These parents witnessed their children’s physical and mental pain during their illness, and believed that death had relieved them of these sufferings.

“I woke up at nights by the sound of her moaning; many nights she suffered until morning and got many nosebleeds. The memory of these still lingers in my mind. She left and was relieved of these pains.” (P #4)

The process of losing a child was formed in these parents over time and, thus, finding a meaning in this incidence helped parents to better cope with the loss of their child. Another participant stated: “I tell myself that he is now relieved of his suffering; he did not have a good life in this world; may he have a better one in the other world.” (P #8).

### European heart health survey 2019 [^ade91163]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Q6: Which of the following symptoms would prompt you to seek an appointment with your general practitioner (GP)?

In total, 93.7% of all respondents claim that having at least one of the symptoms of HVD would make them seek an appointment with their GP. Of the respondents, 76.5% would go to a GP if they experienced chest tightness/pain, 64.1% for abnormal heart beats, 57.8% for shortness of breath and 45.9% when feeling faint. Fewer people would visit a GP if they experienced symptoms not thought to be directly related to the heart, such as fatigue (26.2%), reduced physical activity (19.9%) and feeling older than their age (12.5%). Compared with younger people, elderly people stated more often that none of the symptoms would prompt them to see their GP (80+ years: 10.0%; 60‐64 years: 6.9%).

### Effects of exercise on physiological and psychological variables in cancer survivors [^75ee07d7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aerobic exercise on physiological and psychological function in patients rehabilitating from cancer treatment. A second purpose was to evaluate the differential effects of low- and moderate-intensity exercise on these variables.

Methods

Eighteen survivors of breast or colon cancer (15 female and 3 male, 40-65 yr of age) served as subjects. The subjects were matched by aerobic capacity and scores on a Quality of Life questionnaire, and then randomly assigned to a control, low- (25-35% heart rate reserve (HRR)), or a moderate- (40-50% HRR) intensity exercise group. The exercise groups performed lower-body aerobic exercise three times a week for 10 wk. After the exercise training, there were no statistically significant differences between the two exercise groups on any of the physiological variables. Therefore, the exercise groups were combined into one group for the final analysis.

Results

The results revealed statistically significant increases in aerobic capacity (P < 0.001) and lower-body flexibility (P = 0.027), a significant decrease in body fat (P < 0.001), and a significant increase in quality of life (P < 0.001) and a measure of energy (P = 0.038) in the exercise group when compared with the control group.

Conclusion

Low- and moderate-intensity aerobic-exercise programs were equally effective in improving physiological and psychological function in this population of cancer survivors. Aerobic exercise appears to be a valuable and well-tolerated component of the cancer-rehabilitation process.

### Nebivolol hydrochloride [^750de5ac]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Nebivolol has been evaluated for safety in patients with hypertension and in patients with heart failure. The observed adverse reaction profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients in the clinical trials. Adverse reactions reported for each of these patient populations are provided below. Excluded are adverse reactions considered too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population

The data described below reflect worldwide clinical trial exposure to nebivolol in 6545 patients, including 5038 patients treated for hypertension and the remaining 1507 subjects treated for other cardiovascular diseases. Doses ranged from 0.5 mg to 40 mg. Patients received nebivolol for up to 24 months, with over 1900 patients treated for at least 6 months, and approximately 1300 patients for more than one year.

HYPERTENSION: In placebo-controlled clinical trials comparing nebivolol with placebo, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was reported in 2.8% of patients treated with nebivolol and 2.2% of patients given placebo. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of nebivolol were headache (0.4%), nausea (0.2%) and bradycardia (0.2%).

Table 1 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that were reported in three 12-week, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving 1597 hypertensive patients treated with either 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20-40 mg of nebivolol and 205 patients given placebo and for which the rate of occurrence was at least 1% of patients treated with nebivolol and greater than the rate for those treated with placebo in at least one dose group.

Listed below are other reported adverse reactions with an incidence of at least 1% in the more than 4300 patients treated with nebivolol in controlled or open-label trials except for those already appearing in Table 1, terms too general to be informative, minor symptoms, or adverse reactions unlikely to be attributable to drug because they are common in the population. These adverse reactions were in most cases observed at a similar frequency in placebo-treated patients in the controlled studies.

Body as a Whole: asthenia.

Gastrointestinal System Disorders: abdominal pain

Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hypercholesterolemia

Nervous System Disorders: paraesthesia

6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities

In controlled monotherapy trials of hypertensive patients, nebivolol was associated with an increase in BUN, uric acid, triglycerides and a decrease in HDL cholesterol and platelet count.

### Takotsubo syndrome: pathophysiological insights and innovations in patient care [^6bafc46b]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, was first described in Japan in the 1990s and presents as acute heart failure caused by transient contractile dysfunction that mimics acute coronary syndrome but is not caused by acute coronary obstruction. Takotsubo syndrome accounts for as much as 2-3% of suspected coronary syndromes and is considerably more common in women than in men. In this Review, we discuss the historical background and clinical features of Takotsubo syndrome and our evolving understanding of its pathophysiology. The hallmark feature of Takotsubo syndrome is transient left ventricular dysfunction linked to emotional or physical stressors. Despite advances in our understanding of the clinical presentation and possible pathophysiological mechanisms of Takotsubo syndrome, this condition continues to challenge our fundamental understanding of human anatomy and physiology, particularly regarding how acute emotional and physical stressors can trigger such profound cardiovascular dysfunction. Although the definitive mechanisms remain elusive, current hypotheses largely centre on catecholamine surges and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivation. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by the Mayo Clinic and European Society of Cardiology working groups but, in the absence of randomized controlled clinical trials, no specific treatments for Takotsubo syndrome are available. In this Review, we highlight the complex pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome, with an emphasis on the interplay between emotional stress and cardiac health, and call for the development of evidence-based management protocols.

### Deep abdominal breathing reduces heart rate and symptoms during orthostatic challenge in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^0c19c4ee]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study for the first time investigated the short‐term effect of a deep breathing technique on the symptoms and standing HR in POTS. Slow deep breathing could reduce the standing HR increase in patients with POTS. In addition to the increase, the breathing technique also resulted in a reduction of all absolute vital parameters while standing. The general reduction in mean HR and DBP is consistent with studies that have investigated breathing techniques in healthy subjects. These findings indicate an increase in parasympathetic tone, suggesting undisturbed functioning of neurocircuits modulating the ANS in this POTS cohort.

More important, however, was to demonstrate that participants experienced a subjective relief of symptomatology, especially shortness of breath and palpitations. Because palpitations are one of the most reported orthostatic symptoms, this may contribute to improved disease management and quality of life.

Several conceivable mechanisms, such as the activation of pulmonary stretch receptors and modulation of intravascular volume (respiratory pump), may interact to produce the positive effects of deep breathing, influencing the autonomic state and HR regulation. Moreover, standing induces stress for POTS patients, often leading to anxiety, whereas deep breathing may alleviate stress by engaging pulmonary and baroreceptor‐afferent neurons. Additionally, focusing on breath can divert attention from distressing thoughts, potentially reducing both stress and HR.

During the conduct of our study, Balban et al. published a paper on a randomized controlled trial that compared the psychophysiological effects of 5‐min daily practice of three different breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation over 1 month. The authors concluded that a daily 5‐min breathwork practice improves mood and physiological arousal and reduces respiratory rate in healthy individuals.

Given that the breathing technique is generally deemed safe but not entirely devoid of side effects, POTS patients should closely collaborate with their physicians when integrating it into their standing symptom management strategies. However, patients must receive thorough instruction, as improper implementation could potentially exacerbate symptoms. In summary, adopting the breathing technique may mitigate the sympathoneural response to upright posture and aid in symptom alleviation.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^1fbf9629]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

On 11 March, 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. It brought substantial physical and psychological burden on individuals and financial loss across countries. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chest pain, and abdominal pain, at 2–14 days after exposure to the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV-2). Pain symptoms present important challenge to clinicians’ diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms should be systematically summarized.

Results

The virus can invade different tissues of the body and cause different pain manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory system, and patients develop sore throat, fever, cough, and other pneumonia-associated symptoms. Moreover, it infects the nervous system (eg, headache, dizziness, and confusion), digestive system (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea), and cardiovascular system (eg, chest pain, palmus, and cardiac injury). The incidence rate is 1.7–33.9% for headache, 0.7–47.1% for sore throat, 1.5–61.0% for myalgia/arthralgia, 1.6–17.7% for chest pain, and 1.9–14.5% for abdominal pain. In comparison with chest and abdominal pain, COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop headache, sore throat, and myalgia/arthralgia.

Conclusion

Different pain reflects the damage of different body systems. Therefore, the summary of pain symptoms for COVID-19 patients can help doctors improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis when treating COVID-19 patients with atypical or mild symptoms and adopt more targeted treatment methods.

### Remodeling is at the heart of chromatin: the heartaches of chromatin [^eee9a43f]. Epigenetics (2011). Low credibility.

Chromatin modifications are integral elements of chromosome structure and its function and the vasculature depends on tissue-specific genome regulation for its development. A general concept for the de-regulation of chromatin modifications in cardiac and vascular disease is also emerging. The recognition that metabolic memory contributes to disease persistence highlights the benefit of early and aggressive treatment. As for the importance of memory, we do know that good metabolic control delays the onset of long-term diabetic complications. There are striking parallels between the timing of disease and the development of complications. Landmark multicenter clinical trials on diabetes patients have popularized the concept that glucose is also a demonstrable determinant for the development of complications, indicating the prolonged benefit of intensive therapy and the lasting damage of conventional therapy. Each cell type experiences thousands of modifications to the epigenome in response to environmental changes it is exposed to. Therefore, history is neither lost nor forgotten and previous experiences and exposure may form future memories. There is now a strong resurgence in research trying to understand gene-environment interactions and to determine what commits specific vascular cell types to specific memories. Recent insights show that cardiac gene expression is distinguished by specific chromatin remodeling events and histone modifications that are associated with heart disease.

### Women's views on overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening: a qualitative study [^0913c6ab]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Reactions to learning about overdiagnosis

For some women, learning about overdiagnosis prompted concern about the implications in terms of the undesirable psychological and physical consequences of experiencing a cancer diagnosis and enduring treatment unnecessarily:

“It could cause a lot of unnecessary stress and heartache to the person.” (Participant 42, age 72, 3 screens)
“So you have to go through all the rigmarole of chemotherapy, radiation, all that sort of thing, and it may not have been necessary, and those in themselves are hard to go through.” (Participant 09, age 45, 0 screens).

In contrast, a few women reacted quite defensively to the concept of overdiagnosis or questioned why it mattered. They disagreed with the notion that it could be considered a bad outcome to find a cancer and have treatment that was ultimately not needed. These women perceived “overdetection” as a value laden term, labelling the phenomenon as negative without real justification. There was also some concern about the potential to upset women who had previously accepted invitations to screening:

“I think the terms ‘overtreatment’ and ‘overdiagnosis’ are negative, they’re loaded terms, and I don’t think it’s a necessarily negative occurrence. Whatever kind of cancer it is—from vanilla nothing through to instant killer—finding that, can that be a negative? I don’t think so.” (Participant 10, age 45, 1 screen)
“To me it’s not ‘over’. I don’t believe in ‘overservicing’. I think this is a terrible word to use because I think it’s a bullying word that people think they’ve been pushed into doing something that’s not relevant.” (Participant 05, age 43, 1 screen).

In several groups, women speculated about ulterior motives behind overdiagnosis research. For example, some wondered whether our presentation might be part of a government plan to reduce spending on breast screening, using overdiagnosis as justification:

### Happy heart syndrome: role of positive emotional stress in Takotsubo syndrome [^eb87f3f6]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the first description of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in 1990,evolving evidence suggests that TTS is typically precipitated by episodes of severe negative stress such as grief, anger, or fear. These negative emotional triggers have led to the popular term ‘ broken heart syndrome ’.It is well known that emotional distress may result in an overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and/or inappropriate parasympathetic withdrawal.As a consequence, the resulting cardiovascular effects may lead to life-threatening arrhythmias,TTS,and even sudden cardiac death. Wittstein et al. confirmed in a prospective study increased levels of circulating catecholamines in patients with TTS compared with those with Killip class III myocardial infarction,suggesting that in TTS, stressful events indeed affect the cardiovascular system via an over-activation of the sympathetic neurohormonal axis.

On the other hand, the role of positive emotions in TTS is far less clear. Positive emotions modulate the autonomic nervous system response to a similar degree as do negative emotions, which in turn alter heart rate, peripheral vascular resistance, and blood pressure.However, conflicting results exist on the impact of positive emotions on cardiovascular disease. In the long-term, positive emotions have been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,while others have shown that they can also provoke acute coronary syndrome.Of note, positive emotions can result not only in increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system but also in increased parasympathetic nervous system activity. Interestingly, the likelihood of experiencing a cardiovascular event on one's birthday is 27% higher than on any other day of the year.

The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of TTS in patients after preceding pleasant rather than unpleasant events. Furthermore, we intend to raise awareness and compare this new conceptual entity of ‘ happy heart syndrome ’ with ‘ broken heart syndrome ’.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (part II): diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^3af72318]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Future directions

Over recent years research has shown that TTS is a much more heterogeneous condition than previously thought. Originally believed to be a benign disease, studies have shown that TTS has morbidity and mortality rates that are comparable to those of ACS. TTS can affect many others aside from postmenopausal women with an emotional trigger,, as originally described, and can present as an atypical type rather than apical ballooning.Still, there is much more to be uncovered surrounding TTS and the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome.

Key questions

Many questions need further investigation: Why are women affected predominantly? What is the role of triggering factors in stress responses of the heart? Why do different TTS phenotypes exist? Which patients are vulnerable to TTS or prone to recurrence? Is there a genetic predisposition to TTS? What is the exact pathogenesis of TTS? Are there specific treatment options in the acute stage of this life-threatening syndrome or to prevent recurrence? Additional research needs to be conducted to answer these important questions.

Prospective approaches

The link between the brain and heart seems to play a key role in TTS. Additionally, studies on circulating miRNAs suggest there could be a genetic aspect to the pathophysiology of TTS, and the predominance of female patients suggests that TTS could be related to sex hormones and the endocrine system. Takotsubo syndrome is more than a cardiac disease, and it requires a new and interdisciplinary approach to increase awareness among not only cardiologists, but physicians at large. To establish evidence based strategies for effective TTS treatment, randomized prospective trials will be necessary utilizing a large number of patients from multicentre international consortia.

### Part 10: adult and pediatric special circumstances of resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^839927f5]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Hyperthermia—life-threatening hyperthermia (defined as a core temperature ≥40 °C [104 °F]) is a preventable cause of cardiac arrest with etiologies including exertional heatstroke, environmental exposure, and medication or drug overdose. Animal data suggests that temperature and duration are critical determinants of survival, and prolonged temperature elevation leads to multiorgan failure that resembles septic shock. Children are at higher risk of hyperthermia compared to adults because they have larger ratios of body surface area to body mass, increased metabolic heat production, ineffective sweat glands to dissipate heat, and young children cannot recognize or self-extract from hyperthermic environments. No randomized controlled trial (RCT) on cooling patients with hyperthermic cardiac arrest has been performed; as a result, recommendations are derived from adults with life-threatening hyperthermia and experimental models in human volunteers. The recommendations apply to both adults and children with exertional heatstroke, environmental exposure, and medication or drug overdose, while the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and sepsis is outside scope; separate sections address life-threatening cocaine and sympathomimetics poisoning, and these recommendations inform management of life-threatening hyperthermia, including cardiac arrest.

### Zolmitriptan [^ad1d5c43]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The most common side effects of zolmitriptan tablets are:

pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw
dizziness
tingling or other abnormal sensations
tiredness
drowsiness
feeling warm or cold
nausea
feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of  the body
dry mouth

In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan tablets:

severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw
shortness of breath or wheezing
sudden or severe stomach pain
hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling
problems seeing
unusual weakness or numbness

Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan tablets.

### Association of transportation noise with cardiovascular diseases [^b2322384]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 MECHANISM OF NOISE CAUSING CVD

According to Wolfgang Babisch's stress noise concept, there are two primary pathways by which noise exposure affects our health.These pathways are known as the “direct pathway” and the “indirect pathway.” The direct pathway involves exposure to very high decibel levels, typically exceeding 100 dB(A). In this case, noise at such extreme levels can directly damage the delicate structures of the ear, leading to hearing impairment or damage to the auditory organs. The indirect pathway, on the other hand, comes into play when noise levels are lower, typically falling in the range of 50–60 dB(A). In this scenario, noise disrupts various activities, including sleep and communication. This disturbance can trigger emotional stress responses in individuals, such as annoyance or even anger. These emotional responses are associated with physiological changes in the body, including an increase in cortisone levels (a stress hormone) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system (the “fight or flight” response). Over time, chronic stress responses resulting from noise exposure can contribute to the development of various cardiovascular risk factors.These risk factors include hypertension, elevated glucose and cholesterol levels, increased blood viscosity, and activation of the coagulation system. These risk factors are known contributors to CVD. In the long term, persistent stress responses to noise can lead to the development of CVD, including conditions like manifest hypertension, atherosclerosis, acute and chronic coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmia. Notably, acute exposure to nighttime noise‐related stress can even trigger a specific condition known as “stress cardiomyopathy” or “Takotsubo syndrome.” This condition is often referred to as “broken heart disease” because it can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack and is associated with extreme emotional stress.Figure 1 shows the stress signaling by noise and leading to CVDs.

### Takotsubo syndrome: stress or NO Stress? [^0542600e]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

In terms of advancing the understanding of TTS, the analysis here takes the story further than the initial insult and starts to address potential mechanisms for ongoing deficits in cardiac function. Inflammation is clearly key, but the persistence of this and of the possible edema will need to be explored in a more extensive time series study. In terms of potential therapeutic avenues, PARP-1 inhibition did show some benefit for systolic function, although incomplete. It will be important to know whether this is observed if the inhibitor is given after the isoproterenol, because the clinical presentation of TTS is usually some after the catecholamine surge. However, the lack of effect of PARP-1 inhibitor on the inflammatory state suggests that ongoing inflammation is a problem that may need to be addressed separately in the treatment of these patients.

### American heart month-February 2019 [^fd72cbe1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, and heart attacks are a major category of heart disease; someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds. February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to remind all adults to focus on their hearts and encourage them, their families, friends, and communities to learn the important signs and symptoms of heart attack and how to respond. Recognizing that someone might be having a heart attack and calling emergency services (9-1-1) are crucial for optimizing access to lifesaving emergency cardiac care and receipt of advanced treatments and improving survival. Five common symptoms of a heart attack are 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. If someone is suspected to be having a heart attack, 9-1-1 should be called immediately.

A report in this issue of MMWR shows that, although the percentage of persons who are aware of all five heart attack symptoms increased from 39.6% in 2008 to 50.2% in 2017, sociodemographic disparities existed. Education is needed to more widely disseminate information about how to recognize a possible heart attack and contact lifesaving emergency services.

NHIS is an annual survey that collects health-related information on the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. In 2008, 2014, and 2017, the survey asked questions about symptoms of a heart attack and the best action to take when someone was thought to be having a heart attack. Five yes/no questions assessed whether the respondent was aware of these five symptoms of heart attack: 1) pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck or back; 2) feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3) chest pain or discomfort; 4) pain or discomfort in the arms or shoulder; and 5) shortness of breath. Respondents were then asked, “If you thought someone was having a heart attack, what is the best thing to do right away?” The appropriate response was “Call 9-1-1” (or another emergency number). The total sample sizes were 21,781 (2008), 36,697 (2014), and 26,741 (2017). After excluding approximately 1% of respondents with missing information, the final analytic samples were 21,525 (2008), 36,289 (2014), and 26,480 (2017).

### Persistent long-term structural, functional, and metabolic changes after stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy [^d1e6ce08]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

A Gap in Knowledge

Overall, the data in this study fill an important gap of currently missing but much needed information for the appropriate clinical care of patients with takotsubo. Many descriptive studies have focused on the acute presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The invariable recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction has misled the medical community into believing that takotsubo cardiomyopathy is transient and self-limiting. Despite a well-recognized early mortality – and establishment of clinical features pointing to those at risk,, no data have described the physiological and clinical status of these patients long term. To the best of our knowledge, these data, which demonstrate that patients with takotsubo have symptoms and objective findings compatible with a heart failure syndrome, are unique and novel in the takotsubo literature. These findings should impact clinical practice primarily in the counseling and follow-up of such patients, and they should encourage further research into therapies to mitigate symptoms and improve prognosis.

### Long COVID: post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 with a cardiovascular focus [^118ab55b]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Emerging as a new epidemic, long COVID or post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a condition characterized by the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms beyond 3 months, is anticipated to substantially alter the lives of millions of people globally. Cardiopulmonary symptoms including chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and autonomic manifestations such as postural orthostatic tachycardia are common and associated with significant disability, heightened anxiety, and public awareness. A range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities has been reported among patients beyond the acute phase and include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. Pathophysiological mechanisms for delayed complications are still poorly understood, with a dissociation seen between ongoing symptoms and objective measures of cardiopulmonary health. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. In this review, we discuss the definition of long COVID and its epidemiology, with an emphasis on cardiopulmonary symptoms. We further review the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acute and chronic CV injury, the range of post-acute CV sequelae, and impact of COVID-19 on multiorgan health. We propose a possible model for referral of post-COVID-19 patients to cardiac services and discuss future directions including research priorities and clinical trials that are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of treatment strategies for long COVID and associated CV sequelae.

Hemodynamic Effects

In clinical studies, the majority of patients had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure within 45 minutes after administration of LEXISCAN. Maximum hemodynamic changes after LEXISCAN and ADENOSCAN in Studies 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 5.

Table 5 Hemodynamic Effects in Studies 1 and 2

Hemodynamic Effects Following Inadequate Exercise

In a clinical study, LEXISCAN was administered for MPI following inadequate exercise stress. More patients with LEXISCAN administration three minutes following inadequate exercise stress had an increase in heart rate and a decrease in systolic blood pressure compared with LEXISCAN administered at rest. The changes were not associated with any clinically significant adverse reactions. Maximum hemodynamic changes are presented in Table 6.

Table 6 Hemodynamic Effects in Inadequate Exercise Stress Study

Respiratory Effects

The A2B and A3 adenosine receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of bronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals (i.e., asthmatics). In in vitro studies, regadenoson has not been shown to have appreciable binding affinity for the A2B and A3 adenosine receptors.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 999 patients with a diagnosis, or risk factors for, coronary artery disease and concurrent asthma or COPD, the incidence of respiratory adverse reactions (dyspnea, wheezing) was greater with LEXISCAN compared to placebo. Moderate (2.5%) or severe (< 1%) respiratory reactions were observed more frequently in the LEXISCAN group compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6- 6.1)].

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular history—angina data elements and definitions specify criteria and permissible values for typical angina, atypical angina, anginal equivalent, and angina grade. Typical angina is defined as “1) Substernal chest discomfort with a characteristic quality and duration that is 2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress and 3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerin,” with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. Atypical angina “Meets 2 of these characteristics: 1) Substernal chest discomfort with a characteristic quality and duration that is 2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress and 3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerin,” with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown. An anginal equivalent is described as “Symptom such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, extreme fatigue, ventricular arrhythmias, or pain at a site other than the chest, occurring in a patient at high cardiac risk. Anginal equivalents have the same importance as angina pectoris,” with permissible values Yes, No, or Unknown; an additional note states “Anginal equivalents are considered symptoms of myocardial ischemia.” Angina grade requests grading “symptoms or signs in patients with suspected or presumed stable angina (or angina equivalent) according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading scale” with permissible values Class 0, Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV, or Unknown; an additional note says “Both preprocedure and postprocedure grading Canadian Cardiovascular Society class can be collected.”

### Troponin elevation after ischemic stroke and future cardiovascular risk: is the heart in the right place? [^9e84501d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Our understanding of the intricate relationship between the heart and the brain has evolved beyond the prevailing paradigm where cardiac mechanisms cause brain injury, to now include a bidirectional interaction, where an acute derangement of one organ system adversely affects the other. Acute brain injury in the form of an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is a trigger for myocardial injury, often referred to as neurocardiogenic syndromes, which can range from asymptomatic troponin elevations to symptomatic myocardial ischemic injury, and even symptomatic heart failure such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 1 Large case series evaluating factors associated with neurocardiogenic syndromes have implicated stroke severity and location of the infarct as key factors. 2 Additionally, myocardial injury portends poor outcomes, and is independently associated with severe disability and death after stroke. 3 Given that neurocardiogenic syndromes encompass a wide range of cardiac abnormalities, it is unclear if each subtype adversely affects stroke outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that one neurocardiogenic syndrome, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, results in both, a short‐ and long‐term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, ischemic stroke, and death, regardless of the inciting trigger. 4 However, whether troponin elevation also results in a similarly higher risk of future cardiovascular events is poorly studied.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline—symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use “cardiac,” “possible cardiac,” and “noncardiac” to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

### Emotional triggers of acute coronary syndromes: strength of evidence, biological processes, and clinical implications [^52ab9ca2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Emotional triggers of acute coronary syndromes include population-level events such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks, and individual experiences of acute anger, stress and depression. The methodology of studying emotional triggers has developed markedly over recent years, though limitations remain. The biological processes underlying triggering include acute autonomic dysregulation, neuroendocrine activation, hemostatic and inflammatory responses which, when associated with plaque disruption, promote myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmia and thrombosis formation. Prevention and management strategies for ameliorating emotional triggering remain to be effectively developed.

### Acute stress induces long-term metabolic, functional, and structural remodeling of the heart [^8761d7ea]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-induced cardiovascular disease with symptoms comparable to those of an acute coronary syndrome but without coronary obstruction. Takotsubo was initially considered spontaneously reversible, but epidemiological studies revealed significant long-term morbidity and mortality, the reason for which is unknown. Here, we show in a female rodent model that a single pharmacological challenge creates a stress-induced cardiomyopathy similar to Takotsubo. The acute response involves changes in blood and tissue biomarkers and in cardiac in vivo imaging acquired with ultrasound, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. Longitudinal follow up using in vivo imaging, histochemistry, protein and proteomics analyses evidences a continued metabolic reprogramming of the heart towards metabolic malfunction, eventually leading to irreversible damage in cardiac function and structure. The results combat the supposed reversibility of Takotsubo, point to dysregulation of glucose metabolic pathways as a main cause of long-term cardiac disease and support early therapeutic management of Takotsubo.

Typical patterns of symptom presentation in women describe differences in symptom triggers and descriptors compared with men; the most common presentation of myocardial ischemia is chest pain or discomfort; however, women have a different pattern and distribution of non–chest-related pain symptoms, and women’s ischemic symptoms are more often precipitated by mental or emotional stress and less frequently by physical exertion; proportionately, women more often report epigastric discomfort and associated nausea; radiation of discomfort to the arms, neck, and interscapular areas; and dyspnea and fatigue; studies have not found a pattern of symptoms uniquely ascribed to either sex, but significant overlap in qualitative descriptors exists, and the evidence synthesis highlights that women experience a broad range of symptoms, frequently including recent and stress-related symptoms.

Heat and cold illness in travelers—heat acclimatization: Heat acclimatization, a process of physiologic adaptation that occurs in residents of and visitors to hot environments, is highly effective at decreasing the impact of heat stress and reducing heat illness, resulting in increased thermal tolerance, improved muscle and cardiac function with decreased energy expenditure and lower rise in body temperature for a given work load, and enhanced skin blood flow and sweating response. Only partial adaptation occurs from passive exposure to heat. Full acclimatization, especially cardiovascular, requires 1–2 hours of exercise in the heat each day, with a suitable amount of daily exercise leading to most acclimatization changes within 10 days, and decay of acclimatization occurring within days to weeks if there is no heat exposure.

Iron is an essential element in biological systems because of its ability to shuttle between 2 oxidative states and plays a key role in cell metabolism and homeostasis. 1 Excess iron (iron overload) or lack of iron (iron deficiency) are the 2 major pathophysiological states of abnormal iron metabolism. 2, 3 Under physiological conditions, iron transport is highly conserved and controlled by iron transporters including transferrin and its receptors via negative feedback regulatory mechanisms. 4 However, in primary hemochromatosis and secondary iron overload, iron metabolism is perturbed, which leads to chronic iron overload and increased morbidity and mortality. 3, 5 Iron‐overload cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of mortality in patients with secondary iron overload and is a major comorbidity in patients with primary hemochromatosis. 5, 6, 7, 8 Uncontrolled iron absorption causes transferrin saturation and increased levels of non‐transferrin‐bound iron, which is highly reactive, toxic, and triggers oxidative stress. 6 Iron‐induced oxidative stress is a key driver in the pathogenesis of myocardial tissue injury and progressive development of iron‐overload cardiomyopathy. 7, 9, 10 Excess iron promotes oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction, which plays a key pathogenic role in myocardial injury and heart failure. 9, 11, 12, 13

Sex‐related differences do exist in the pathophysiology of cardiac diseases, and sex‐specific pathways play a key role in the cardioprotection observed in cardiomyopathies and heart failure in preclinical models and patients. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Estrogen has several beneficial pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. 14, 20, 21 Functional estrogen receptors are expressed in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, 22 and via the activation of these receptors, β‐estradiol attenuates cardiac hypertrophy, metabolic dysregulation, and cardiac apoptosis. 14, 19, 23, 24 In contrast, lack of estrogen leads to adverse myocardial remodeling and precipitates heart failure. 14, 19, 25 Sex‐related disparities in the regulation of iron metabolism may contribute to the differences in progression of iron‐overload heart disease. 26, 27 Moreover, women have lower iron stores, which have been argued to confer protection in an iron‐overloaded state. 28, 29 In this study we investigated the sex‐specific differences and mechanisms of iron‐overload cardiomyopathy.

### Happy heart syndrome: role of positive emotional stress in Takotsubo syndrome [^7ce18e19]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This novel observation of pleasant emotional stressors in triggering TTS may lead to a paradigm shift in clinical practice by raising awareness among physicians. While the role of negative life events such as anger, grief, or physical stressors in provoking TTS is acknowledged, the association between positive emotions and TTS is not commonly recognized. Therefore, our findings further expose the multifaceted nature of this disease and broaden the spectrum of triggers associated with this fascinating disease.

Furthermore, we believe that TTS is a classic example of a complex intertwined feedback loop encompassing psychological and/or physical stimuli within the brain that subsequently impact the cardiovascular system. Perhaps, both happy and sad life events, while inherently distinct in nature, share a final common pathway in the central nervous system processing and output, which can ultimately trigger TTS. Clearly, future research is warranted to investigate this possibility and delineate the exact mechanisms underlying both ‘ broken ’ and ‘ happy ’ heart variants of TTS.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^b0b40e32]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM expert consensus—exertional heat exhaustion (EHE) is defined as the inability to sustain required cardiac output and blood pressure to continue activity due to high skin blood flow requirements and/or dehydration, with body temperature usually <40°C; EHE usually has no chronic health effects and after cooling and resuming fluid–electrolyte balance most athletes and laborers can return to activity in 1 to 2 d, but people with repeated episodes of EHE in a 24-month span should have a thorough medical evaluation.

Methods

Study setting

This study was performed in three districts of the Kilimanjaro Region in northern Tanzania: Moshi Urban District (population 184,289), Moshi Rural District (population 466,740), and Hai District (population 210,531). The local prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors is high, including an estimated 28% prevalence of hypertension and 22% prevalence of glucose impairment among adults.The predominant local tribe is Chagga.

Participant selection

Within the study area, 60 sub-districts were selected randomly in a population-weighted fashion, with proportionate selection of urban and rural settings. Twelve points were randomly generated within each selected sub-district using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS, v2.18.7). The global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of each selected point was recorded and then visited on foot by the study team. The closest home to each selected point was approached for inclusion in the study. If no eligible respondent was available to participate in the survey, then the next nearest dwelling was approached. Only self-identified healthcare decision makers for the household were eligible to participate in the survey. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Survey translation

Survey questions were independently translated into Swahili and back-translated into English by two research assistants who were fluent in both languages in order to confirm fidelity to the essence of the question and to flag any potential ambiguity. Because “heart attack” can be a nebulous term, we piloted several word choice options with 15 Tanzanians with both medical and non-medical backgrounds, who were in unanimous agreement that the appropriate term in Swahili is “ mshituko wa moyo.” This term corresponds to the biomedical English term “heart attack,” and it does not have alternate psychosocial connotations such as heartbreak, heartache, or sudden fright. The full survey was piloted with 20 Tanzanians in both urban and rural settings to ensure content clarity and fidelity prior to study initiation.

Causes of elevated or lower natriuretic peptide levels—Other than a primary diagnosis of HF, cardiovascular causes include acute coronary syndrome, MI; pulmonary embolism; myocarditis; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; valvular heart disease; congenital heart disease; atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; heart contusion, cardiac infiltration or malignancy; cardioversion, ICD shock; pericardial disease; invasive or surgical procedures involving the heart; pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure; and infiltrative cardiomyopathies. Noncardiovascular causes include advanced age, kidney disease, critical illnesses including sepsis syndrome and cytokine syndrome, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary disease (pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), liver disease, severe anemia, and severe metabolic and hormone abnormalities (eg, thyrotoxicosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns). Causes of lower natriuretic peptide levels include obesity or increased BMI and pericardial disease, with the note that in certain patients with pericardial disease and effusion, natriuretic peptides may be lower and increase after pericardiocentesis.

### Takotsubo syndrome and emotional stress: a heuristic approach [^e580ca14]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

While acute and reversible coronary syndrome without anatomical damage, called TakoTsubo syndrome, has been repeatedly associated with emotional stress, the specific categories of stressors have been ill-defined. Following a review of variously described emotional stressors associated with that specific cardiomyopathy, a clinical report is presented to raise two issues: the overlap of biological risk factors with emotional stress and the interplay of acute and subacute emotional stressors.

### Stress and cardiovascular disease [^be637324]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The physiological reaction to psychological stress, involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenomedullary axes, is well characterized, but its link to cardiovascular disease risk is not well understood. Epidemiological data show that chronic stress predicts the occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD). Employees who experience work-related stress and individuals who are socially isolated or lonely have an increased risk of a first CHD event. In addition, short-term emotional stress can act as a trigger of cardiac events among individuals with advanced atherosclerosis. A stress-specific coronary syndrome, known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning cardiomyopathy or stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy, also exists. Among patients with CHD, acute psychological stress has been shown to induce transient myocardial ischemia and long-term stress can increase the risk of recurrent CHD events and mortality. Applications of the 'stress concept' (the understanding of stress as a risk factor and the use of stress management) in the clinical settings have been relatively limited, although the importance of stress management is highlighted in European guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention.
