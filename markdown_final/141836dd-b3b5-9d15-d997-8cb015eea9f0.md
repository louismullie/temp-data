## Question

Aeromonas

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Aeromonas infections, including epidemiology, clinical syndromes, risk factors, diagnostics, treatment, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's taxonomy and ecology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology across populations and geographies. Next, I will examine clinical syndromes and severity determinants. After that, I need to check diagnostic pitfalls and recommended testing. Then, I will review antimicrobial susceptibility and treatment algorithms, including special scenarios. Finally, I should consider prevention, public health implications, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and ecology. Aeromonas species are gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods commonly found in freshwater, brackish water, soil, and chlorinated drinking water, with peak abundance in warmer months; clinically relevant species include A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. veronii biovar sobria, and increasingly recognized A. dhakensis, which can carry virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes that complicate management [^bebcd3c9] [^e683cd73] [^fe3d1789].

> I need to check the epidemiology in children with diarrhea. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses converge on a pooled global prevalence of Aeromonas in pediatric diarrheal illness around 4.2% (95% CI 3.1–5.6%), with higher burdens in upper-middle-income countries, densely populated regions, and settings with poor water and sanitation; importantly, prevalence appears to be declining over time, likely reflecting improved infrastructure and hygiene [^6f6c53a6] [^0629861b] [^e32717e9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should verify the strength of association. In the GEMS case-control study across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, Aeromonas was significantly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea even after adjustment for coinfections and sociodemographics, with dysentery more common in infants and strong links to stunting, supporting pathogenicity in certain contexts [^d844fe71] [^34d8c1bb].

> Next, I should review extraintestinal disease. Aeromonas causes skin and soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, abscesses, and necrotizing infections, often after freshwater exposure or trauma; it also causes bacteremia, hepatobiliary infections such as cholangitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis, and rare entities like brain abscess, osteomyelitis, and peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, with mortality higher in immunocompromised hosts and those with septic shock [^fe3d1789] [^919e7bcc] [^c67c1d69] [^2005026e] [^7b4d4a2a] [^9dd049d7].

> Wait, let me verify risk modifiers. Diabetes, malignancy, cirrhosis, and immunosuppression increase risk of invasive disease; burns and freshwater trauma are classic precipitants; seasonal clustering occurs in warmer months; and leech therapy is a well-described iatrogenic source of A. hydrophila infection, occasionally with ciprofloxacin resistance, which matters for prophylaxis and treatment choices [^fe3d1789] [^c67c1d69] [^d954e1bf] [^c730e7f4].

> I will now examine diagnostics. Routine stool cultures may miss Aeromonas because it is not a standard target; selective media like ampicillin-containing agar or CIN agar improve yield, and molecular methods can enhance detection in research or outbreak settings; for extraintestinal disease, obtain blood cultures and tissue or wound cultures, and consider NAATs where available, recognizing that many clinical labs still rely on phenotypic identification with variable species-level accuracy [^e0b82587] [^48b674a7] [^3c349d1c].

> Hold on, I should verify antimicrobial susceptibility patterns before recommending therapy. Aeromonas is consistently resistant to ampicillin and often to first- and second-generation cephalosporins; susceptibility is generally good to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides, but rising resistance to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam has been documented, including chromosomal and plasmid-encoded carbapenemases, so local antibiograms are essential [^fe3d1789] [^3c349d1c].

> Let me think about gastroenteritis management. Most cases are self-limited; rehydration is first-line, and antibiotics are reserved for severe, dysenteric, or persistent disease, with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins reasonable choices guided by susceptibility; IDSA guidance emphasizes avoiding empiric antibiotics in persistent watery diarrhea without a defined pathogen, except in severely immunocompromised hosts, which tempers overtreatment [^f3116689] [^4c9d215a].

> For skin and soft tissue infections, I should confirm empiric regimens. In suspected Aeromonas from freshwater exposure, combine a tetracycline (doxycycline) with either a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or ceftazidime); if necrotizing infection is suspected, add broad gram-positive coverage for MRSA and streptococci, and proceed to urgent surgical debridement without delay, as outcomes hinge on early source control [^642026d5] [^de8b1ac2] [^88d0a0dd] [^749ede80].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or a child. I should double-check safety. In pregnancy, beta-lactams are preferred; if a fluoroquinolone is unavoidable in life-threatening infection, ciprofloxacin has the most safety data, though use is generally avoided in children; pediatric dosing for levofloxacin may be used in severe cases with careful risk–benefit assessment, and surgical consultation should not be delayed for imaging or observation in suspected necrotizing disease [^88d90fb3] [^982532d9].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, Aeromonas should be considered, especially with diarrheal episodes in warm months; in peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, prompt intraperitoneal and systemic therapy with agents active against Aeromonas is indicated, and catheter issues may necessitate removal; in leech-associated infections, ciprofloxacin resistance is increasingly reported, so consider third-generation cephalosporins or piperacillin-tazobactam based on local patterns [^c67c1d69] [^9dd049d7] [^d954e1bf].

> Next, I should review prevention and public health. Improving water and sanitation infrastructure correlates with declining pediatric prevalence; travelers should avoid unsafe water and raw foods; after freshwater exposure, promptly cleanse and monitor wounds; in burn care, avoid immersion in nonsterile water; and in leech therapy, use prophylactic antibiotics with awareness of local resistance, adjusting as susceptibilities evolve [^6f6c53a6] [^c77fe5fc] [^6d5cddfb] [^d954e1bf].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical synthesis. Aeromonas is a water-associated pathogen with a broad clinical spectrum; in children, it accounts for a meaningful fraction of diarrheal disease where water quality is poor, while in adults it is a key cause of severe soft tissue infection after freshwater trauma; diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and appropriate cultures, and treatment hinges on early source control for invasive disease and judicious, susceptibility-guided antibiotics, with rising resistance necessitating local antibiogram-informed choices and stewardship [^fe3d1789] [^3c349d1c] [^642026d5].

Aeromonas species are **gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods** [^bebcd3c9] found in freshwater and brackish environments, and are a recognized cause of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans [^bebcd3c9]. The most clinically significant species are **A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria** [^e683cd73], which can cause watery or dysenteric diarrhea, wound infections, and bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^fe3d1789]. Diagnosis relies on **culture with selective media** [^e0b82587] and susceptibility testing, as resistance patterns vary and ampicillin is consistently ineffective [^c38b8ed9]. Empiric therapy for severe infections should include a **third-generation cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone** [^4c9d215a], with doxycycline plus ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime for necrotizing soft tissue infections [^642026d5]; early surgical intervention is critical for necrotizing disease [^88d0a0dd]. Prevention focuses on safe water practices, prompt wound care after freshwater exposure, and avoiding raw or undercooked seafood [^c77fe5fc].

---

## Microbiological characteristics

- **Morphology**: Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rods; motile via polar flagella [^bebcd3c9].
- **Growth**: Facultative anaerobes; grow on standard media, with enhanced recovery on selective media (e.g. ampicillin-containing agar) [^e0b82587].
- **Virulence factors**: Multiple, including aerolysin, hemolysins, enterotoxins, proteases, lipases, and type III secretion system effectors [^fe3d1789] [^49547804].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Aeromonas causes both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal disease, with severity influenced by host factors and exposure [^fe3d1789].

| **Clinical syndrome** | **Features and risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Gastroenteritis | - Watery or dysenteric diarrhea <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - Often self-limited; severe in immunocompromised hosts [^c393a434] [^d844fe71] |
| Wound infections | - Cellulitis <br/> - Abscesses <br/> - Necrotizing soft tissue infections <br/> - Associated with freshwater exposure or trauma [^be49dc8f] [^e5080ae6] |
| Bacteremia | - Often polymicrobial <br/> - Associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients [^5b6c1aff] [^fe3d1789] |
| Hepatobiliary infections | - Cholangitis <br/> - Hepatic abscesses <br/> - Associated with biliary obstruction or immunosuppression [^919e7bcc] |
| Other infections | - Endocarditis <br/> - Meningitis <br/> - Osteomyelitis <br/> - Peritonitis (including PD-related) <br/> - Rare but reported [^6a4d622b] [^7b4d4a2a] |

---

## Epidemiology

- **Environmental distribution**: Ubiquitous in freshwater, brackish water, and chlorinated drinking water; peaks in warm months [^e683cd73].
- **Human exposure**: Recreational water activities, trauma, consumption of contaminated water or seafood, and leech therapy [^be49dc8f] [^d954e1bf].
- **Risk factors**: Immunocompromise, liver disease, diabetes, malignancy, and chronic renal failure [^fe3d1789] [^c67c1d69].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Culture**: Gold standard; use selective media (e.g. ampicillin-containing agar) and standard biochemical identification [^e0b82587].
- **MALDI-TOF**: Useful for species-level identification but may misidentify some species [^3c349d1c].
- **Molecular methods**: PCR can detect virulence genes but is not routinely available [^011aed1b].
- **Blood cultures**: Recommended for severe or systemic infections [^48b674a7].

---

## Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance

- **Consistent resistance**: Ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins [^c38b8ed9].
- **Variable resistance**: Chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^c38b8ed9].
- **Generally active**: Third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides [^ea4933b6] [^fe3d1789].
- **Emerging resistance**: Carbapenemases (e.g. blaKPC, blaNDM) and colistin resistance (mcr-3) reported [^fe3d1789] [^3c349d1c].

---

## Treatment guidelines

- **Gastroenteritis**: Supportive care; antibiotics for severe, persistent, or immunocompromised cases (e.g. fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin) [^e1a6f105] [^4c9d215a].
- **Wound infections**: Early surgical debridement; empiric antibiotics covering gram-negative rods (e.g. ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone) [^642026d5] [^e5080ae6].
- **Necrotizing soft tissue infections**: Doxycycline plus ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime; urgent surgical intervention is critical [^642026d5] [^88d0a0dd].
- **Bacteremia**: Empiric third-generation cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone; adjust based on susceptibilities [^4c9d215a].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **safe water practices** — avoiding contaminated freshwater, using proper chlorination, and maintaining sanitation — and on **prompt wound care** after freshwater exposure, including thorough cleaning, debridement, and prophylactic antibiotics for high-risk patients. Travelers should avoid raw or undercooked seafood and untreated water, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for Aeromonas in immunocompromised hosts or after freshwater exposure [^c77fe5fc] [^e5080ae6].

---

Aeromonas species are **important water-associated pathogens** causing gastrointestinal and extraintestinal infections, with severity modulated by host factors. Accurate diagnosis and timely, susceptibility-guided therapy — including early surgery for necrotizing disease — are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^fe3d1789].

### An estimation of global Aeromonas infection prevalence in children with diarrhoea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7cdf4b01]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoeal diseases remain a serious worldwide problem among young children. In 2016, diarrhoea was the fifth main cause of fatality among children younger than 5 years, approximately 27% of diarrhoeal deaths occurred among children. Some causes of diarrhoea involve infection by bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other non-infectious causes. Bacteria are responsible for 20–40% of diarrhoea diseases, and various bacterial pathogens have been mostly attributed to diarrhoea episodes, including Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp. Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Plesiomonas spp, and Aeromonas spp. The rank of Aeromonas vary from first to fifth among enteropathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhoea. Childhood diarrhoea is most often caused by Aeromonas species and in bacteremia disseminated from gastrointestinal tract have mortality rates of 30–70%. Diarrhoea is the common manifestation of Aeromonas infection. Aeromonas has also been related to a variety of extraintestinal presentations. Aeromonas -associated diarrhoeal is defined as the leading cause of mortality with 1.0 cases per 100,000. Symptoms of Aeromonas related diarrhoea are quietly changeable, consistency of stool varied from watery to loose to bloody; and diarrhoea is either self-limited, tolerable to one week, or elongated up to two weeks, or become chronic with more than one month period. It is noteworthy that 2,195 children die due to diarrhoea every day, more than malaria, AIDS, and measles combined worldwide. Several investigations have been conducted in many parts of the world at several times to record the prevalence of Aeromonas genus. Anyway, briefed prevalence information of this bacterial disease in diarrhoea children worldwide is needed. Accordingly, the existing study is the first of its kind to specify the pooled prevalence of Aeromons in diarrhoea children on a global scale.

Aeromonas species are rarely an identified cause of folliculitis. Here, we describe the case of a patient who had purulent folliculitis of the breast caused by an Aeromonas species and review 4 other cases presented in the literature, highlighting the commonalities observed. Aeromonas infection should be considered in patients who present with purulent folliculitis, particularly those with exposure to nonchlorinated pools or baths.

### Aeromonas species: an opportunistic enteropathogen in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases? A single center cohort study [^ec9b03ef]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of Aeromonas species as an enteropathogen in patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still debated. The aim was to explore the significance of positive Aeromonas stool cultures in IBD and patients without IBD.

Methods

Observational retrospective study including all patients with a stool culture positive for Aeromonas between January 2011 and October 2013 at the Leuven University Hospitals. Demographics, clinical, and endoscopic outcomes and laboratory results were analyzed.

Results

A total of 77 patients (11 IBD) were identified. In 37 cases, Aeromonas caused a mild self-limited gastrointestinal infection. Among the 40 patients needing antibiotics, 22 presented a mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal infection; 4 suffered from extraintestinal complications; and 4 were coinfected by Campylobacter spp. A. veronii caused more frequently severe infection than the other species (25% versus 5%; P = 0.046). In 2 patients with ulcerative colitis, Aeromonas triggered a moderate-to-severe flare and 2 cases appeared in the context of de novo Crohn's disease. In contrast, in 1 patient with ulcerative colitis and 2 patients with Crohn's disease, Aeromonas caused a mild gastrointestinal infection not worsening the disease activity and in 4 patients with Crohn's disease, it presented in the context of active disease with no clear pathogenic role. Patients with IBD were treated more often with antibiotics (82 versus 41%, P = 0.012) and had more complications (46 versus 14%, P = 0.024).

Conclusions

Aeromonas caused mostly mild infections but also moderate and severe infections. A. veronii was more prevalent in patients with IBD and was associated with worse clinical outcomes. Aeromonas caused milder infections in patients without IBD. Other risk factors for severe infection were not found.

### Clinical presentation, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment outcomes of Aeromonas human infections: a 14-year retrospective study and comparative genomics of 2 isolates from fatal cases [^fe3d1789]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Aeromonas virulence may not be entirely dependent on the host's immune status. Pathophysiologic determinants of disease progression and severity remain unclear.

Methods

One hundred five patients with Aeromonas infections and 112 isolates were identified, their clinical presentations and outcomes were analyzed, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns were assessed. Two isolates (A and B) from fatal cases of Aeromonas dhakensis bacteremia were characterized using whole-genome sequencing. Virulence factor- and AMR-encoding genes from these isolates were compared with a well-characterized diarrheal isolate A. dhakensis SSU and environmental isolate Aeromonas hydrophila American Type Culture Collection_7966T.

Results

Skin and soft tissue infections, traumatic wound infections, sepsis, burns, and intraabdominal infections were common. Diabetes, malignancy, and cirrhosis were frequent comorbidities. Male sex, age ≥ 65 years, hospitalization, burns, and intensive care admission were associated with complicated disease. High rates of AMR to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were found. Treatment failure was observed in 25.7% of cases. Septic shock and hospital-acquired infections were predictors of treatment failure. All 4 isolates harbored assorted broad-spectrum AMR genes including blaOXA, ampC, cphA, and efflux pumps. Only clinical isolates possessed both polar and lateral flagellar genes, genes for various surface adhesion proteins, type 3 and 6 secretion systems and their effectors, and toxin genes, including exotoxin A. Both isolates A and B were resistant to colistin and harbored the mobile colistin resistance-3 (mcr-3) gene.

Conclusions

Empirical therapy tailored to local antibiograms may facilitate favorable outcomes, while advanced diagnostic methods may aid in identifying correct Aeromonas spp. of significant clinical importance.

### Rapidly progressive soft tissue infection of the upper extremity with Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria [^e5080ae6]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Aeromonas veronii, a bacterium found in freshwater, is an unusual pathogen in healthy patients. We present a case report of a rare, aggressive subtype in a young, immunocompetent individual. History of injury in an aquatic environment and culture data are key for identification of the causal agent and should dictate acute clinical management and antibiotic therapy. Coverage should include cephalosporins, quinolones, or sulfas if Aeromonas is suspected, and adjusted depending on culture and sensitivity. Early surgical exploration, incision and drainage, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are the cornerstones for successful treatment of these aggressive, sometimes life-threatening infections.

### Pancreatic abscess due to Aeromonas hydrophila [^b7943253]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Aeromonas hydrophila is an uncommon cause of deep-seated infection in man. We present what we believe to be the first reported case of a pancreatic abscess due to A. hydrophila. The outcome of this case attests to the potentially lethal nature of infection that can occur with this organism.

### The patient presenting with acute dysentery – a systematic review [^9d912d76]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of literature published between January 2000 and June 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific dysentery.

Results

Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is potentially important in industrialized countries. Entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. Clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect Vibrio spp. Aeromonas spp. Plesiomonas spp. Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium difficile, Cytomegalovirus or Schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. A single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis.

Conclusions

While a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than STEC, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this review.

### A fatal case of necrotizing Aeromonas schubertii fasciitis after penetrating injury [^455db16f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon but life-threatening condition with a high associated mortality and morbidity. Most infections are polymicrobial, another distinct form of necrotizing fasciitis that occurred by penetrating freshwater trauma, such as fishing or wading in wet fields. Aeromonas species are responsible. The rapidity of the infectious process is similar to that of clostridial infection, but gas production is not a consistent feature. We report a patient who presented with fever, chills, and bullae on left forearm, despite antibiotics and wound debridement; the infection extend to mid humerus with a rapid onset of skin necrosis and progressive sepsis. Aeromonas schubertii fasciitis is particularly virulent. An apparent superficial cellulitis that fails to respond to standard therapy must raise suspicion of a more extensive underlying subcutaneous infection. Aggressive surgical debridement and antibiotic coverage for gram-negative rods are the essential features of treatment. Delay caused by a mistaken diagnosis of cellulitis and subsequent inadequate debridement would likely prove fatal.

### Aeromonas hydrophilia infections after penetrating foot trauma [^73c3671d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila is an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus commonly found in natural bodies of water and can cause infection in patients who suffer water-associated trauma or in immunocompromised hosts. The authors present 5 cases of penetrating wound trauma that did not involve any aquatic environment and developed rapidly forming infections. All patients presented with severe pain, cellulitis, ascending lymphangitis, fever, and pain on range of motion of the joint near the traumatic site. Presentation of clinical symptoms mimicked that of a septic joint or of severe streptococcal infection. All patients required surgical incision and drainage, intravenous and oral antibiotics using levofloxacin or bactrim, and local wound care. Results from cultures taken intraoperatively showed only A hydrophilia in every case. Resolution of symptoms occurred rapidly after surgery, and clinical resolution was seen within 72 hours. Each patient healed uneventfully and returned to preinjury status.

### An estimation of global Aeromonas infection prevalence in children with diarrhoea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e32717e9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We did provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea to get a better comprehension of the global dispensation of this infectious disease. Although diarrhoeal disease fatality has reduced remarkably in the last three decades, lots of work is still required to speed up the decline in the burden of bacterial diarrhoeal diseases in deprived children in terms of safe and healthy water and sanitation, and appropriate health care.

### Prospective nationwide study of Aeromonas infections in France [^5f78f5a4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a systematic prospective multicenter nationwide study of clinical Aeromonas infections in France. During 6 months (May to October 2006), 78 cases of aeromonosis were reviewed for risk factors and clinical, microbiological, and antimicrobial susceptibility data. They included wound infections (44%), bacteremia (26%), enteritis (19%), respiratory tract infections (6%), and miscellaneous (5%) infections.

### Empyema caused by Aeromonas species in Taiwan [^9f63c628]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Strains of Aeromonas species are prevalent bacteria in coastal areas of southern Taiwan. Aeromonad is known as a cause of epidemic diarrheal disease, and the most common clinical manifestation is acute gastroenteritis. Extra-intestinal infections by Aeromonas species, such as pleural cavity, are rare. Herein, we described the six patients who developed Aeromonas spp.-related empyema, and was successfully treated with antimicrobial agent and drainage.

### Aeromonas spp. and infectious diarrhea, Hong Kong [^c393a434]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In conclusion, Aeromonas spp. are responsible for a small proportion of cases of bacterial gastroenteritis encountered in an urban emergency department setting in Hong Kong. Patients affected do not necessarily have a history of travel to a nonindustrialized region. In a substantial proportion of cases, the symptoms are severe enough to require intravenous fluid therapy and observation. However, symptoms generally would have resolved by the time the pathogen was isolated from stool culture. In contrast to the report of Vila et al. persistent diarrhea is uncommon, and antimicrobial therapy is usually unnecessary in our particular setting. Aeromonas spp. are susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobial drugs, except ampicillin. Whether empiric antimicrobial drugs given at the time of treatment would have significantly shortened the duration of the symptoms is not known.

### The infectious and noninfectious dermatological consequences of flooding: a field manual for the responding provider [^2d313d2b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Meteorological data show that disastrous floods are increasingly frequent and more severe in recent years, perhaps due to climatic changes such as global warming. During and after a flood disaster, traumatic injuries, communicable diseases, chemical exposures, malnutrition, decreased access to care, and even mental health disorders dramatically increase, and many of these have dermatological manifestations. Numerous case reports document typical and atypical cutaneous infections, percutaneous trauma, immersion injuries, noninfectious contact exposures, exposure to wildlife, and exacerbation of underlying skin diseases after such disasters as the 2004 Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the 2010 Pakistan floods. This review attempts to provide a basic field manual of sorts to providers who are engaged in care after a flooding event, with particular focus on the infectious consequences. Bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are still common causes of skin infections after floods, with atypical bacteria also greatly increased. Vibrio vulnificus is classically associated with exposure to saltwater or brackish water. It may present as necrotizing fasciitis with hemorrhagic bullae, and treatment consists of doxycycline or a quinolone, plus a third-generation cephalosporin and surgical debridement. Atypical mycobacterial infections typically produce indolent cutaneous infections, possibly showing sporotrichoid spread. A unique nontuberculous infection called spam has recently been identified in Satowan Pacific Islanders; combination antibiotic therapy is recommended. Aeromonas infection is typically associated with freshwater exposure and, like Vibrio infections, immunocompromised or cirrhotic patients are at highest risk for severe disease, such as necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis. Various antibiotics can be used to treat Aeromonas infections. Melioidosis is seen mainly in Southeast Asia and Australia, particularly in rice farmers, and can remain latent for many years before presenting as the host's immunocompetence wanes. It can present with a variety of skin findings or as a nonspecific febrile illness, and preferred treatment consists of ceftazidime or a carbapenem with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 2 weeks, then continuing TMP/SMX for at least 3 months. Leptospirosis is a waterborne zoonosis that is often prevalent after heavy rains or flooding. Different forms exist, including Fort Bragg fever, which produces a distinctive erythematous papular rash on the shins. Doxycycline is often sufficient; however, volume and potassium repletion may be necessary if renal involvement exists. Chromobacterium violaceum infection may occur after open skin is exposed to stagnant or muddy water. Cultured colonies produce a unique violacein pigment, and treatment typically consists of a carbapenem. Both typical and atypical fungal infections are increased in the flooding disaster scenario, such as dermatophytosis, chromoblastomycosis, blastomycosis, and mucormycosis. Appropriate antifungals should be used. In addition, land inundated with water expands the habitat for parasites and/or vectors, thus increased vigilance for regional parasitic infections is necessary after a flood. Lastly, noninfectious consequences of a flooding disaster are also common and include miliaria, immersion foot syndromes, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, traumatic wounds and animal bites, and arthropod assault, as well as exacerbation of existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and alopecia areata due to increased stress or nonavailability of daily medications.

### Cystitis caused by Aeromonas caviae [^b9896849]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Aeromonas sp. organisms rarely cause urinary tract infection. We report for the first time a case of urinary tract infection caused by A. caviae in an adult patient with a history of increased frequency of urination, dysuria, hematuria, and weight loss.

### Case reports: fatal necrotizing fasciitis caused by Aeromonas sobria in two diabetic patients [^c58faf1b]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

We report two rare cases of Aeromonas sobria necrotizing fasciitis with sepsis in patients with diabetes. In both cases, immediate fasciotomy was performed and appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy and intensive care were administered. However, the two patients died on Day 2 and Day 11, respectively, after admission as a result of multiple organ failure. When patients present with a rapid onset of skin necrosis and progressive sepsis, an Aeromonas sobria infection or Vibrio infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Aeromonas hydrophila in a burn patient [^18ff55fa]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2009). Low credibility.

Infectious consequences are still a major problem and leading cause of mortality in burn patients. Among others, aeromonads need special concern because they mimic pseudomonal infections; however, they have a more rapid progression with considerable mortality if undiagnosed promptly. Here, we present a major burn case extinguished with tap water pooled in a tank. With the possibility of aeromonal infection in mind, the patient underwent aggressive debridement with proper antibiotic medication, which resulted in a successful patient management. Aeromonads should always be kept in mind in burn cases that contacted with tanked water or soil after the burn.

### What Do kayaking and a hog have in common? Two cases of Aeromonas hydrophila infection in Georgia [^7b4d4a2a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

We highlight 2 cases of immunocompetent pediatric patients diagnosed with osteomyelitis and cellulitis attributed to Aeromonas hydrophila. One case had a direct water source; however, the second case occurred following a wild hog bite. Both required fluoroquinolone treatment and demonstrated the need to consider A. hydrophila in patients with water exposure, animal bites and initial antibiotic failure.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f3116689]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Persistent watery diarrhea — etiology and approach emphasize identifying a cause rather than empiric therapy: persistent watery diarrhea generally should not be treated in the absence of an identified cause, is only rarely due to bacterial infection in otherwise healthy adults and children, and organisms reported with prolonged diarrhea (such as Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, C. difficile, and EAEC) are not detected on routine stool culture. When infection is responsible, the most common etiologic agents are protozoa and are best managed with pathogen-specific therapy rather than empiric therapy before diagnosis; an exception is in severely immunocompromised patients (including people with AIDS), in whom more conventional pathogens such as Campylobacter and Salmonella may persist, and in such cases an empiric trial with an antimicrobial agent may be considered to provide symptomatic benefit to optimize tolerance of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Strengths and limitations

This was the first systematic review and meta-analysis to obtain a global prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea. The comprehensive literature search, duplicated data elicitation, precise methodology, and quality assessment by two autonomous reviewers, obvious exclusion and inclusion criteria, and the lack of publication bias are strengths of this meta-analysis. Nevertheless, there are some limitations that goes back to the nature of the surveys that are as follow: Firstly, most of the investigations included in this meta-analysis did not report information about the virulence genes and antibiotic resistance pattern clearly and consistently; therefore, we were unable to evaluate the effect of these momentous factors. Secondly, the age of patients was not provided clearly in most included studies. Third, in many studies, information about children's gender was not given.

Aeromonas is at the interface of all the One Health components and represents an amazingly sound test case in the One Health approach, from economic loss in aquaculture tochallenges related to antibiotic-resistant bacteria selected from the environment. In human health, infections following leech therapy is an outstanding example of such One Health challenges. Aeromonads are not only ubiquitous environmental bacteria, able to rapidly colonize and cause opportunistic infections in humans and animals, they are also capable of promoting interactions and gene exchanges between the One Health components. This makes this genus a key amplifier of genetic transfer, especially of antibiotic resistance genes.

### An estimation of global Aeromonas infection prevalence in children with diarrhoea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6f6c53a6]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diarrhoea is the most commonly related disease caused by Aeromonas. To improve knowledge on prevalence, this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the global prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea worldwide.

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Google scholar, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of sciences to identify all cross-sectional published papers between 2000 and 10 July 2022. After initial scrutinizing, 31 papers reporting the prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea were found to be adequate for meta-analysis. The statistical study was accompanied by using random effects models.

Results

A total of 5660 identified papers, 31 cross-sectional studies encompassing 38,663 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea worldwide was 4.2% (95% CI 3.1–5.6%). In the subgroup analysis, the highest prevalence was seen among children in Upper middle-income countries with pooled prevalence of 5.1% (95% CI 2.8–9.2%). The prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea was higher in countries with populations of over 100 million people (9.4%; 95% CI 5.6–15.3%), and water and sanitation quality score of less than 25% (8.8%; 95% CI 5.2–14.4%). Additionally, Cumulative Forest Plot showed a decreasing trend in the prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea over time (P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

The results of this study showed a better comprehension of Aeromonas prevalence in children with diarrhoea on a global scale. As well as our findings showed that much work is still required to decline the burden of bacterial diarrhoea in countries with high populations, low-level income, and unsanitary water.

### Aeromonas infection of the hepatobiliary system: report of 15 cases and review of the literature [^919e7bcc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Aeromonas species cause both intestinal and extraintestinal disease. We reviewed hospital laboratory and medical records to identify patients with Aeromonas infection of the hepatobiliary or pancreatic system. Analysis of data from our hospital, as well as a review of the published literature, yielded a total of 41 episodes in 39 patients, and the features of these episodes are described. The most common manifestation of Aeromonas hepatobiliary infection among all reported cases was cholangitis (29 of 41 episodes). The majority of infections in our hospital occurred in patients with underlying immunosuppression or malignancy (13 of 15 patients), including 4 liver transplant recipients, and nosocomial infection was not infrequent (8 of 17 episodes). Infection occurred most commonly in patients with obstruction of the biliary tract due to stones, tumor, or stricture and was associated with a relatively high mortality rate (11.8%). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that gentamicin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin had the highest activity against the Aeromonas species isolated.

Discussion

Enteric bacteria related diarrhoea maintains to be a main cause of morbidity and mortality among children. Troeger et al. Aeromonas -associated diarrhoeal is known as the leading cause of mortality with 1.0 cases per 100,000 which indicates that children are more sensitive to Aeromonas infection. In humans, Aeromonas is a cause of extra-intestinal and intestinal diseases, particularly in immunocompromised patients, including urinary tract infections, septicemia, wound infections, necrotizing fasciitis, and hepatobiliary tract infections. Clinical symptoms of Aeromonas infection include chronic watery diarrhoea to severe dysentery. Rehydration therapy is sufficient intervention in most children cases of gastroenteritis and watery diarrhoea caused by Aeromonas. Antibiotics are used for only unresponsive and sever cases of Aeromonas gastroenteritis or extraintestinal infections. Correct detection of the genus Aeromonas in laboratory is still a great challenge. Many studies have been conducted with the goal of making detection applied and reproducible, thus increasing the reliability of findings. The current systematic review presents the first published summary of the global prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea. Based on 31 cross-sectional articles published during the past 22 years, we evaluated the overall prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea worldwide to be 4.2% (95% CI 3.1–5.6%) using a random effect model. Global prevalence of Aeromonas and its huge burden in some countries such as South Africa, India, and Kenya made Aeromonas reportable disease especially in children with diarrhoea. Prevalence for different studies that met the inclusion criteria of the current review differed largely from 0.002% to 30.5%. Differences in the prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea reflected possible differences associated with geographic factors in various parts of the world, water and sanitation quality, income level, and population densities. In the present study the greatest and lowest prevalence of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea was in India (30.5%) and Denmark (0.002%). The pooled prevalence here totally agrees with other investigations of Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea, including NASEEM Q N DUBAI (4.1%), and Oliver Waithaka Mbuthia (4.3%). Furthermore, the pooled prevalence we obtained is approximately in line with the findings of both W S Lee (4.0%) and Saba Talib Hashim (4.0%). Subgroups analysis based on population, income level, and water and sanitation quality score also was evaluated. Findings show prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea being documented from 17 countries that have the higher prevalence in upper middle-income countries 5.1% (95% CI 2.8–9.2%), regions with populations of over 100 million people (9.4%; 95% CI 5.6–15.3%), and water and sanitation quality score of less than 25% (8.8%; 95% CI 5.2–14.4%). The present subgroups analysis confirmed the findings that the high prevalence rate of diarrhoea diseases among children would happen in areas with large population densities, poor water and sanitation facilities, and low-income and middle-income countries. Based on the importance of quality assessment section in meta-analysis getting high-quality studies is crucial in providing reliable and useful results to provide a deeper understanding of research topic. Accordingly, some suggestions for high-quality studies are mentioned as follows:
High-quality research is anchored on a good study question.
High-quality research follows a systematic, relevant study methodology.
High-quality research acknowledges previous studies.
High-quality research uses appropriate, empirical data and correct data analysis methods.
High-quality research is representative and generalizable.
High-quality research has external validity.
High-quality research is replicable and transparent.

### Aeromonas hydrophila folliculitis associated with an inflatable swimming pool: mimicking Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [^311b70b9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Aeromonas species are ubiquitous, facultative, anaerobic, gram-negative flagellated rods, mainly found in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Skin and soft-tissue infections, including cellulitis and wound infections, are the second most frequent location of isolations of Aeromonas spp. in clinical samples, after the gastrointestinal tract. All three major Aeromonas species (A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veroni biotype sobria) have been associated with wound infections, but A. hydrophila predominates. Typically, infection occurs after trauma and subsequent exposure to contaminated fresh water or soil. However, Aeromonas folliculitis has been rarely reported. We report the first two pediatric cases of Aeromonas hydrophila folliculitis associated with the use of recreational water facilities that clinically and epidemiologically mimic Pseudomonas folliculitis. Clinical and microbiological studies may be necessary to clarify the role of Aeromonas spp. in this newly-reported infection.

### Aeromonas sobria peritonitis in a peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient: a case report and review of the literature [^9dd049d7]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is a common cause of catheter removal and mortality in the patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Various pathogenic organisms have been identified as the etiology of PD-related peritonitis, among which Aeromonas sobria is a rare one. Several studies have indicated that Aeromonas sobria might be of particular clinical significance because of its enterotoxin production. We here present a case of peritonitis due to Aeromonas sobria in a PD patient and review of the related literature.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old man with chronic renal failure who was secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis had been on PD for approximately 6months without any episode of peritonitis. In July 2015, he was admitted to the hospital for fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and cloudy dialysate several hours after eating stinky tofu. The peritoneal effluent culture yielded Aeromonas sobria. The patient was given intraperitoneal amikacin and intravenous levofloxacin for 10days. And the patient's symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain were relieved and the cloudy effluent turned to be clear. Unfortunately, peritoneal dialysis catheter was blocked because of fibrin clot formation in the setting of inflammation, and finally it was removed.

Conclusions

Aeromonas species are rare causes of PD-related peritonitis, however they should not be ignored. Clinicians should be aware of monitoring the hygiene protocol and retraining patients at regular intervals, especially for such rare cases.

### Aeromonas-associated diarrhea in children under 5 years: the GEMS experience [^d844fe71]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

We report the clinical findings, epidemiology, and risk factors for moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) associated with Aeromonas species in children 0–59 months of age, from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, conducted at three sites in south Asia and four sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Children with MSD were enrolled along with controls matched for age, gender, and neighborhood. Pooled, age-stratified conditional logistic regression models were applied to evaluate the association of Aeromonas infection controlling for coinfecting pathogens and sociodemographic variables. A pooled, age-stratified, multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to identify risk factors associated with Aeromonas positivity in MSD cases. A total of 12,110 cases and 17,291 matched controls were enrolled over a period of 48 months. Aeromonas was identified as a significant pathogen in 736 cases of MSD in Pakistan and Bangladesh (22.2%). Aeromonas remained a significant pathogen even after adjustment for the presence of other pathogens and sociodemographic factors. Odds ratio (OR) for Aeromonas were higher in the presence of Shigella (matched OR: 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9–20.2). Cases of Aeromonas were likely to present with dysentery, particularly in the 0–11 months (OR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–2.0) and 12–23 months (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3–2.5) age group. The odds of Aeromonas increased with increasing degree of stunting, being highest for severe stunting (OR: 10.1, 95% CI: 3.6–28.9). Aeromonas is a significant pathogen for MSD in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Presence of dysentery and co-occurrence with other pathogens, notably Shigella spp. are significant features of Aeromonas-associated diarrhea.

Details of prevalence publications

Through online database search, we returned a total of 5660 papers. Review papers on the prevalence of Aeromonas in children with diarrhoea were removed. After the primary check of the titles of eligible papers, related articles to the prevalence of Aeromonas were selected, while irrelevant papers were excluded from the study. Finally, thirty one papers were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1).

Meta-analysis of Aeromonas prevalence in diarrhoea children

Current survey covered four continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. No related published papers were found for North, Central America, and Australia. The number of papers included in the meta-analysis was 31, including 38,663 samples, from 2000 to 2022. The principal specifications and outcomes of the included studies are presented in Table 1. Included studies showed high heterogeneity (I² = 95.27%; p < 0.0001), which is indicative to use random effects model. The pooled prevalence by the random-effects model was 4.2% (95% CI 3.1–5.6%) (Fig. 2). Subgroup analysis showed that regions with populations of over 100 million people had the highest prevalence of Aeromonas (9.4%; 95% CI 5.6–15.3%) (Fig. 3). In addition, the infection was more prevalent in Upper middle-income regions 5.1% (95% CI 2.8–9.2%) (Fig. 4), and regions with water and sanitation quality score of less than 25% (8.8%; 95% CI 5.2–14.4%) (Fig. 5). Our results identify evidence of decreasing Aeromonas infection in children with diarrhoea within the approximately more than two decades covered by reported studies (Fig. 6).

Water-Associated Infections — Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) can occur after exposure to fresh, brackish, or salt water, particularly if the skin's surface is compromised, including from abrasions or lacerations during swimming or wading, bites or stings from marine or aquatic creatures, and punctures from fishhooks. The most virulent SSTI associated with marine and estuarine exposures are due to Vibrio vulnificus and related non-cholera Vibrio spp., whereas for freshwater exposures Aeromonas hydrophila is the most dangerous pathogen. Manifestations can include abscess formation, cellulitis, ecthyma gangrenosum, and necrotizing fasciitis. Pending identification of a specific organism, treat acute infections related to aquatic injury with an antibiotic that provides both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage (e.g., fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin).

Antibiotic choice according to the site of infection

NSTIs are commonly classified based on microbiological findings. The most widely accepted classification distinguishes between type I and type II NSTIs. Type I infections are polymicrobial and typically occur in elderly patients or individuals with underlying comorbidities. A portal of entry, such as a skin ulcer or mucosal breach, is often identified. In contrast, type II NSTIs are monomicrobial, most frequently caused by GAS or S. aureus, and can affect patients of any age, including those without pre-existing conditions. Some authors also describe a type III category, encompassing infections caused by organisms such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio vulnificus or clostridial species.

In our protocol, we chose to categorize NSTIs according to the anatomical location of the infection rather than on microbiological documentation. This pragmatic approach is intended to help clinicians select the correct empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected NSTIs, before microbiological results are available.

Antibiotic dosing regimens for adults and children are presented in Table 1. Adult dosages follow the 2025 European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommendations for high-dose therapy. Pediatric dosages follow the Red Book recommendations, except for levofloxacin, for which higher doses are proposed based on recent pediatric pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses and the recommendations of the Société de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Française (SPILF) for pediatric use.

### Aeromonas sobria peritonitis in a peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient: a case report and review of the literature [^6a4d622b]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritonitis is not only a common complication in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but also a main cause of catheter removal and mortality in PD patients. Various of pathogenic organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, S.epidermidis and enterogenous bacteria, have been recognized as the pathogens of PD-related peritonitis, among which Aeromonas sobria is rare. Several studies have indicated that Aeromonas sobria may be of particular clinical significance because of its enterotoxin production. The Aeromonas species, are facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, gram-negative microorganisms widely found in water, sewage and soil, and can also be isolated from varieties of foods including raw meats, sea foods and milk. Animals and humans are usually infected through the contaminated food. Aeromonas species may act as conditional pathogenic bacteria which can cause various infections including bacteremia, wound infections, skin and soft-tissue infections, pneumonia, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, meningitis, cholangitis, urinary tract infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and gastroenteritis, especially in immunocompromised patients. Aeromonas sobria, which belongs to the Aeromonas species, has seldom been reported in PD-related peritonitis. Here, we present a case of peritonitis caused by Aeromona sobria in a PD patient and review of the related literature.

Antimicrobial therapy

17) Early appropriate empiric coverage against suspected pathogens should be initiated, based upon the clinical setting for patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

18) Patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from Gram positive pathogens (S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents (clindamycin or linezolid). Patients who present with rapidly progressive infections with gram stains of tissue demonstrating gram negative pathogens (Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting gram negative pathogens (tetracyclines) (Recommendation 1 C).

19) Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C).

20) Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available (Recommendation 1 C).

21) An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results return (Recommendation 1 C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (mono-microbial infections initiated by a variety of virulent gram positive or gram negative bacilli such as Clostridia, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Eikenella, and Bacillus species). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

Table 1
Cases of PD-related Peritonitis Caused by Aeromonas Species

Aeromonas peritonitis has an abrupt onset in most patients. In this case, the patient presented fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and cloudy peritoneal effluent several hours after eating stinky tofu. Stinky tofu, a kind of traditional Chinese food, is usually considered unhygienic. The tofu have to be placed in water for a long time to increase the unique smell. Human body may get infected after eating stinky tofu contaminated by Aeromonas sobria. Aeromonas can produce enterotoxin and hemolysin, causing gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Then the bacterial translocation plays a important role in the pathogenesis of PD-related peritonitis. Therefore, we speculated that the stinky tofu might be the source of infection.

Aeromonas sobria grow rapidly in summer. The patient we reported here got infected in summer, and the anemia, low albumin, and immunosuppressive status of the patient increased the risk of opportunistic infection. Moreover, hypokalemia caused by vomiting and diarrhea not only decrease intestinal peristalsis, but also increase intestinal permeability, both of which facilitate bacterial translocation. The increased cellulose exudation and fibrin clot formation in the setting of inflammation made peritoneal catheter blocked. In consequence, the patient had to remove the catheter and switch to hemodialysis. Therefore, the patients undergoing PD should pay more attention not to eat any contaminated food, and avoid constipation in order to prevent from opportunistic bacterial infection.

Aeromonas species can produce β-lactamases which make most of them resistant to ampicillin, pencillin and first- or second-generation cephalosporins, while sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, which is consistent with our drug sensitivity tests. However, our result indicated that Aeromonas sobria was resistant to cefotaxime which belongs to third-generation cephalosporins. Recent literature also suggests that Aeromonas species show an increasing trend of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Amikacin and levofloxacin treatment were efficient in this case. The patient finally shifted to hemodialysis with the catheter removed. It's noteworthy that the third-generation cephalosporins which is well known as the empirical approach to the therapy of bacterial infection caused by Aeromonas sobria may be ineffective sometimes.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^bb1072aa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea is the main infectious disease reported in persons traveling abroad. Among the microorganisms responsible, bacteria represent approximately 61%. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and Shigella spp. are the most common bacteria involved. Other bacteria that cause diarrhea, such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas spp. are isolated less often.

The genus Aeromonas has high diversity: at least 16 DNA hybridization groups are recognized. Among these genospecies, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biotype sobria are considered of clinical significance. The spectrum of infectious diseases caused by Aeromonas species includes gastrointestinal infections as well as extraintestinal infections such as cellulitis, wound infections, septicemia, urinary tract infections, and hepatobiliary and ear infections, among others. Although healthy carriers of Aeromonas spp. have been described, several case-control studies have shown that these bacteria cause diarrhea. With the incorporation of genotypic techniques, identification of Aeromonas to species level has improved. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Aeromonas spp. as a cause of traveler's diarrhea and to analyze the species' geographic distribution, clinical features, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.

Water and soil-borne necrotizing infections

Aeromonas hydrophila is a rod-shaped, motile, and Gram-negative bacterium. It is found in wastewater, sewage, and food. Wound infection of A. hydrophila in humans is the second most frequent after oral infection and is associated with traumatic events and wounds exposed to water and soil. Most cases of A. hydrophila wound infection occur in healthy people. In particular, A. hydrophila wound infection is reported following natural disasters, such as the tsunami and hurricane. The wound infections due to A. hydrophila can progress rapidly to NSTIs.

Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic, Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Vibrio genus and Vibrionaceae family.

V. vulnificus can be transmitted through the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish, and skin exposure to contaminated seawater. The sensitivity of the host is crucial for the development of V. vulnificus infection, which commonly occurs in patients with chronic liver diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hemochromatosis. The wound infections due to V. vulnificus can progress to NSTIs.

Mortality for V. vulnificus serious wound infections have been shown to increase with greater delays between onset of illness and initiation of antibiotic treatment and aggressive debridement. Thus, patients with a presumptive diagnosis of V. vulnificus should be treated immediately by antibiotics and managed aggressively by a prompt debridement and resuscitation in an intensive care unit to minimize the possible consequences of hypotension, septic shock, and the risk of multiorgan system failure.

The contact history of patients with a rapid onset of cellulitis can alert clinicians to a differential diagnosis of soft-tissue infection with V vulnificus (contact with seawater) or A. hydrophila (contact with fresh or brackish water, soil, or wood).

### Bacteremia caused by Aeromonas species complex in the caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe [^5b6c1aff]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Aeromonas species are Gram-negative bacilli of the water environment whose survival appears facilitated by warm climates. There have been no reports on Aeromonas species in the Caribbean to date. Our aim was to describe clinical and bacteriological features in patients presenting with such bacteremia in Martinique and Guadeloupe. During a 14-year period, we retrospectively identified 37 patients. The mean age was 55 years and in 89% of cases underlying disease such as digestive diseases, cutaneous wounds, and malignancy were identified. One case was related to severe strongyloidiasis and one with snake bite. Polymicrobial bacteremia was identified in 38%, essentially with Enterobacteriaceae. All Aeromonas isolates were resistant to amoxicillin but extended-spectrum beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone were active against more than 95%. During hospitalization 10 patients died (27%). Older age, occurrence of multiorgan failure, and impaired renal function were associated with in-hospital mortality.

### Clinical significance of spontaneous Aeromonas bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients: a matched case-control study [^c67c1d69]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although Aeromonas species are known to cause bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis, less is known about spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) caused by Aeromonas species in these patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, matched case-control study (1:2 ratio) consisting of patients presenting with SBP due to Aeromonas species from January 1997 through December 2006. Control subjects were patients with SBP caused by other organisms and were matched to the patients by age (± 1 year) and sex.

Results

We identified 43 patients with SBP due to Aeromonas species, 40 (93%) of whom had Aeromonas hydrophila infection and 3 (7%) of whom had Aeromonas sorbia infection. There were 81 control subjects, of whom 38 (47%) were infected with Escherichia coli, 25 (31%) were infected with Klebsiella species, 12 (15%) were infected with Streptococcus species, and 6 (7%) were infected with other bacteria. Baseline Child-Pugh class and model for end-stage liver disease score did not differ between groups. A significant increase in the incidence of infection during the warm season (July-September) was observed in the group with SBP due to Aeromonas species, compared with the group with SBP due to other bacteria (63% vs. 25%; P < .001). Diarrheal episodes were significantly more frequent in the group with SBP due to Aeromonas species (26% vs. 6%; P = 0.002). There were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to appropriateness of initial antibiotic therapy,3-day mortality, and 30-day cumulative survival. In the group with Aeromonas infection, the in-hospital mortality rate was 23%; septic shock was the only independent prognostic factor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 34.5;95% confidence interval, 1.9–640.6; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Aeromonas species should be considered to be a causative organism of SBP in cirrhotic patients presenting with diarrheal episodes during the warm season. Compared with SBP caused by other organisms, SBP due to Aeromonas species was not associated with more-advanced cirrhosis.

### Management of extremity trauma and related infections occurring in the aquatic environment [^12f8095f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Wounds sustained in oceans, lakes, and streams are exposed to a milieu of bacteria rarely encountered in typical land-based injuries. These include Vibrio species, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas and Plesiomonas species, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Mycobacterium marinum, and other microbes. Failure to recognize and treat these less common pathogens in a timely manner may result in significant morbidity or death. Initial antibiotic therapy should address common gram-positive and gram-negative aquatic bacteria, depending on the environment. Trauma occurring in brackish or salt water should be treated with doxycycline and ceftazidime, or a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin). Freshwater wounds should be managed with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (eg, ceftazidime). Injuries sustained in a marine or freshwater environment may result from bites or venomous stings of aquatic organisms as well as from accidental trauma. Musculoskeletal trauma caused by venomous underwater species (eg, stingrays, stinging fish, sea urchins, and coral) requires immediate neutralization of the heat-labile toxin with immersion in nonscalding water for 30 to 90 minutes. Appropriate management of aquatic wounds requires recognition of the mechanism of injury, neutralization of venom, antibiotic administration, radiographic assessment, surgical débridement with irrigation, wound cultures, and structural repair or amputation as indicated by the severity of the injury.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^8c10f673]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

NSTI type II is a mono-microbial infection. Among Gram-positive organisms, GAS remains the most common pathogen, followed by MRSA. Unlike type I infections, type II infections may occur in any age group and in persons without any underlying illness. Other pathogens include Aeromonas hydrophila and V. vulnificus. Mono-microbial necrotizing fasciitis due to Gram-negative pathogens (bacteroides and E. coli) have also been reported, though these infections are typically seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, obese, and postoperative patients.

Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), or type III NSTI, is an acute infection by clostridium or bacillus of healthy living tissue that occurs spontaneously or as a result of traumatic injury. Recurrent gas gangrene, occurring several decades after the primary infection, has also been described.

The use of antimicrobial therapy is an adjuvant treatment and must be combined with early surgical debridement. Once the diagnosis is made and blood cultures have been drawn, broad-spectrum coverage should be urgently commenced. Initial antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections is empirical in nature because microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may require > 24 h before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available. An acceptable empiric antibiotic regimen should always include antibiotics, which cover MRSA with the additional benefit of inhibiting invasive GAS virulence proteins. For the treatment of MRSA, we refer to the previous paragraphs.

For the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in the setting without high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae optimizing pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameters is appropriate. Carbapenems, administered in adequate dosage, including meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or doripenem may be used in the settings with high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae. Culture-specific results and sensitivities can direct both broadening of antimicrobial regimen if it is too narrow and a de-escalation if it is too broad particularly in critically ill patients where de-escalation strategy is one of the cornerstones of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and MDRO non-fermenters.

### One year ago not business as usual: wound management, infection and psychoemotional control during tertiary medical care following the 2004 tsunami disaster in southeast Asia [^fec4d8da]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Infection patterns

Traumatic wounds were immediately contaminated by a mixture of sea and fresh water, sewage, soil, foreign materials (for example, corals, sand, vegetation) and floating debris as many victims had been swept into the mangroves behind the shores by the force of the wave, causing polymicrobial infections. Repeated multilocal microbiology identified a wide spectrum of bacteria common to the marine environment, for example, Aeromonas species. Furthermore, the presence of enteric and Gram-negative pathogens/coliforms, for example, E. coli and Proteus and Klebsiella species, was not surprising as seawater is regularly contaminated with sewage, even in the best of times and that also in resort areas. Inland freshwater pools classically contain Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas species, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, as well as Burkholderia and Leptospira. Outbreaks of leptospirosis have been reported after flooding but Leptospira was not isolated in our cohort. In contrast, Aeromonas and Pseudomonas species were frequently encountered in our cohort and have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections after traumatic exposure to contaminated water as well as pulmonary complications and septicemia following near drowning. Although atypical mycobacteria and anaerobic bacteria may also be encountered in wounds with fresh water or soil exposure, the most common pathogens associated with fresh water exposure remain staphylococci and streptococci. Burkholderia species have only been anecdotally reported to induce necrotising pneumonia, cutaneous and septicaemic melioidosis.

### Aeromonas sobria peritonitis in a peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient: a case report and review of the literature [^49547804]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Aeromonas is usually classified into four main species: Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas salmonicida and Aeromonas sobria. It's commonly believed that the major virulence factors of Aeromonas species are haemolysins including enterotoxins, invasins, aerolysin, adhesins, proteases, phospholipase and lipase. Aeromonas sobria bacteremia is reported to have the highest mortality rate in this genus (Aeromonas sobria - 56%, Aeromonas hydrophyila - 33%, Aeromonas cavies - 17%). Aeromonas sobria may act as opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, intestinal and other extraintestinal infection, and can be isolated from sea water, soil, fish and many other food. Such infections occurred predominantly in patients with chronic hepatic disease, gastroenteritis, malignancy and immunocompromised status. Although gastroenteritis is the most common infection of Aeromonas species, peritonitis caused by Aeromonas species are not uncommon, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. However, peritonitis episodes due to Aeromonas species have seldom been reported in PD patients (Table 1). The most frequently isolated specie was A. hydrophila (10;71.4%), while A. sobria was reported owning higher virulence (1;7.1%). The pathogenic mechanism of Aeromonas peritonitis in patients undergoing PD could be associated with direct exposure to contaminated water. From the literature review (Table 1), we found that two of the cases may be possibility of water-related infection, however, such infection has rarely been proven. Another possible mechanism is transmural migration from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood. The outcomes of PD-related peritonitis caused by Aeromonas species are generally good; however, recurrent peritonitis can occur (21.4%). The reason of recurrence may be biofilm formation on the surfaces of catheter. Recently, Joana et al. found that no major differences on microbial density of the catheter cultures were observed between the catheters removed due to infectious and non-infectious causes. However, microbial yields were higher on the cuffs of catheters removed due to infection, which indicated that microbial biofilm is universal in PD catheters with the subclinical menace. Cuffs colonization may significantly contribute to infection. In this sense, it would not be prudent to prophylactically remove the PD catheter in PD-related peritonitis patients.

### Performance of stool-testing recommendations for acute gastroenteritis when used to identify children with 9 potential bacterial enteropathogens [^e157b75b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The ability to identify bacterial pathogens that necessitate specific clinical management or public health action in children with acute gastroenteritis is crucial to patient care and public health. However, existing stool-testing guidelines offer inconsistent recommendations, and their performance characteristics are unknown. We evaluated 6 leading gastroenteritis guidelines (eg, those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Infectious Disease Society of America) that recommend when to test children's stool for bacterial enteropathogens.

Methods

Via 2 emergency departments in Alberta, Canada, we enrolled 2447 children < 18 years old who presented with ≥ 3 episodes of diarrhea and/or vomiting in a 24-hour period. All participants were tested for 9 bacterial enteropathogens: Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia. Patient data gathered at the index visit were used to determine whether guidelines would recommend testing. Sensitivity and specificity to recommend testing for children with bacterial enteropathogens were calculated for each guideline.

Results

Outcome data were available for 2391 (97.7%) participants, and 6% (144/2391) of participants tested positive for a bacterial enteropathogen. Guideline sensitivity ranged from 25.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18.7–33.0%) to 66.9% (95% CI 59.3–74.6%), and varied for individual pathogens. Guideline specificity for all bacterial enteropathogens ranged from 63.6% (95% CI 61.6–65.6%) to 96.5% (95% CI 95.7–97.2%).

Conclusions

No guideline provided optimally balanced performance. The most sensitive guidelines missed one-third of cases and would drastically increase testing volumes. The most specific guidelines missed almost 75% of cases.

Water-exposure skin and soft tissue infections: P aeruginosa can cause skin infections (including folliculitis) after exposure to inadequately chlorinated swimming pools or hot tubs; the disease is typically self-limited and most children will not require antimicrobial therapy, but if treatment is needed, oral fluoroquinolone agents may be preferred over parenteral nonfluoroquinolone therapy, and they may be considered after penetrating skin/soft tissue injuries with water exposure when P aeruginosa or Aeromonas hydrophila may play a significant role.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^da6a50df]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study we describe the prevalence of different types of Aeromonas species associated with traveler's diarrhea in a cohort of travelers to a variety of tropical and subtropical countries. In contrast, other published studies have often been selective in terms of the types of travelers, geographic areas visited, or attempts to isolate specific microorganisms with the aim of testing antibiotic efficiency. In our study, Aeromonas spp. were isolated in 18 (2%) of 863 patients with traveler's diarrhea. A. veronii biotype sobria and A. caviae were the most frequently isolated species. These findings agree with the results of Hänninen et al. who reported that these were the most common Aeromonas spp. associated with traveler's diarrhea in tourists traveling to Morocco. Likewise, Yamada et al. found that A. veronii biotype sobria was the Aeromonas species most frequently implicated as a cause of traveler's diarrhea in Japanese travelers returning from unindustrialized countries. In our study, the geographic distribution of Aeromonas species did not favor any predominant area: species were isolated with a similar prevalence in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. However, all four species (A. veronii biotype sobria, A. caviae, A. jandaei, and A. hydrophila) were isolated from patients returning from India. In India, Aeromonas spp. has been identified as an enteric pathogen in 1.8% of patients with diarrhea. In a recent study performed in Dhaka (Bangladesh), Aeromonas spp. were significantly associated with diarrhea, similar to occurrences in other countries.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^cba207b7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

17) Early appropriate empiric coverage against suspected pathogens should be initiated, based upon the clinical setting for patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

18) Patients whose clinical setting or gram stain suggests rapidly progressive infection potentiated by exotoxins from Gram positive pathogens (S. pyogenes, CA-MRSA, Clostridial species), treatment with antimicrobial agents should be combined with antiribosomal agents (clindamycin or linezolid). Patients who present with rapidly progressive infections with gram stains of tissue demonstrating gram negative pathogens (Aeromonas sp. Eikenella, Vibrio sp) should be treated with antiribosomal agents targeting gram negative pathogens (tetracyclines) (Recommendation 1 C).

19) Appropriate empiric coverage against MRSA should be immediately initiated in patients with NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

20) Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available (Recommendation 1 C).

21) An appropriate de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy is suggested once culture results come back (Recommendation 1 C).

Supportive treatment in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

22) Supportive treatment in managing NSTI must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process (Recommendation 1 A).

Intravenous immunoglobulins in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

23) Intravenous immunoglobulins may be considered in all patients with NSTI and evidence of organ dysfunction (Recommendation 2 C).

Early nutritional support in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

24) Early nutritional support should be established (Recommendation 2 C).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^d14a1c9c]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- acute epididymitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis lasting < 6 weeks

- sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis

- acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (such as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma genitalium) or enteric organisms (such as E. coli)

- acute epididymitis caused by STIs is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic

- acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur in males who are the insertive partner during anal sex

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (such as BPH)

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis in older males is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression.

### Infective myositis [^db872765]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Non‐clostridial myositis

This category includes anaerobic streptococcal myositis, synergistic non‐clostridial myonecrosis, Aeromonas hydrophila myonecrosis, and vascular (infected) gangrene.

Anaerobic streptococci predominated by Peptostreptococci cause myositis similar to clostridial myonecrosis with the presence of gas, prominent necrosis, and foul‐smelling exudate. Numerous streptococci and polymorphonuclear leukocytes are present in the exudate. Synergistic nonclostridial myonecrosis mainly involves the subcutaneous tissues and fascia that extend to the muscle and the overlying skin. Multiple aerobic and anaerobic organisms may cause this. Streptococci, Bacteroides, E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Bacillus cereus are some of the causative microbes. These are often associated with immunocompromised state, particularly diabetes and neutropenia.

Aeromonas hydrophila, a facultative anaerobic gram‐negative bacillus, causes Aeromonas myonecrosis usually associated with penetrating injury in a freshwater environment or in contact with aquatic animals. It progresses rapidly and may form a gas. While myositis from Vibrio vulnificus is often linked to salt‐water exposure, and a predilection to occur in patients with liver disease, infection may also occur in immunocompetent hosts.

Vascular gangrene is due to compromise in the arterial blood supply, post‐injury or in diabetics. Several organisms (mixed infection that includes Proteus spp. Bacteroides spp. and anaerobic streptococci) may be involved. Gas formation and foul‐smelling exudate are commonly seen.

### Case report: disseminatedInfection with meningoencephalitis in a traveler secondary to marine injury in Madagascar [^762481c3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Marine microorganisms such as Shewanella spp. Vibrio spp., and Aeromonas spp. can cause sepsis secondary to a wound infection in the context of swimming. These microorganisms are most often susceptible to fluoroquinolones. Here, we report a unique case of Shewanella algae bacteremia associated with meningoencephalitis and disseminated via hematogenous spread secondary to a skin injury. The patient suffered the injury while swimming in saline water during a cruise holiday in Madagascar, and she was initially treated with amoxicillin. The neurological evolution was unsatisfactory. Better knowledge of such infections (and especially of the context in which they occur), as well as greater familiarity with the susceptibility profile of different marine microorganisms would have allowed health professionals to provide presumptive microbiological diagnosis and effective treatment earlier.

### Aeromonas spp. and infectious diarrhea, Hong Kong [^775ddbce]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Of 130 patients with positive stool cultures, Aeromonas spp. were isolated in 9 patients (6.9%), including A. caviae in 4 patients, A. hydrophila in 2 patients, and A veronii in 3 patients. The cases were not epidemiologically linked. In one of these isolates (A. caviae), another enteropathogen (Vibrio parahemolyticus) was also isolated. None of the patients reported recent travel abroad or to mainland China before treatment.

Our review of the clinical features of these nine patients found that the mean highest body temperature at the time of treatment or during the patient's stay in the emergency department was 37.4°C (95% confidence interval [CI] 36.9–38.0). Two patients (both with A. caviae isolated) had temperatures > 37.5°C. Bloody diarrhea was present in two patients (one with A. veronii and one with A. caviae). The mean number of unformed stools per day was 8.6 (95% CI 4.0–13.2). Abdominal pain in eight patients and vomiting in four patients was reported. Five patients required admission to the emergency department's observation unit before discharge. Of these, four patients needed intravenous fluid therapy. Empiric ciprofloxacin was given to one patient with a temperature of 38.3°C. Stool culture results were available within 3 days for positive isolation of Aeromonas. All Aeromonas strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol, while two of nine isolates (one A. caviae strain and one A. hydrophila strain) were susceptible to ampicillin. All patients had recovered satisfactorily by the time stool culture results were available, and antimicrobial therapy was not necessary, except for the patient who was given ciprofloxacin empirically.

### Use of quantitative molecular diagnostic methods to investigate the effect of enteropathogen infections on linear growth in children in low-resource settings: longitudinal analysis of results from the MAL-ED cohort study [^b1b941be]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Diarrhoea of any cause occurred in 6296 child-months (mean 4.3 episodes per child between 0 and 2 years), diarrhoea due to any infectious aetiology in 3018 child-months (any quantitative aetiologic pathogen detection; mean 2.1 episodes per child between age 0 and 2 years), bacterial diarrhoea (attributable to enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, atypical enteropathogenic E coli, typical enteropathogenic E coli, enterotoxigenic E coli, Shiga toxin-producing E coli, Aeromonas, C jejuni or C coli, Helicobacter pylori, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella, Shigella, or Vibrio cholera) in 1245 child-months (mean 0.9 episodes per child between age 0 and 2 years), viral diarrhoea (attributable to adenovirus 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus GI or GII, rotavirus, or sapovirus) in 1962 child-months (mean 1.4 episodes per child between age 0 and 2 years), and parasitic diarrhoea (attributable to E bieneusi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, Ancylostoma, Strongyloides, or Trichuris) in 149 child-months (mean 0.1 episodes per child between age 0 and 2 years). Diarrhoea of any cause and infectious diarrhoea episodes were associated with small reductions in LAZ after 3 months (figure 1). The difference in LAZ score varied on the basis of site (appendix) and diarrhoeal aetiology (p heterogeneity < 0.001). Associations between aetiology-specific diarrhoea and LAZ after 3 months were stronger for bacterial and parasitic diarrhoea than viral diarrhoea. Aetiology-specific episodes attributable to Shigella (LAZ difference −0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to −0.00), enterotoxigenic E coli (−0.04, −0.07 to −0.01), Cryptosporidium (−0.06,–0.13 to 0.00), norovirus (−0.04,–0.08 to 0.00), and adenovirus 40/41 (−0.05, −0.08 to −0.02) were negatively associated with LAZ after 3 months. No short-term associations were identified between LAZ and other specific pathogens (appendix). Diarrhoea episodes with blood (LAZ difference −0.06, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.01), prolonged duration (−0.04, −0.07 to −0.01), and high severity (−0.04, −0.08 to −0.01) were independently associated with reductions in short-term linear growth regardless of aetiology. The cumulative effect of infectious diarrhoea episodes on LAZ at age 2 years was less precise, but showed that a high burden of diarrhoea due to any aetiology was associated with a decrease of −0.16 in LAZ (95% CI −0.37 to 0.06) at age 2 years. Similar to the short-term models, the associations with LAZ varied according to diarrhoeal aetiology (figure 1).

### Relative frequency, characteristics, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Vibrio spp. Aeromonas spp., chromobacterium violaceum, and shewanella spp. in the Northern territory of Australia, 2000–2013 [^03adcc9d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Vibrio, Aeromonas, Chromobacterium violaceum, and Shewanella (VACS) are water-associated Gram-negative organisms that can cause a variety of infections. The frequency, patient characteristics, and antimicrobial susceptibilities for 468 isolates from 442 patients from the Northern Territory were reviewed. Aeromonas spp. (312 of 468; 67%) were most commonly isolated followed by Vibrio spp. (71 of 468; 15%), Shewanella spp. (61 of 468; 13%), and C. violaceum (24 of 468; 5%). A strong male predominance was found (male to female ratio of 2.3:1). Skin and soft tissue isolations (373 of 468; 80%) from lower limb infections (222 of 371; 60%) were the most common clinical manifestation. The episodes were usually polymicrobial (281 of 468; 60%). Coisolates included Staphylococcus aureus (137 of 468; 29%), β-hemolytic streptococci (74 of 468; 16%), enterobacteriaceae (111 of 468; 24%), non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (35 of 468; 7%), and other VACS organisms (37 of 468; 8%). Antimicrobial resistance of VACS organisms to ciprofloxacin (0–4%), cefepime (0–3%), and gentamicin (0–0.8%) and Vibrio spp. Aeromonas spp., and Shewanella to cotrimoxazole (0–3%) was rarely shown. For water-associated lower limb skin and soft tissue infections in the tropics, clinicians should consider empirical antimicrobial therapy with agents active against S. aureus and VACS organisms.

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^88d90fb3]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy

All β-lactams are considered safe during pregnancy. Amikacin and gentamicin have no fetal toxicity at standard doses and can be prescribed, preferably once daily. Vancomycin should be preferred to daptomycin and linezolid, as there is limited data available on the latter two antibiotics in pregnant patients. Among fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin has the most extensive safety data and should be preferred to levofloxacin.

Specific pathogens

Infections caused by Vibrio spp. (primarily V. vulnificus but also occasionally V. alginolyticus non-serogroup 01, V. cholerae, and V. parahaemolyticus), can complicate traumatic wound sustained in saltwater (or brackish inland waters) or from exposure to drippings from raw seafood and subsequently progress to NSTIs. A rapidly progressive primary bacteremia caused by V. vulnificus may occur after entry of the organism through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. consumption of raw oysters) rather than through abraded skin. NSTI often occurs rapidly after the bacteremia. Hepatic diseases are associated with infections and complications from V. vulnificus. Tetracyclines have been considered for the treatment of V. vulnificus infections, with cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin as alternatives. Infections caused by V. vulnificus should be considered when choosing the empirical antibiotic coverage for NSTIs occurring in warm coastal environments after the ingestion of shellfish. These infections are more frequent during the summer months and in patients with liver cirrhosis or other forms of immunosuppression.

A. hydrophila, an environmental gram-negative bacillus commonly found in lakes, rivers, and soil, may produce NSTIs following inoculation through a laceration sustained during freshwater exposure. Skin and soft-tissue infections due to Aeromonas sp. have been reported in Australia, Asia, South America, Europe and the Indian Ocean. Most isolates of Aeromonas are susceptible in vitro to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, antipseudomonal aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems and tetracyclines. Aeromonas sp. Coverage should be considered for NSTIs occurring in aquatic environments.

### Burn wounds infected by contaminated water: case reports, review of the literature and recommendations for treatment [^6d5cddfb]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

First-aid education for the management of burns advocates cool running water over burnt skin to limit soft tissue damage. However, the water used may itself constitute a risk. We report three cases of severe invasive and necrotizing infection in patients who used or immersed themselves in contaminated water in an attempt to extinguish the fire following acute major burns. Wound cultures from all patients yielded Aeromonas hydrophila and two yielded Bacillus cereus. One patient had a complex polymicrobial infection, including zygomycosis with Rhizomucor variabilis. All patients were treated aggressively with wound débridement, including one patient who required bilateral lower limb amputations to control progressive infection. All infections were successfully treated and all patients survived their burn injuries. We review the management of burns complicated by exposure to contaminated water leading to burn wound infections. We describe commonly reported organisms from various water sources, the appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial chemotherapy and present the clinician with a proposed algorithm for managing these serious infections.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^cc9c5707]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In our study, 3 (16.7%) of the Aeromonas isolates were detected together with other enteropathogens. This situation allowed us to consider that the symptoms we observed in the patients with traveler's diarrhea associated with Aeromonas spp. were due to the presence of this Aeromonas organisms. In our study, watery stools, fever, and abdominal cramps were the most common symptoms, which is consistent with other reports. Albert et al. suggested that isolates of Aeromonas spp. positive for both the alt and ast genes, which encode enterotoxins, were associated with watery diarrhea but that isolates positive only for the alt gene were associated with loose stools.

Fifty percent of the patients with Aeromonas spp. enteritis had persistent diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea lasting more than 1 year caused by A. caviae has been reported. A direct link between drinking water and food contaminated with Aeromonas spp. and gastrointestinal disease has been demonstrated.

Patients with prolonged enteritis required treatment. A quinolone was the drug of choice, although increased occurrence of quinolone-resistant Aeromonas spp. strains has been reported in industrialized countries. Regarding the β-lactam antibiotics, Aeromonas spp. strains analyzed in this study were, as expected, uniformly resistant to ampicillin, whereas third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime, showed good activity. These results are in accordance with those reported by other authors, showing that third-generation cephalosporins are active against Aeromonas spp. The percentage of strains with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ranged from 22.9% to 45%. These levels of resistance are likely related to the extensive use of these antimicrobial agents in unindustrialized countries.

In summary, A. veronii biotype sobria and A. caviae are the Aeromonas species most frequently associated with traveler's diarrhea; watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps are the predominant clinical features. The persistence of symptoms makes the use of antimicrobial treatment necessary.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^749ede80]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Initial therapy should include coverage for Gram-positive and Gram-negative (aerobic and anaerobic) organisms including MRSA, as well as group A and group B streptococci. Antibiotics chosen should have good tissue penetrance, especially since many patients with NSTI have severe diabetes.

Piperacillin-tazobactam has broad Gram-negative aerobic coverage which is a gap in coverage with linezolid and microbes causing NSTI continue to have good sensitivity.

Linezolid has recently been shown to be associated with better clinical and microbiological cure rates than vancomycin. Because linezolid has antitoxin activity, it obviates the need for clindamycin. Furthermore, linezolid is more likely to cover group B streptococci which are common in NSTI. Clindamycin has a long history of clinical data and there is not enough data to discern whether the rising resistance in group A Streptococcus is clinically significant. Clinical superiority for linezolid is suggested in NSTI caused by MRSA, although the most recent evidence does not show overall clinical superiority. Linezolid is associated with less acute kidney injury than the alternative treatment with vancomycin and a shorter hospital length of stay but a higher risk of thrombocytopenia. Vancomycin plus clindamycin remain a different but equal choice as linezolid as the debate continues.

Rare but important exposures that can lead to fatal infections are the following: (1) marine exposure — the antibiotic regimen must then cover vibrio species, namely (a quinolone or a tetracycline) plus a third-generation cephalosporin. Exposure to fresh water, soil, wood — the antibiotic regimen must then cover Aeromonas, namely a tetracycline with either ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone, based on known effectiveness of these agents. We do not advise carbapenems because there are rising reports of resistance.

Regarding the duration of antibiotics, we base our current antibiotic recommendation on recent literature and recommend a 2-day to 4-day course provided the conditions above are met. The presence of initial negative blood cultures would obviate the need to treat a bacteremia; furthermore, given that patients with positive blood culture were excluded from the index study, one cannot conclude that patients without initial blood culture data are safe to be included in the short-course treatment strategy.

### Clinical significance and distribution of putative virulence markers of 116 consecutive clinical Aeromonas isolates in Southern Taiwan [^011aed1b]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to elucidate the clinical manifestations of Aeromonas infections and the association of putative virulence genes with clinical invasiveness.

Methods

116 consecutive clinical Aeromonas isolates collected from July 1999 to June 2001 in a medical center in southern Taiwan were included. All isolates were identified by biochemical phenotyping and their genomic sequences encoding eight putative virulence factors, including cytolytic enterotoxin (AHCYTOEN), aerolysin (aerA), hemolysin (hlyA), heat-labile enterotoxin (alt), heat-stable enterotoxin (ast), and components of type III secretion system (ascV, aexT and ascF-ascG) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and colony blot hybridization. The association of clinical diseases of the patients with the putative virulence genes in the isolates was analyzed.

Results

Sixty-two percent of Aeromonas isolates caused clinically evident infections, of which the major clinical manifestations were primary bacteremia (40%), followed by soft tissue infections (27%), and hepatobiliary tract infections (15%). Liver cirrhosis (36%), malignancy (25%), and hepatobiliary diseases (13%) were the major underlying diseases in patients with Aeromonas bacteremia. The majority (64%) of patients with Aeromonas hepatobiliary infections had underlying hepatobiliary diseases, whereas 71% of those with soft tissue infections had antecedent water- or soil-related injuries. The crude fatality rate for Aeromonas infections was 26%. Aeromonas hydrophila complex was the most common (52%) of the three major complex groups investigated, followed by Aeromonas sobria complex (24%) and Aeromonas caviae complex (23%). None of the eight putative virulence factors was associated with invasiveness or bacteremia.

Conclusions

Primary bacteremia, soft tissue infections, and hepatobiliary tract infections are the three major clinical manifestations of invasive Aeromonas infections in southern Taiwan. This study found no association between the presence of AHCYTOEN, aerA, hlyA, alt, ast, ascV, aexT or ascF-ascG genes in Aeromonas isolates and the development of extra-intestinal infections or bacteremia.

### Infectious colitis excluding E. coli O157: H7 and C. difficile [^d2cdcc25]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Colitic infection caused by a variety of organisms may have an extremely varied presentation, course, and treatment response. Current data have provided great insights into the pathophysiology of these various organisms and their clinical presentation, course, and treatment outcomes. As clinicians develop a better understanding of the colon, its immunologic defense mechanisms, and the virulence factors of such organisms, they will be better able to evaluate these infections as well as newer colonic infections yet unknown. It is important to know if and when to treat such organisms to prevent the dilemma of drug-resistant strains, as seen already in a variety of well-known infections, such as Campylobacter and others. Knowledge of such colonic targets will be more important in an era of ever-growing resistance to and wide use of antibiotic regimens.

### Outbreak of Aeromonas hydrophila wound infections associated with mud football [^32af4f12]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

On 16 February 2002, a total of 26 people presented to the emergency department of the local hospital in the rural town of Collie in southwest Western Australia with many infected scratches and pustules distributed over their bodies. All of the patients had participated in a "mud football" competition the previous day, in which there had been ~100 participants. One patient required removal of an infected thumbnail, and another required surgical debridement of an infected toe. Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated from all 3 patients from whom swab specimens were obtained. To prepare the mud football fields, a paddock was irrigated with water that was pumped from an adjacent river during the 1-month period before the competition. A. hydrophila was subsequently isolated from a water sample obtained from the river. This is the first published report of an outbreak of A. hydrophila wound infections associated with exposure to mud.

### Atypical pneumonias: current clinical concepts focusing on legionnaires' disease [^62dabcfb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides clinicians with an overview of the clinical features of the atypical pneumonias. Atypical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens cause systemic infections with pneumonia. The key to the clinical diagnosis of atypical pneumonias depends on recognizing the characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement different for each pathogen. As Legionella is likely to present as severe pneumonia and does not respond to beta-lactams, it is important to presumptively diagnose Legionnaires' disease clinically so that Legionella coverage is included in empiric therapy. This study reviews the clinical features and nonspecific laboratory markers of atypical pathogens, focusing on Legionnaires' disease.

Recent Findings

Case reports/outbreaks increase our understanding of Legionnaires' disease transmission. Both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophilia pneumoniae may cause asthma. Antimicrobial therapy of Chlamydophilia pneumoniae/Mycoplasma pneumoniae is important to decrease person-to-person spread and to decrease potential long-term sequelae.

Summary

Atypical pulmonary pathogens cause systemic infections accompanied by a variety of characteristic extrapulmonary features. Clinically, it is possible to differentiate Legionnaires' disease from the other typical/atypical pneumonias. Rapid clinical diagnosis of atypical pathogens, particularly Legionnaires' disease, is important in selecting effective empiric therapy and prompting definitive laboratory testing.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^e0b82587]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

A total of 863 patients with traveler's diarrhea were recruited from the Tropical Medicine Unit of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Spain, during the period January 1999–December 2001. All patients completed an epidemiologic questionnaire; their clinical history was taken, and a physical examination was performed. Traveler's diarrhea was defined as the occurrence of three or more episodes of watery stool within a 24-hour period, with or without other symptoms, or the occurrence of unformed stools accompanied by one of the following: vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, fever, chills, prostration, or tenesmus. Persistent diarrhea was defined as that of > 14 days' duration.

Microbiologic Tests

A stool sample was collected, sent to the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, and processed for bacterial, viral, and parasitologic studies. To isolate Aeromonas spp. blood agar supplemented with ampicillin and a selective media, CIN (cefsulodin-irgasan-novobioci) agar, were used. After incubation at 37°C for 24–48 hours, an oxidase test was performed on the colonies compatible with bacilli. Biochemical criteria were used to identify Aeromonas. Identification of the species was performed by 16S rDNA–restriction fragment length polymorphism as previously described. The biotype of A. veronii strains was identified on the basis of a positive reaction to arginine dihydrolase and negative response to bilis-esculin hydrolysis and production of ornithine decarboxylase.

Susceptibility Testing

Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by using an agar disk diffusion method advocated by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Antimicrobial disks (ampicillin 10 μg; cefotaxime 30 μg; chloramphenicol 30 μg; ciprofloxacin 5 μg; nalidixic acid 30 μg; tetracycline 30 μg; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1.25/23.75 μg) were obtained from Becton Dickinson (Cockeysville, MD). E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used as quality-control strains.

### Etiology of acute diarrheal disease and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in children younger than 5 years old in Nepal [^4a15cb50]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparing the frequency of etiological agents between the two surveillance sites, a diarrheal pathogen was detected in 80% of cases at Kanti Children's Hospital compared with 60% at Bharatpur Hospital. Bacterial pathogens were isolated more commonly from stool samples collected at Kanti Children's Hospital and diarrhea associated with bacterial pathogens. Shigella, ETEC, Aeromonas, and Vibrio were observed more frequently at Kanti Children's Hospital than at Bharatpur Hospital. The frequency of viral pathogens (rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, and norovirus) were comparable at the two hospitals.

Infections with multiple organisms were common at both Bharatpur Hospital and Kanti Children's Hospital among both cases and control subjects (29% versus 23% for Bharatpur Hospital and 45% versus 33% for Kanti Children's Hospital) (Table 2). In general, viral infections (rotavirus and norovirus) and the bacterial pathogen EAEC were more common in children during the first 2 years of life, whereas the bacterial pathogens (Shigella, Campylobacter, ETEC, and Vibrio) were more common in children older than 2 years (Table 3). With regard to seasonality, rotavirus was detected more frequently during the winter and dry season (December–April), whereas norovirus cases were found from September through December (Figure 1). Bacterial infections tended to occur more commonly distributed during the summer and rainy season (May–August), with the exception of EAEC, which was seen all year with a peak in May (Figure 1).

Viral infections, rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus tend to present with watery stool without blood (56%–88%) and with vomiting (83%–89%) (Table 4). Shigella infections were associated with fever (76%) and bloody diarrhea (31%). Clinical presentations of infections by Vibrio spp. were similar to viral gastroenteritis, with watery diarrhea without blood (62%) and with vomiting (81%) (Table 4).

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^adfc2243]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea is the most common health problem of international travelers. We determined the prevalence of Aeromonas spp. associated with traveler's diarrhea and analyzed the geographic distribution, clinical features, and antimicrobial susceptibility. Aeromonas spp. were isolated as a cause of traveler's diarrhea in 18 (2%) of 863 patients. A. veronii biotype sobria was isolated in nine patients, A. caviae in seven patients, and A. jandai and A. hydrophila in one patient each. Aeromonas spp. were isolated with a similar prevalence in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Watery and persistent diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps were common complaints. All strains were resistant to ampicillin; showed variable resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole; and were susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid. The persistence of symptoms made antimicrobial treatment necessary.

### Waterborne infections in Reunion island, 2010–2017 [^ea4933b6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Gram-negative bacilli Vibrio spp. Aeromonas spp., and Shewanella spp. are a major cause of severe waterborne infection. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and microbiological characteristics and prognosis of patients hospitalized in Reunion Island for a waterborne infection. This retrospective study was conducted in the two university hospitals of Reunion Island between January 2010 and March 2017. Patients diagnosed with a Vibrio, Aeromonas, or Shewanella infection were evaluated. Over the study period, 112 aquatic strains were isolated at Reunion Island: Aeromonas spp. were found in 91 patients (81.3%), Shewanella spp. in 13 patients (11.6%), and Vibrio spp. in eight patients (7.2%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 11.6%. The main sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (44.6%) and the abdomen (19.6%). Infections were polymicrobial in 70 cases (62.5%). The most commonly prescribed empiric antibiotic regimen was amoxicillin-clavulanate (34.8%). Eighty-four percent of the aquatic strains were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and more than > 95% were susceptible to third or fourth generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. After multivariate analysis, the only independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality was the presence of sepsis (P < 0.0001). In Reunion Island, the most commonly isolated aquatic microorganisms were Aeromonas spp. Sepsis caused by aquatic microorganisms was frequent (> 50%) and associated with higher in-hospital mortality. This study suggests that empiric antibiotic regimens in patients with sepsis or septic shock caused by suspected aquatic microorganisms (tropical climate, skin lesion exposed to seawater…) should include broad-spectrum antibiotics (third or fourth generation cephalosporins).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^8c521c48]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

### Clinical implications and characterization of group A streptoccoccus infections in adults with cystic fibrosis [^bfa53b9c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease amongst Caucasians. Typically affected organs include the sinuses, lungs, gastrointestinal system and the male reproductive system. Pulmonary complications (both acute and chronic) are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult CF population. CF lungs are classically characterized by viscous secretions as well as impaired mucociliary clearance. These factors compromise airway clearance creating an optimal environment for bacterial colonization, inflammation, chronic infection, and eventually, bronchiectasis.

The cultured microbiome of the CF respiratory system is well-characterized and unique from other forms of chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of lung microbiology in the CF population continues to evolve. Traditional perceptions focused on chronic colonization with classical CF pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Burkholderia cepacia complex. Other microorganisms such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter species, and mycobacteria have been identified as emerging CF pathogens in the last two decades. Whereas traditional pathogens like P. aeruginosa and B. cenocepacia have clearly been associated with adverse outcomes, the clinical implications are less clear with many emerging pathogens. Furthermore, it is apparent that CF airways disease may exist in both stable (classical CF pathogens) and dynamic states (non-classical pathogens whose presence in the CF airways disease is usually only temporary). How these transient infections affect CF outcomes is entirely unknown. Consequently, clinicians are posed with unique management challenges when these atypical microbes are isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of CF patients.

### Ciprofloxacin-resistant Aeromonas infection following leech therapy for digit replantation: report of 2 cases [^d954e1bf]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Medicinal leeches are commonly used after finger replantation to treat surgically unsalvageable venous congestion. Infection from Aeromonas hydrophila is a recognized complication of leech therapy that can be underestimated by the medical community. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are the most commonly recommended prophylactic antibiotics used to prevent A. hydrophila infections during leech therapy. Here, we report 2 cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant Aeromonas infections, occurring within 4 months of each other. Both cases developed after leech therapy for unsuccessful digital replantation. These infections were successfully treated with ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin-resistant Aeromonas should be recognized when determining prophylactic antibiotic protocols for replant centers when leech therapy is used for finger replantation.

### Aeromonas isolates from human diarrheic stool and groundwater compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [^e683cd73]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The Safe Drinking Water Act amendment of 1996 requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a list of contaminants of public health concern that are known or anticipated to occur in drinking water systems and may require future regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The list, known as the Contaminant Candidate List, is intended to generate scientific research that will assist the EPA in creating new regulations to protect the public from health risks associated with drinking water. Currently, the putatively emerging enteric pathogen, Aeromonas hydrophila, is included in the list because it has the potential to grow in water distribution systems, especially in biofilms, where it may be resistant to chlorination. However, the role of drinking water consumption in Aeromonas infections is unclear.

Three phenotypically defined species, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biotype sobria, constitute 85% of all clinical isolates involved with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal infections. Whether Aeromonas is indeed a causative agent of gastroenteritis has been debated. Numerous case reports have described isolating Aeromonas from patients with acute diarrhea, but the bacterium can also be isolated from stool of healthy persons. Determining the enteropathogenicity of Aeromonas has been inconclusive, probably because of differences in diarrheagenic potential among strains. A consensus appears to be growing that certain strains are likely human enteric pathogens.

Aeromonas is ubiquitous in water, including chlorinated drinking water. In surface water, Aeromonas abundance peaks in the warm summer and fall months. In one municipality, the seasonal increase in Aeromonas detection in the drinking water supply matched the peak occurrence of clinical isolates. Aeromonas also occurs in groundwater, and in a single well, the same strain can persist for years. Some strains of Aeromonas isolated from water have been shown to possess virulence traits, such as adhesions, hemolysins, and cytotonic enterotoxins, presumably involved with human pathogenicity.

If Aeromonas enteric infections are transmitted by drinking water and symptomatic infections are strain-specific, then the same strains isolated from patients with acute gastroenteritis should be found in drinking water. The objective of this study was to isolate Aeromonas from patients with acute diarrhea and, by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), compare the molecular fingerprints of these isolates with isolates from the patients' drinking water.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^97168360]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Results

Distribution and Geographic Origin of Species Causing Traveler's Diarrhea

Aeromonas spp. were isolated as a cause of traveler's diarrhea in 18 (2%) of 863 patients. A. veronii biotype sobria was isolated in nine patients, A. caviae in seven patients, and A. jandaei and A. hydrophila in one patient each (Table 1). In three of these patients, another enteropathogen was also found: in one patient who had traveled to Mexico, Shigella sonnei was isolated together with A. veronii; in another patient traveling to India, Giardia lamblia was detected together with A. veronii; in the third patient, who had traveled to Thailand, Salmonella Typhimurium was found with A. veronii. The frequency of Aeromonas spp. as a cause of traveler's diarrhea was similar in patients returning from Africa (1.7%), Latin America (1.8%), and Asia (2.3%) (Table 1).

Clinical Features

The signs and symptoms of Aeromonas enteritis in these 18 patients are summarized in Table 2. Sixteen of the 18 patients had watery diarrhea; these were the cases associated with A. veronii biotype sobria and A. caviae. The patients with enteritis caused by A. hydrophila and A. jandaei had loose stools. Fifty percent of the patients had fever and abdominal cramps, whereas nausea and vomiting were uncommon complaints. Gross blood was observed in the stools of one patient, but this could be attributed to the S. sonnei isolated in the same stool. In 9 of the 18 patients, diarrhea was persistent.

### Recreational waterborne illnesses: recognition, treatment, and prevention [^591b0a77]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Illness after recreational water activities can be caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, algae, and even chlorine gas. These illnesses are more common in summer. Waterborne illnesses are underreported because most recreational activity occurs in unsupervised venues or on private property, and participants tend to disperse before illness occurs. Symptoms of waterborne illness are primarily gastrointestinal, but upper respiratory and skin manifestations also occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms are usually self-limited, and supportive treatment may be all that is necessary. However, some infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Cryptosporidium and Giardia intestinalis are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness and have partial chlorine resistance. Respiratory infections are typically mild and self-limited. However, if legionnaires' disease develops and is unrecognized, mortality may be as high as 10%. Cellulitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus can result in serious illness, amputation, and death. Early and appropriate antibiotic treatment is important. Chronically ill and immunocompromised persons are at high risk of infection and should be counseled accordingly.

### Aeromonas isolates from human diarrheic stool and groundwater compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [^78ead15e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal infections of Aeromonas species are generally considered waterborne; for this reason, Aeromonas hydrophila has been placed on the United States Environmental Protection Agency Contaminant Candidate List of emerging pathogens in drinking water. In this study, we compared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of Aeromonas isolates from stool specimens of patients with diarrhea with Aeromonas isolates from patients' drinking water. Among 2,565 diarrheic stool specimens submitted to a Wisconsin clinical reference laboratory, 17 (0.66%) tested positive for Aeromonas. Groundwater isolates of Aeromonas were obtained from private wells throughout Wisconsin and the drinking water of Aeromonas -positive patients. The analysis showed that the stool and drinking water isolates were genetically unrelated, suggesting that in this population Aeromonas gastrointestinal infections were not linked with groundwater exposures.

Compromised flap perfusion can lead to the use of leech therapy to aid in flap salvage. Aeromonas hydrophila, a symbiont of the leech, is a well-known bacterial pathogen that has the potential to cause infection in patients receiving leech therapy. Ciprofloxacin is commonly regarded as the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis against this pathogen. We present patient who underwent leech therapy during salvage attempts for a venous congested flap. A resultant infection developed despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Culture sensitivities indicated that A. hydrophila was resistant to ciprofloxacin.

### Aeromonas isolates from human diarrheic stool and groundwater compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [^d0a2cab6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence rate in this study was lower than rates from other large surveillance studies in the United States for Aeromonas in stool. Aeromonas was cultured from 2,848 diarrheic stool specimens submitted to a Los Angeles, California, hospital in the early 1980s and 80 (2.8%) were positive. Among 1,821 patients with diarrhea visiting a clinic in La Crosse, Wisconsin, during an 18-month period, Agger et al. identified 20 (1.1%) that were positive for A. hydrophila. Moyer examined 3,334 diarrheic stool specimens submitted by physicians over a 2-year period to an Iowa public health laboratory and found 238 (7.1%) positive for either A. caviae, A. hydrophila, or A. sobria. Isolation in the latter study included an alkaline peptone water enrichment step, which may explain the higher prevalence rate. In our study, the specimen prevalence rate was 0.66%, and this rate was likely biased upwards because stool specimens were collected only in the summer and fall months when the incidence of Aeromonas gastrointestinal infections is reportedly highest. The data, albeit limited, do not suggest that the prevalence of Aeromonas enteric infections is increasing in the United States. Worldwide, the isolation rate of Aeromonas from diarrheic stool has been reported as high as 10.8% and as low as 0%. In the latter study, recently conducted in Melbourne, Australia, during a 68-week observation period, 795 fecal specimens were collected from city residents with highly credible gastroenteritis. Aeromonas was not detected in any of the fecal specimens, even though 50% of water samples drawn weekly from the drinking water distribution mains serving the study participants were Aeromonas -positive.

### Rapid detection of carbapenemase production inusing phenotypic tests based on colorimetric microtube assay [^3c349d1c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Aeromonas, significant opportunistic pathogens, are widely distributed across diverse ecological environments and can infect both humans and animals, positioning them as crucial indicators for monitoring antimicrobial resistance from a "One Health" perspective. Currently, 36 species of Aeromonas have been identified, with at least 19 capable of causing human infections, predominantly including Aeromonas caviae (37.26%), Aeromonas dhakensis (23.49%), Aeromonas veronii (21.54%), and Aeromonas hydrophila (13.07%). Studies have shown that both the VITEK2 and MALDI-TOF Biotyper systems are effective in accurately identifying Aeromonas at the genus level. However, they encounter significant challenges with species-level identification, leading to notable discrepancies. In light of these limitations, we chose not to differentiate between species and instead concentrated our analysis at the genus level to minimize the risk of misidentification. The escalating emergence of antibiotic resistance in Aeromonas, particularly to carbapenems, has garnered widespread attention. Although carbapenem resistance in Aeromonas is primarily mediated by chromosomal bla CphA, plasmid-associated carbapenem resistance genes such as bla KPC, bla VIM, bla IMP, bla NDM, and bla OXA have also been identified. Aeromonas can serve as a reservoir for disseminating resistance genes among humans, animals, and the environment. Studies indicate that conventional AST often fails to fully detect carbapenem-resistant strains. Our prospective trial identified 97 isolates carrying carbapenem resistance genes, accounting for 63.8%. However, the resistance rate of four carbapenems in susceptibility tests ranged from 22.4% to 58.6%, potentially missing some CphA-positive strains, indicating that the VITEK2 system cannot be solely relied upon for accurate identification of carbapenemase-producing organisms. Consequently, early identification of carbapenem-resistant Aeromonas is essential for effective anti-infection treatment and antimicrobial management.

### Burden and aetiology of diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children in developing countries (the global enteric multicenter study, GEMS): a prospective, case-control study [^34d8c1bb]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diarrhoeal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income countries. We designed the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to identify the aetiology and population-based burden of paediatric diarrhoeal disease in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

Methods

The GEMS is a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children aged 0–59 months residing in censused populations at four sites in Africa and three in Asia. We recruited children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea seeking care at health centres along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. From patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and controls, we obtained clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and a faecal sample to identify enteropathogens at enrolment; one follow-up home visit was made about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth.

Findings

We enrolled 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and 13,129 control children without diarrhoea. By analysing adjusted population attributable fractions, most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Other pathogens were important in selected sites (eg, Aeromonas, Vibrio cholerae O1, Campylobacter jejuni). Odds of dying during follow-up were 8.5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea than in controls (odd ratio 8.5, 95% CI 5.8–12.5, p < 0.0001); most deaths (167 [87.9%]) occurred during the first 2 years of life. Pathogens associated with increased risk of case death were ST-ETEC (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9; 0.99–3.5) and typical enteropathogenic E coli (HR 2.6; 1.6–4.1) in infants aged 0–11 months, and Cryptosporidium (HR 2.3; 1.3–4.3) in toddlers aged 12–23 months.

Interpretation

Interventions targeting five pathogens (rotavirus, Shigella, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium, typical enteropathogenic E coli) can substantially reduce the burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. New methods and accelerated implementation of existing interventions (rotavirus vaccine and zinc) are needed to prevent disease and improve outcomes.

### Detection and whole-genome sequencing of carbapenemase-producing Aeromonas hydrophila isolates from routine perirectal surveillance culture [^fcafe886]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Perirectal surveillance cultures and a stool culture grew Aeromonas species from three patients over a 6-week period and were without epidemiological links. Detection of the blaKPC-2 gene in one isolate prompted inclusion of non-Enterobacteriaceae in our surveillance culture workup. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that the isolates were unrelated and provided data for Aeromonas reference genomes.

### Aeromonas isolates from human diarrheic stool and groundwater compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [^df69952b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Results

Cultures for Aeromonas were performed on 2,565 diarrheic stool specimens from 2,310 patients. The median age of the patient population was 37 years (range 4 days to 97 years), and 55% were female. Most specimens (97.6%) were from patients residing in Wisconsin, primarily the central portion of the state, where groundwater, either from a municipal system or private well, is the source of drinking water (Figure 1). Some specimens came from communities along Lake Michigan where lake water is the source of drinking water.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility

The antimicrobial susceptibility of Aeromonas spp. isolates causing traveler's diarrhea is shown in Table 3. All strains were resistant to ampicillin but susceptible to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid. The susceptibility to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole varied. Some 66.6% of A. veronii biotype sobria strains and 71.4% of A. caviae strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol; 55.6% of A. veronii biotype sobria strains and 71.4% of the A. caviae strains were susceptible to tetracycline; and 77.8% of A. veronii biotype sobria and 100% of A. caviae were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of Aeromonas spp. causing traveler's diarrhea

Treatment

While travelling, two patients received treatment, amoxicillin in one case and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in the other. Patients with persistent diarrhea were treated with the following antibiotics: norfloxacin (one patient), ciprofloxacin (six patients), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (two patients); all recovered.

### Pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae in children: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^eb0cc08b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

The term "atypical" pneumonia has been used to differentiate infections caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella, and other related organisms from pneumonia caused by classic bacteria, the prototype being Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, recent studies demonstrated that the clinical presentation of pneumonia due to atypical pathogens cannot readily be differentiated from those caused by "typical" bacteria. This is further complicated by the observation that coinfections with atypical pathogens and other bacteria are frequent. Nonetheless, the term "atypical" can be useful, as these organisms share a number of characteristics that separate them from "typical" bacteria. They are either obligate or facultative intracellular parasites that cannot be isolated using routine microbiologic methods. The most commonly used method of diagnosis of these infections is serology, which has significant limitations. Although C. pneumoniae is now recognized worldwide as a common cause of respiratory infections in adults and children, major gaps remain in our knowledge of the biology of this organism and how it causes disease, in major part due to the lack of readily available, standardized diagnostic methods.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections" caused by E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii, but "Ceftriaxone is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis… when susceptibility is demonstrated". The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Acute diarrhoea in children treated in an outpatient setting in athens, Greece [^0d7713eb]. The Journal of Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the epidemiology and aetiology of acute diarrhoea among children treated exclusively in an outpatient setting in Greece.

Methods

During 1999, children with acute diarrhoea who attended the emergency department of our hospital were prospectively studied. Patients requiring hospitalization were excluded. Stool specimens were tested microscopically, for bacterial enteropathogens by standard and selective medium cultures and for rotavirus and adenovirus by latex agglutination test.

Results

One hundred and thirty-two children (median age: 2 years) were included in the study; an enteropathogen was detected in 63 (48%) of them. Isolates included rotavirus (19 patients), Salmonella sp (12), Campylobacter sp (10), Aeromonas sp (9), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (6), adenovirus (6), Giardia lamblia (4), Yersinia enterocolitica (2) and Shigella sp (1). Half of the bacterial cases occurred from August to October, and two rotavirus-associated peaks occurred during February and August. Acute diarrhoea caused by viruses affected exclusively children under six years of age, mainly those attending day care centres. Macroscopic blood in stools was reported only among patients with a bacterial infection. Socioeconomic characteristics were not helpful in differentiating disease due to specific enteropathogens.

Conclusions

Bacterial enteropathogens account for a significant proportion of acute diarrhoea in children treated in the outpatient setting in Greece. Rotavirus is also a frequent cause affecting mostly younger children and those attending day care centers. The presence of blood in stools and the seasonality of bacterial infections may enable their presumptive diagnosis.

### Clinical relevance of the recently described species Aeromonas aquariorum [^a5f28410]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Twenty-two human extraintestinal isolates (11 from blood) and three isolates recovered from patients with diarrhea were genetically characterized as Aeromonas aquariorum, a novel species known only from ornamental fish. The isolates proved to bear a considerable number of virulence genes, and all were resistant to amoxicillin (amoxicilline), cephalothin (cefalotin), and cefoxitin. Biochemical differentiation from the most relevant clinical species is provided.
