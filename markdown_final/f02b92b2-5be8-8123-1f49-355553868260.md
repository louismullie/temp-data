Primary spontaneous pneumorhorax

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about primary spontaneous pneumothorax management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PSP and establishing the clinical context. Then, I should appraise the historical evidence gaps and why practice varied. Next, I will examine the highest-quality contemporary trials and meta-analyses to anchor current practice. After that, I need to integrate guideline recommendations and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and highlight special populations and uncertainties, making sure I verify each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. PSP is a spontaneous pneumothorax in patients without clinically apparent underlying lung disease, classically affecting tall, thin, young males, with an incidence around 17–24 per 100,000 per year in men and 1–6 per 100,000 per year in women, and a notable recurrence risk of roughly 20–30% at one year, which frames counseling and follow-up decisions [^d6051271] [^f3c27d93].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management before I review the historical evidence base. Historically, there was a paucity of high-quality comparative trials, with a 2014 Cochrane review finding zero completed RCTs comparing conservative versus interventional management and calling for randomized trials, which explains why practice varied widely and was largely consensus-driven rather than evidence-based [^b21b7e90].

> Next, I should review the pivotal contemporary trials that shifted the paradigm. The 2020 NEJM RCT in 316 patients with first-known, moderate-to-large PSP showed that conservative management was noninferior to immediate intervention for lung reexpansion at 8 weeks, with fewer serious adverse events and less need for procedures, supporting observation-first strategies in stable patients [^59aa2e7c] [^80bd6820]. The RAMPP trial demonstrated that ambulatory management with a one-way valve device reduced hospital stay by a median of 2 days versus standard care, albeit with more adverse events, many device-related, underscoring the need for appropriate selection and follow-up infrastructure [^8dbc7c4a] [^177a0be1]. The EXPRED noninferiority trial in complete PSP found aspiration had higher immediate failure than chest tube but was better tolerated and had similar 1-year recurrence, reinforcing that symptom relief and patient-centered outcomes matter as much as radiographic success [^7e17041e] [^6ee99522].

> I will now examine meta-analyses to synthesize across studies. A 2023 Chest meta-analysis and cost-utility analysis concluded that observation was the dominant strategy in most simulations, with shorter length of stay and lower cost, and similar recurrence across strategies, aligning with a shift toward conservative-first care when safe [^a7a06c1c]. A 2021 meta-analysis likewise found conservative management had similar success and lower complications than interventional care, though heterogeneity and the need for more RCTs were acknowledged [^fbd778b3].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The 2023 BTS guideline recommends considering conservative management for minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic PSP regardless of size, and supports ambulatory management where expertise and follow-up exist, while still allowing needle aspiration or tube drainage when conservative care is unsuitable or fails [^96343c10] [^210e7522] [^6c0299bb]. The 2024 ERS/EACTS/ESTS guideline similarly endorses conservative management in selected, stable patients and prioritizes needle aspiration over chest tube drainage when intervention is needed, with outpatient pathways considered where appropriate [^fc5460bf] [^481eb1cd] [^6a2e1cec].

> Wait, let me verify how to reconcile apparent contradictions between older and newer guidance. Earlier pathways emphasized intervention for large or symptomatic PSP, but emerging high-quality evidence shows that many such patients can still be managed conservatively or with less invasive options if stable, so the modern approach is to treat the patient rather than the X-ray, reserving escalation for failure or instability rather than size alone [^6bed61fa] [^1fed9c59].

> I should double-check prognostic modifiers that influence failure risk and timing of intervention. Presenting on the same day as symptom onset is associated with higher treatment failure, possibly due to ongoing air leak or selection bias, whereas delayed presentation may reflect spontaneous sealing and better outcomes with conservative care, which is a key clinical nuance for shared decision-making [^718be5e0] [^aada4c69]. Larger pneumothorax size correlates with longer treatment duration but not necessarily higher failure in RCTs, and digital air leak quantification can help predict prolonged leak and guide early surgical referral in high-flow cases [^c3cde889] [^bd2c21c8].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and extrapolated from adult data; conservative management appears reasonable in stable children, with surgery reserved for recurrence or persistent air leak, and aspiration has been de-emphasized in some centers pending better pediatric-specific data [^0e1b5f44] [^120460eb]. In pregnancy, case series suggest that less invasive options like aspiration can be safe with individualized planning, though evidence is sparse and multidisciplinary care is essential [^0c2f47c0]. For secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, ambulatory strategies are not recommended initially due to higher risk, so inpatient observation or tube drainage remains standard [^943f159e].

> I need to ensure I address recurrence prevention and when to escalate definitively. Recurrence after a first episode is common, around 20–30% at one year, and risk is higher with smoking, low BMI, and certain CT features; chemical pleurodesis with minocycline after successful aspiration reduces recurrence compared with aspiration alone, and surgical options such as VATS with bullectomy and pleural procedure are appropriate for recurrent or persistent PSP, with pleural abrasion and apical pleurectomy offering similar recurrence prevention in meta-analyses [^f3c27d93] [^0c3518a6] [^30052108]. Early surgery can be considered in patients prioritizing recurrence prevention or those with high-risk features or occupations, balancing morbidity and patient preferences [^e9c0a2b4].

> But wait, what about practical implementation and safety netting. Ambulatory care requires reliable follow-up, patient education, and pathways for rapid reassessment if symptoms worsen; serious adverse events in RAMPP were mostly device-related and manageable, and cost-effectiveness analyses suggest substantial savings despite readmissions, supporting ambulatory models where systems allow [^8dbc7c4a] [^6dc11020]. Standardized protocols can reduce length of stay and imaging without increasing recurrence, reinforcing the value of system-level approaches to care [^e8e40083].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, risk-stratified algorithm and sanity-check each branch. For stable, minimally symptomatic patients, observation with interval imaging is preferred regardless of size; for symptomatic or larger PSP in stable patients, needle aspiration is reasonable and may avoid tube thoracostomy; for those requiring intervention with good support, ambulatory one-way valve devices can shorten hospitalization; reserve chest tube drainage for failure of less invasive measures, ongoing air leak, or instability; and consider early surgical referral for persistent air leak, recurrence, bilateral disease, high-risk occupations, or patient preference for recurrence prevention, aligning with BTS and ERS/EACTS/ESTS guidance [^96343c10] [^481eb1cd] [^e9c0a2b4].

> Finally, I should confirm key uncertainties and research directions so counseling is honest. We still need better predictors of treatment failure beyond symptom onset timing, clearer pediatric-specific guidance, and head-to-head comparisons of aspiration versus ambulatory devices versus observation in diverse settings; digital air leak monitoring and CT-based risk scores are promising but require validation and integration into decision tools [^718be5e0] [^bd2c21c8] [^3db6c387].

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a **lung collapse without trauma** in patients without underlying lung disease, most often in tall, thin, young men [^d6051271]. Management is **symptom-driven**, not size-based: observe if stable, aspirate if symptomatic, and use a chest tube only if aspiration fails or the patient deteriorates [^96343c10] [^481eb1cd]. Conservative management is **noninferior to intervention** for lung re-expansion and has fewer serious adverse events, while ambulatory devices can reduce hospital stay but increase adverse events [^59aa2e7c] [^8dbc7c4a]. Recurrence is common (20–50%), so counsel on smoking cessation and consider pleurodesis or surgery after recurrence or persistent air leak [^f3c27d93] [^e9c0a2b4].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

PSP predominantly affects **young, tall, thin males**, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 6:1 [^d6051271]. The incidence is **17–24 per 100,000 per year in men** and 1–6 per 100,000 per year in women [^d6051271]. Smoking significantly increases risk, and genetic predisposition may contribute in familial cases [^d6051271].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Sudden pleuritic chest pain**: Often sharp and localized [^7c555d68].
- **Dyspnea**: Usually mild to moderate, proportional to pneumothorax size [^6ee99522].
- **Minimal respiratory distress**: Unless tension physiology develops [^6ee99522].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on **chest radiography** to confirm pneumothorax and estimate size; CT is reserved for equivocal cases or to detect blebs/bullae [^notfound]. Size is measured from the chest wall to the lung apex; a distance > 2 cm is considered large [^27be284a].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **guided by symptoms, stability, and size**, with a trend toward conservative care [^fc5460bf].

| **Management approach** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Observation | - Minimal or asymptomatic <br/> - Stable vitals <br/> - Small to moderate size | - Safe <br/> - 79% success <br/> - Shorter stay [^f8379aaf] [^a7a06c1c] |
| Needle aspiration | - Symptomatic <br/> - Moderate size <br/> - Stable | - 60–70% success <br/> - Shorter stay <br/> - Less pain than tube [^2e6e123b] [^7e17041e] |
| Chest tube drainage | - Failed aspiration <br/> - Large/symptomatic <br/> - Tension physiology | - High success <br/> - Longer stay <br/> - More pain/complications [^2e6e123b] [^7e17041e] |
| Ambulatory devices | - Selected stable patients <br/> - Expertise available | - Reduced stay <br/> - More adverse events [^8dbc7c4a] [^177a0be1] |
| Surgery (VATS) | - Recurrence <br/> - Persistent air leak <br/> - High-risk occupations | - Low recurrence (< 5%) <br/> - Effective prevention [^notfound] |

---

## Recent evidence and guidelines

Recent RCTs and meta-analyses show that **conservative management is noninferior to intervention** for lung re-expansion and has fewer serious adverse events [^59aa2e7c] [^fbd778b3]. Ambulatory management reduces hospital stay but increases adverse events, so patient selection is key [^8dbc7c4a] [^6dc11020]. Current guidelines emphasize **symptom-based care**, with observation for stable patients and needle aspiration preferred over chest tubes when intervention is needed [^96343c10] [^481eb1cd].

---

## Recurrence and prevention

Recurrence is common (20–50%), especially in smokers and those with blebs/bullae [^f3c27d93]. Smoking cessation is essential, and **pleurodesis or surgery** should be considered after recurrence or persistent air leak [^e9c0a2b4].

---

## Complications

Potential complications include:

- **Tension pneumothorax**: Life-threatening, requires immediate decompression [^4be98b19].
- **Re-expansion pulmonary edema**: Rare, associated with rapid lung re-expansion [^a8434ad3].
- **Infection**: Rare with sterile technique [^cb27defd].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** with appropriate management; most patients recover fully, though recurrence is common and may require definitive interventions [^f3c27d93].

---

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is best managed with a **symptom-driven approach**, favoring observation or aspiration over chest tubes, and reserving surgery for recurrence or persistent air leak. Conservative strategies are effective and safer, while ambulatory care can reduce hospitalization when carefully selected.

### Conservative versus interventional management for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults [^b21b7e90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is widely managed according to size with interventional techniques based on practice guidelines. Interventional management is not without complications and observational data suggest conservative management works. The current guidelines are based on expert consensus rather than evidence, and a systematic review may help in identifying evidence for this practice.

Objectives

The objective of the review is to compare conservative and interventional treatments of adult primary spontaneous pneumothorax for outcomes of clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1920 to 26th June 2014); EMBASE via Ovid SP (1947 to 26th June 2014); CINAHL via EBSCO host (1980 to 26th June 2014); and ISI Web of Science (1945 to 26th June 2014). We searched ongoing trials via the relevant databases and contacted authors. We also searched the 'grey literature'.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and we accepted quasi-RCTs if a systematic method of allocation was used. Participants were limited to adults aged 18 to 50 years, with their first symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax with radiological evidence and no underlying lung disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of five authors independently reviewed all studies in the search criteria and made inclusions and exclusions according to the selection criteria. No statistical methods were necessary as there were no included trials.

Main Results

We identified 358 studies with duplicates removed. There were three potentially relevant studies that we excluded as they were not randomized controlled trials. There was one ongoing trial that was relevant and we contacted the authors and confirmed the study is ongoing at June 2014. We will update this review when this ongoing study is completed.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no completed randomized controlled trials comparing conservative and interventional management for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for current guidelines in management and a need for randomized controlled trials comparing conservative and interventional management for this condition.

### Treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^f94f1eb1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Initial treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax poses dilemmas for clinicians as size classification systems and current treatment guidelines differ in their approaches, and underlying evidence is weak. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent evidence and highlight remaining evidence gaps.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm significant variation in practice. New evidence suggests that conservative management may be a viable option in a wider range of patients than previously thought (including some large pneumothoraces), with a reported clinical success rate of 79%. New data regarding aspiration report similar treatment success rates and shorter hospitalizations than chest tube drainage; however, methodological issues challenge these findings. There are conflicting data about the prognostic implications of computed tomography-identified pulmonary dystrophia.

Summary

Initial management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is controversial, and there remains little high-quality evidence to guide decision-making. International differences in classification systems and management recommendations make meaningful pooling of clinical trials difficult. This makes a strong case for international agreement about study methodology in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons. Recent evidence suggests that conservative management may be a viable option and argues for its place in much needed randomized trials.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^3327b0d9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology with an incidence of 17–24 and 1–6 per 100 000 population per annum for men and women, respectively. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients with no underlying lung disease.

The optimal initial treatment regime for PSP is not yet defined. Options include conservative management, aspiration or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. International guidelines and expert consensus statements vary. Recently updated British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest treatment should be offered to patients with symptomatic pneumothorax. Previous guidelines suggested aspiration as initial treatment, followed by chest tube insertion, if unsuccessful. If admitted, then the average hospital stay is 4–5 days. Patients with ongoing pneumothorax (ongoing air leak and/or the lung not fully re-expanded on chest radiograph (CXR)) by days 4–5 have 'failed' medical treatment and should be referred for surgical management.

Currently, there are no validated predictive models for treatment failure in patients with PSP. No prior studies have investigated the relationship between patient symptoms and outcomes.

We hypothesised that patients with longer symptom duration and higher symptom scores would be more likely to fail treatment.

### Management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^eae6d4d4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains the subject of considerable controversy. During the last few years, however, interesting new data on pathogenesis and various treatment techniques have been published, which have led to the publication of some interesting and thought-provoking opinion articles. The author reviews the latest developments in pneumothorax pathophysiology and management.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^f69ed578]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and objective

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology but optimal initial treatment regime is not well defined. Treatment options including conservative management, needle aspiration (NA) or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. Recent large randomised controlled trials may change the treatment paradigm: comparing conservative and ambulatory management to standard care, but current guidelines need to be updated. The aim of this study was to assess the current "state of play" in the management of pneumothorax in the UK.

Methods

Physicians and respiratory healthcare staff were invited to complete an online survey on the initial and subsequent management of pneumothorax.

Results

This study is the first survey of pneumothorax practice across the UK, which highlights variation in practice: 50% would manage a large primary pneumothorax with minimal symptoms conservatively, compared to only 3% if there were significant symptoms; 64% use suction if the pneumothorax had not resolved after > 2 days, 15% always clamp the chest drain prior to removal; whereas 30% never do. NICE guidance recommends the use of digital suction but this has not translated into widespread usage: only 23% use digital suction to check for resolution of air leak).

Conclusion

Whilst there has always been allowance for individual clinician preference in guidelines, there needs to be consensus on the optimum management strategy. The challenge the new guidelines face is to design a simple and pragmatic approach, using this new evidence base.

### Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: an American College of Chest Physicians Delphi consensus statement [^329a6410]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Provide explicit expert-based consensus recommendations for the management of adults with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces in an emergency department and inpatient hospital setting. The use of opinion was made explicit by employing a structured questionnaire, appropriateness scores, and consensus scores with a Delphi technique. The guideline was designed to be relevant to physicians who make management decisions for the care of patients with pneumothorax.

Options

Decisions for observation, chest tube placement, surgical interventions, and radiographic imaging.

Outcomes

Effectiveness of pneumothorax resolution, duration of and patient tolerance of care, and pneumothorax recurrence.

Evidence

Literature review from 1967 to January 1999 and Delphi questionnaire submitted in three iterations to a multidisciplinary physician panel.

Values

The guideline development group determined by consensus the relevant outcomes to be considered in developing the Delphi questionnaire.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

The type and magnitude of benefits, harms, and costs expected for patients from guideline implementation.

Recommendations

Management decisions vary between patients with primary or secondary pneumothoraces, with observation of small pneumothoraces being appropriate only for primary pneumothoraces. The level of consensus varies regarding the specific interventions indicated, but agreement exists for the general principles of care.

Validation

Recommendations were peer reviewed by physician experts and were reviewed by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Health and Science Policy Committee.

Implementation

The guideline recommendations will be published in printed and electronic form with distribution of synopses for patients and health care providers. Contents of the guideline will be incorporated into continuing medical education programs.

Sponsors

The ACCP.

### Simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults [^2e6e123b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

For management of pneumothorax that occurs without underlying lung disease, also referred to as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, simple aspiration is technically easier to perform than intercostal tube drainage. In this systematic review, we seek to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. This review was first published in 2007 and was updated in 2017.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017); and Embase (1980 to January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry for ongoing trials (January 2017). We checked the reference lists of included trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults 18 years of age and older with primary spontaneous pneumothorax that compared simple aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. We combined studies using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Of 2332 publications obtained through the search strategy, seven studies met the inclusion criteria; one study was ongoing and six studies of 435 participants were eligible for inclusion in the updated review. Data show a significant difference in immediate success rates of procedures favouring tube drainage over simple aspiration for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.89; 435 participants, 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Duration of hospitalization however was significantly less for patients treated by simple aspiration (mean difference (MD) -1.66, 95% CI -2.28 to -1.04; 387 participants, 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence). A narrative synthesis of evidence revealed that simple aspiration led to fewer adverse events (245 participants, 3 studies; low-quality evidence), but data suggest no differences between groups in terms of one-year success rate (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.18; 318 participants, 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence), hospitalization rate (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.47; 245 participants, 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), and patient satisfaction (median between-group difference of 0.5 on a scale from 1 to 10; 48 participants, 1 study; low-quality evidence). No studies provided data on cost-effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

Available trials showed low to moderate-quality evidence that intercostal tube drainage produced higher rates of immediate success, while simple aspiration resulted in a shorter duration of hospitalization. Although adverse events were reported more commonly for patients treated with tube drainage, the low quality of the evidence warrants caution in interpreting these findings. Similarly, although this review observed no differences between groups when early failure rate, one-year success rate, or hospital admission rate was evaluated, this too needs to be put into the perspective of the quality of evidence, specifically, for evidence of very low and low quality for hospitalization rate and patient satisfaction, respectively. Future adequately powered research is needed to strengthen the evidence presented in this review.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^718be5e0]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) occurs when air leaks into the pleural space in patients without known underlying lung disease, causing pain and breathlessness. Optimal management of PSP is not defined and we are unable to predict who will fail medical treatment (ongoing pneumothorax with prolonged air leak). We hypothesised that patients with longer symptom duration and higher symptom scores would be more likely to fail treatment.

Methods

Prospectively collected data from the Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax randomised controlled trial of ambulatory management were used to determine which clinical factors are associated with treatment failure including symptom scores, time from symptom onset to presentation, treatment allocation, vital signs, history of prior pneumothorax and size of initial pneumothorax.

Results

Overall, 63/236 patients (26.7%) failed treatment. On average, symptoms started 1day before admission. Multivariable analysis found that patients who presented at least 1day after symptoms began had a lower risk of treatment failure than those presenting on the day symptoms began (ORs 0.39 (0.18 to 0.81)).

Conclusion

Further work is required to determine psychological drivers of PSP presentation and risks of prolonged air leak.

### Observation, aspiration, or tube thoracostomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and cost-utility analysis [^a7a06c1c]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) has several commonly used management strategies: observation, aspiration, and chest tube placement. Economic modelling of pooled data comparing techniques has not been performed.

Research Question

Based on studies from the past 20 years, which approach to management of PSP delivers the highest utility?

Study Design and Methods

A systematic review of PSP management strategies (observation, aspiration, or chest tube placement) included in the Medline and EMBASE databases from January 1, 2000, through April 10, 2020, was conducted. Text screening, bias assessment, and data extraction were performed by two authors (G. E. and C. A. P.). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined a priori. The primary outcome was PSP resolution after the initial intervention. Secondary outcomes were PSP recurrence, length of stay, rate of surgical management, and complications. The meta-analysis compared treatment arms; dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RRs) and continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences. A cost-utility analysis within the Canadian health care system context with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses was performed.

Results

Five thousand one hundred seventy-nine articles were identified; after screening, 22 articles were included. Most trials showed a high risk of bias, but randomized trials showed a lower risk. Compared with chest tube placement, observation (mean difference, 5.17; 95% CI, 3.75–6.59; P < .01; I² = 62%) and aspiration (mean difference, 2.72; 95% CI, 2.39–3.04; P < .01; I² = 0%) showed a shorter length of stay. Compared with observation, chest tube placement (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71–0.91; P < .01; I² = 62%) and aspiration (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.88; P < .01; I² = 67%) showed higher resolution without additional intervention. Two-year recurrence rates did not differ between management strategies. Observation showed the best utility (0.82) and lowest cost; observation was the optimal strategy in 98.2% of Monte Carlo simulations.

Interpretation

Observation is the dominant choice compared with aspiration and chest tube placement for PSP. It should be considered as the first-line therapy in appropriately selected patients.

### Conservative versus interventional treatment for spontaneous pneumothorax [^59aa2e7c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether conservative management is an acceptable alternative to interventional management for uncomplicated, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial, we recruited patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate interventional management of the pneumothorax (intervention group) or a conservative observational approach (conservative-management group) and were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was lung reexpansion within 8 weeks.

Results

A total of 316 patients underwent randomization (154 patients to the intervention group and 162 to the conservative-management group). In the conservative-management group, 25 patients (15.4%) underwent interventions to manage the pneumothorax, for reasons prespecified in the protocol, and 137 (84.6%) did not undergo interventions. In a complete-case analysis in which data were not available for 23 patients in the intervention group and 37 in the conservative-management group, reexpansion within 8 weeks occurred in 129 of 131 patients (98.5%) with interventional management and in 118 of 125 (94.4%) with conservative management (risk difference, -4.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.6 to 0.5; P = 0.02 for noninferiority); the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval was within the prespecified noninferiority margin of -9 percentage points. In a sensitivity analysis in which all missing data after 56 days were imputed as treatment failure (with reexpansion in 129 of 138 patients [93.5%] in the intervention group and in 118 of 143 [82.5%] in the conservative-management group), the risk difference of -11.0 percentage points (95% CI, -18.4 to -3.5) was outside the prespecified noninferiority margin. Conservative management resulted in a lower risk of serious adverse events or pneumothorax recurrence than interventional management.

Conclusions

Although the primary outcome was not statistically robust to conservative assumptions about missing data, the trial provides modest evidence that conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^8dbc7c4a]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy young patients. Optimal management is not defined and often results in prolonged hospitalisation. Data on efficacy of ambulatory options are poor. We aimed to describe the duration of hospitalisation and safety of ambulatory management compared with standard care.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged 16–55 years) with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax were recruited from 24 UK hospitals during a period of 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both). The primary outcome was total length of hospital stay including re-admission up to 30 days after randomisation. Patients with available data were included in the primary analysis and all assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. The trial was prospectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trials Number, ISRCTN79151659.

Findings

Of 776 patients screened between July, 2015, and March, 2019, 236 (30%) were randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n = 117) and standard care (n = 119). At day 30, the median hospitalisation was significantly shorter in the 114 patients with available data who received ambulatory treatment (0 days [IQR 0–3]) than in the 113 with available data who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0–8]; p < 0·0001; median difference 2 days [95% CI 1–3]). 110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events, including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, eight (57%) of which were related to the intervention, including an enlarging pneumothorax, asymptomatic pulmonary oedema, and the device malfunctioning, leaking, or dislodging.

Interpretation

Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduced the duration of hospitalisation including re-admissions in the first 30 days, but at the expense of increased adverse events. This data suggests that primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be managed for outpatients, using ambulatory devices in those who require intervention.

### Simple aspiration versus chest-tube insertion in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a systematic review [^22090404]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The initial treatment of a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is controversial. Guidelines of the British Thoracic Society recommend simple aspiration for all PSP requiring intervention. The placement of chest tubes is only advocated for patients who fail simple aspiration. However, the American College of Chest Physicians Delphi Consensus Statement found simple aspiration to be rarely appropriate in the management of PSP.

Aims

To compare simple aspiration with chest-tube drainage in the initial management of PSP.

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Outcome Measures

Reductions in duration of hospital stay, recurrence rate and pain or dyspnoea score were classified as benefits, whereas reductions in successful events were classified as risks.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous data, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) were used.

Results

Three RCTs were identified with a combined total of 194 patients. Simple aspiration was associated with shorter hospitalization (WMD -1.30 days [-2.20 to -0.39]). The results for success rate could not be combined because of differences in outcome definitions. However, a pooled result for "success at 1 week or more" showed no significant difference between either intervention (RR 0.86 [0.67, 1.11]). Results of recurrence at 1 year were also not significantly different (RR 0.73 [0.39–1.38]). Different reporting systems for pain scores meant that data could not be pooled. Only one trial reported dyspnoea scores.

Conclusion

RCT evidence in this field is limited, and the total sample size is too small to make any firm conclusion. On the basis of current available evidence, simple aspiration is advantageous in the initial management of PSP because of shorter hospitalization. There is no significant difference in recurrence at 1 year using either modality, and the efficacy data are inconclusive.

### Pneumothorax management: current state of practice in the UK [^b2f8d7ec]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology with an incidence of 17–24 and 1–6 per 100,000 population per annum for men and women, respectively. Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients with no underlying lung disease; whereas those with lung conditions are termed Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (SSP).

The most recent European Respiratory Society (ERS) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the management of pneumothorax were published in 2015 and 2010, respectively. The optimal initial treatment regime for PSP is not well defined: treatment options including conservative management, needle aspiration (NA) or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. Pleural drainage is recommended in patients with a large pneumothorax and/or symptoms initially with NA and then, if unsuccessful, chest drain insertion. However, two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have recently been published which may change the treatment paradigm: comparing conservative and ambulatory management to standard care, and the guidelines are due to be updated. The aim of this study was to assess the current "state of play" in the management of pneumothorax in the UK.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^78e25b8f]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy young patients. Optimal management is not defined and often results in prolonged hospitalisation. Data on efficacy of ambulatory options are poor. We aimed to describe the duration of hospitalisation and safety of ambulatory management compared with standard care.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged 16–55 years) with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax were recruited from 24 UK hospitals during a period of 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both). The primary outcome was total length of hospital stay including re-admission up to 30 days after randomisation. Patients with available data were included in the primary analysis and all assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. The trial was prospectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trials Number, ISRCTN79151659.

Findings

Of 776 patients screened between July, 2015, and March, 2019, 236 (30%) were randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n = 117) and standard care (n = 119). At day 30, the median hospitalisation was significantly shorter in the 114 patients with available data who received ambulatory treatment (0 days [IQR 0–3]) than in the 113 with available data who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0–8]; p < 0·0001; median difference 2 days [95% CI 1–3]). 110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events, including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, eight (57%) of which were related to the intervention, including an enlarging pneumothorax, asymptomatic pulmonary oedema, and the device malfunctioning, leaking, or dislodging.

Interpretation

Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduced the duration of hospitalisation including re-admissions in the first 30 days, but at the expense of increased adverse events.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^9eb5ae89]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

No significant differences between intervention groups were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time off work, and overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result, investigators classified patients with pneumothorax within 7 days into two categories: ongoing if there had been incomplete re-expansion on chest radiograph at completion of treatment, or new recurrence if the pneumothorax had fully resolved on the last chest radiograph. The excess recurrence in patients receiving standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with aspiration alone, because they accounted for less than 53% of those with early recurrence.

Longer-term recurrence rates (1–12 months) were similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of first ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically different at 12 months. The overall rate of recurrence (27%) is consistent with previous large epidemiological studies.

A 2020 randomised trialin primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion), reporting that the conservative approach was non-inferior to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach. First, the trial screened more than 2600 patients to randomly assign 316, and it required 39 sites recruiting for 6 years. Excluding patients with previous pneumothorax would automatically exclude about 25% of the population. The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is already recognised that conservative management is wholly appropriate in some cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (as stated in the 2010 BTS guidelines). Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than patient-centred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore, although the conservative treatment study should be applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we would suggest that symptomatic patients who choose or are chosen by the treating physicians for intervention should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy, which is shown here to be effective and reasonably safe.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to a child with primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^7c4a58a2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is an uncommon presentation in children but may occur at any age and occurs in patients with no pre-existing lung disease. Management aims are to re-expand the collapsed lung, relieve pressure in the intrapleural space and avoid a tension pneumothorax. Correct management of PSP will avoid unnecessary intervention, reduce length of hospital stay and also reduce the risk of recurrence. There are no established guidelines for treating PSP in children and there is significant variation in management among centres and clinicians. This article provides a clear, evidence-based and structured approach to assessment and management of PSP in children and young people.

### Update in management of paediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^0e1b5f44]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Paediatric spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) management continues to lack paediatric-specific guideline recommendations. There have been increasing reports of paediatric retrospective case studies supplemented by important well designed RCT (predominantly) adult studies. Taken together, these suggest that conservative management may have an increasing role to play in the management of PSP and that aspiration may have limited utility as a first line intervention. Our local experience, as part of a multicentre retrospective analysis and subsequent audit of management since, corroborates recent published data: it highlights an increasing trend towards conservative management in spontaneous pneumothorax with similar rates of recurrence, compared to intervention, and low use of aspiration with similarly low success rates. We have therefore updated our local practice guidelines and share these with readers. Specifically, we have removed aspiration in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and reserved intervention for children who are clinically unstable or show evidence of increasing air leak irrespective of pneumothorax size. Whilst the success of this change in clinical practice will need to be reviewed in the next 5–10 years, the overall low incidence of the condition, demands a multicentre, and probably multinational, collaborative approach to allow the best chance of obtaining definitive evidence to guide clinical paediatric management.

### Spontaneous pneumothorax: time to rethink management? [^af3b24b8]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

There are substantial differences in international guidelines for the management of pneumothorax and much geographical variation in clinical practice. These discrepancies have, in part, been driven by a paucity of high-quality evidence. Advances in diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed the identification of lung abnormalities in patients previously labelled as having primary spontaneous pneumothorax, a group in whom recommended management differs from those with clinically apparent lung disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pneumothorax are now better understood and this may have implications for clinical management. Risk stratification of patients at baseline could help to identify subgroups at higher risk of recurrent pneumothorax who would benefit from early intervention to prevent recurrence. Further research into the roles of conservative management, Heimlich valves, digital air-leak monitoring, and pleurodesis at first presentation might lead to an increase in their use in the future.

### Simple aspiration versus drainage for complete pneumothorax: a randomized noninferiority trial [^7e17041e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Management of first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains the subject of debate. Objectives: To determine whether first-line simple aspiration is noninferior to first-line chest tube drainage for lung expansion in patients with complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Methods: We conducted a prospective, open-label, randomized noninferiority trial. Adults aged 18–50 years with complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax (total separation of the lung from the chest wall), recruited at 31 French hospitals from 2009 to 2015, received simple aspiration (n = 200) or chest tube drainage (n = 202) as first-line treatment. The primary outcome was pulmonary expansion 24 hours after the procedure. Secondary outcomes were tolerance of treatment, occurrence of adverse events, and recurrence of pneumothorax within 1 year. Substantial discordance in the numerical inputs used for trial planning and the actual trial rates of the primary outcome resulted in a reevaluation of the trial analysis plan. Measurement and Main Results: Treatment failure occurred in 29% in the aspiration group and 18% in the chest tube drainage group (difference in failure rate, 0.113; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026–0.200). The aspiration group experienced less pain overall (mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -1.89, -0.91), less pain limiting breathing (frequency difference, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.27, -0.09), and less kinking of the device (frequency difference, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.09, -0.01). Recurrence of pneumothorax was 20% in this group versus 27% in the drainage group (frequency difference, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.16, +0.02). Conclusions: First-line management of complete primary spontaneous pneumothorax with simple aspiration had a higher failure rate than chest tube drainage but was better tolerated with fewer adverse events. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01008228).

### Comparison of efficiency and safety of conservative versus interventional management for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a meta-analysis [^fbd778b3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing opinion that primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) patients without hemodynamic compromise could be safely and successfully managed with observation alone. The aims of this meta-analysis were to estimate the safety and effectiveness of conservative treatment compared with that of interventional management as the initial treatment option for patients with PSP.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) until April 25, 2020, that compared conservative treatment and interventional treatment as the initial treatment for patients with PSP. The primary outcomes were success rates and recurrence rates. The secondary outcome was complication rates. Data extraction and quality assessment from eligible studies were independently conducted by two reviewers.

Results

8 trials with a total of 1342 patients were identified. The success rates of conservative management were similar with interventional treatment, with a risk ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.17, I2 = 69.1%). There was no significant difference of recurrence rates between these two type managements. (RR, 1.43, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 4.55, I2 = 86.7%). Complication rates were lower in conservative treatment group (13 of 215 [6.05%]) than in interventional treatment group (57 of 212, [26.89%]), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (RR, 0.15, 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.13, I2 = 56.7%).

Conclusions

Results of the meta-analysis suggest that conservative treatment offers a safe and effective alternative as compared with interventional management as the initial treatment approach for patients with PSP. However, more randomized clinical trials are need to provide more strong evidence to confirm our results.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^aada4c69]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with PSP were more likely to fail treatment if they presented on the same day that their symptoms started. Delayed treatment may allow the air leak in PSP to heal itself and thereby reduce the risk of prolonged air leak and failure of medical management.

Time to change practice?

What is different about patients who present on the same day as their symptom started? It could be that by intervening 'early' that we are prolonging the air leak (as above). More anxious patients may be less likely to adopt a 'wait and see' approach. We do not routinely record the evolution of the patient's symptoms – that is, are they increasing with time or fluctuating. Therefore, there may be other patient factors which are not being captured on our VAS symptom scores, which are influencing the patients' decisions to attend as soon as symptoms start. Should we delay treatment in patients with PSP? One RCT of needle aspiration versus chest drain had a 'delayed treatment' arm of 2–3 days; however, no difference in immediate success rates was observed.

What about those patients in our study whose symptoms began > 7 days ago? In theory, the majority of those patients should have had sufficient time for the air leak to heal. Patients in this situation in our study had an increased rate of ongoing air leak (treatment failure), albeit not statistically significant in this small patient group.

The 'holy grail' for pneumothorax management is a non-invasive way to identify those patients with ongoing air leak but this is an area of ongoing research.

The strengths of this study are the prospective nature of clinical data collection (including the first-ever daily symptom scores) from the largest RCT of PSP initial management in Europe and good data completeness. Definitions of treatment failure were predetermined and consistent across all recruiting centres. The limitations include the generalisability of the data as only patients enrolled into the RCT were included, although patient demographics are equivalent to previous epidemiological studies. Although the 100 mm VAS scores for pain and breathlessness are widely used in pleural disease, they have not been specifically validated in pneumothorax, so the MCID has not been determined. Despite 236 patients being included, only 60 patients experienced treatment failure. Therefore, there is a risk of type I error rate inflation (ie, a false-positive result) by multiple comparisons and type II errors (false rejecting other significant variables by relatively small sample size) in this analysis. The results need to be validated in another larger high-quality dataset.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^15d6e420]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

There are limitations to this study. Some eligible patients were not enrolled because they presented out of the 0900–1700 National Health Service working hours or when no trained members of staff were available. This factor introduces a potential recruitment bias, because patients presenting out of hours could be more unwell, and thus ambulatory management should be used cautiously in those patients. However, this prospective trial was pragmatic in its design and the patients who enrolled were likely to represent those suitable for ambulatory management. The study was necessarily open label with both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation; however, the use of objective and identical discharge criteria were used for the primary outcome measure to ensure balance between treatment groups. Finally, not all patients in the standard care arm had pleural aspiration as initial management, which could have introduced bias towards the ambulatory arm. However, a post-hoc analysis excluding these patients showed that the primary outcome remained significantly different between the two arms.

Considering the data in the present study, what is now the optimal treatment for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who require treatment? To our knowledge, our results show for the first time evidence of effective use of an entirely ambulatory strategy in patients with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as compared with current evidence based standard care. The ambulatory strategy was associated with reduced hospital stay and did not result in higher surgical or recurrence rates, but it did show an increase in adverse events related to readmission. Despite these readmissions, the total number of pleural procedures required and median hospital stay were significantly lower in patients in the ambulatory arm. These results have important implications for practice and suggest that future guidelines should include an ambulatory treatment option. We argue that this study provides strong evidence that the ambulatory strategy should replace the initial treatment (both aspiration and chest tube insertion) that forms the basis of current management guidelines. The ambulatory device used in this trial was the Pleural Vent (Rocket Medical). Ambulatory treatment might be just as effective with any ambulatory treatment strategy (eg, a chest drain attached to a one-way valve), but other devices were not tested in this study. It should be noted, however, that an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax will require health-care services to develop ambulatory care facilities to allow patients to be safely followed up with the device in situ.

In conclusion, in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, ambulatory management significantly reduces the duration of hospital stay during 30 days. Outpatient management is now a reasonable and probably preferable option in the management of this condition.

### Conservative versus interventional treatment for spontaneous pneumothorax [^80bd6820]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study PSP was published by Simon G A Brown and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pneumothorax and Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. In the PSP study, the trial question was: is conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax noninferior to interventional management for uncomplicated, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax? In the PSP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PSP study, the population was: 316 patients (44 female, 272 male). The inclusion criteria were patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The key exclusion criteria were secondary pneumothorax, previous spontaneous pneumothorax on the same side, coexistent hemothorax, bilateral pneumothorax, clinical instability suggesting tension pneumothorax, pregnancy, air travel within the next 12 weeks. In the PSP study, the interventions were: n = 162 conservative management (a conservative observational approach with a minimum observation of 4 hours before repeat chest radiograph) n = 154 interventional management (an immediate standard interventional treatment of the pneumothorax). In the PSP study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the rate of lung reexpansion within 8 weeks (94.4% vs. 98.5%; ARD -4.1, 95% CI -8.6 to 0.5). In the PSP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median time until radiographic resolution (30 days vs. 16 days; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.63) No significant difference in the rate of pneumothorax recurrence within 12 months (8.8% vs. 16.8%; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.02) No significant difference in median time until symptom resolution (14 days vs. 15.5 days; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.4). In the PSP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hemothorax, tension pneumothorax. significant differences in adverse events (8.0% vs. 26.6%), serious adverse events (3.7% vs. 12.3%). In the PSP study, the conclusion was: in patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax, conservative management was noninferior to interventional management with respect to the rate of lung reexpansion within 8 weeks.

### Evidence-based management of paediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^f1d8880c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

The exact incidence of paediatric primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is unclear, although PSP incidence in the general population is between 6 and 18 per 100,000. PSP has been reported throughout the paediatric age range. A potential genetic predisposition for familial cases has been recently identified. Whilst there is universal consensus on the management of tension pneumothorax, lack of agreement and consistency exists across a wide range of management issues for other aspects of PSP management. Paediatric PSP may have a higher recurrence rate than adult PSP, and the presence of apical lung cysts or bullae is not predictive of recurrence. The decision for surgical intervention should be based on documented recurrence. There is a lack of paediatric evidence to guide management decisions, and extrapolation of predominantly adult data to younger age groups should not be encouraged. Given the relatively low apparent incidence, a multicentre approach to future research is required in order to generate the evidence required for informed management of PSP in children.

### Efficacy of treatments in primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^78060d86]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains a significant global health problem. Despite general agreement, an official algorithm for the management of PSP still does not exist.

Objectives

Evaluating the efficacy of all available treatments in PSP.

Methods

A systematic search of 12 electronic databases was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatments in PSP. The primary endpoint was recurrence incidence; secondary were an immediate success, complication and hospitalization days. All available outcomes were included in frequentist network meta-analysis.

Results

4262 patients of 29 RCTs were included. In patients with first episode of PSP, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), tube drainage and aspiration had no significant difference regarding recurrence. Chemical pleurodesis significantly reduced the recurrent incidence of 46% compared with aspiration and 54% compared with tube drainage. VATS and aspiration significantly decreased hospitalization days compared with tube drainage. In patients with recurrent or persistent PSP, thoracotomy with mechanical pleurodesis has a higher rank than VATS with or without pleurodesis in preventing recurrence, with no significant difference. VATS alone significantly reduced complications compared with all others treatments, except thoracotomy with abrasion.

Conclusions

Aspiration and tube drainage have no significant difference in treating patients with first episode of PSP regarding recurrence. Aspiration reduced hospitalization days when compared with tube drainage. Thoracotomy with mechanical pleurodesis and VATS with or without pleurodesis are not significantly different in preventing recurrence in patients with recurrent or persistent PSP. VATS alone reduced complications compared with others treatments except for thoracotomy with abrasion.

### Evaluation and management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adolescents and young adults: a systematic review from the APSA outcomes&evidence-based practice committee [^120460eb]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controversy exists in the optimal management of adolescent and young adult primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee performed a systematic review of the literature to develop evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier Embase, EBSCOhost CINAHL, Elsevier Scopus, and Wiley Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were queried for literature related to spontaneous pneumothorax between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2020, addressing (1) initial management, (2) advanced imaging, (3) timing of surgery, (4) operative technique, (5) management of contralateral side, and (6) management of recurrence. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed.

Results

Seventy-nine manuscripts were included. Initial management of adolescent and young adult primary spontaneous pneumothorax should be guided by symptoms and can include observation, aspiration, or tube thoracostomy. There is no evidence of benefit for cross-sectional imaging. Patients with ongoing air leak may benefit from early operative intervention within 24–48 h. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach with stapled blebectomy and pleural procedure should be considered. There is no evidence to support prophylactic management of the contralateral side. Recurrence after VATS can be treated with repeat VATS with intensification of pleural treatment.

Conclusions

The management of adolescent and young adult primary spontaneous pneumothorax is varied. Best practices exist to optimize some aspects of care. Further prospective studies are needed to better determine optimal timing of operative intervention, the most effective operation, and management of recurrence after observation, tube thoracostomy, or operative intervention.

### The role of simple aspiration in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^750414ab]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

According to an American College of Chest Physicians consensus statement published in 2001, it is recommended that chest tubes should be used for the drainage of primary spontaneous pneumothoraces. However, more recent expert opinions and guidelines suggest that simple aspiration is increasingly recognized as an acceptable alternative treatment. Studies have shown that the success rates and recurrence rates of simple aspiration are comparable to, if not more favorable than, those of chest tube drainage and small-bore catheter aspiration. Simple aspiration is the least invasive modality and it has economic cost-saving benefits, particularly with respect to admission rates and hospital length of stay. Its complication rate is low. However, a larger size of pneumothorax seems to be associated with increased likelihood of failure of simple aspiration. The author reviews the available evidence relating to the use of simple aspiration as a modality for treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Pneumothorax and pregnancy [^0c2f47c0]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Though more common in male patients, primary spontaneous pneumothorax might be expected to occur reasonably often in female patients of child-bearing age. However, < 50 cases of pneumothorax in pregnancy have been previously reported. Special risks are posed for both the mother and the fetus in this situation. Previous management strategies have varied widely, without describing the more modern and less invasive techniques, and existing pneumothorax guidelines do not incorporate this difficult scenario.

Methods

A retrospective search of our database of 250 spontaneous pneumothorax patients over a 10-year period, in a stable local population of 500,000 patients, identified five cases of pneumothorax occurring in pregnancy. We report our experience, the largest series yet described, review the medical literature, and make management recommendations.

Results

We found favorable outcomes for both mothers and infants in our series, with modern techniques such as simple aspiration, elective assisted delivery at or near term with regional anesthesia, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

Conclusions

Future guidelines on the management of pneumothorax should consider the inclusion of advice on the problems of pregnancy, based on previous published experience, and utilizing the modern and less invasive techniques. Such advice would inform and support those specialists involved in managing a potentially hazardous situation to the benefit of both mother and child.

### Predicting outcomes in primary spontaneous pneumothorax using air leak measurements [^262cc4b3]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common pathology with an incidence of 17–24 and 1–6 per 100 000 population per annum for men and women, respectively. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients with no underlying lung disease.

The optimal initial treatment regime for PSP is not yet defined. Options include conservative management, needle aspiration (NA) or insertion of a small-bore chest drain. International guidelines and expert consensus statements vary. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest treatment is required in patients with a large pneumothorax and/or symptoms.NA of up to 2.5 L of air is recommended as initial treatment. If aspiration is unsuccessful, then chest tube insertion is required.

Ideally, removal of the air from the pleural cavity will allow the lung to re-expand. This relies on the air leak, which occurs via a hole in the visceral pleura (ie, an alveolar–pleural fistula), having ceased. Standard management currently involves daily monitoring for ongoing air leak, using bubbling of the chest tube as a marker. Although ambulatory strategies have been described, a meta-analysis showed these data to be highly bias (a large number of case series) and outlined the need for a randomised controlled trial. This is the rationale behind the currently recruiting Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (RAMPP) trial (see below), but currently, the practice remains to treat patients as inpatients in hospital. This management strategy is unsatisfactory for both patients and clinicians; bubbles via the chest drain are not precise (they are not consistently present) and are a binary measure which do not quantify the degree of air leak.

Digital suction devices, such as the Thopaz+ (Medela, Switzerland), provide a quantitative measure of airflow. These devices are widely used post-thoracic surgery in the UK and have been shown to reduce chest drain duration and hospital stay.

We hypothesise that early quantification of air leak predicts those patients who will have prolonged air leak and hence failed medical management (requiring surgical referral).

### Management of pneumothorax: an update [^76061950]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumothorax is a global health problem. To date, there is still significant variation in the management of pneumothorax. For the past few years, there have been significant developments in the outpatient management of both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). We will review the latest evidence for the management of nontraumatic pneumothorax (spontaneous and iatrogenic) to include pneumothorax associated with COVID-19 infection.

Recent Findings

Outpatient management of both primary and SSP may be safe and feasible.

Summary

Outpatient management of both primary and SSP should be included in treatment options discussion with patients.

### Outcomes of emergency department patients treated for primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^f8379aaf]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines for the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) vary, and there is growing opinion that more patients could be successfully managed with observation alone. There is little published evidence detailing the outcomes of emergency department (ED) patients who have been treated for PSP. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes for patients with PSP.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study that was conducted by explicit medical record review that investigated adult patients with PSP who had been treated at two urban teaching hospital EDs from 1996 to 2005. The data collected included demographics, clinical data at presentation, and outcome data. The outcome of interest was the proportion of patients who were successfully treated with the initial management strategy (ie, conservative, aspiration, and tube thoracostomy). Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics.

Results

A total of 203 episodes of PSP in 154 patients (70% male; median age, 24 years) was identified. PSP size ranged from 5 to 100%. Ninety-one PSP patients (45%) were treated with outpatient observation, 48 patients (24%) were treated with aspiration, and 64 patients (31%) were treated with tube thoracostomy. In total, the conditions of 79% of patients (82 of 91 patients) who were treated with observation resolved without additional intervention. Aspiration was successful in 50% of cases (24 of 48 cases) where it was attempted; the conditions of 73% of PSP patients who were treated with tube thoracostomy (47 of 64) resolved without additional intervention.

Conclusion

These data suggest that observation alone is an effective initial treatment strategy for selected patients with PSP. They support the inclusion of an observation arm in planned prospective studies comparing different management approaches.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^0729f7e6]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial compared an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care using evidence-based guidelines (aspiration, chest drain insertion, or both), using clinically relevant outcomes including the duration of hospital stay during the first 30 days following intervention. The results show the efficacy of the ambulatory strategy, with most patients successfully managed as outpatients. This finding is supported by analysis of the primary outcome by initial hospital and overall stay in both whole days and number of hours.

Although 24 (21%) of 114 patients who had ambulatory care required at least one further procedure, patients in this group required significantly fewer procedures overall than those who received standard care. Patients in the ambulatory group had longer treatment duration (ie, time with ambulatory device in place) than did the standard care group (ie, time with chest drain in place). This difference is probably due to a number of factors. First, physicians might have been more cautious in managing patients with the ambulatory device and left the device in situ longer to ensure it was not removed too soon. Second, because patients in the ambulatory care group were being managed as outpatients and reviewed every 24 h, there were fewer opportunities to assess whether the pneumothorax had resolved than there were for those with a chest tube, who were treated in hospital and potentially reviewed many times per day.

Serious adverse events, defined as those needing admission to hospital, occurred exclusively in the ambulatory care arm. Serious adverse events related to treatment included enlargement of pneumothorax despite the ambulatory device being in place and device blockage and kinking, requiring chest tube insertion and hospitalisation. In the ambulatory care group, three patients had unrecognised haemopneumothoraces, which at review were not considered related to the intervention. Although this higher rate of serious adverse events is clearly important, by the nature of its definition it is biased against the ambulatory arm. Insertion of a chest tube (eg, after failed aspiration) and admission to hospital was not a possible serious adverse event in the standard care arm because this constituted normal care. Therefore, any adverse event in a patient already hospitalised, regardless of the primary intervention, requires careful interpretation. Nonetheless, the increased adverse event rate in the ambulatory arm should be accounted for when using an ambulatory pneumothorax strategy.

### Factors associated with early recurrence in non-surgically managed primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^ca0ec547]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is characterized by the collapse of the lung and the presence of air in the pleural cavity without any trauma or significant underlying pulmonary pathology. It is more common among young, tall, and slender patients. Treatment modalities for PSP include observation, tube thoracostomy, and video‐assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) wedge resection. The mechanism of PSP is typically elucidated by the rupture of small air sacs known as bullae or blebs on the lung's surface. Researchers predominantly agree that smoking, low body mass index, and genetic predisposition are the primary risk factors for PSP. Inflammatory processes induced by smoking damage lung tissue and promoted the development of pneumothorax. Studies have shown that the risk of recurrent pneumothorax is higher in individuals who were active smokers prior to the episode, compared to those who had quit smoking or had never smoked before the episode.

### Cost-effectiveness of ambulatory care management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^6dc11020]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax has been shown to reduce initial hospitalisation, but at the expense of increase adverse events. As a result, questions remain about the cost-effectiveness of this option.

Objectives

A within-trial economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ambulatory care when compared with standard guideline-based management.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion or both). Follow-up was 12 months. Outcomes included healthcare resource use and costs, quality of life, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness.

Results

236 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n = 117) and standard care (n = 119). After multiple imputation for missing data, patients in the ambulatory care group had significantly lower National Health Service healthcare costs (-£788, 95%CI difference: -1527 to -50; p = 0.037) than those in the standard care group. There were no differences in the number of QALYs gained (mean difference: -0.001, 95%CI difference: -0.032 to 0.030; p = 0.95). When standard care was compared with ambulatory care, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £799066 per QALY gained, well above current thresholds of cost-effectiveness. As a result, the probability of ambulatory care being cost-effective was 0.93.

Conclusion

Outpatient ambulatory management is highly likely to be a cost-effective option in the management of primary pneumothorax.

Key messages

Can patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax be managed safely and effectively on an ambulatory pathway?
Data on ambulatory management of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax are sparse, but suggest it could be considered in selected cases; however, the criteria for case selection are not defined.
Ambulatory management of carefully selected patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax appears to have comparable outcomes with ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, while also appearing to be safe and cost-saving.

### Videothoracoscopic surgical approach for spontaneous pneumothorax: review of the pertinent literature [^7c555d68]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax

Patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, which is usually caused by a rupture of a subpleural bleb or bulla in the underlying lung, most commonly present with ipsilateral sudden chest pain and dyspnea. Spontaneous pneumothoraces are classified as primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy patients, most commonly in tall, young, lean males and particularly in those who smoke. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs as a complication of an underlying lung disease, which most often is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In either case, the goals of pneumothorax treatment are to eliminate intrapleural air collection and to prevent recurrence. In the first episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax, observation, simple aspiration, or chest tube drainage in proportion to clinical stability or the degree of pneumothorax are recommended as first-line therapies. The recurrence rate after these therapies has been reported to range from 16% to 52%, with a mean of 30%. Treatment to prevent recurrent pneumothorax is essential under clinical conditions such as spontaneous pneumothorax with potential respiratory insufficiency, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, or persistent pneumothorax. Under these conditions, a surgical option is considered for pneumothorax.

### Management of spontaneous pneumothorax: state of the art [^cf7b00d2]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax remains a significant health problem. However, with time, there have been improvements in pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures and both medical and surgical approaches to treatment. Owing to better imaging techniques, it is now clear that there is almost no normal visceral pleura in the case of spontaneous pneumothorax, and that blebs and bullae are not always the cause of pneumothorax. In first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation and simple aspiration are established first-line therapies, as proven by randomised controlled trials. Aspiration should be better promoted in daily medical practice. In the case of recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, simple talc poudrage under thoracoscopy has been shown to be safe, cost-effective and no more painful than a conservative treatment using a chest tube. There are also new experimental data showing that talc poudrage, as used in Europe, does not lead to serious side-effects and is currently the best available pleural sclerosing agent. Alternatively, surgical techniques have considerably improved, and are now less invasive, especially due to the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Studies suggest that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be more cost-effective than chest tube drainage in spontaneous pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage, although it is more expensive than simple thoracoscopy and requires general anaesthesia, double-lumen tube intubation and ventilation. Recommendations are made regarding the treatment of pneumothorax. In secondary or complicated primary pneumothorax, i.e. recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, some diffuse treatment of the visceral pleura should be offered, either by talc poudrage under thoracoscopy or by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Moreover, all of these new techniques should be better standardised to permit comparison in randomised controlled studies.

### A novel finding related to bulla and bleb formation in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^d6051271]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax is 17 to 24 in 100,000 for men and one to six in 100,000 for women. Although it is a common problem globally, the best method of management remains controversial. One reason for this lack of consensus is that there are many categories of spontaneous pneumothorax. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients without underlying clinical lung disease, and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by underlying lung disease. There is a bimodal age distribution to spontaneous pneumothorax, with one peak occurring in patients 55 years of age or older. These patients typically have secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, mainly caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The other peak is seen in young patients and is related to male sex, taller height, and the formation of bullas or blebs. In patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the fundamental treatment is smoking cessation. The fundamental treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in young nonsmokers is unknown. Also unknown is the reason why bullas and blebs are formed in the apex of the lung and how to prevent this formation. Many researchers have tried to discover the answer, without success. Tall height is frequently referred to as a risk factor for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: the hypothetical mechanism herein is that increased distending pressures on the apex of the lung are caused by the increased pressure gradient from the base to the apex of the lung in tall patients. However, as imaging techniques have developed, bullas and blebs have come to be seen as emphysematous-like changes, and the concept that only ruptured bullas and blebs cause primary spontaneous pneumothorax is now obsolete. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax may be related to a parenchymal abnormality, or the primary pathologic process may involve inflammatory cells obstructing small airways and bronchiolitis. These theories, based on pathologic findings, are currently under investigation. If these are determined to cause spontaneous pneumothorax, treating these factors will become the primary treatment for spontaneous pneumothorax.

We have noted a novel intraoperative finding that may explain why pleural changes, including bullas and blebs, are frequently observed in the upper lobe of the lung, and why those pleural changes are associated with abnormalities of the peripheral airways. We aim to show the relation between this novel finding, the pulmonary delayed inflation (PDI) sign, and spontaneous pneumothorax in young patients.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^1cce264a]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pneumothorax is a common clinical problem. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax describes patients developing pneumothorax in the absence of trauma, with no underlying established lung pathology, and occurs in in approximately 3000 patients per year in the UK. Some patients can be managed conservatively with close observation, but many symptomatic patients require an intervention to re-expand the lung. Current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest that aspiration of trapped air using a cannula and syringe should be considered, but more than 50% of patients subsequently require the insertion of a chest tube, which is then attached to an underwater seal drainage system. The mean duration of hospitalisation of patients admitted for drainage is 6–8 days.

Ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax potentially removes the need for long hospital admission by facilitating outpatient treatment. Reducing the need for chest tubes with bulky underwater systems might allow patients to remain mobile and facilitate early discharge with the device in situ. Ambulatory devices generally incorporate a Heimlich (one-way) valve, which replaces the traditional underwater seal, either by in-line attachment to a standard chest tube or as part of an integrated device. However, the efficacy and safety of this approach has yet to be rigorously assessed. A systematic reviewof the literature found that 18 studies describing ambulatory management of both spontaneous and iatrogenic pneumothorax reported an overall success rate of 86% and successful outpatient management in 78% of cases, with few complications. Unfortunately, the available evidence was described as poor quality with a high risk of bias, including two inadequately powered randomised trials and several retrospective case series.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A search of PubMed and MEDLINE for articles on ambulatory management of pneumothorax published up to Dec 5, 2019, with the keywords "pneumothorax", "ambulatory", "Heimlich valve", and "outpatient" showed that most studies were case series and included two small, inadequately powered randomised trials. In 2013, a systematic review of 18 studies found that although ambulatory options might be successful, the data were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. A further three case series were subsequently published. Given this uncertain evidence base, we designed the Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax trial as a controlled study to determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax reduces the length of hospitalisation and is safe.

Added value of this study

This study, which to our knowledge is the only large randomised trial of its kind, found that ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the length of hospitalisation compared with standard care. Ambulatory patients had fewer pleural procedures, but serious adverse events were higher because of hospital re-admission.

Implications of all the available evidence

This trial challenges the current guidelines for management for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with the proviso that some patients will require further treatment.

The Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax (RAMPP) trial was done to determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax is safe and reduces the length of hospitalisation.

### Outpatient management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^044eda62]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The outpatient management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is still debated. The risk of a tension pneumothorax is used to justify active treatment like chest-tube drainage, although outpatient management can reduce both the time in hospital and the cost of treatment. It is also likely to be the patient's choice. This report is a reappraisal of the situations for which outpatient management, by monitoring alone, or using minimally invasive techniques, can be considered.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^a8434ad3]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Safety data were collected for all patients at each trial visit regarding adverse events, with seriousness defined as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Expected adverse events were pain at the drainage site, minor haemorrhage not requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion or surgery), subcutaneous emphysema, pleural infection, unintentional removal (falling out) of the Pleural Vent or chest tube, recurrence of pneumothorax or worsening of ongoing pneumothorax (if evidence of failure of full resolution following initial intervention), re-expansion pulmonary oedema, and the need for further (non-emergency) pleural procedures. Expected serious adverse events included tension pneumothorax occurring during treatment, blockage of chest tube with clinical consequences (eg, patient unwell or further procedure required), major intrathoracic haemorrhage requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion), and any additional emergency pleural procedure as deemed necessary by the local investigator (eg, large bore chest tube insertion). Because the recurrence of pneumothorax is common and expected (occurring in about 33% of primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases within 1 year,), recurrence was not reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events were assessed locally, and, if they fulfilled the criteria for a serious adverse event, they were reported immediately (ie, within 24 h) to the Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit for review. All serious adverse events were followed until resolution.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis was approved by the trial statisticians and steering committee before data analysis. The sample size for the primary outcome was determined to detect a difference in length of hospital stay of 2·3 days: from a mean of 4 days admission in patients receiving standard care to an expected mean of 1·7 days in patients receiving ambulatory care (standard deviation in both groups 6·0). The sample size calculation included a correction factor for non-normal data. These estimates assume that up to 50% of patients receiving standard care were expected to be successfully treated with aspiration alone (ie, zero-day admission). It was assumed, conservatively, that about 20% of patients in the ambulatory care arm would require re-admission. Based on these parameters, with 80% power, a 5% two-sided significance level, and a 10% attrition rate, the study required 236 patients. Previous pleural studies have shown an attrition rate for the primary outcome measure of less than 5%.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^27be284a]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

The RAMPP trial was a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial comparing ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care based on national guidelines. Participants were screened and recruited from 24 hospitals in the UK with a track record of recruiting to trials and a strong link between emergency and respiratory departments. Study oversight was provided by the trial steering committee and an independent data monitoring committee, and ethical approval was provided by the UK National Research Ethics Service Committee (15/SC/0240). The trial protocol can be found online and in the appendix (pp 9–47).

Participants

Eligible patients had presented with a symptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax (confirmed by a chest radiograph or CT scan) and were aged 16–55 years (as per BTS definition). Once a patient was identified as having a primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the decision to intervene was made on the basis of current BTS guidelines: patients were enrolled if they had a large pneumothorax (≥ 2 cm interpleural distance at the level of the hilum) or significant symptoms, or both. Patients were ineligible if they had known or suspected underlying lung disease (including > 20 pack-year tobacco smoking history, but excluding well controlled asthma), evidence of tension pneumothorax (defined as clinical or radiographic evidence of significantly increased intrapleural pressure causing haemodynamic compromise that requires urgent decompression), or a contraindication to thoracic procedure as determined by the responsible physician, or if they were pregnant or lactating. Patients requiring intervention could be enrolled and randomly assigned up to 24 h after presentation, provided that they remained hospitalised with an ongoing symptomatic pneumothorax despite initial intervention (eg, patients treated initially with aspiration and observed overnight) requiring chest tube insertion. Patients not requiring an intervention were invited to participate in an observational cohort up to 2 weeks after their initial presentation, the results of which will be published separately. All participants in the current study provided written informed consent.

Trial profile

*Patients were classed as missed if they had already been treated for primary spontaneous pneumothorax and were therefore no longer eligible.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics by treatment allocation

For the primary outcome, we analysed 114 (97%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 who received standard care, because data was not available for the remaining patients. Among those who had ambulatory care, the median hospital stay in the first 30 days was 0 days [IQR 0–3], which was significantly lower than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0–8]; median difference 2 days, 95% CI 1–3; p < 0·0001). The cumulative incidence of hospital stay (comprising any initial hospital stay plus re-admission days in hospital) is shown in figure 2. The difference in overall hospital stay during 30 days was also significant when calculated in hours (ambulatory median 4·7 h [IQR 2·7–59·2] vs standard care median 74·7 h [IQR 6·3–178·2); p < 0·0001; table 2). In the ambulatory care group, 73 (64%) of 114 patients with available data were discharged on the same day as admission, compared with 39 (34%) of 115 patients with available data in the standard care group (p < 0·0001; appendix p 3). In 24 patients (12 in ambulatory care; 12 in standard care), data were missing either at 1-week or at 30-days follow-up, or both.

### Predicting outcomes in primary spontaneous pneumothorax using air leak measurements [^bd2c21c8]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

The initial treatment regime for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is generic and non-personalised, often involving a long hospital stay waiting for air leak to cease. This prospective study of 81 patients with PSP, who required drain insertion, captured daily digital air leak measurements and assessed failure of medical management against prespecified criteria. Patients with higher air leak at day 1 or 2 had significantly longer hospital stay. If air leak was ≥ 100mL/min on day 1, the adjusted OR of treatment failure was 5.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 22.6, p = 0.03), demonstrating that early digital air leak measurements could potentially predict future medical treatment failure.

### What is the difference in size of spontaneous pneumothorax between inspiratory and expiratory X-rays? [^5d92fb16]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aims of this study were to compare the estimated size of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) calculated on inspiratory and expiratory radiographs using the volumetrically derived Collins method and to determine whether radiograph type influences size classification for treatment according to published guidelines.

Method

This retrospective cohort study included patients treated for PSP in the emergency departments of two metropolitan teaching hospitals. Data collected included patient demographics and interpleural distances required to calculate pneumothorax size by the Collins method and to classify PSP according to guidelines. The outcomes of interest were the difference in size estimate between radiograph types and agreement in size classification for treatment according to guidelines. Analysis is by bias-plot analysis, kappa analysis and descriptive statistics.

Results

A total of 49 pneumothoraces (44 patients) were studied. Median age was 22 years; 66% were men. Median PSP size on inspiratory radiographs was 24% (IQR 14% to 31%, range 5% to 100%). The average size difference between expiratory and inspiratory films was 9%, with size on expiratory radiographs being larger. The 95% limits of agreement were wide (-5% to 23%). For each guideline, size estimation on expiratory rather than inspiratory radiographs would have suggested a change in treatment for an additional seven patients (14%, 95% CI 7% to 27%).

Conclusions

On average, PSP size calculated on expiratory radiographs is 9% higher than that calculated on matched inspiratory radiographs. Applying current management guidelines, the size difference between inspiratory and expiratory x-rays may alter initial treatment recommendation for some patients.

### Manual aspiration versus chest tube drainage in first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a multicenter, prospective, randomized pilot study [^a1a3e9c0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although there is no agreement on the optimal treatment of patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the majority of physicians prefer chest tube drainage for air evacuation. Manual aspiration of air has been proposed by some, but lack of sound comparative data and safety data has limited its use. In this first randomized, prospective, multicenter pilot study, 60 patients with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax were randomly allocated to manual aspiration (n = 27) or chest tube drainage (n = 33). Immediate success was obtained in 16 out of 27 (59.3%) in the manual aspiration group, and in 21 out of 33 (63.6%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.9). One-week success rates were 25 out of 27 (93%) in the intention-to-treat manual aspiration group and 28 out of 33 (85%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.4). Fourteen of 27 manual aspiration patients (52%) were hospitalized, versus 100% of the chest tube drainage patients (p < 0.0001). Recurrence rates with at least 1-year follow-up were 7 out of 26 (26%) in the manual aspiration group, and 9 out of 33 (27.3%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.9). There were no complications associated with manual aspiration. Although statistical power is insufficient to formally confirm therapeutic equality, this pilot study suggests that in first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, manual aspiration seems equally effective as chest tube drainage and is safe, well tolerated, and feasible as an outpatient procedure in the majority of patients.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: treat the patient, not the X-ray [^6bed61fa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

PSP management has seen a surge of paradigm-changing research in recent years. The EXPRED trial should be interpreted together with the published PSP randomized trial, which investigated the noninferiority of conservative management of pneumothorax (i.e. no drainage at all) against conventional chest-tube drainage. The trial reported successful management of 85% of patients without drainage, again suggesting that the air leak had stopped or was minimal by the time the patients presented. Radiographic lung reexpansion was, as expected, slower with conservative management, but there were no significant intergroup differences by 8 weeks.

It is hypothesized that conservative management (i.e. no drainage) allows the lung to remain deflated and brings the edges of any defect to the closest proximity, enhancing healing. Patients conservatively treated in the PSP trial enjoyed better patient-relevant outcomes, including significant reductions in hospital stay, days off work, need for chest tubes or eventual surgical treatment, and the associated pain and complications.

Accumulating data now suggest that most patients presenting with PSP, irrespective of size, can be managed conservatively provided that the safety criteria (i.e. normal vital signs, stable pneumothorax on interval CXRs, and walking freely around the emergency department) are met. Chest-tube drainage should be reserved for those with an ongoing air leak or cases of failed conservative management. For those who are symptomatic, needle aspiration is an option, as shown in the EXPRED trial, as is ambulatory management with one-way valve devices, which have disadvantages of their own.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: treat the patient, not the X-ray [^1fed9c59]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Marx and colleagues (pp.) reported the largest randomized controlled trial on the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). The Comparison of Exsufflation Versus Drainage in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (EXPRED) trial randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) 402 patients from 31 emergency departments in France to undergo simple aspiration or insertion of a chest tube.

PSP predominantly affects young people with no significant underlying lung diseases. Its diagnosis and monitoring are always made on imaging, usually with chest X-rays (CXRs). Throughout past decades, clinicians have focused first-line management of PSP on correcting the radiographic abnormality. Prompt and full reexpansion of the lung is considered the key priority. A variety of drainage techniques have been used to evacuate the pleural air. Large-bore chest tubes, often aided by suction and obsessive apical positioning of drainage tubes, have become the default practice in many centers to achieve the best radiographic lung expansion.

However, large-bore chest tubes are known to cause pain, and their insertion also poses recognized risks. Less invasive alternative methods to evacuate air have been assessed. Aspiration of the air via different types of needles or small catheters is an attractive option and has been included in clinical guidelines as an alternative to chest tube drainage after several smaller randomized controlled trials showed promising results.

Although clinicians are willing to entertain less invasive options for "smaller" PSP, most still consider it "safer" to default to large-bore tube drainage if the CXR shows a sizeable pneumothorax. The EXPRED trial specifically addresses the role of simple aspiration in patients with a complete pneumothorax, defined as radiographic separation of the lung, from its apex to the base, from the lateral chest wall. In the trial, simple aspiration was performed with a catheter connected to a suction device at −25 cm H 2 O (to avoid variations associated with manual aspiration) for 30 minutes. A second bout of suction was allowed if needed. In the control group, patients underwent insertion of 16- or 20-F chest tubes for drainage.

### Pediatric spontaneous pneumothorax: does initial treatment affect outcomes? [^64397bfc]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) commonly occurs in adolescents, most commonly in males, and has recurrence rates between 20% and 60%. Surgical therapy has long been debated regarding its role in preventing recurrence, with no current consensus on guidelines for care. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of treatment type on recurrence rates in pediatric PSP.

Methods

This is a single-institution, institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis of patients aged 1 to 18 diagnosed with their first occurrence of PSP between 2009 and 2017. Patient demographics, hospital course, and outcomes over a 2-y period were collected. Patients were divided into nonoperative (oxygen therapy only) management, chest tube placement, and surgical management. The primary outcome was the recurrence rate.

Results

Sixty-four patients diagnosed with PSP met inclusive criteria. The mean age was 15.5, and 48 (75%) of patients were men. Twenty-one patients (33%) underwent nonoperative treatment, 24 patients (37.5%) underwent operative treatment with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy, and 19 patients (30%) underwent chest tube or pigtail placement alone. Fifteen patients (23.4%) experienced a recurrence within 2 y: 6 patients (29%) from the nonoperative treatment group, 4 (21%) who were treated with the chest tube only, and 5 (21%) who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy. No statistically significant difference in recurrence rates was found between treatment groups. Pneumothorax size was found to differ between treatment type; larger pneumothoraces were more likely to undergo surgical intervention (P = 0.0003). Smaller pneumothoraces were associated with higher rates of recurrence on multivariate logistic regression analysis (P = 0.046).

Conclusions

Recurrence of PSP in adolescents was found to be 23.4% after 2-y follow-up. Smaller-sized pneumothoraces were associated with higher rates of recurrence, but treatment type did not significantly affect recurrence rates.

### Pleural abrasion versus apical pleurectomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f3c27d93]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space, occurring predominantly in young and otherwise healthy individuals without clinically apparent lung pathology. It is one of the most common thoracic diseases of the young, with an estimated annual incidence of up to 22.7 per 100,000 people. The disease displays a male preponderance of 1:3.3 and cigarette smoking as a major risk factor. While pneumothoraces can be managed successfully with a variety of techniques ranging from observation to surgical techniques, spontaneous pneumothoraces without surgical treatment are characterized by their tendency to recur at a risk of approximately 30% at one year, thus producing a significant burden of disease.

A variety of approaches to manage PSP exist, including conservative therapy, drainage of air via needle aspiration or chest drain insertion, and definitive surgical intervention. Surgical procedures performed with video-assisted thoracoscopy include a combination of bullectomy, mechanical abrasion, pleurectomy, chemical pleurodesis (notably talcum powder). The two main objectives of surgical approach are resection of bleb or bullae and obliteration of the pleural space to achieve pleural symphysis to prevent recurrence of pneumothorax. Generally, surgical interventions are reserved for recurrent pneumothorax, bilateral pneumothorax, persistent air leak despite chest tube drainage or failure of lung expansion, spontaneous haemothorax, pregnancy and professions at risk, such as divers and pilots.

Current evidence regarding superiority of bullectomy with pleural abrasion versus pleurectomy for PSP is lacking. As such, even authoritative guidelines are ambiguous in providing a gold standard intervention for PSPs.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the outcomes between mechanical abrasion and apical pleurectomy in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. This comparison is important to guide clinical decision making, reduce heterogeneity in surgical management and to understand what clinically relevant outcomes are associated with each procedure.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: treat the patient, not the X-ray [^6ee99522]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint of the trial followed those of many prior studies and centered on expansion of the lung. "Failure" was defined by any residual pneumothorax ⩾2 cm on radiographs 24 hours after the intervention. The study was set up as a noninferiority trial, but the predicted failure rate in the control group (based on literature data) differed significantly from the actual observed rate in the recruited subjects. Two different methods to define the inferiority margins were presented and created much discussion on their relative statistical validity.

Not surprisingly, the trial did find that patients treated with chest tubes had better radiographic success. Only 18% of drainages in the chest-tube group "failed", compared with 29% in those treated with simple aspiration. However, patients in the aspiration group reported less pain (mean difference, −1.4 [95% CI: −1.89 to −0.91] on a 10-point scale), and significantly fewer of them described restriction in breathing as a result of pain (frequency difference, −18% [−27% to −9%]). Serious adverse events were uncommon in both groups. No intergroup differences were found in the long-term outcome measures, especially the recurrence rates after 1 year (20% in the aspiration group and 27% in the chest-tube group).

These results serve to confront clinicians to examine their priorities for PSP management. More invasive drainages provide better CXR improvement, reassuring clinicians, but at the expense of patient comfort and procedural risks.

The fundamental focus in PSP management should be to 1) relieve symptoms and 2) stop the air leak. PSP differs from secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in that the underlying, and the contralateral, lungs are usually normal. Thus, unlike secondary pneumothorax, PSP is rarely life-threatening, and the associated breathlessness is comparatively mild, usually restricting only severe exertion. It must also be remembered that lung expansion does not stop air leaks. The fact that most patients in this and other studies were successfully treated with needle aspiration implies that their air leaks had already stopped at the time of intervention. These observations should challenge the conventional practice of aiming to achieve urgent radiographic lung expansion with invasive procedures.

### Simple aspiration as initial treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: results of 91 consecutive cases [^812e02d6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Varying opinions exist regarding the choice of initial treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). This study aims to determine the success rate of simple aspiration of PSP, identify factors associated with failure, and identify associated complications. A retrospective analysis was performed on 91 consecutive patients receiving simple aspiration for PSP at the Emergency Department of a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong, China. The overall success rate was 50.5%. Failed cases had significantly larger sizes of pneumothorax, and significantly larger volumes of air aspirated. Pneumothorax size ≥ 40% was significantly associated with failure. In a multivariate analysis, pneumothorax size ≥ 40%, compared to size 21–39%, independently predicted failure, with an odds ratio of 8.88 (95% CI, 2.49 to 31.63). Complications were rarely encountered. It is concluded that the success rate may be significantly improved by excluding patients with pneumothorax size 40% or larger from this modality of treatment.

### Comparison of size classification of primary spontaneous pneumothorax by three international guidelines: a case for international consensus? [^c33ae5e6]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare classification of pneumothoraces into size groups for treatment using the British Thoracic Society [BTS], American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] and Belgian Society of Pulmonology [BSP] guidelines and the range of pneumothorax sizes in each group calculated using the volumetrically-derived Collins' method.

Method

This was a retrospective cohort study. Participants were patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax [PSP] attending emergency departments of two teaching hospitals between 1996 and 2005. Participants were identified from a pre-existing database. Data collected included demographics, side of PSP and interpleural distances for size classification based on BTS, ACCP, BSP and Collins' method requirements measured on inspiratory X-rays. The outcome of interest was comparison of classification into size groups according to each guideline. Analysis was by descriptive statistics, overall agreement and Kappa analysis for agreement between guideline pairs.

Results

Forty-nine episodes [44 patients] were studied. Median age was 22 years; 66% of patients were male. Median PSP size [Collins' method; inspiratory films] was 24%; range 5–100%. Based on inspiratory films, the BTS guideline classified 10% of PSP as large compared with 47% by the BSP guideline and 49% by the ACCP guideline. The three guidelines agreed in their classification in only 47% of cases.

Conclusion

Size classification of PSP based on available treatment guideline definitions shows poor agreement. This goes some way to explain management variation between regions and limits comparability of reported outcomes. There is a strong case for international agreement in size classification/estimation in order to facilitate high-quality studies into optimal management approaches.

### Recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax is common following chest tube and conservative treatment [^30c74646]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Previous studies on primary spontaneous pneumothorax reported variable recurrence rates, but they were based on heterogeneous patient populations including secondary pneumothorax. We investigated young patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax exclusively and used a national registry to track readmissions and calculate independent predictors of recurrence.

Methods

A prospective cohort study of consecutive young patients who were admitted over a 5-year period with their first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and treated conservatively with a chest tube. Baseline characteristics were obtained from questionnaires presented on admittance. All patients were discharged with fully expanded lungs on chest radiography. Patient charts were identified in the national electronic patient registry for detailed information on readmissions due to recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax.

Results

We included 234 patients. Male/female = ratio 5/1. After a median observation period of 3.6 years (range 1–6 years), recurrent pneumothorax was observed in 54%. Ipsilateral recurrence was the most common (79%) but 30% also experienced contralateral pneumothorax during the study period. Females had a significantly higher age at debut (p < 0.01) and experienced significantly more recurrences over time (p < 0.01). Low body weight (< 60 kg) was an independent predictor of recurrence and patients with repeated recurrences were significantly younger at debut (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in younger patients with their first episode had a much higher recurrence rate than previously reported. Every doctor who treats patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax should be aware and patients informed.

### Intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^d2d774a3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of chemical pleurodesis in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains unclear. According to current practice guidelines, chemical pleurodesis is reserved for patients who are unable or unwilling to have surgery. Some recent studies showed that intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis could decrease the rate of pneumothorax recurrence, when used either as the initial treatment for simple pneumothorax after successful aspiration and drainage or as an adjuvant treatment for complicated or recurrent pneumothorax following thoracoscopic surgery. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current available evidence on intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Recent Findings

In a recently published prospective, randomized controlled trial, additional minocycline pleurodesis following simple aspiration and drainage was a well tolerated and more effective initial treatment for a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax than simple aspiration and drainage alone. Other prospective, randomized controlled trials showed that additional minocycline pleurodesis after thoracoscopic treatment was a well tolerated and convenient procedure which can reduce the rate of ipsilateral recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Summary

Intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis can be considered an adjunct to standard treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, after either simple aspiration and drainage or after thoracoscopic surgery.

### Which clinical factors are predictive of outcome in primary spontaneous pneumothorax management? [^c2b3f4f8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Our prospectively collected RCT data show that patients who presented with PSP on the same day that their symptoms began had a higher risk of treatment failure. These same-day patients tended to have higher baseline breathlessness and pain scores but the severity of the symptoms was not independently associated with the risk of treatment failure. It should be noted that in the small group of patients (n = 17) with symptoms for > 7 days prior to admission also had a higher risk of treatment failure but this was not statistically significant.

Size of pneumothorax

Large pneumothorax size was associated with increased risk of failure of needle aspiration in two small retrospective case series. A larger retrospective of 253 patients with PSP found higher failure rates in those with massive (> 62.5%) compared with small pneumothoraces. In our study, although patients with larger pneumothorax had a longer median treatment duration, there was no increased risk of treatment failure.

Symptom scores

There are no previous studies assessing the association of symptom severity and risk of treatment failure. Our data were prospectively collected as part of an RCT, with good completion rates (> 90%). While same-day patients had higher symptom scores than those presenting later, we did not find an association between the VAS-measured symptom severity scores and treatment failure on multivariable analysis.

Vital signs

There were no significant differences in respiratory rate or systolic blood pressure. There was a statistically significant association between lower heart rate and treatment failure. The effect size was small and unlikely to be clinically significant: one might expect patients who were more symptomatic to have a higher heart rate, so difficult to rationalise clinically.

Prolonging the air leak?

The biological mechanisms resulting in same-day patients having a higher risk of treatment failure are not clear. One possible mechanism is that by inserting a device to drain the pneumothorax, a more negative pleural pressure is created, resulting in impaired healing of the pleural defect and persistent air leak.

### Is prophylactic treatment of contralateral blebs in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax indicated? [^699b17a2]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

More than 50% of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax have contralateral blebs/bullae, and about a quarter will develop a contralateral pneumothorax. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the need for elective treatment of asymptomatic contralateral blebs/bullae in patients presenting with primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Methods

From May 2006 through June 2008, results from 35 patients with ipsilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax without contralateral blebs receiving unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery, 35 patients with ipsilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax with contralateral blebs receiving unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery, and 16 patients with ipsilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax receiving bilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery for positive contralateral blebs were collected. Their demographic and operating data were also recorded.

Results

There was no significant difference in age, gender, smoking percentage, body mass index (kg/m(2)), blood loss, and postoperative pain among groups. There was longer operative time and length of stay in group receiving bilateral surgery. Within the follow-up period of 16.68 ± 9.91 months (median, 17.50), no recurrence on either lung was found in the group operated on both sides, while contralateral occurrence was found in 17.14% of the group with ipsilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax with contralateral blebs receiving unilateral video-assisted thoracic surgery within the period of 18.15 ± 8.07 months (median, 21).

Conclusion

The study showed that the preemptive video-assisted thoracic surgery for the contralateral blebs/bullae effectively prevented the contralateral occurrence.

### Pleural abrasion versus apical pleurectomy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^30052108]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical approach is the most effective treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The two most widely adopted surgical methods are mechanical abrasion and apical pleurectomy, in addition to bullectomy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine which technique is superior in treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Methods

PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 to September 2022 comparing mechanical abrasion and apical pleurectomy for treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The primary outcome was pneumothorax recurrence. Secondary outcomes included post-operative chest tube duration, hospital length of stay, operative time and intra-operative of blood loss.

Results

Eight studies were eligible for inclusion involving 1,613 patients. There was no difference in the rate of pneumothorax recurrence between pleural abrasion and pleurectomy (RR: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.92). However, pleural abrasion led to shorter hospital length of stay (MD: -0.25; 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.00), post-operative chest tube duration (MD: -0.30; 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.03), operative time (MD: -13.00; 95% CI -15.07 to 10.92) and less surgical blood loss (MD: -17.77; 95% CI: -24.36 to -11.18).

Conclusion

Pleural abrasion leads to less perioperative patient burden and shorter hospital length of stay without compromising the rate of pneumothorax recurrence when compared to pleurectomy. Thus, pleural abrasion is a reasonable first choice surgical procedure for management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^6e028ed2]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Regarding the secondary outcomes, initial treatment data was available for 227 (96%) of 236 patients. Documented per-protocol compliance with allocated treatment was 114 (97%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 patients receiving standard care. Among 119 patients receiving standard care, initial management was pleural aspiration in 81 (68%) patients, 38 (47%) of whom subsequently required chest drain insertion. 31 (26%) of 119 patients receiving standard care were initially managed with a chest drain (table 4).

Table 4
Secondary outcomes: need for further procedures

Following the initial intervention, patients who received ambulatory care required fewer total pleural procedures (mean 1·2 [SD 0·5]) than did those who received standard care (mean 1·4 [SD 0·7]; p = 0·0327), and 40 (33·6%) of 119 patients who received standard care required one or more further pleural procedures (table 4). Surgical referral rates were similar in both groups, including 33 (28%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 26 (22%) of 119 patients who had standard care. Of patients referred for surgery, 21 (64%) in ambulatory care and 19 (73%) in standard care then had a surgical procedure.

### Effect of environmental factors on postoperative recurrent primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a case-crossover study [^f7e55958]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is a benign condition that predominantly affects young, tall, and thin males. Despite well-established management strategies, the high recurrence rate remains a significant challenge. Recurrence rates for PSP are typically reported to range from 16 to 52%, complicating counseling about future risk and creating uncertainty regarding optimal management. More recent studies indicate that recurrence occurs in 21–32% of cases after the first episode, with 4–21% involving the contralateral side. Our previous research demonstrated that preemptive contralateral blebectomy during initial PSP surgery significantly reduces the risk of future contralateral recurrence. Currently, conservative management is recommended for initial PSP treatment, with early surgical intervention reserved for patients who prioritize recurrence prevention — such as those with a history of tension pneumothorax, persistent air leak, or high-risk occupations. However, postoperative recurrent pneumothorax (PORP), defined as recurrence on the same side, still occurs in 3–13% of patients following surgery.

The triggers for PSP episodes remain largely undefined, contributing to anxiety and psychological burdens among affected young individuals. Over the last few decades, studies have proposed potential associations between PSP incidence and meteorological or environmental factors, but findings have been inconsistent across different geographic regions. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis echoed these inconsistencies, attributing them to variations in study designs, measurement methods, and statistical analyses. While some studies reported higher temperatures on days with spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) than on control days, research on the influence of air pollution on PSP has been limited, resulting in inconclusive evidence.

PSP and its recurrence present considerable clinical and public health concerns in young adults, and the optimal strategies for prevention remain uncertain. In particular, efforts to predict and reduce the occurrence of PORP are areas with significant room for improvement.

This study seeks to address these gaps by conducting a longitudinal analysis of a well-characterized PSP cohort with documented postoperative recurrence. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the associations between meteorological and air pollution factors and the occurrence of PSP and PORP episodes in the same patient population.

### Improving care through standardized treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax [^e8e40083]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this quality improvement (QI) initiative was to implement a standardized clinical treatment protocol for patients presenting with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) in order to decrease hospital length of stay (LOS), diagnostic radiation exposure, and related cost.

Methods

Baseline data from patients admitted with PSP from January 1, 2016 to July 31, 2018 were compared to data from patients managed using a newly developed evidence-based treatment pathway from August 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Standard QI methodology was used to track results.

Results

Fifty-six episodes of PSP were observed during the baseline period and 40 episodes of PSP following initiation of the PSP protocol. The average LOS decreased from 4.5 days to 2.9 days. Patients underwent an average of 8.8 X-rays per admission preintervention versus 5.9 postintervention. The rate of CT scans decreased from 45% to 15% (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between the preintervention (13%) and postintervention (10%) groups (p = 0.7). Average admission costs per patient decreased by $1322 after adoption of the pathway.

Conclusions

Adoption of a standardized treatment protocol for PSP led to a reduction in LOS, diagnostic imaging utilization, and cost without increasing clinical recurrence.

### Aspiration versus tube drainage in primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a randomised study [^26c45e2a]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

This randomised study was designed to compare clinical outcomes for simple aspiration versus tube thoracostomy, in the treatment of the first primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) attack. A randomised trial, comparing simple aspiration with tube thoracostomy, in 137 patients with a first episode of PSP was carried out. Immediate success was obtained in 40 out of the 65 patients (62%) randomly assigned to undergo simple aspiration and in 49 out of the 72 patients (68%) who had been randomly assigned to undergo tube thoracostomy. The 1-week success rates were: 58 (89%) patients in the intention-to-treat simple aspiration group and 63 (88%) patients in the tube thoracostomy group. In the aspiration group, there were more recurrences during the 3-month follow-up period (15 versus 8%), though the difference was not significant. Recurrence rates at 1 and 2 yrs were 16 (22%) and 20 (31%) for patients who had undergone simple aspiration, respectively, and 17 (24%) and 18 (25%) for patients who had undergone tube thoracostomies, respectively. Complications occurred in 5 (7%) patients who had undergone a tube thoracostomy and 1 (2%) patient who had undergone simple aspiration. Analgesia was required in 22 (34%) patients of the simple aspiration group versus 40 (56%) patients of the tube thoracostomy group. These findings suggest that simple aspiration could be an acceptable alternative to tube thoracostomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Longer symptom onset to aspiration time predicts success of needle aspiration in primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^79fe3fe3]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Needle aspiration (NA) is recommended as first-line treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). We aimed to assess NA success and the effect of a longer symptom onset to NA time.

Methods

A discovery phase was retrospectively conducted in the intensive care unit of Louis Mourier Hospital (January 2000 to December 2011) followed by a prospective validation cohort (January 2012 to August 2015). The primary outcome was immediate NA success defined by the absence of need for chest tube insertion within 24hours of the procedure.

Results

In the discovery phase, 130 patients were admitted for PSP and 98 had NA as first-line treatment (75%). The immediate success rate of NA was 34.7% and was higher when it was performed ≥ 48hours after symptom onset (57.7% vs 25%; p = 0.004). In the prospective cohort, 87 patients were admitted for PSP; 71 (82%) had NA as first-step treatment. The immediate success rate was 40.8%. NA was more successful when it was performed after 48hours of symptoms' onset (34.5% vs 7.1%; p = 0.005). A delay between the first symptom and NA procedure ≥ 48hours was associated with a higher success of NA (OR = 13.54; 95%CI 1.37 to 133). A smaller pneumothorax estimated by Light's index was associated with NA success (OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.98). To what extent some of these pneumothoraces would have had a spontaneous resolution remains unknown.

Conclusion

When managing PSP with NA, a longer symptom onset to NA time was associated with NA success.

### Simple aspiration and drainage and intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis versus simple aspiration and drainage for the initial treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax: an open-label, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^0c3518a6]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Simple aspiration and drainage is a standard initial treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax, but the rate of pneumothorax recurrence is substantial. We investigated whether additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration and drainage reduces the rate of recurrence.

Methods

In our open-label, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, controlled trial at two hospitals in Taiwan, patients were aged 15–40 years and had a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with a rim of air greater than 2 cm on chest radiographs, complete lung expansion without air leakage after pigtail catheter drainage, adequate haematological function, and normal renal and hepatic function. After simple aspiration and drainage via a pigtail catheter, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg of minocycline pleurodesis or no further treatment (control group). Randomisation was by computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes. Our primary endpoint was rate of pneumothorax recurrence at 1 year. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00418392).

Findings

Between Dec 31, 2006, and June 30, 2012, 214 patients were randomly assigned-106 to the minocycline group and 108 to the control group (intention-to-treat population). Treatment was unsuccessful within 7 days of randomisation in 14 patients in the minocycline group and 20 patients in the control group. At 1 year, pneumothoraces had recurred in 31 of 106 (29·2%) patients in the minocycline group compared with 53 of 108 (49·1%) in the control group (p = 0·003). We noted no procedure-related complications in either group.

Interpretation

Simple aspiration and drainage followed by minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and more effective treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax than is simple aspiration and drainage only. Minocycline pleurodesis should be an adjunct to standard treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Ambulatory treatment in the management of pneumothorax: a systematic review of the literature [^cb27defd]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) is broken down into primary (PSP: no known underlying lung disease), secondary (SSP: known lung disease) and from trauma or iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP). Current treatments include a conservative approach, needle aspiration, chest drain, suction and surgery. A Heimlich valve (HV) is a lightweight one-way valve designed for the ambulatory treatment of pneumothorax (with an intercostal catheter).

Methods

We performed a systematic review across nine electronic databases for studies reporting the use of HV for adults with pneumothorax. Randomised controlled trials (RCT), case control studies and case series were included, unrestricted by year of publication. Measures of interest included the use only of a HV to manage SP or IP, (ie, avoidance of further procedures), successful treatment as outpatient (OP) and complications.

Results

Eighteen studies were included reporting on the use of HV in 1235 patients, 992 cases of SP (of which 413 were reported as PSP) and 243 IP. The overall quality of the reports was moderate to poor with high risk of bias. Success with HV alone was 1060/1235 (85.8%) and treatment as OP successful in 761/977 (77.9%). Serious complications are rare. Long-term outcomes are comparable with current treatments.

Conclusions

High-quality data to support the use of HV for ambulatory treatment of pneumothorax is sparse. The use of HV in such circumstances may have benefits for patient comfort, mobility and avoidance of hospital admission, with comparable outcomes to current practice. There is urgent need for a carefully designed RCT to answer his question.

### Randomised ambulatory management of primary pneumothorax (RAMPP): protocol of an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^c1630be7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumothorax — air in the pleural space — is a common pathology. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) conventionally refers to patients developing a pneumothorax, in the absence of trauma, with no underlying established lung pathology. PSP occurs in ~3000 patients per year in the UK. A minority can be managed conservatively with close observation only. A currently recruiting trial is assessing conservative versus interventional management. However, many patients will require an intervention to re-expand the lung. In most patients 'aspiration' of the trapped air using a cannula and syringe is considered, but more than 50% will require treatment with insertion of a chest drain and a standard underwater seal. The average duration of inpatient stay of patients admitted for drainage is 6–8 days.

Ambulatory management of patients with PSP could potentially remove the need for long hospital admission and outpatient treatment. Reducing the need for chest drains with bulky underwater systems may allow patients to be more mobile and facilitate earlier discharge. A 'Heimlich valve' (one-way valve connected to a chest drain, rather than a bulky underwater seal) has been previously proposed, in the form of either one-way valves attached to standard chest drains, as well as the relatively new 'pocket' devices in which the drainage catheter and one-way valve are integrated into a single device. A systematic review of 18 studies using ambulatory management reported an overall success rate of 85.8% and a successful outpatient management in 77.9% with 'few complications'. However, the evidence was of poor quality with a high risk of bias, with only two small randomised trials and with the remainder being retrospective case series.

### Utilization and outcomes of observation for spontaneous pneumothorax at an integrated health system [^df48708b]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Though limited, recent evidence supports observation rather than intervention for spontaneous pneumothorax management. We sought to compare the utilization and outcomes between observation and intervention for patients with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of all adults presenting to Kaiser Permanente Northern California emergency rooms with spontaneous pneumothorax from 2016 to 2020 was performed. Those with prior pneumothoraces, tension physiology, bilateral pneumothoraces, effusions, and prior thoracic procedures or surgery on the affected side were excluded. Groups included observation versus intervention. Baseline clinicodemographic variables and outcomes were compared. Treatment was considered successful if further interventions were not required for pneumothorax resolution. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, chi-square tests, Fischer exact tests, and multivariable logistic regression models were performed.

Results

Of the 386 patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, and the Charlson comorbidity index were not different between treatment groups. Of 86 patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, age, gender, and smoking status were not different between treatment groups. Among patients with primary pneumothoraces, 83 underwent observation while 303 underwent intervention. The success rate was 92.8% for observation and 60.4% for intervention (P < 0.0001). Among patients with secondary pneumothoraces, 15 underwent observation while 71 underwent intervention, with a successful rate of 73.3% for observation and 32.4% for intervention (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Given the high success rates for observation of both small and moderate primary and secondary pneumothoraces, observation should be considered for clinically stable patients. Observation may be the superior choice for decreasing morbidity and healthcare costs.

### Factors associated with early recurrence in non-surgically managed primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^99a6c500]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

The indications for surgery in primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) at first episode are clearly defined. Despite the indications, some patients avoid surgical treatment. This study examines the factors affecting early recurrence in patients who have not undergone surgical intervention.

Methods

This retrospective and multicenter study was conducted between January 2018 and June 2023. The impact of demographic characteristics, inflammatory response, smoking habits before and after the episode, treatment modality, duration of chest tube drainage, and quantitative measurements of bullae–bleb structures on the risk and timing of recurrence was examined in 117 cases of first episode PSP.

Results

Age, sex, inflammatory response indicators, pre‐episode smoking history, pneumothorax volume, and bullae size were not associated with earlier recurrence. The detection of bullae–blebs on computed tomography in first episode PSP and smoking post‐episode in non‐surgically treated cases were correlated with earlier recurrence (p = 0.031; p = 0.019, respectively). In cases that surgical intervention had not been performed, a prolonged duration of chest tube drainage correlated with increased recurrence‐free survival and decreased recurrence risk (p = 0.002).

Conclusion

In cases of first episode PSP, surgical intervention may be advised when bullae–bleb formations are detected via tomography. Patients who did not undergo surgical treatment during the first episode and smoke after discharge are at higher risk of earlier recurrence. Prolonged chest tube drainage duration reduces the risk of earlier recurrence in first‐episode PSP cases that have not undergone surgical intervention. This finding suggests that extended drainage is not a disadvantageous outcome for cases hesitant to undergo surgical treatment.

### Should we consider the resected lung volume in primary spontaneous pneumothorax? [^7d6ffc6e]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although bullectomy is the most curative treatment in primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), postoperative recurrence is not uncommon. New bulla formation at the staple line is the most common cause of recurrence. However, the mechanism is not known. We believe that the pressure gradient plays the main role in new bulla formation. A large resection amount induces a prolonged pressure gradient for obliteration of the residual space. This study aimed to identify the association between resected lung volume and recurrence.

Methods

The medical records of patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) bullectomy were reviewed between October 2010 and December 2017. A total of 396 patients underwent surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax. The electronic medical records (EMRs) of the patients were reviewed. Patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax were excluded. Patients who were diagnosed with emphysema on CT were excluded. Patients with PSP were excluded from the study if the bulla was not located in the apex or if there was no ruptured bulla at the time of the operation. Patients who lacked EMRs were also excluded. We reviewed the medical records of 276 patients. The apical resected lung volume was estimated using a conical volumetric formula with the use of the specimen size. The risk factors for postoperative recurrence were analyzed.

Results

The median age was 19 years old (range 13–36). A total of 261 patients were male (94.6%). The median body weight and body mass index (BMI) were 58 kg (range 40–82) and 18.92 (range 15.21–26.47), respectively. In 24 patients, both sides were operated on simultaneously. The resected lung volume was obtained by using a conical volumetric formula, and the value was divided by the BMI value. The median value was 1.43 (0.03–5.67). The median operative time was 35 min (range 15–120). The median postoperative day was 4 (range 2–12). Age (p = 0.006), the value of the resected lung volume divided by BMI (p = 0.003), bilateral bullectomy (p = 0.013) and transverse diameter (p = 0.034) were associated with postoperative recurrence according to the univariate analysis. According to the multivariate analysis, age and the value of the lung volume divided by BMI were significant risk factors for postoperative recurrence.

Conclusions

Younger age and a large resected lung volume and a low BMI are associated with postoperative recurrence after VATS bullectomy for PSP.

### Chemical pleurodesis-a review of mechanisms involved in pleural space obliteration [^aaa84646]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax is the second most common indication for chemical pleurodesis. Data on the incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax are rather scarce. The results of one recent study that used an English national dataset showed the overall annual incidence for both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax of 14.1 per 100,000 population. This number seems to be consistent with the data from earlier studies. Most authors agree that pleurodesis should be offered to patients with the first recurrence (i.e. the second episode) of spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the definitive treatment aimed to prevent recurrence of pneumothorax is not limited to chemical pleurodesis, but also includes other therapeutic options. Bearing in mind the above considerations, it is easy to understand that the number of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who are treated with chemical pleurodesis might be lower than the respective number of patients with pleural effusion. Nevertheless, chemical pleurodesis is a widely used, cost-effective method preventing recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The effectiveness of chemical and mechanical pleurodesis in this group of patients is high and estimated to reach 90–99%.

Available data indicate that chemical pleurodesis is an important treatment option for both patients with pleural effusion and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hence, the importance of understanding the mechanisms of action of sclerosing agents and further studies on new effective and safe sclerosants.

### LARGE primary spontaneous pneumothorax (2023 French guidelines definition): Do radiographic size matter in pediatric patients? A comparative analysis [^998c188f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to explore the applicability of the definition of "large" primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) of adult guidelines to pediatric patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective monocentric analysis of first-episodes of PSP (Period: January 2010-January 2023). We defined large PSP according to French SPLF/SMFU/SRLF/SFAR/SFCTCV Guidelines.

Inclusion Criteria

age 1–18 years-old, follow-up ≥ 1 year. We performed a comparative analysis between large and nonlarge PSP. We reported the categorical variables as frequencies, and continuous as median and range. We compared categorical variables using Chi-Square or Fisher test, and continuous using U Mann-Whitney test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

The population consisted of 49 patients, 15 (30%) with large PSP. We found no significant differences at presentation between large and nonlarge PSP regarding age, sex, side, BMI, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and hearth rate. Conservative first-line management was used significantly less for large PSP (26% vs. 82%, p = 0.0003), while drain more (46% vs. 8%, p = 0.005). The groups were similar regarding surgery. Large PSP had a significantly longer hospitalization (7 days vs. 4 days, p = 0.003). The incidence of first-line management failure was similar between the groups. During the follow-up, we found no significant differences regarding ipsilateral recurrence (33% vs. 17%, p = 0.275), and contralateral occurrence (0% vs. 5%, p = 1.000), need for drain (6% vs. 5%, p = 1.000), or surgery (33% vs. 14%, p = 0.246).

Conclusions

In the first-line, large PSP were treated significantly less conservatively and more drained. Radiographic size of the pneumothorax does not seem to have an impact on first-line treatment failure and follow-up outcomes.

### Complete atelectasis of the lung in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^500e526a]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Complete atelectasis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) requires immediate air reduction. Surgical intervention has been considered proper treatment for persistent air leakage or recurrence. We examined whether this is the proper treatment by evaluating the natural course and treatment outcomes of complete lung atelectasis.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 286 patients with a first episode of PSP. We classified patients as partial atelectasis (n = 201, 71%) and complete atelectasis (n = 85, 29%) by initial radiography. Surgical intervention was done for persistent air leakage or recurrence, and all surgery was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We compared both groups for demographic and operative variables.

Results

In all, 29.4% of the complete atelectasis group and 10% of the partial atelectasis group showed persistent air leakage. The ipsilateral recurrence rate was 70% for the complete atelectasis group and 39.2% for the partial atelectasis group. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed in 78.8% and 45.3% of the complete atelectasis and partial atelectasis groups, respectively. The postoperative course and recurrence rate were not different between the two groups during 40.2 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

The PSP patients with complete atelectasis showed a higher incidence of persistent air leakage and ipsilateral recurrence than did PSP patients with partial atelectasis. Operative outcomes were good. Complete atelectasis of the lung in PSP patients is an indication for surgical intervention at their first PSP episode.

### Digital versus analogue chest drainage system in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a randomized controlled trial [^8b08c4c7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of air in the pleural space in patients without clinically apparent lung disease. The condition is associated with smoking.

The management of PSP is based on two principles: first, the initial management of the pneumothorax with symptom control and re-expansion of the lung and secondly, reducing recurrence rate. The recurrence rate is reported to be between 17 and 54%, with the majority of recurrences in the first year after the primary event. Recurrence rate can be reduced by surgical pleurectomy or thoracoscopic pleurodesis. Initial management of PSP has been subject of ongoing debate, with a trend towards a more conservative approach using manual aspiration and outpatient treatment. Manual aspiration has been shown to be effective in approximately two-thirds of patients and is as equally effective as chest tube drainage. Since it is associated with reduced hospitalization or length of stay (LOS), manual aspiration is recommended as the standard of care in international guidelines and recommendations. However, in daily practice, insertion of a small-bore pleural catheter or chest tube is still common practice in the Netherlands, probably due to practical reasons.

Until recently, the pleural catheter or chest tube was commonly connected to an analogue drainage system, in which air leakage is assessed by the observation of bubbling in the water seal. A major disadvantage of analogue systems is their inability to give accurate information about the quantity of air leakage and about air leak patterns. Uncertainty about air leakage might lead to unnecessary prolongation of hospital stay and additionally might increase the risk of recurrence, due to removing the tube before the pleural defect has healed.

Digital drainage systems provide quantitative information on air leakage (flow) in mL/min, both actual and historical, thereby providing information on air leakage patterns. In thoracic surgical patients these drainage systems have been shown to reduce duration of hospital stay, compared to analogue drainage systems. Digital monitoring of air leakage patterns might be useful in predicting prolonged air leakage after pulmonary resection, thereby providing a window-of opportunity for early intervention.

Whether digital drainage of PSP affects duration of hospital stay has yet to be established. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the use of a digital drainage system in PSP leads to a shorter length of (hospital) stay compared to the use of an analogue drainage system.

### Pneumothorax as a complication of combination antiangiogenic therapy in children and young adults with refractory / recurrent solid tumors [^b1040198]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Appropriate management of a pneumothorax includes observation alone, observation with supplemental oxygen, needle aspiration, insertion of an intercostal catheter or thoracostomy tube, or invasive thoracoscopy or thoracotomy. Although treatment options are dictated by clinical symptoms and size of the pneumothorax, many aspects about the management of pneumothorax in children, especially those with cancer, are challenging and currently there are no established guidelines for children. Furthermore, establishing a standardized approach is difficult as the data in children are based on small-scale studies and mainly address primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Because of the link between the development of a pneumothorax and combination antiangiogenic chemotherapy-induced tumor cavitation in our patient population at a median of 5.7 weeks from the start of therapy, we recommend imaging with a 2-view chest x-ray at least 3–4 weeks from the initiation of therapy to evaluate for the presence of cavitary change in the lung nodules and an asymptomatic pneumothorax. Patients with these findings warrant close observation with serial imaging. The caregiver and patient should also be educated about potential symptoms necessitating further evaluation. Given the need for knowledge concerning appropriate management guidelines in children, we propose an algorithm for the management of spontaneous pneumothorax as a complication of treatment for advanced cancer (Fig. 2). Our algorithm was devised based on the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) consensus statement regarding treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults. We added our experience to formulate a pediatric-specific pneumothorax management protocol.

### Digital versus analogue chest drainage system in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax: a randomized controlled trial [^6a3ab008]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) who are treated with chest tube drainage are traditionally connected to an analogue chest drainage system, containing a water seal and using a visual method of monitoring air leakage. Electronic systems with continuous digital monitoring of air leakage provide better insight into actual air leakage and changes in leakage over time, which may lead to a shorter length of hospital stay.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing the digital with analogue system, with the aim of demonstrating that use of a digital drainage system in PSP leads to a shorter hospital stay.

Results

In 102 patients enrolled with PSP we found no differences in total duration of chest tube drainage and hospital stay between the groups. However, in a post-hoc analysis, excluding 19 patients needing surgery due to prolonged air leakage, hospital stay was significantly shorter in the digital group (median 1 days, IQR 1–5 days) compared to the analogue group (median 3 days, IQR 2–5 days) (p 0.014). Treatment failure occurred in 3 patients in both groups; the rate of recurrence within 12 weeks was not significantly different between groups (16% in the digital group versus 8% in the analogue group, p 0.339).

Conclusion

Length of hospital stay was not shorter in patients with PSP when applying a digital drainage system compared to an analogue drainage system. However, in the large subgroup of uncomplicated PSP, a significant reduction in duration of drainage and hospital stay was demonstrated with digital drainage. These findings suggest that digital drainage may be a practical alternative to manual aspiration in the management of PSP.

### Pleural disease in the emergency department [^4be98b19]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Emergency department presentations of pleural-based diseases are common, with severity ranging from mild to life threatening. The acute assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of pleural disease are critical as urgent invasive maneuvers such as thoracocentesis and thoracostomy may be indicated. The emergency physician must have a systematic approach to these conditions that allows for rapid recognition, diagnosis, and definitive management. This article focuses on nontraumatic pleural disease, including diagnostic and treatment considerations of pleural effusion, empyema, primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, pediatric pneumothorax, spontaneous hemothorax, and spontaneous tension pneumothorax.

### First episode of spontaneous pneumothorax: CT-based scoring to select patients for early surgery [^3db6c387]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is frequent, guidelines do not routinely recommend surgery after first presentation. A CT-based lung dystrophy severity score (DSS) has recently been proposed to predict recurrence following conservative therapy. This study compares the DSS in surgically and conservatively treated patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of first episode PSP patients, comparing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS; group A) to conservative treatment with or without chest drainage (group B). CT scans were reviewed for blebs or bullae, and patients were assigned DSS values and stratified into risk groups (low and high-grade). Primary end point was ipsilateral or contralateral recurrence.

Results

Fifty-six patients were included, 33 received VATS and 23 conservative treatment. In total, 37.5% experienced recurrence, with a 5-year estimated recurrence rate of 40.7% (group A: 13.3%; group B: 73.9%; p < 0.001). In group B, detection of any dystrophic lesions resulted in significantly higher 5-year recurrence rates (86.7 vs. 50.0%; p = 0.03), there was no significant difference in group A (17.7 vs. 7.7%; p = 0.50). Greater DSS values correlated with higher 5-year recurrence rates in group B (p = 0.02), but not in group A (p = 0.90). Comparing low- and high-grade patients in group B resulted in a significant 5-year recurrence rate of 53.8 versus 100% (p = 0.023).

Conclusions

The DSS is useful to indicate VATS after the first episode. For routine application, assigning patients to low- and high-grade groups seems most practical. We recommend CT-evaluation for every PSP patient and early surgery for those with lesions exceeding one bleb. After VATS, the preoperative DSS is not beneficial in predicting recurrence.

### Factors associated with early recurrence in non-surgically managed primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^63515449]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between pneumothorax and inflammatory processes. Studies indicate that pneumothorax enhances the inflammatory response in both the blood and pleura. The appearance of pulmonary bronchiolitis and the increased inflammatory cell count in wedge resection specimens of PSP cases suggest that inflammation may contribute to the etiology of PSP. Building on this evidence, the present study aims to investigate whether inflammatory markers can predict recurrence in patients experiencing a first episode of PSP that was managed non‐surgically. We specifically evaluated several inflammation‐related blood parameters — white blood cell (WBC) count, systemic immune‐inflammation index (SII), neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) — all of which are easily obtained through routine blood tests and have been increasingly studied in recent years for their diagnostic and prognostic value in various medical conditions. Research on the recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) typically includes data from all treatment approaches, evaluates the risk of recurrence, and accounts for smoking history solely in the pre‐episode period. In clinical practice, a significant uncertainty for patients recommended for surgery during first episode (FE) is the timing of potential recurrence. This uncertainty may affect the decision of numerous patients for surgery following the FE. Our study examined the factors influencing the recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax managed without surgical intervention, utilizing only observation or tube thoracostomy. Unlike many reports in the literature that include patients who underwent surgery, our research specifically focused on patients managed exclusively with non‐surgical approaches. Not only was recurrence risk investigated, but also, as a novel aspect, recurrence‐free survival (RFS) was investigated. Based on the hypothesis that inflammatory response may affect the quality of healing of bullae structures, we analyzed the effects of inflammatory response, smoking before and — as a novel aspect — after the episode, treatment method, duration of chest tube drainage (DCT), and quantitative measurements of bullae‐bleb structures on recurrence risk and RFS.
