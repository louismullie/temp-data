## Question

If amiodarone can be given for acute atrial fibrillation with RBBB

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amiodarone can be given for acute atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in a patient who has right bundle branch block, and what the key safety considerations and guideline-based recommendations are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether RBBB changes the management of acute AF rate control. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about IV amiodarone for acute AF, especially in heart failure or decompensated states. Next, I will check the FDA labeling and contraindications to ensure RBBB is not a formal contraindication. After that, I need to assess the pathophysiologic risk of amiodarone in the setting of RBBB and potential progression to higher-grade block. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation with dosing and monitoring, and consider alternatives if the risk is unacceptable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: acute AF with rapid ventricular response in the presence of RBBB. RBBB itself is not a contraindication to rate-control therapy; it is a conduction abnormality that can reflect structural disease and is associated with worse outcomes in some populations, but it does not preclude standard AF management principles, so I should not jump to conclusions that RBBB changes acute pharmacologic rate control decisions by itself [^113ei6qi] [^114zZGZ5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on IV amiodarone for acute AF rate control. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline supports considering IV amiodarone for acute rate control in critically ill patients or those with decompensated heart failure when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, which is exactly the scenario where amiodarone is often most useful acutely [^116MWexS] [^114m34W5]. The 2024 ESC/EACTS guideline similarly recommends considering IV amiodarone, digoxin, esmolol, or landiolol for acute rate control in AF with hemodynamic instability or severely depressed LVEF, reinforcing its role in unstable or HF contexts [^116S5GVh]. Hold on, I should verify that none of these documents list RBBB as a reason to avoid amiodarone; I do not see RBBB listed as a contraindication in these rate-control recommendations, which supports proceeding cautiously when clinically indicated [^notfound].

> I will now examine the FDA labeling to ensure there is no hidden contraindication. The Pacerone label lists contraindications including sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block, and bradycardia leading to syncope without a pacemaker, but it does not list isolated RBBB as a contraindication, which aligns with the notion that RBBB alone is not a formal reason to avoid amiodarone [^111haywH]. Wait, let me verify the IV formulations as well. Nexterone and generic IV amiodarone labeling similarly emphasize contraindications around significant bradyarrhythmias and AV block without pacing support, again not naming RBBB specifically, which supports that isolated RBBB is permissible with caution [^113faSwE].

> But wait, what if RBBB signals higher risk of infranodal conduction disease or progression to block? I need to check the pathophysiology and risk modifiers. RBBB can be a marker of conduction system disease and, in some cohorts, is associated with higher mortality and progression to higher-grade block, though absolute risk varies by context; importantly, amiodarone can cause or unmask sinus node dysfunction and AV block, so baseline conduction abnormalities warrant vigilance even if they are not absolute contraindications [^113ei6qi] [^114zZGZ5] [^113EiwjZ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the presence of RBBB should prompt me to screen for bifascicular or trifascicular disease and to monitor closely for bradycardia or worsening block rather than to categorically avoid amiodarone when it is otherwise indicated for acute AF rate control in HF or instability [^notfound].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions and cumulative nodal suppression risks. Amiodarone has beta- and calcium channel–blocking properties and can potentiate bradycardia when combined with other nodal agents; in patients with RBBB, especially if there is any suggestion of bifascicular block or PR prolongation, stacking nodal blockade increases the risk of higher-grade AV block, so I need to review concomitant medications and consider dose adjustments or alternative strategies if multiple nodal agents are already on board [^116zXnBx] [^113EiwjZ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said amiodarone is contraindicated with any AV nodal disease; that would be too strong — its contraindication is specifically significant sinus-node dysfunction, second- or third-degree AV block, or marked bradycardia without pacing, so isolated RBBB is not an absolute contraindication, but it is a yellow flag for enhanced monitoring [^111haywH] [^113faSwE].

> Let me consider dosing and practical administration. For acute rate control, IV amiodarone is typically loaded with 150 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 360 mg over 6 hours at 1 mg/min, then 540 mg over the next 18 hours at 0.5 mg/min, with transition to oral 100–200 mg daily if continued. Some protocols use 150–300 mg IV over 1 hour, then 10–50 mg/h for 24 hours, so institutional pathways vary and should be followed with telemetry in place [^1132C5oR] [^112EFACu]. I should confirm that continuous ECG monitoring is standard during IV therapy given the risks of bradycardia and hypotension, and that blood pressure and heart rhythm are checked frequently during the infusion [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and mitigation strategies. Before and during amiodarone, I need to ensure close ECG monitoring for new PR prolongation, second-degree AV block, or junctional rhythms. Check electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium. Review concomitant nodal agents. And have a low threshold to reduce dose or stop if significant bradycardia or conduction worsening emerges, with consideration of temporary pacing if high-grade block develops in an unstable patient without a pacemaker [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize balancing benefit in decompensated HF against AV block risk; yes, both ACC/AHA and ESC prioritize hemodynamic stabilization in AF with rapid response, and amiodarone is an accepted option when first-line rate agents are unsuitable, with explicit caution about toxicity and the need for monitoring [^116MWexS] [^116S5GVh].

> I need to ensure I consider alternatives if the conduction risk seems high or if amiodarone is not favored. In AF with rapid response and HFrEF or decompensation, digoxin is a reasonable alternative for rate control and is often combined with other agents when needed; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in significant LV dysfunction, which is why amiodarone or digoxin are preferred in that subgroup [^1145nHv8] [^111jfJvB]. If there is concern for bifascicular disease or marked baseline conduction delay, prioritizing digoxin, minimizing nodal agents, and planning for close monitoring or pacing support may be safer while still achieving rate control goals [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, amiodarone can be given for acute AF with rapid ventricular response in a patient with isolated RBBB, provided there is no second- or third-degree AV block, marked sinus bradycardia, or syncopal bradycardia without pacing, and provided continuous ECG monitoring, electrolyte optimization, and careful review of concomitant nodal-blocking drugs are in place. The presence of RBBB heightens my vigilance for conduction deterioration but does not constitute a formal contraindication to amiodarone when guidelines support its use for acute rate control in HF or instability [^111haywH] [^116MWexS] [^116S5GVh].

---

In general, **amiodarone can be used for acute atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with RBBB** when standard rate-control agents (beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are ineffective or contraindicated, especially in the setting of heart failure or hemodynamic instability [^116MWexS] [^116S5GVh]. Amiodarone is not contraindicated in isolated RBBB, but **monitor for bradycardia and AV block** because it can worsen conduction disease [^113EiwjZ]. Use continuous ECG monitoring, correct electrolytes, and avoid other QT-prolonging or nodal-blocking drugs when possible [^116zXnBx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support **amiodarone for acute AF rate control** in selected patients:

- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2023 guidelines**: Consider IV amiodarone for acute rate control in critically ill or decompensated HF patients when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated [^116MWexS] [^114m34W5].

- **ESC 2024 guidelines**: Consider IV amiodarone, digoxin, esmolol, or landiolol for acute rate control in AF with hemodynamic instability or severely depressed LVEF [^116S5GVh].

- **CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines**: Consider IV amiodarone or digoxin for acute rate control in significant LV dysfunction, decompensated HF, or hypotension when immediate cardioversion is not indicated [^117HqYaC].

These guidelines **do not list RBBB as a contraindication** to amiodarone use.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Although amiodarone is not contraindicated in isolated RBBB, **clinicians should be aware of the following risks**:

- **Bradycardia and AV block**: Amiodarone can cause or worsen sinus bradycardia and AV block, particularly in patients with pre-existing conduction disease [^113EiwjZ].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Amiodarone prolongs the QT interval and can rarely cause torsades de pointes, especially with electrolyte disturbances or other QT-prolonging drugs [^116zXnBx].

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Amiodarone can cause hypotension, particularly with rapid IV administration [^114MG5ub].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

Limited studies specifically address amiodarone use in AF patients with RBBB; however, **amiodarone is widely used for acute AF rate control** in patients with structural heart disease, including those with conduction abnormalities. Its efficacy and safety are supported by clinical experience and guideline recommendations [^116MWexS] [^116S5GVh].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When administering amiodarone to patients with RBBB and acute AF, **the following precautions are recommended**:

- **Continuous ECG monitoring**: Monitor for bradycardia, AV block, and QT prolongation [^116zXnBx].

- **Electrolyte management**: Correct potassium and magnesium levels before and during treatment [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid concomitant use of other QT-prolonging or nodal-blocking drugs when possible [^116zXnBx].

- **Clinical assessment**: Regularly assess for signs of hemodynamic instability, worsening heart failure, or conduction disturbances [^116qwuf1].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

If amiodarone is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternative agents for acute rate control** include:

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Digoxin | - Acute rate control in AF with HF or LV dysfunction | - Slower onset <br/> - Monitor for toxicity [^117TiHjS] |
| Beta-blockers (esmolol, metoprolol) | First-line for acute rate control in AF without significant HF | Contraindicated in decompensated HF [^notfound] |
| Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) | First-line for acute rate control in AF without significant HF | Contraindicated in decompensated HF [^111jfJvB] |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Amiodarone can be used** for acute AF with rapid ventricular response in patients with RBBB when standard rate-control agents are ineffective or contraindicated, particularly in the setting of heart failure or hemodynamic instability [^116MWexS] [^116S5GVh].

- **RBBB is not a contraindication** to amiodarone use, but clinicians should monitor for bradycardia, AV block, and QT prolongation [^113EiwjZ].

- **Continuous ECG monitoring, electrolyte management, and careful assessment of drug interactions** are essential when administering amiodarone in this patient population [^116zXnBx].

---

Amiodarone is appropriate for acute AF with rapid ventricular response in patients with RBBB when standard agents are ineffective or contraindicated, especially in heart failure or hemodynamic instability. RBBB is not a contraindication, but **close monitoring for bradycardia, AV block, and QT prolongation is required** [^116zXnBx].

### Amiodarone for cardioversion on recent-onset atrial fibrillation… [^114N8NQn]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Recent-onset atrial fibrillation, defined as an onset within one week, is a major issue in clinical practice, and recent advances have shown that cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm provides better patient outcomes. Cardio-version can be attempted with electric and pharmacologic methods. Immediate electric cardioversion is indicated in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response who have evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, symptomatic hypotension, angina, or heart failure that does not respond to pharmacologic interventions. The study design was a meta-analysis of randomized trials on the treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation comparing amiodarone with placebo and the class Ic drugs. The database search included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The trial had to be a prospective, randomized trial of amiodarone versus placebo or a class Ic antiarrhythmic medication.

The main outcome measure was rate of cardioversion within 24 hours. Other data collected included rates of cardioversion at one to two, three to five, and six to eight hours. Mortality and adverse events also were analyzed. There were six studies that compared amiodarone to placebo, and seven studies compared it to the class Ic antiarrhythmics, for a total of 1, 174 patients. The results showed that there was no difference between amiodarone and placebo with regard to cardioversion rates at one to two hours, but there was a significant improvement in cardioversion rates with amiodarone after six to eight hours. The class Ic medications had a significantly better rate of cardioversion than amiodarone for up to eight hours, but there was no difference between the two groups at 24 hours. The adverse events were minimal in all of the studies, with no deaths reported in any of the treatment groups.

The authors conclude that amiodarone is as safe and effective as the class Ic antiarrhythmic medications at 24 hours in cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation. It provides an alternative for patients who are not candidates for the more rapid-acting antiarrhythmic medication, such as those with ventricular dysfunction and ischemic heart disease, in whom rapid cardioversion is not required. They also state that these data were based on intravenous amiodarone and further studies need to be done using the oral preparation, to establish the optimal dose, and to determine when to start outpatient treatment.

Atrial fibrillation — sotalol risk and role of amiodarone and dofetilide: A Cochrane meta-analysis found sotalol to be associated with increased all-cause mortality (RR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.03–4.81]). Low-dose amiodarone is described as more effective than sotalol and Class IC agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm but "is best reserved" for patients in whom other antiarrhythmics are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated. For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), amiodarone and dofetilide are presented as options for maintenance of sinus rhythm, as they are effective while most other drugs are contraindicated.

### Amiodarone hci [^115qDpmF]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients refractory to other therapy. Amiodarone HCl injection also can be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. During or after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, patients may be transferred to oral amiodarone therapy (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

Amiodarone HCl injection should be used for acute treatment until the patient's ventricular arrhythmias are stabilized. Most patients will require this therapy for 48 to 96 hours, but amiodarone HCl injection may be safely administered for longer periods if necessary.

### Atrial fibrillation complicating acute myocardial infarction: how should it be interpreted and how should it be treated and prevented? [^116rdnou]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported to complicate the course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in ∼6–21% of hospitalized patients. Possible precipitating factors of AF in this setting include atrial ischaemia or infarction, right ventricular infarction, pericardial inflammation, acute hypoxia or hypokalaemia, and haemodynamic impairment secondary to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. – Endogenous or exogenous catecholamines may also precipitate AF. These factors can be found alone or in combination, and may superimpose on predisposing diseases affecting cardiac anatomy and physiology, such as previous cardiomyopathy, valvular impairment, or chronic lung disease. Finally, AF in the setting of AMI has been reported to be associated with ageing, severely impaired LV function, presence of mitral regurgitation, or frequent ventricular arrhythmias plus right bundle branch block, and presence of left bundle branch block. Although most of these factors are claimed to be causative of AF, the intimate relationship between their presence and AF occurrence is not known. Despite the variability of factors and conditions associated with AF in clinical practice, patients developing this arrhythmia during AMI are usually reported as a uniform category.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to intravenous amiodarone, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to administer IV amiodarone to attempt to achieve a stable rhythm after further defibrillation in patients with hemodynamically unstable VA persisting or recurring after a maximal energy shock.

### Predictive effect of atypical right bundle-branch block on in-hospital sudden cardiac death and cardiac rupture and long-term prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [^1168wwkv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of this study probably suggest that ARBBB, potentially serving as an indication for prompt reperfusion therapy, is a valuable marker for reducing the incidence of in‐hospital SCD and CR and improving the long‐term prognosis in patients with AMI. Timely identification of predictors of SCD and CR in patients with AMI can provide valuable prognostic information for clinicians, patients, and their families, aiding in guiding timely treatment and rehabilitation. For patients at high risk of AMI or with confirmed AMI, specific ECG changes need to be recognized promptly, particularly in those with AMI and ARBBB. Coronary angiography and early reperfusion therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. Simultaneously, mechanical circulatory support devices, such as intra‐aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and Impella, should be employed promptly for patients with ARBBB. If CR occurs, multidisciplinary intervention should be implemented immediately to improve the prognosis of patients with AMI and ARBBB. For survivors of AMI with BBB, cardiac resynchronization therapy, including implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator, may improve their prognosis, especially in those patients with AMI and LBBB. In our study, only 4 (1.1%) cases of LBBB with left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% were underwent successfully cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation 2 months after the onset of AMI. We plan to investigate effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy on the long‐term prognosis in patients with AMI and RBBB, particularly those with ARBBB, in our future studies.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, maintenance therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating low-dose amiodarone (100–200 mg/day) for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and normal LV function, but in view of its adverse effect profile, reserve it for situations when other rhythm control strategies are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated.

Limitations

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, this was a retrospective analysis, and as such, our data were susceptible to inherent biases. Second, the data are from a large tertiary care center, which is subject to referral bias. Third, the majority of patients were male and White; thus, these results must be interpreted in such a context. However, we did adjust for sex specifically for this reason, as prior studies had contrasting results that could be sex‐based. Fourth, although multiple confounders were accounted for in the multivariable analysis performed, there may have been other residual confounders that influenced the ultimate results of the study. Fifth, although patients did not have any noted diagnosis of CVD, it does not mean that patients did not have some element of subclinical coronary disease, myocardial dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, etc. Specifically, our study was not structured to provide further insights into the physiology underlying the differences in mortality seen with RBBB. It should be noted, however, that a scenario of testing only those patients for whom we systematically and completely excluded all pre‐existing CVD through a combination of invasive and noninvasive testing would not be generalizable to any patient population; thus, we see this as a positive aspect of our study. Finally, the patient population evaluated underwent stress testing presumably for a guideline‐recommended indication. Thus, some impetus for referral may have been based on concern for a not‐yet‐diagnosed cardiovascular condition, and the results must be interpreted in such a context. Although the current AHA/ACC guideline on risk assessment neither endorses nor does not endorse exercise testing for risk assessment, the practice at our institution often includes assessment of functional capacity more frequently than in other practices, which accounts for the frequency of the number of patients undergoing "routine" stress testing included in this population. 16 Thus, it is likely that the risk conferred by RBBB may be different, depending on the indication for which stress testing was performed (eg, presence of cardiac symptoms).

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure (HF) — antiarrhythmic selection and outcomes: Randomized trials have demonstrated the safety of amiodarone and dofetilide (given separately) in patients with HF, and these are the recommended drugs for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF in the presence of HF. In a subgroup analysis of CHF-STAT, amiodarone reduced the incidence of AF over 4 y in patients with HF to 4% compared with 8% with placebo, and conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 31% of patients on amiodarone versus 8% with placebo and was associated with significantly better survival.

### Amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation… [^111RPp6K]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Data from several small trials have indicated that amiodarone is more effective than other antiarrhythmic agents in treating atrial fibrillation. Roy and colleagues conducted a large, prospective, randomized trial comparing amiodarone with sotalol and propafenone in the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation lasting more than 48 hours were anticoagulated to obtain an International Normalized Ratio of 2 or higher for at least three weeks. They were then randomized to receive amiodarone, sotalol or propafenone in an open-label fashion. Cardioversion was performed in patients who had not converted to sinus rhythm after two weeks of amiodarone therapy or after four days of the other two medications. Patients were seen at three months after randomization, and every six months thereafter. The primary end point was the length of time to a first electrocardiographically confirmed recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

Secondary end points were thromboembolic events, death and adverse events caused by the study drugs. A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study. There were slightly more men than women, and the mean age for both groups of patients was 65 ± 11 years. During a mean follow-up period of 468 ± 150 days, 71 patients in the amiodarone group had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation compared with 127 patients who were given sotalol or propafenone. With regard to major clinical events, nine deaths occurred in the amiodarone group and eight deaths in the patients receiving sotalol or propafenone. Eighteen percent of patients in the amiodarone group required treatment for a major clinical event compared with 17 percent in the second group. However, strokes and intracranial hemorrhages were less common in the amiodarone group.

On the basis of their data, the authors conclude that amiodarone is significantly more effective than sotalol or propafenone in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this study, where the dosage of amiodarone was 200 mg per day, the incidence of adverse events was quite low. The authors suggest that amiodarone should become the drug of choice for use in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation and structural heart disease.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — amiodarone for prevention of recurrent AF around electrical cardioversion: In patients with persistent AF, treatment with amiodarone for 6 wk before and after cardioversion increased the conversion rate and the likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm and reduced supraventricular ectopic activity that may trigger recurrent AF, and prophylactic treatment with amiodarone was also effective when an initial attempt at direct-current cardioversion had failed. In patients with persistent AF randomly assigned to carvedilol, amiodarone, or placebo 6 d before direct-current cardioversion, the 2 drugs yielded similar cardioversion rates, but amiodarone proved superior at maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion.

### The prognostic significance of right bundle branch block: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^113ei6qi]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic significance of right bundle branch block (RBBB) is inconsistent across studies. We aimed to assess the association between RBBB (in general population and patients with heart disease) and risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and heart failure (HF).

Hypothesis

RBBB may be associated with increased risk of death.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to February 2015 were searched for prospective cohort studies that reported RBBB at baseline and all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and HF at follow-up. A meta-analysis of published data was undertaken primarily by means of fixed-effects models.

Results

Nineteen cohort studies including 201437 participants were included with a mean follow-up period ranging from 1 to 246 months. For general population with RBBB, the pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03–1.33) compared with no BBB. General population with RBBB had an increased risk of cardiac death (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17–1.74). For patients with RBBB and acute MI, the pooled risk ratio was 2.31 (95% CI: 2.13–2.49) for in-hospital mortality, 2.85 (95% CI: 2.46–3.30) for 30-day mortality, and 1.96 (95% CI: 1.59–2.42) for longer-term mortality. For acute HF patients, the pooled risk ratio of all-cause mortality was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06–1.16), and for chronic HF patients it was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.38–2.22).

Conclusions

Right bundle branch block is associated with an increased risk of mortality in general population and patients with heart disease.

### Primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction with right bundle branch block: should new onset right bundle branch block be added to future guidelines as an indication for reperfusion therapy? [^1128ZYkm]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The current guidelines recommend reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block (LBBB). Surprisingly, the right bundle branch block (RBBB) is not listed as an indication for reperfusion therapy. This study analysed patients with AMI presenting with RBBB [with or without left anterior hemiblock (LAH) or left posterior hemiblock (LPH)] and compared them with those presenting with LBBB or with other electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. The aim was to describe angiographic patterns and primary angioplasty use in AMI patients with RBBB.

Methods and Results

A cohort of 6742 patients with AMI admitted to eight participating hospitals was analysed. Baseline clinical characteristics, ECG patterns, coronary angiographic, and echocardiographic data were correlated with the reperfusion therapies used and with in-hospital outcomes. Right bundle branch block was present in 6.3% of AMI patients: 2.8% had RBBB alone, 3.2% had RBBB + LAH, and 0.3% had RBBB + LPH. TIMI flow 0 in the infarct-related artery was present in 51.7% of RBBB patients vs. 39.4% of LBBB patients (P = 0.023). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed in 80.1% of RBBB patients vs. 68.3% of LBBB patients (P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality of RBBB patients was similar to LBBB (14.3 vs. 13.1%, P = 0.661). Patients with new or presumably new blocks had the highest (LBBB 15.8% and RBBB 15.4%) incidence of cardiogenic shock from all ECG subgroups. Percutaneous coronary intervention was done more frequently (84.8%) in patients with new or presumably new RBBB when compared with other patients with blocks (old RBBB 66.0%, old LBBB 62.3%, new or presumably new LBBB 73.0%). In-hospital mortality was highest (18.8%) among patients presenting with new or presumably new RBBB, followed by new or presumably new LBBB (13.2%), old LBBB (10.1%), and old RBBB (6.4%). Among 35 patients with acute left main coronary artery occlusion, 26% presented with RBBB (mostly with LAH) on the admission ECG.

Conclusion

Acute myocardial infarction with RBBB is frequently caused by the complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery and is more frequently treated with primary PCI when compared with AMI + LBBB. In-hospital mortality of patients with AMI and RBBB is highest from all ECG presentations of AMI. Restoration of coronary flow by primary PCI may lead to resolution of the conduction delay on the discharge ECG. Right bundle branch block should strongly be considered for listing in future guidelines as a standard indication for reperfusion therapy, in the same way as LBBB.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^111W1t6o]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure arrhythmia management — supraventricular rhythm control — notes that given its relatively rapid onset of action and superior safety profile in HF, intravenous amiodarone for life-threatening arrhythmias during acute HF has gained widespread acceptance, and in acutely ill HF, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter may impose hemodynamic decompensation requiring aggressive therapy; poorly tolerated SVT may be better treated acutely by synchronous cardioversion at relatively low energies (e.g., 50 to 100 J biphasic), verapamil may be effective for recurrent AV node–dependent SVTs but care should be taken due to negative inotropic effects, and intravenous amiodarone may be more effective at rate control of AF or atrial flutter and may restore sinus rhythm; in HF, amiodarone alone or with electrical cardioversion is effective at slowing the heart rate and achieving cardioversion, and for unstable arrhythmia cardioversion is appropriate with amiodarone preferred for longer-term administration and generally well tolerated hemodynamically.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — amiodarone dosing, adverse effects, and precautions are detailed as follows: initial dosing is 400–600 mg QD in divided doses (loading dose), followed by 100–200 mg QD (maintenance dose); up to 1200 mg QD may be considered in an inpatient monitoring setting (loading dose), and up to 200 mg QD maintenance is noted. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes (rare), with additional noncardiac toxicities listed. Use with caution in sinus or AV conduction disease (in absence of pacemaker) and other listed conditions, and avoid drugs with SA and/or AV nodal–blocking properties. Interactions include the need to reduce warfarin dose by 50% and reduce digoxin dose by 30%–50%, and to avoid other QT‑prolonging drugs.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^113qw3hC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a recent study, Jordan‐Martinez et al. analyzed patients with drug‐related AVB, focusing on identifying predictive factors for pacemaker need. The study population consisted of 127 patients with third‐degree AVB, 2:1 AVB, or second‐degree Mobitz type II AVB, including individuals with atrial fibrillation and AVB. Most of the study patients were elderly and had comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic or other heart disease. Also, most patients were on β‐blockers (78%), 18.1% were on non‐DHP CCBs, and 11.8% were on digoxin. Additionally, 3.9% and 4.8% were receiving flecainide or amiodarone, respectively, in combination with the previously mentioned drugs. Furthermore, 8.6% of the patients were on a combination of digoxin, flecainide, or amiodarone with either β‐blockers or non‐DHP CCBs. In keeping with the studies mentioned above, drug discontinuation led to the spontaneous resolution of AVB within 48 h in 47.2% of patients. However, 66.6% of these patients experienced a recurrence of AVB during the 3‐year follow‐up period (median time to AVB recurrence: 65 days; interquartile range: 12–201 days). Overall, 84.36% of patients required permanent pacemaker implantation in the acute setting or during follow‐up, while only 18.1% experienced AVB resolution without recurrence after drug discontinuation. Importantly, this study identified several factors associated with the overall need for permanent pacing. These included a heart rate < 35 bpm (odds ratio [OR] = 8.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–36.17; p = 0.006), increased QRS duration (OR = 5.65; 95% CI = 1.77–18.04; p = 0.003), and a clinical presentation other than syncope or presyncope (OR = 4.09; 95% CI = 1.18–14.13; p = 0.026). Interestingly, a combination of flecainide or amiodarone with β‐blockers or non‐DHP CCBs was associated with a significantly lower need for pacemaker implantation (OR = 0.12; 95% CI 0.02–0.66; p = 0.014).

Right bundle-branch block (RBBB) in the patient with acute coronary syndrome is a marker of significant potential cardiovascular risk; the RBBB pattern in the patient with acute coronary syndrome identifies a subgroup of patients with quite high short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Right bundle-branch block is not an uncommon finding on an electrocardiogram in the emergency department patient, noted incidentally and thus without clinical import or, conversely, encountered in the early phase of significant cardiovascular dysfunction.

Drug-associated atrioventricular block — therapy interactions and risk management are described as follows: Beta blockers have been recommended as guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and after myocardial infarction (MI), but atrioventricular block was usually an exclusion criterion in the large trials showing benefit. Atrioventricular block can develop secondary to amiodarone or sotalol used for atrial fibrillation (AF), and the benefit of any medication that exacerbates atrioventricular block must be balanced against potentially deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation — recommendations for pharmacological cardioversion state that administration of flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, or ibutilide is recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). Administration of amiodarone is a reasonable option for pharmacological cardioversion of AF (Level of Evidence: A). A single oral bolus dose of propafenone or flecainide (pill-in-the-pocket) can be administered to terminate persistent AF outside the hospital once treatment has proved safe in hospital for selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, and before antiarrhythmic medication is initiated, a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist should be given to prevent rapid AV conduction in the event atrial flutter occurs (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of amiodarone can be beneficial on an outpatient basis in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when rapid restoration of sinus rhythm is not deemed necessary (Level of Evidence: C). Administration of quinidine or procainamide might be considered for pharmacological cardioversion of AF, but the usefulness of these agents is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin and sotalol may be harmful when used for pharmacological cardioversion of AF and are not recommended (Level of Evidence: A). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and dofetilide should not be started out of hospital for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (Level of Evidence: B).

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block? [^115Vda5r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Yet, over the years, conflicting data have emerged about the long‐term prognostic significance of incidental RBBB in people without overt cardiac disease. Rotman and Triebwasser used the database of the US Air Force Central Electrocardiographic Library and reported on 394 individuals with RBBB with a mean age of 36.9 years (range, 17–58 years). Most of the subjects were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. During a mean follow‐up of 10.8 years, 6% of the patients developed coronary artery disease and 4% died. Only one patient developed complete heart block. They concluded that, overall, the prognosis was good. 4 No increased mortality was reported in patients > 85 years with RBBB. 6 Casiglia et al assessed the implications of BBB on mortality among 2254 elderly subjects included in the CASTEL (Cardiovascular Study in the Elderly) who were followed up for 7 years. 7 The presence of RBBB was associated with increased all‐cause mortality in both men and women and with cardiovascular mortality only in men, but not in women. 7 Fahy et al reported on 310 individuals with bundle branch block (BBB) who were followed up for 9.5 years. Left BBB, but not RBBB, was associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease at the follow‐up (21% versus 11%; P = 0.04). 8

Eriksson et al used the Primary Prevention Study in Goteborg, Sweden. They included 7392 men without prior myocardial infarction or stroke born between 1915 and 1925 and initially evaluated between 1970 and 1973 (70 men had RBBB). 9 The patients were followed up until 1998. RBBB was not associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, all‐cause mortality, or heart failure. Yet, RBBB was associated with an increased risk for progression to high‐degree atrioventricular block. 9

Among the 9541 patients aged ≥ 55 years with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with ≥ 1 risk factors who participated in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation trial and were followed up for a median of 4.5 years, a total of 428 (4.5%) had RBBB on their baseline ECG. 10 RBBB was not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. 10

Case 3: pre-excited atrial fibrillation and pending ablation

A 63-year-old patient was brought to the emergency department following an episode of sudden palpitations after a domestic altercation. On arrival of the first responder emergency doctor, he showed a wide complex tachycardia leading to a differential diagnosis between a VT and tachycardic atrial fibrillation with bundle branch block. Intravenous amiodarone was administered, resulting in symptomatic relief. The patient could be transported to our emergency department, where subsequent evaluation revealed atrial fibrillation with signs of pre-excitation, indicating the presence of an accessory pathway. Further ECG analysis localised the accessory pathway to a left posteroseptal position. Echocardiography demonstrated normal biventricular function. Given the patient's history of chronic coronary heart disease, and because of evidence of recurrent episodes of non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias during cardiological monitoring, the decision was made to proceed with coronary angiography, revealing severe three-vessel disease. Stenting of the right coronary artery was performed, followed by staged stenting of the left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery as coronary artery bypassed was refused by the patient. Dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated post stenting, with plans to continue uninterrupted for at least 3 months. Due to the documented pre-excited atrial fibrillation and the need to delay ablation for 3 months, the patient was fitted with a WCD, despite the normal biventricular function. This measure aimed to provide protection from arrhythmia-related complications. After 15 days of wearing the WCD, a new episode of pre-excited atrial fibrillation occurred. The WCD alarm activated, allowing the patient to prevent a shock by pressing the response buttons (figure 2). Rate control therapy with amiodarone was initiated to manage the atrial fibrillation. The patient's heart rate was stabilised with amiodarone, and he was discharged with instructions to continue wearing the WCD until his scheduled ablation. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his progress and adjust treatment as needed and an ablation of the left accessory pathway and atrial fibrillation was scheduled in 3 months.

### Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: are the guidelines guiding clinical practice? [^113PL2Wa]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The AFFIRM study showed no clear survival advantage for a rhythm versus rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is appropriate in a large number of patients with AF. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology AF management guidelines include a safety-based algorithm for selection of AAD therapy. Class 1C agents are recommended as first-line therapy in patients without or with minimal structural heart disease. However, market research and clinical study data indicate a growing use of class III agents (mainly amiodarone) despite long-term safety and tolerability concerns, suggesting that clinical practice does not adhere to current guidelines.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: future directions [^114LANvJ]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia that requires treatment, and although ablation is appropriate in many cases, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy remains the first and most appropriate therapy in most patients. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs are limited by modest efficacy and significant toxicity. Cardiac toxicity relates to effects on the ventricle, especially in prolonging the QT interval and causing torsades de pointes. Amiodarone, an agent with multiple antiarrhythmic effects, is unique in its relative lack of pro-arrhythmia, although its non-cardiac toxicities limit its use. Some investigational agents are directed at multiple ion channels, or are designed to be analogs of amiodarone. The other line of investigation focuses on the antiarrhythmic action of agents that affect novel ion channel targets. Basic and early clinical studies show promise for drugs that provide atrial antiarrhythmic effects without ventricular pro-arrhythmia by affecting the atrium preferentially or selectively (inhibiting the I(TO) and I(Kur) currents, respectively). Future drugs may possess preferential effects on the remodeled atrium (and as such would be selective for patients with atrial fibrillation). It is hoped that efforts to develop new drugs, including those with preferential effects on the atrium, will provide therapy with greater efficacy and safety.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^111wLztb]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1145nHv8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure (HF) — key guideline recommendations state that in patients with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended; in appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF on guideline-directed medical therapy and with reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation is beneficial to improve symptoms, quality of life (QOL), ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes; in symptomatic AF with HFpEF and reasonable expectation of benefit, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL; for AF with HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, either with other rate-controlling agents or as monotherapy if others are not tolerated; when AF with HF presents with rapid ventricular rates and beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for acute rate control; in AF, HF, HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 50%) with refractory rapid ventricular response and not candidates for or failing rhythm control, atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) with biventricular pacing can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; in AF and HF with implanted biventricular pacing where effective pacing percentage cannot be achieved pharmacologically, AVNA can be beneficial to improve functional class, reduce ICD shock risk, and improve survival; after recovery of LV function from AF‑induced cardiomyopathy, long-term surveillance can be beneficial to detect recurrent AF; for suspected AF‑induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms on pharmacological rate control, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate ≤ 80 bpm at rest and < 110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable; in AF and HFrEF undergoing AVNA, His bundle or left bundle branch area pacing may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LVEF; and in AF with known LVEF < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered because of the potential to exacerbate HF.

### Management of patients with acute atrial fibrillation in the ED [^115KUigx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute atrial fibrillation with a history of mild structural heart disease could be considered for rhythm conversion.

Methods

Patients received intravenous flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone on presentation and a second dose after 6 hours if atrial fibrillation persisted. No randomization was used, and drugs were given at the discretion of the treating physician. Primary end point was rhythm conversion within the first 6 hours from presentation. Secondary end points included rhythm conversion, time to rhythm conversion, and adverse drug effects within 24 hours.

Results

Among the 378 patients enrolled, 37 (10%) recovered sinus rhythm before therapy was given. Of the remaining 341 patients, 43 (13%) received flecainide, 187 (55%) received propafenone, and 111 (32%) received amiodarone. Baseline clinical characteristics were homogeneous among groups. Rhythm conversion was obtained in 87% of treated patients overall. Within 6 hours, the primary end point was achieved in a higher proportion in the flecainide and propafenone groups (72% and 55%, respectively) as compared with the amiodarone group (30%; P < .001). The mean time to the end point overall was shorter in the flecainide and propafenone groups (178 ± 227 and 292 ± 285 minutes, respectively) as compared with the amiodarone group (472 ± 269 minutes; P < .001). Length of in-hospital stay in the amiodarone group was significantly higher (26.1 ± 22.4 hours) compared with the flecainide and propafenone groups (8.9 ± 10.3 and 11.0 ± 13.8 hours; respectively; p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in adverse drug effects.

Conclusions

Flecainide and propafenone achieve rhythm control in a higher proportion of patients as compared with amiodarone within a 6-hour management.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation — A frequent issue is whether to initiate therapy in hospital or on an outpatient basis, with concern for serious adverse effects including torsades de pointes; virtually all pharmacological cardioversion studies (except those with low-dose oral amiodarone) have involved hospitalized patients, but one study provided a clinically useful approach with out-of-hospital patient-controlled conversion using class IC drugs. The pill-in-the-pocket strategy consists of self-administration of a single oral dose shortly after the onset of symptomatic AF to improve quality of life, decrease hospital admission, and reduce cost. Recommendations differ for paroxysmal versus persistent AF: for paroxysmal AF the aims are to terminate an episode or prevent recurrence, whereas for persistent AF the aims are to achieve pharmacological cardioversion, obviate direct-current cardioversion, or enhance its success by lowering the defibrillation threshold and prevent early recurrence. In patients with lone AF without structural heart disease, class IC drugs may be initiated on an outpatient basis, and for other selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone and flecainide outside the hospital becomes an option once treatment has proved safe in hospital.

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that patients with RBBB without prior diagnosis of CVD have an increased risk of cardiovascular‐related and all‐cause mortality. Our data also suggest that these patients have a higher likelihood of reduced exercise capacity compared with those without RBBB. Given the potential significance of these findings, these data merit further prospective and multicenter evaluation.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Practical regimen for amiodarone use in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation [^113XnhQz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 5% to 65% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Although postoperative atrial fibrillation is often regarded as a temporary, benign, operation-related problem, it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events, including permanent or transient stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial included 250 eligible consecutively enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). They received 300 mg of amiodarone/placebo administered intravenously over 20 minutes on the first postoperative day and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily for the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

The patients in amiodarone prophylaxis experienced a reduction in risk of atrial fibrillation of 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0% to 24%), with the number needed to treat at 6.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 20), and the results for symptomatic atrial fibrillation showed a risk reduction of 18% (95% CI, 9.4% to 26), with the number needed to treat at 5.7 (95% CI, 3.9 to 11). Of the patients who developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group, 84% experienced a symptomatic attack versus only 43% in the amiodarone group.

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe, practical, feasible, and effective regimen for CABG patients. It significantly diminishes the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

### Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation… [^114wFord]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in many European countries but is labeled in the United States only for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Its success in restoring a sinus rhythm has been inconsistent in clinical trials, with success rates ranging from 16 to 92 percent. In addition, concerns exist about the toxicity of amiodarone. Vardas and colleagues performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in the treatment of atrial fibrillation of long or short duration. The study included 208 consecutive patients 27 to 78 years of age who presented to an emergency department or outpatient clinic because of acute or chronic atrial fibrillation. An anticoagulant was given for 21 days if the duration of atrial fibrillation could not be determined or if it had lasted for more than 48 hours.

Of the 208 patients, 108 were randomized to receive amiodarone and 100 to receive placebo. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. Amiodarone was initially administered as a 300-mg intravenous bolus over one hour, followed by a 24-hour infusion in a dose of 20 mg per kg. It was then given orally, 600 mg daily in three divided doses, for one week, followed by 400 mg daily for three weeks. If the patient had not previously received digoxin, digoxin was also administered during the first 24 hours. Anticoagulation was continued for 21 days after cardioversion. Patients were hospitalized for at least the first three days of treatment and were reevaluated after 30 days of therapy. One-dimensional and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed either 24 hours after conversion or at the end of the study. The authors conclude that amiodarone is a safe and effective method for termination of atrial fibrillation.

While the conversion rate was generally high following administration of amiodarone, it fell to a relatively low level in patients with a very large left atrium or with chronic fibrillation. The conversion rate in patients with a large left atrium was 61 percent, and it was 34. 6 percent in those with chronic atrial fibrillation. The authors believe amiodarone could be a drug of first choice for atrial fibrillation, unless rapid conversion is needed.

Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs — sotalol may be initiated in outpatients with little or no heart disease as long as the baseline uncorrected QT interval is less than 450 ms, serum electrolytes are normal, and risk factors associated with class III drug–related proarrhythmia are considered, and it is safest to start sotalol when the patient is in sinus rhythm; amiodarone can also usually be given safely on an outpatient basis, with loading regimens of 600 mg daily for 4 wk or 1 g daily for 1 wk followed by lower maintenance doses; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide should not be started out of hospital and out-of-hospital initiation of dofetilide is not permitted; amiodarone, class IA or IC agents, or sotalol can be associated with bradycardia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, which is more frequent with amiodarone and more common in women than in men.

### Amiodarone is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias upgraded to cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators [^114SJMaq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone reduces recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) but may worsen cardiovascular outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may also be antiarrhythmic. When patients with prior sustained VTA are upgraded to CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) from conventional implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), should concomitant amiodarone be continued or is CRT's antiarrhythmic potential sufficient?

Methods and Results

We identified 67 patients from a prospective CRT registry with spontaneous sustained VTA, New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-IV HF, and left bundle-branch block (LBBB) who were upgraded to CRT defibrillators from conventional ICDs. We compared changes in QRS duration and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) pre- and post-CRT, time to death, transplant or ventricular assist device (VAD), and time to recurrent VTA therapies between 37 patients continuing amiodarone therapy and 30 amiodarone-naïve patients. Amiodarone-treated patients had worse renal function and a higher prevalence of prior VTA storm compared with amiodarone-naïve patients. After CRT, amiodarone-treated patients demonstrated less QRS narrowing (8 vs 20ms; P = 0.021) and less LVEF improvement (-2.7 vs +5.2%; P = 0.006). Over 29 months, 31 (47%) patients died and 13 (20%) received transplant or VAD. Risk of death, transplant, or VAD was greater in amiodarone-treated than -naïve patients (corrected hazard ratio [HR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–4.11; P = 0.022). Appropriate CRT-D therapies occurred in 37 (55%) patients; amiodarone use was not associated time to first therapy (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.59–2.16; P = 0.72).

Conclusion

In patients with sustained VTA and LBBB upgraded from conventional ICDs to CRT defibrillators, concomitant amiodarone use is associated with less QRS narrowing, less LVEF improvement, greater risk of death, transplant, or VAD, and similar risk of recurrent VTA.

Background

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death. There are two main strategies to prevent it: managing cardiovascular risk factors and reducing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) constitute the standard therapy for both primary and secondary prevention; however, they are not widely available in settings with limited resources. The antiarrhythmic amiodarone has been proposed as an alternative to ICD.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone for primary or secondary prevention in SCD compared with placebo or no intervention or any other antiarrhythmic drugs in participants at high risk (primary prevention) or who have recovered from a cardiac arrest or a syncope due to Ventricular Tachycardia/Ventricular Fibrillation, or VT/VF (secondary prevention).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO) and LILACS on 26 March 2015. We reviewed reference lists of included studies and selected reviews on the topic, contacted authors of included studies, screened relevant meetings and searched in registers for ongoing trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the efficacy of amiodarone versus placebo, no intervention, or other antiarrhythmics in adults. For primary prevention we considered participants at high risk for SCD. For secondary prevention we considered participants recovered from cardiac arrest or syncope due to ventricular arrhythmias.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. We contacted trial authors for missing data. We performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three studies included more than one comparison.

Main Results

We included 24 studies (9,997 participants). Seventeen studies evaluated amiodarone for primary prevention and six for secondary prevention. Only three studies used an ICD concomitantly with amiodarone for the comparison (all of them for secondary prevention). For primary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (17 studies, 8383 participants) reduced SCD (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), cardiac mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00). The quality of the evidence was low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (three studies, 540 participants), amiodarone reduced SCD (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00), cardiac mortality (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.86) and all-cause mortality (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76). The quality of the evidence was moderate. For secondary prevention, amiodarone compared to placebo or no intervention (two studies, 440 participants) appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 4.32; 95% CI 0.87 to 21.49) and all-cause mortality (RR 3.05; 1.33 to 7.01). However, the quality of the evidence was very low. Compared to other antiarrhythmics (four studies, 839 participants) amiodarone appeared to increase the risk of SCD (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.56 to 3.52; very low quality of evidence), but there was no effect in all-cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.42; low quality evidence). Amiodarone was associated with an increase in pulmonary and thyroid adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low to moderate quality evidence that amiodarone reduces SCD, cardiac and all-cause mortality when compared to placebo or no intervention for primary prevention, and its effects are superior to other antiarrhythmics. It is uncertain if amiodarone reduces or increases SCD and mortality for secondary prevention because the quality of the evidence was very low.

### Amiodarone – avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^113sussL]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.
