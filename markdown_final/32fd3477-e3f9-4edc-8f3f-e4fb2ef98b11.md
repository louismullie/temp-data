## Question

elevated progesterone in pituitary adenoma pt, what to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage elevated progesterone in a patient with a pituitary adenoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the laboratory abnormality and excluding physiologic states like pregnancy or luteal phase that could explain a high progesterone without pituitary causation. Then, I should delineate the pituitary adenoma subtype and perform a comprehensive endocrine assessment to look for a gonadotroph adenoma that could secondarily drive ovarian steroidogenesis [^116EtSwT]. Next, I will consider non-pituitary differentials and ovarian pathology, proceed to targeted imaging of the sellar and pelvic regions, and finally map management decisions including surgery versus observation and special considerations for pregnancy and postoperative surveillance [^112vWL1S].

> At first glance, one might wonder whether a "progesterone-secreting" pituitary adenoma exists, but wait, let me verify the biology because I should not jump to conclusions here. Hold on, I should verify tumor lineages: anterior pituitary adenomas originate from differentiated hormone cell types and when functional usually hypersecrete PRL, GH, ACTH, or, far less commonly, gonadotropins or TSH, but not steroid hormones such as progesterone, which are produced peripherally by ovaries and adrenal glands, so a pituitary source of direct progesterone secretion would be biologically implausible and not described in standard classifications [^112RTd5X] [^1175jE8r] [^112x9DzT]. Let me reconsider the likely mechanism: if the adenoma is a functioning gonadotroph adenoma or a "clinically silent" tumor with biochemical activity, ovarian stimulation could secondarily raise estradiol and, post-ovulation, progesterone, which fits known pathophysiology rather than a primary pituitary progesterone source [^1175jE8r].

> Before attributing causality, I should confirm the abnormal progesterone and the overall endocrine profile because assay issues and sampling context matter, and I need to ensure there is no analytical artifact or misinterpretation [^1145k2GN]. Wait, let me verify the lab platform and repeat the measurement if results are incongruent with the clinical picture, as substantial inter-assay discrepancies are documented for pituitary hormones such as prolactin and can mislead management, and the same caution about platform effects and dilution for high values applies when interpreting endocrine assays more broadly [^112XxaWG]. I should double-check for the hook effect with prolactin if a large macroadenoma is present and prolactin seems only mildly elevated, ensuring serial dilutions are performed to avoid a falsely low value that would confound the overall pituitary assessment and differential diagnosis in this patient [^113KpDLA] [^112LEBCA].

> Next, I will exclude physiologic states that explain elevated progesterone, and I need to check pregnancy immediately because luteal and gestational physiology drive high progesterone and alter interpretation of pituitary testing, and during pregnancy some pituitary hormone measurements, like prolactin, are not recommended routinely given physiologic elevation and limited actionability [^112DzFSV]. Hold on, I should verify the timing within the menstrual cycle as luteal-phase progesterone can be markedly higher, and if pregnancy is confirmed or strongly suspected, I will avoid overinterpreting pituitary hormone levels and prioritize clinical monitoring with neuro-ophthalmologic assessment and MRI only if there is evidence of tumor growth or compressive symptoms during pregnancy [^113Bgwsf] [^113c2ssn] [^112Wj7rm].

> With pregnancy ruled out, I will now examine the pituitary adenoma subtype and perform comprehensive endocrine testing because this determines whether a gonadotroph process is plausible and whether other axes are affected [^116EtSwT]. I should confirm baseline screening for hypopituitarism and hypersecretion with free T4, TSH, morning cortisol, ACTH, IGF-1, prolactin with attention to assay pitfalls, and the gonadal axis including LH, FSH, estradiol or testosterone as appropriate, and consider an alpha-subunit when a gonadotroph adenoma is suspected, as recommended by consensus guidelines for incidental sellar lesions and suspected nonfunctioning adenomas [^114vceZP] [^113GoW5D] [^112AsY1F].

> Let me interpret possible gonadotroph patterns carefully because I need to ensure the biochemical phenotype matches the clinical scenario and imaging findings [^112x9DzT]. In premenopausal women, elevated or inappropriately normal FSH with high estradiol and clinical signs of ovarian stimulation, sometimes with low or normal LH, can suggest a gonadotroph adenoma with biologically active secretion, whereas in men, discordant FSH/LH with high or low testosterone may signal a gonadotroph process, and in both settings "silent" tumors can show biochemical activity without classic hypersecretion syndromes, so I should correlate labs with ovarian or testicular status and symptoms [^notfound] [^1175jE8r]. If prior pathology exists, I should confirm immunohistochemistry for FSH/LH and consider alpha-subunit staining to support a gonadotroph lineage, noting that immunostaining does not always equate to clinically relevant hypersecretion and requires clinical correlation [^112x9DzT].

> But wait, what if ovarian pathology is the proximate source of progesterone elevation rather than the pituitary lesion, so I should double-check the ovaries directly when the clinical picture suggests stimulation or cystic change [^notfound]. I need to ensure a pelvic ultrasound is obtained if estradiol is high or symptoms such as pelvic pain or cysts are present because FSH-secreting adenomas can cause ovarian hyperstimulation and multicystic ovaries, with several cases showing resolution after transsphenoidal resection, which would tie the biochemical findings to the pituitary source rather than a primary ovarian tumor [^112SzSz2] [^1139TW5k].

> I should also broaden the differential and review non-pituitary causes because medications, systemic illness, and primary ovarian or adrenal disorders can mimic or contribute, and I need to check these before anchoring on the pituitary adenoma as causal [^114MfskW]. Hold on, I should verify medication history for agents that influence the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, review thyroid status and renal function which can confound endocrine interpretation, consider PCOS phenotypes that overlap with gonadotroph adenoma presentations, and evaluate for ovarian neoplasms that can alter sex steroid levels, keeping in mind that PCOS can obscure or delay recognition of pituitary disorders with overlapping features [^111aBRgj] [^114MfskW].

> For structural assessment, I need to obtain a high-quality pituitary MRI using a standardized protocol because surgical planning and risk assessment rely on accurate definition of the lesion's size, extension, and relationship to the optic apparatus, and I should confirm adherence to thin-slice T1 pre- and post-gadolinium coronal/sagittal plus T2 coronal sequences per consensus [^112qGqXf]. Let me also confirm whether the lesion abuts the chiasm or invades the cavernous sinus as this will influence urgency, surveillance intervals, and the threshold for recommending resection in a pituitary center of excellence [^115EuKjP] [^115EuKjP].

> If a functioning gonadotroph adenoma is confirmed or strongly suspected, I will focus therapy on the tumor rather than the progesterone level itself because lowering progesterone per se does not address the driver and could miss windows for cure or decompression [^114iPxPL]. I should confirm surgical indications including visual field compromise or chiasmal abutment, symptomatic tumor mass effect, documented growth on serial imaging, and special consideration in women desiring pregnancy given risks of growth during gestation, with transsphenoidal surgery as first-line in symptomatic NFPA and functioning gonadotroph adenomas, ideally in a high-volume pituitary center [^115EuKjP] [^115rB8zU] [^114iPxPL].

> Initially, I might be tempted to try dopamine agonists or somatostatin analogs to reduce tumor size and secretion, but wait, I should verify the evidence because these agents have limited and inconsistent efficacy for gonadotroph and other nonfunctioning adenomas, and I should not overstate medical therapy where data are weak [^112JucL5]. Let me correct that: while guidelines for functioning pituitary tumors recognize SRLs and DAs at maximally tolerated doses as standard medical options, their role in gonadotroph adenomas is limited, and surgery remains the mainstay when clinically indicated, with medical therapy considered adjunctive or in selected aggressive cases under expert guidance [^114KoBth] [^1175jE8r] [^112JucL5].

> If pregnancy is contemplated or ongoing, I should confirm a preconception plan and in-pregnancy monitoring strategy because pituitary volume and adenomas can enlarge in gestation, and surveillance must be individualized with attention to vision and headaches, reserving MRI for clinical suspicion of growth or apoplexy and coordinating care with neuro-ophthalmology and obstetrics [^112Wj7rm]. I need to ensure that prolactin is generally not measured during pregnancy, educate about symptom triggers that warrant urgent evaluation, and discuss that large adenomas near the chiasm deserve closer follow-up during gestation, with postpartum reassessment of imaging and pituitary function once delivery and breastfeeding are completed [^112DzFSV] [^113c2ssn] [^113Jkufd].

> Postoperatively, I should double-check endocrine recovery and deficits on a structured timeline and maintain imaging surveillance because recurrence or regrowth can occur and hypopituitarism may evolve over time, requiring long-term follow-up in selected patients [^112pcidZ]. I need to confirm early adrenal axis assessment on postoperative day 2, re-evaluation at 6 weeks, and reassessment at 12 months, and consider indefinite endocrine surveillance when pituitary function is abnormal or radiotherapy has been given, alongside long-term MRI follow-up per CNS guidelines [^1121q5ti] [^1168RCjV] [^115HzfEG].

> Stepping back, I should verify that my final synthesis preserves diagnostic parsimony without missing uncommon but important scenarios: confirm the progesterone elevation with attention to assay pitfalls, exclude pregnancy and physiologic luteal elevation, comprehensively stage pituitary function with a focus on gonadotroph activity, image the sella with a standardized MRI protocol, image the ovaries when stimulated, and treat the tumor when clinically indicated rather than chasing progesterone per se, with special care plans for pregnancy and structured long-term surveillance after surgery [^116weAeu]. Hold on, let me double-check alignment with consensus: this approach mirrors Pituitary Society and CNS guidance for evaluation of incidental sellar lesions and NFPA, integrates endocrine society cautions about assay artifacts, and recognizes the limited role of medical therapy in gonadotroph adenomas, which keeps the reasoning clinically anchored and reference-consistent [^114vceZP] [^113GoW5D] [^112qGqXf].

Elevated progesterone in a patient with a pituitary adenoma is most often due to **gonadotroph adenomas**, in which excess LH/FSH drives ovarian progesterone production rather than pituitary progesterone secretion [^1155PcvU] [^112SzSz2]. The priority is to **confirm the source** by repeating a progesterone level in the early follicular phase, assessing LH/FSH, estradiol, and prolactin [^114vceZP], and obtaining a high-resolution pituitary MRI with a standardized protocol [^112qGqXf]. If a gonadotroph adenoma is confirmed, treat with transsphenoidal surgery for macroadenomas or symptomatic tumors [^114iPxPL], and monitor with serial MRI and endocrine testing; medical therapy has a limited role and is reserved for select cases [^112JucL5].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated progesterone in pituitary adenoma patients

- **Gonadotroph adenomas**: These tumors secrete LH/FSH, stimulating ovarian progesterone production, especially in the luteal phase or with ovarian cysts [^112xhBnJ] [^112SzSz2].

- **Clinical manifestations**: Elevated progesterone can cause menstrual irregularities, infertility, and ovarian cysts.

- **Rare progesterone-secreting tumors**: Pure progesterone-secreting pituitary tumors are extremely rare; most cases reflect secondary ovarian stimulation.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential to confirm the source of elevated progesterone and should include hormonal assessment, imaging, and differential diagnosis [^113HUKxm].

---

### Hormonal assessment

- **Repeat progesterone measurement**: Obtain in the early follicular phase (days 2–5) to minimize luteal-phase elevation.

- **Gonadotropin levels**: Measure LH and FSH to assess for inappropriate secretion [^1155PcvU].

- **Estradiol and prolactin**: Evaluate for concurrent hypersecretion syndromes [^111enbh9].

- **Comprehensive pituitary panel**: Include cortisol, ACTH, TSH, free T4, and IGF-1 to assess overall pituitary function [^114vceZP] [^112AsY1F].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should include a **pituitary MRI** using a standardized protocol (T1-weighted coronal/sagittal pre- and post-gadolinium, T2-weighted coronal, ≤ 3 mm slices) to characterize the adenoma [^112qGqXf] [^111LNBFo], and an **ovarian ultrasound** to evaluate for ovarian cysts or hyperstimulation [^112SzSz2].

---

### Differential diagnosis

In the differential diagnosis, **exclude other causes** such as adrenal hyperplasia, ovarian tumors, and exogenous progesterone use.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **tumor type, size, and clinical symptoms**, with options including surgery, medical therapy, and radiation [^114iPxPL].

---

### Surgical intervention

**Transsphenoidal surgery** is first-line for macroadenomas, symptomatic tumors, or significant hormone hypersecretion. Indications include **visual field deficits**, **tumor growth**, or **significant hormonal disturbances** [^115EuKjP] [^115rB8zU].

---

### Medical therapy

Medical therapy has a **limited role** because gonadotroph adenomas are generally unresponsive; **GnRH analogs** may be considered in select cases to suppress gonadotropin secretion, but efficacy is limited [^112JucL5].

---

### Radiation therapy

Radiation is typically **adjunctive**, considered for residual or recurrent tumors after surgery [^115g5htZ].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for **tumor recurrence** and **hormonal normalization** [^117BdH5o]. It should include serial measurements of progesterone, LH, FSH, and other pituitary hormones; periodic MRI to detect recurrence or progression; and clinical evaluations to identify recurrent symptoms or new hormonal disturbances [^112pcidZ].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If untreated, elevated progesterone in pituitary adenoma patients can lead to:

- **Persistent menstrual irregularities**: Ongoing menstrual disturbances and infertility [^112SzSz2].

- **Ovarian cysts**: Increased risk of ovarian cyst formation and hyperstimulation [^112xhBnJ].

- **Tumor progression**: Potential growth of the adenoma, leading to visual impairment and hypopituitarism [^114iPxPL].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally **favorable**, with surgical resection typically normalizing progesterone levels and resolving symptoms; however, a **recurrence risk** remains, so regular monitoring is essential [^112SzSz2] [^115f2WyQ].

---

Elevated progesterone in patients with pituitary adenomas is typically due to gonadotroph adenomas that stimulate ovarian progesterone production [^1155PcvU]. A structured diagnostic approach — including hormonal assessment and imaging — is essential to confirm the source [^114vceZP]. Management primarily involves **surgical intervention**, with limited roles for medical therapy and radiation [^115EuKjP]. Regular follow-up is crucial to monitor for **recurrence** and ensure **hormonal normalization** [^112pcidZ].

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112LEBCA]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The evaluation for hypersecretion should include an assessment for prolactin, GH, and ACTH hypersecretion. Evidence is strongest for the need to measure a serum prolactin level in all patients presenting with an incidentaloma. Ideally, for patients with large macroincidentalomas, the laboratory should measure prolactin levels in diluted serum to ensure that levels are not falsely lowered by a hook effect in the assay. Hyperprolactinemia was found in five of 42 patients with microincidentalomas at initial evaluation, but in other studies, none of 22 developed a prolactin elevation on prospective follow-up. In other studies, prolactinomas were detected in seven of 46 patients with incidentalomas (micro and macro combined). In macroincidentalomas, prolactin levels were elevated in two of 16.

In a large autopsy study, 39.5% of the adenomas detected (most microadenomas) were found to stain positive for prolactin. These data might suggest that prolactinomas are very common among pituitary incidentalomas, which is contrary to the literature. Autopsy data should cautiously be considered representative of incidentalomas presenting in life because the autopsy studies lack clinical data, and prolactin staining may not have been associated with clinically relevant circulating hyperprolactinemia. Patients with hyperprolactinemia could receive a trial of dopamine agonist therapy so long as it is recognized that mild/moderate elevations may be due to stalk compression from a lesion other than a prolactinoma. In these patients, tumor shrinkage is unlikely, and growth of the incidentaloma is constrained.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115PCs7P]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the subject of pituitary incidentalomas a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions through a series of conference calls, e-mails, and one in-person meeting. An initial draft guideline was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology. A second draft was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society Council.

At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated substantive changes. The evidence was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence, which was low or very low. The GRADE group is an international group with expertise in the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence identified and one commissioned systematic review to develop some of the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence.

### Silent (clinically nonfunctioning) pituitary adenomas [^1175jE8r]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Silent, or clinically nonfunctioning, pituitary adenomas can arise from any anterior pituitary cell type. Some are "clinically silent", meaning they result in a supranormal serum concentration of the hormonal product of the cell type from which the adenoma arose but do not cause the clinical manifestations typical of excessive levels of that hormone. Others are "totally silent", resulting in neither hormonal excess nor clinical manifestations.

Gonadotroph and null cell adenomas are the most prevalent types and are typically silent. Somatotroph and corticotroph adenomas typically cause clinical syndromes but occasionally are clinically or totally silent. Those that are silent are usually larger and grow more aggressively than those that cause clinical syndromes. Silent adenomas are usually not discovered until they become very large and cause neurologic defects, such as visual impairment, but are often discovered incidentally during neuroimaging performed for other reasons. Silent adenomas may, rarely, become clinically apparent over time.

The diagnosis of a silent pituitary adenoma begins with the detection of a sellar mass by MRI. Biochemical testing can identify the adenoma cell type in those that are clinically silent. Silent adenomas that cause neurologic deficits require transsphenoidal surgery, but those that do not can be monitored by MRI. Residual or recurrent disease is treated with radiation therapy, which is usually effective in preventing further growth but results in hormonal deficiencies in about half of patients. Treatment options also include dopamine agonists and somatostatin analogs.

### Biochemical diagnosis in prolactinomas: some caveats [^1145k2GN]. Pituitary (2020). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are the most frequently seen pituitary adenomas in clinical practice. A correct biochemical diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is a prerequisite for further investigation but may be hampered by analytical difficulties, as well as a large number of potentially overlapping conditions associated with increased prolactin levels. Suspicion should rise in patients whose symptoms and biochemical results do not match.

- **Assay problems**: Macroprolactinemia and high-dose hook effect are discussed as possible reasons for false positive or false negative prolactin levels.
- **Physiological and pathological causes**: These causes of hyperprolactinemia and their implications for interpreting prolactin results are reviewed.

### Successful pregnancy after operation in an infertile woman caused by luteinizing hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma: Case report and literature review [^1139TW5k]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

This female patient merely presents with infertility, while the most common presenting clinical manifestations of premenopausal women include menstrual irregularity, spontaneous vaginal spotting, galactorrhea, and mass effect. Female infertility can result from ovulation disorders, uterine abnormalities, tubal obstruction, and peritoneal factors. In contrast, infertility due to gonadotroph pituitary adenomas is rare. There are fewer than five studies documenting FSH-secreting adenomas causing infertility. Herein, we report the first case of infertility caused by an LH-secreting pituitary adenoma, without FSH-secreting. The rarity of FGA explains why an infertile female will not be considered as having pituitary adenomas on first impressions. According to our case, gonadotroph adenoma should be considered in a reproductive-aged woman who presents with infertility and elevated LH and/or FSH, after ruling out other common diseases that can cause infertility. Pituitary imaging is necessary to make the diagnosis.

The diagnosis of an LH-secreting pituitary adenoma was demonstrated by:

- **Elevated serum levels**: Elevated serum LH and estradiol concentrations.
- **Post-operation outcomes**: Normalization of serum LH and successful pregnancy after pituitary adenomectomy.
- **Immunohistochemical findings**: Immunohistochemical staining positive for LH.

However, GH levels were normal in serum, whereas immunohistochemical staining of GH was partially positive. This may be due to combining with NFPAs. A study of 103 patients with NFPA showed that 18 patients were immunohistochemically positive for both FSH and LH, while one patient was positive for both GH and LH. According to the new WHO classification…

### Diagnosis and management of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas: A Pituitary Society international consensus statement [^112Hv6QD]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

This consensus statement from an international, multidisciplinary workshop sponsored by the Pituitary Society offers evidence-based graded consensus recommendations and key summary points for clinical practice on the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas. Epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical presentation of disordered pituitary hormone secretion, assessment of hyperprolactinemia, and biochemical evaluation, as well as the optimal use of imaging strategies and disease-related complications, are addressed.

In-depth discussions present the latest evidence on the treatment of prolactinoma, including efficacy, adverse effects, and options for withdrawal of dopamine agonist therapy, as well as indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy, and radiation therapy. Management of prolactinoma in special situations is discussed, including cystic lesions, mixed growth hormone-secreting and prolactin-secreting adenomas, and giant and aggressive prolactinomas. Furthermore, considerations for pregnancy and fertility are outlined, as well as management of prolactinomas in children and adolescents, patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder, postmenopausal women, transgender individuals, and patients with chronic kidney disease.

The workshop concluded that, although treatment resistance is rare, there is a need for additional therapeutic options to address clinical challenges in treating these patients and a need to facilitate international registries to enable risk stratification and optimization of therapeutic strategies.

### Clinical and pathological aspects of silent pituitary adenomas [^112x9DzT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical picture of pituitary adenomas reflects a continuum between functional adenomas and "totally silent" adenomas. The phrase "totally silent" adenoma has been proposed for when the basal and stimulated serum concentrations of the corresponding hormones do not suggest excess hormone secretion, and no clinical signs or symptoms are present that can be attributed to hormone excess. The term "clinically silent" can be used when silent pituitary adenomas (SPAs) secrete hormonal products that cause a mild elevation of the serum concentration but do not result in clinical signs or symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion. Some cases have been referred to as "whispering" adenomas, characterized by borderline, mild, often overlooked clinical symptoms and signs but elevated hormone levels in the blood. Furthermore, the functional status of a tumor can change during the course of the disease, which has most often been observed with ACTH-expressing tumors.

A comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 2000 to March 2018 with the following keywords:

- **Pituitary adenoma/tumor and nonfunctioning**
- **Pituitary adenoma/tumor and silent**

Two separate searches were performed in each database without language restrictions. A total of 667 studies were retrieved, with 511 from PubMed and 156 from EMBASE. Duplicate reports were excluded, totaling 55. All titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were reviewed, and the data are presented with an emphasis on the particular aspects of the different histological subtypes.

### Pituitary society guidance: Pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^114T3Wuu]. Pituitary (2020). Low credibility.

If preliminary assessment confirms ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and no visual symptoms are reported, imaging may be delayed. However, if any visual symptoms are present, and recognizing the challenges of conducting a formal visual field assessment, proceeding directly with MRI or CT imaging (shorter exam time and easier machine access) will allow for confirmation or exclusion of a large pituitary adenoma compressing the optic chiasm. If a large adenoma is confirmed, the patient will need to be evaluated by a neurosurgeon. In contrast, a small pituitary adenoma may not be visible on a CT scan; in such cases, MRI may be deferred for a few months until COVID-19 restrictions limiting access to care are lifted.

- **Decision making**: Another variable will help determine, in conjunction with the patient's preference, the best next step. In cases of more severe clinical Cushing's syndrome, and in the absence of a large pituitary adenoma, medical therapy would be considered. The magnitude of 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) elevation could also serve as a criterion for primary therapy since higher values have been associated with an increased risk of infection.

- **Comorbidities management**: It is also important to address comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Given the increased risk of venous thromboembolism, discussions with primary care providers should include plans for regular mobilization/exercise as permitted (including at home when stay-in orders are in place) and/or the consideration of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin.

### Predictors of favorable long-term outcomes in first-line surgery for microprolactinomas [^1161qHT5]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis relied on preoperative clinical and biochemical evaluations, following a standardized protocol for pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outlined below. Baseline characteristics encompassed patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and the clinical manifestations prompting their presentation, such as headache, visual deficits, galactorrhea, amenorrhea in women, and low libido or erectile dysfunction in men.

- **Biochemical evaluation**: PRL levels were evaluated using the immunoradiometric PRL assay, employing serum dilution to overcome the high-dose PRL hook effect. The presence of macroprolactin was regularly examined, with the upper limit for PRL levels set at 20 µg/L. In terms of pituitary axis deficits, partial hypopituitarism was defined as impaired secretion of one or more pituitary hormones. Secondary adrenal insufficiency was identified by low cortisol levels (< 50 nmol/L) in the serum or normal cortisol levels with inadequate responses to the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test or insulin tolerance test. The diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism relied on finding low-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and a low free thyroxine (FT4) level. A deficiency in gonadotropins or central hypogonadism was considered if gonadotropin levels were low-normal alongside low estradiol or testosterone levels.

- **Neuroimaging assessment**: MRI scans were conducted using a 1.5- or 3-Tesla system, encompassing a Proton/T2-weighted whole-brain examination that included unenhanced, contrast-enhanced, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.

### Parlodel [^112uV7vP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Warnings about the use of Parlodel (bromocriptine mesylate) highlight several important considerations. Since hyperprolactinemia with amenorrhea/galactorrhea and infertility has been found in patients with pituitary tumors, a complete evaluation of the pituitary is indicated before treatment.

If pregnancy occurs during Parlodel administration, careful observation of these patients is mandatory. Prolactin-secreting adenomas may expand, and compression of the optic or other cranial nerves may occur, potentially necessitating emergency pituitary surgery. In most cases, the compression resolves following delivery. Reinitiation of Parlodel treatment has been reported to improve the visual fields of patients in whom nerve compression has occurred during pregnancy. However, the safety of Parlodel treatment during pregnancy, for both the mother and fetus, has not been established.

Parlodel has also been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson's disease. Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, sometimes without awareness or warning signs, has been reported. Patients must be informed of this risk and advised not to drive or operate machines during treatment with bromocriptine. Patients who have experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset must not drive or operate machines. Furthermore, a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1111aFv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

- **Values and preferences**: The recommendations for screening for hypersecretion needed to balance the potential benefits of early detection with the relatively low likelihood of finding certain abnormalities in a given patient, as well as the costs and burden of potentially unnecessary testing. Screening for certain hormone hypersecretion syndromes was considered important even if the patient was asymptomatic or if the abnormality was unlikely in the patient population. Screening for hyperprolactinemia was deemed essential due to the potential for successful treatment with an oral dopamine agonist. Screening for GH excess with a serum IGF-I level was recommended, as early detection of a GH-secreting tumor — which would likely be asymptomatic — could reduce long-term morbidity and increase the likelihood of surgical cure. Some suggest screening for glucocorticoid excess in all patients, but others may limit screening to those with clinical suspicion, given the high false-positive rate and low rate of true positives in the former group of patients.

- **Remarks**: The pros and cons of detailed versus limited screening for hypersecretion syndromes (other than for prolactinoma) were debated, and the Task Force was split on this point. The quality of evidence for, or against one particular testing strategy was weak.

- **Recommendation**: We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, with or without symptoms, also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

### Pituitary adenomas: An overview [^114mFT3d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas are the most common types of pituitary adenomas. Patients with pituitary adenomas may initially present with symptoms of endocrine dysfunction such as infertility, decreased libido, and galactorrhea, or with neurologic symptoms such as headache and visual changes. The diagnosis may also be made following imaging performed for an unrelated issue in an asymptomatic patient; this is termed a pituitary incidentaloma. Oversecretion of hormones from a dysfunctional pituitary gland may result in classic clinical syndromes, the most common of which are hyperprolactinemia (from oversecretion of prolactin), acromegaly (from excess growth hormone), and Cushing disease (from overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone).

In the diagnostic approach to a suspected pituitary adenoma, it is important to evaluate complete pituitary function, as hypopituitarism is common. Therapy for pituitary adenomas depends on the specific type of tumor and should be managed with a team approach that includes endocrinology and neurosurgery when indicated. Dopamine agonists are the primary treatment for prolactinomas. Small nonfunctioning adenomas and prolactinomas in asymptomatic patients do not require immediate intervention and can be observed.

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are several other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

### Clinical and pathological aspects of silent pituitary adenomas [^1155PcvU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

In a retrospective series of 118 surgically resected gonadotroph adenomas without symptoms of hyperfunction, 48% of the men and 25% of the premenopausal women presented with elevated FSH and LH levels; isolated FSH elevation was more common (13%) than isolated LH elevation (8%). In a clinicopathological analysis of 100 (79 men and 21 women) gonadotroph adenomas, hypogonadism was diagnosed in 78% of the men, and high levels of testosterone were not described. Hypersecretion of FSH and LH (defined as more than a twofold increase above the upper limit of normal) was observed in 19% and 9% of the men, respectively. In contrast, preoperative FSH and LH were not elevated in any of the premenopausal or postmenopausal women. Additionally, 33% of the patients presented with hyperprolactinemia, which might have altered the serum gonadotropin levels.

Circulating LH and FSH levels can therefore aid in the preoperative diagnosis and the postoperative surveillance of these patients. In men, a large sellar mass associated with elevated FSH, an inappropriately normal LH, and a low testosterone level or an elevated LH level, with or without elevated FSH, and a high testosterone level, is indicative of a gonadotroph adenoma. In premenopausal women, a gonadotroph adenoma should be suspected when elevated FSH, low or normal LH, and pronounced elevated estradiol are present with clinical findings resembling polycystic ovarian syndrome, characterized by large polycystic ovaries and menstrual irregularities. In postmenopausal women, the diagnosis can be more challenging because they typically have high circulating levels of LH and FSH naturally.

### Medical therapy of gonadotropin-producing and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas [^112JucL5]. Pituitary (2002). Low credibility.

Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas are among the most common types of pituitary tumors. Most tumors are detected incidentally during imaging studies conducted for other reasons unless they present with symptoms related to local mass effects. Although clinically nonfunctioning, most of these tumors have in vitro evidence of gonadotropin hormone or glycoprotein subunit production. The gonadotropins or their monomer subunits rarely cause clinically identifiable effects. When these tumors present as macroadenomas, often with associated mass effect and hypopituitarism, primary therapy is neurosurgery. The role for medical therapy will be reviewed here.

### Serum prolactin overestimation and risk of misdiagnosis [^112XxaWG]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Falsely elevated prolactin measurements risk overdiagnosis, unnecessary imaging, and treatment. We conducted a clinical audit of 18 patients who presented with hyperprolactinaemia, followed by a laboratory audit of 40 split samples across a range of serum prolactin (5‐5051 mIU/L). In each case (total n = 58), serum prolactin was measured on both Roche and Siemens platforms.

Serum prolactin as measured by Roche was higher than the corresponding Siemens value in every case, despite similar reference ranges. The mean discrepancy in serum prolactin by Roche vs. Siemens was +81% in the clinical audit and +50% in the laboratory audit. This led to unnecessary interventions in 7 of 18 patients (39%) in the clinical audit.

Serum prolactin is overestimated on the Roche platform relative to the Siemens platform. Laboratories should review Roche reference intervals for serum prolactin, and clinicians should consider repeating serum prolactin on another platform if the serum prolactin is incongruent with the clinical scenario.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome in the context of pituitary adenomas: Prevalence, pathophysiology and clinical management [^111aBRgj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

This review explores the coexistence of specific types of pituitary adenomas (PAs) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), focusing on potential pathogenesis and overlapping features. A comprehensive evaluation of the full spectrum of PAs and their association with PCOS is lacking. This review provides a broad assessment of the interactions between these entities, emphasizing pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentations, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic implications.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE database, focusing on publications from 2000 to 2024, and including seminal papers from the 1950s. Reference lists of selected articles were manually searched. Inclusion criteria encompassed review articles, retrospective studies, clinical trials, case reports, and meta-analyses on pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic approaches related to PCOS and different PAs.

- **Results**: PCOS and functioning PAs often exhibit overlapping clinical features, complicating diagnosis and management. PCOS may precede and delay the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas. The prevalence of PCOS or its features in acromegaly is influenced by disease activity, approximating 13% in cases with controlled disease. Excess GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) adversely affect ovarian function through direct pathways and by inducing.

### Future treatment strategies of aggressive pituitary tumors [^117AP2rS]. Pituitary (2009). Low credibility.

While surgery remains the first-line treatment for most aggressive pituitary adenomas, medical therapy is important as a second-line or adjunctive option for a large proportion of patients. Dopamine agonists (DAs) are the best treatment for prolactinomas; however, when DAs are not tolerated, new somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR(5)) inhibitors may offer an alternative in the future. Unfortunately, these are unlikely to be effective in DA-resistant prolactinomas.

In acromegaly, the existing somatostatin analogs, octreotide and lanreotide, will remain the medical treatment of choice for the foreseeable future. There is an urgent need for medical therapies in Cushing's disease, and the SSTR(5) analogs could offer an effective treatment for a proportion of patients within the next few years. Finally, the medical management options for non-functioning pituitary adenomas are also very limited, and a new chimeric agent with activity towards dopamine receptors, SSTR(5), and SSTR(2) may help reduce adenoma recurrence in the future.

### Diagnosis of pituitary gonadotroph adenomas in reproductive-aged women [^112SzSz2]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical symptoms associated with the diagnosis of pituitary gonadotroph adenoma in premenopausal women. The design involved a report of three separate cases conducted at a university medical center.

- **Patients**: Three patients were examined:
	- A 31-year-old woman presented with primary infertility, adnexal masses, and highly elevated estradiol levels.
	- A 30-year-old woman exhibited multicystic ovaries following multiple cystectomies and transvaginal cyst aspirations, along with elevated estradiol levels.
	- A 43-year-old woman had bilateral complex cystic adnexal masses and elevated estradiol levels; she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for a suspected granulosa cell tumor.

- **Interventions**: The intervention for these cases was the transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary mass.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes measured were serum estradiol, FSH, and LH levels; transvaginal ultrasonography of the ovaries; and histological examination of pituitary tumors.

- **Results**: The transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenomas resulted in normalization of serum estradiol and FSH levels and resolution of adnexal masses in two of the women.

- **Conclusions**: Pituitary gonadotroph adenoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis of reproductive-aged women presenting with the clinical symptom triad of new-onset oligomenorrhea, bilateral cystic adnexal masses, elevated estradiol and FSH levels, with suppressed LH levels. Timely diagnosis may prevent unnecessary and potentially damaging surgical procedures.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113UB9pj]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence to support screening for hypopituitarism in patients with an incidentaloma also comes from small observational studies. In combined data on micro- and macroincidentalomas, hypopituitarism was present in seven of 66 and 19 of 46 patients. Deficits of gonadotropins (not associated with hyperprolactinemia) were detected in up to 30% of patients; of the ACTH/cortisol axis in up to 18%; the thyroid axis in up to 28%; and the GH axis in up to 8%.

Different approaches can be taken to the initial evaluation of the patient for hypopituitarism.

- **Minimal screening**: Some Task Force members recommend the measurement of free T4, morning cortisol, and testosterone levels.
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Others recommend that the initial evaluation should also include the measurement of TSH, LH, FSH, and IGF-I. A broad initial approach to this testing is favored by some to avoid repeated blood sampling that would be needed to confirm a central origin of target organ deficiencies should they be detected.

Low gonadotropin levels in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone levels are low. Similarly, normal or low TSH levels help distinguish a pituitary etiology of hypothyroidism when the free T4 is low. Gonadal function can be assessed in premenopausal women by history and examination. If baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, particularly with respect to endocrine evaluation, the PS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining baseline screening for hypopituitarism in all patients with sellar lesions. This includes measuring levels of fT4, TSH, morning cortisol, ACTH, LH, FSH, and IGF-1. It is advised to measure testosterone in men and estradiol in women as needed. If morning cortisol levels suggest hypocortisolism, obtain dynamic testing of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Consider dynamic testing for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in selected patients after correcting other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Gonadal hormonal testing is not recommended for premenopausal women with regular menses.

### Approach to the patient with persistent hyperprolactinemia and negative sellar imaging [^116ZjbbQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of menstrual disturbances affecting young women. There is a diversity of causes, ranging from physiological, such as pregnancy, to pharmacological and pathological, such as hypothyroidism. Renal and hepatic failure, intercostal nerve stimulation by trauma or surgery, prolactinomas, other tumors in the hypothalamus-pituitary region, and macroprolactinemia can also be considered. Identifying the correct cause is important to establish the correct treatment. Should all these causes be ruled out and pituitary imaging revealed as negative, idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is diagnosed. In symptomatic patients, treatment with dopaminergic agonists is indicated. As for asymptomatic hyperprolactinemic individuals, macroprolactinemia should be screened, and once detected, there is no need for pituitary imaging study or dopaminergic agonist use.

### Pathogenesis of pituitary tumors [^112RTd5X]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenomas may hypersecrete hormones, including prolactin, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, and rarely follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or TSH, or may be nonfunctional. Despite their high prevalence in the general population, these tumors are invariably benign and exhibit features of differentiated pituitary cell function as well as premature proliferative arrest. The pathogenesis of dysregulated pituitary cell proliferation and unrestrained hormone hypersecretion may be mediated by hypothalamic, intrapituitary, and/or peripheral factors. Altered expression of pituitary cell cycle genes, activation of pituitary selective oncoproteins, or loss of pituitary suppressor factors may be associated with aberrant growth factor signaling. Considerable information on the etiology of these tumors has been derived from transgenic animal models, which may not accurately and universally reflect human tumor pathophysiology. Understanding subcellular mechanisms that underlie pituitary tumorigenesis will enable the development of tumor aggression markers as well as novel targeted therapies.

### Successful pregnancy after operation in an infertile woman caused by luteinizing hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma: Case report and literature review [^111sj7jH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

There are few systemic series on the optimal management of FGA, and the relevant data relies on case reports or very small cases. Surgical removal of the adenoma remains the optimal approach and, if successful, leads to restoration of normal gonadotropin secretion, regular menstruation, and resolution of infertility. However, after the operation, there was a peak of serum LH and FSH curve in 24 hours due to the excess LH and FSH secreted into the blood from the pituitary adenoma irritated by the operation. The most typical endocrinological abnormality in our case was the elevation of LH and estradiol, with FSH within normal limits. Our study revealed that 3 of 6 LH-secreting adenomas had decreased FSH, which may be due to the impairment of FSH secretion from the normal pituitary by the adenoma, while 3 cases had normal FSH. However, in FSH-secreting adenomas, elevated FSH was always accompanied by decreased LH.

One limitation we have to acknowledge is that serum and immunostaining of the alpha-subunit were not measured due to the limits of detection technology; thus, we cannot conclude whether the pure LH-secreting adenoma was accompanied by free alpha-subunit hypersecretion.

In our case, a woman with infertility as the first manifestation successfully conceived after pituitary mass resection. This case indicates that pituitary adenoma should be considered when other diseases causing infertility have been excluded.

### Clinical biology of the pituitary adenoma [^112Z6x7e]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing use of assisted reproductive techniques and advances in pituitary clinical and surgical treatments have resulted in more women with pituitary disorders achieving fertility and conceiving. Accordingly, pregnancy is now common in women harboring pituitary adenomas. However, during pregnancy, these adenomas may enlarge, and pituitary volume increases by up to 136%, mostly due to estrogen-stimulated lactotroph hypertrophy and hyperplasia, with a subsequent increased risk of sellar mass effect.

Pituitary adenomas, especially when associated with pituitary failure, may impair fertility and preconception and affect endocrine outcomes throughout pregnancy. Prior to pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy should be optimized in women with pituitary adenoma and hypopituitarism.

Evaluation of a newly discovered pituitary adenoma during pregnancy is challenging, as the interpretation of biochemical testing can be difficult, and imaging may be constrained due to radiation or gadolinium risks. Notably, the differential diagnosis in a pregnant woman with no known prior pituitary adenoma should include that of lymphocytic hypophysitis.

Most pregnant women with a pituitary adenoma should receive standard obstetrical care, with frequent maternal and fetal surveillance. Those with macroadenomas and compressive symptoms would likely require cesarean section and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team.

- **Pituitary gland changes during pregnancy**: Pituitary morphological adaptations result in altered pituitary hormonal secretion, ensuring optimal fetal development.

### Successful pregnancy after operation in an infertile woman caused by luteinizing hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma: Case report and literature review [^115zJrZ3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Gonadotroph adenomas are relatively common among pituitary adenomas, accounting for 25–35% of all macroadenomas recognized clinically, and 43–64% of silent adenomas. They are defined by being immunohistochemically positive for FSH, LH, and/or their subunits, even when there is no measurable hormone secretion. Amongst gonadotroph adenomas, most are non-functional, and only a minority are functional gonadotroph adenomas (FGAs) that secrete biologically active gonadotropins. Even for those hormone-producing adenomas, the hormonal production is usually not high enough to cause recognizable symptoms besides common neurological symptoms resulting from mass effect. This leads to difficulty in recognizing gonadotroph adenomas.

FGA is a rare disease. Only small case series or individual case reports have been documented. The tumors usually produce FSH, and less frequently, both FSH and LH together. In contrast, from 1981 to 2020, only six cases of LH-secreting adenomas have been reported in the English literature, with or without free alpha-subunits, illustrating the rarity of this disease and the difficulty in diagnosis based on clinical symptoms. FGAs are difficult to recognize because they are often poorly symptomatic or "silent". Although these adenomas do produce complete or partial gonadotropins, they do not raise the serum gonadotropin concentrations significantly. Therefore, it is important and essential to conduct biochemical testing in pituitary adenomas to detect excessive hormonal secretion.

### Clinical biology of the pituitary adenoma [^1145wwsX]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In the absence of a specific pathological marker, the occurrence of cranio-spinal or systemic metastasis is required to classify a pituitary tumor as a carcinoma. Despite this clear definition, differential diagnosis can be difficult in the presence of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of visceral origin with pituitary metastasis.

True pituitary carcinomas are exceedingly rare. Their prevalence, estimated from large pathology collections, ranges from 0.13% to 0.4% of all resected tumors. Interestingly, published cases describing pituitary carcinomas have increased dramatically following the first descriptions of successful treatment of these tumors with the oral alkylating agent temozolomide, leading to publication of case series or large cohort studies describing therapeutic results.

- **Natural history**: The majority of pituitary carcinomas originate from invasive macroadenomas, are resistant to medical treatment, and require multiple surgeries and radiation therapy to achieve tumor control. From a review of the literature and a survey of European Society of Endocrinology members, 112 cases of pituitary carcinomas were identified (65 men and 47 women), with a median age at diagnosis of 45 years (range, 9–75 years). Corticotroph and lactotroph tumors were the most frequent subtypes. The switch from a nonfunctioning to functioning tumor should alert the physician to the potential for an aggressive pituitary tumor and the risk of distant metastasis, especially with a switch from a silent corticotroph adenoma to overt Cushing's disease.

### Incidental versus symptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas: Are they different [^114A8AxW]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, the aim of our study was to highlight the increasing prevalence of incidentally diagnosed nonfunctioning adenomas, as well as the need for more clinical suspicion for this condition, as many of the patients manifesting this type of diagnosis already present previously unknown symptoms related to the tumour. It is also intended to emphasize the need for hormonal assessment in all tumours, both the incidentally and symptomatically diagnosed ones, be they macro or microadenomas. Understanding the behavior of these tumours better and acting accordingly would only be possible if contemporary cohorts, including patients undergoing or not undergoing surgical intervention, were studied. Further research can better clarify the differences between these types of tumours, especially regarding their long-term prognosis.

### Clinical and diagnostic characteristics of hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence [^116dchXd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, a rare endocrine disorder encountered in pediatric patient care. Epidemiological and clinical information about hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence is limited. Clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia are very heterogeneous. In girls, disturbances in menstrual function and galactorrhea may be seen, whereas in boys, headache, visual disturbances, delayed pubertal development, and hypogonadism are often present. Owing to the ease of ordering a serum prolactin measurement, an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to the management of this endocrine disorder is required. Before a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, drug use, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and parasellar tumors should be excluded.

The main objectives of treatment are normalization of prolactin level, adenoma shrinkage, and recovery from clinical signs related to hyperprolactinemia. In patients with microadenoma, invasive or non-invasive macroadenoma, and even in patients with visual field defects, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to medical treatment or who have persistent neurological signs. Radiotherapy should be considered as a supportive treatment for patients in whom surgery fails or medical response is not achieved.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^115nFmLz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Accounting for approximately 40% of the entire cohort of pituitary tumors, prolactinomas are the most common hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas. Infertility, along with gonadal and sexual dysfunction, are the most relevant clinical features in both sexes. Prolactinomas are the main pathological cause of PRL excess; however, several conditions may induce an increase in PRL levels and should be excluded before a diagnosis is made.

- **Microprolactinomas**: In clinical practice, microprolactinomas (10 mm in size) occur more frequently in women. Disturbances of the menstrual cycle and infertility often prompt rapid medical advice, leading to early diagnosis, as exemplified in clinical case 2.

- **Macroprolactinomas**: Conversely, in men, the prevalence of macroprolactinomas with visual field defects and hypopituitarism at first presentation is higher. The mean age at diagnosis in men is at least 10 years delayed compared with women. This delay is due to the most important components of the clinical syndrome in men being decreased libido and/or erectile dysfunction, as illustrated in clinical case 3.

- **Epidemiology**: In adults, the estimated prevalence of prolactinomas accounts for 60 to 100 per million population. According to a recent review study of different patient series, standardized incidence rates for pituitary tumors range from 4 to 7.39 cases per 100,000 per year. Prolactinomas have been reported to represent 40% to 66% of all pituitary tumors. Patient age has been shown to differently influence incidence rates in men compared to women.

### Pituitary Society guidance: Pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^117JzgK5]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

The diagnosis of a lactotroph adenoma can be inferred in most patients based on the presence of a pituitary adenoma and an elevated prolactin level, which is typically proportionate in magnitude to adenoma size. Pituitary imaging (MRI or CT) is therefore a key step in the investigation of hyperprolactinemia. Evaluation for hypopituitarism is also necessary.

- **Management**: Although observation and routine follow-up with serial prolactin levels and imaging is acceptable for patients who are asymptomatic and have a microadenoma, most patients diagnosed with a prolactinoma will require treatment. Dopamine-agonists (DA) can normalize prolactin levels and lead to reduction in size of the lactotroph adenoma. In patients who have a microadenoma and who are not seeking fertility, hormone-replacement therapy may also be appropriate if serum prolactin is routinely followed and imaging performed as necessary.

Medical therapy can be managed effectively and efficiently via virtual visits (VVs) coupled with laboratory/imaging studies as needed. However, in all patients in whom a DA will be initiated, it is critical that a comprehensive psychiatric history is obtained prior to commencing treatment. Patients may not readily volunteer their psychiatric history and may not appreciate the relevance of such information. For example, until specifically questioned about their psychiatric history, the patient described in the illustrative case did not report a history of severe depression, suicide attempt, and prolonged psychiatric hospitalization 8 months prior to presentation with hyperprolactinemia.
