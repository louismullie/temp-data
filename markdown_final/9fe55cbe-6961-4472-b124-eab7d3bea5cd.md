## Question

Opll recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommendations for the management of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), with transparent self-verification and a clear stepwise plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and classification. Then, I should verify indications for surgery versus conservative care. Next, I will review surgical approach selection and risk–benefit tradeoffs. After that, I should examine special populations and thoracic disease. Finally, I will integrate long-term follow-up and outcome data into a concise decision framework and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach and disease classification because treatment hinges on precise imaging characterization. OPLL spans localized, segmental, continuous, and mixed morphologies, with cervical involvement most common and thoracic disease more likely to be severe at the mid-thoracic levels, so noncontrast CT best defines ossification extent, canal occupancy, dural ossification signs, and K-line status, while MRI characterizes cord edema and soft-tissue dynamics, and radiographs remain first-line for nonspecific neck pain absent red flags per ACR criteria [^114ZfMbX] [^114jpSqK] [^116XG1Cs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check how we stratify severity clinically and radiographically before discussing surgery, since decisions depend on neurologic grade (for example, Nurick or mJOA), symptom duration, canal occupying ratio (COR), K-line, number of involved levels, and sagittal alignment, and the literature repeatedly shows that surgery yields the greatest benefit in moderate-to-severe myelopathy and is less compelling in mild disease or asymptomatic compression, which should temper aggressive intervention in low-grade cases [^111d7x9H] [^115h9bXg] [^1113JsPS].

> I should confirm when conservative management is acceptable. Minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with OPLL are generally managed nonsurgically with close follow-up, and a long-term cohort suggests that about 16.7% of initially nonmyelopathic patients progress to myelopathy over prolonged observation, which means counseling on red flags and interval reassessment is essential, and emerging evidence indicates integrative Korean medicine may reduce pain and disability in select patients, though high-quality comparative data are limited and should be interpreted cautiously [^116v24iY] [^113eG764] [^111d7x9H].

> Wait, let me verify the prophylactic surgery question because this is commonly asked. There is no evidence to support prophylactic decompression for significant OPLL in the absence of symptoms or with only mild myelopathy, and a focused review of Japanese guidelines explicitly recommends against prophylactic surgery in such scenarios, so observation with surveillance remains the appropriate course unless new risk stratification data emerge [^112YBLu9].

> Next, I should review the core indications for surgery. Clear neurologic deficits from cord compression, progressive myelopathy, and severe canal compromise are established reasons to decompress, with many series anchoring severity to a canal occupying ratio greater than 50–60%, while long-term cohort data show surgery's greatest relative benefit in Nurick grades 3–4 and limited yield in grades 1–2, and randomized and prospective multicenter data demonstrate that patients with mild DCM can still improve with surgery, though equipoise with structured rehabilitation persists and decisions should be individualized [^117WdtZe] [^115h9bXg] [^114mGYrE].

> Let me think about approach selection. I initially recalled that posterior laminoplasty yields better myelopathy recovery than laminectomy and fusion, but wait, I should double-check that because the comparative literature is mixed and often low quality, with some systematic reviews suggesting similar functional outcomes between laminoplasty and laminectomy with fusion and others noting nuanced differences by subgroup, so I should correct that overgeneralization and emphasize that approach selection should be individualized to morphology, alignment, and surgeon expertise rather than assuming superiority of one posterior technique over another [^114xdRfF] [^115kU47j] [^117GaUT2].

> I will now examine the K-line concept because it meaningfully guides posterior candidacy. The K-line connects the midpoints of the spinal canal at C2 and C7, and when the OPLL mass does not exceed this line (K-line positive), posterior decompression can achieve adequate cord drift and favorable outcomes, whereas K-line negative predicts insufficient posterior shift and poorer recovery after laminoplasty, prompting consideration of anterior decompression in those cases, which is supported by prospective data and ultrasound confirmation of limited cord drift in K-line negative patients [^112hTRTg] [^117TR4j8].

> But wait, what if the patient has extensive multilevel disease? I should confirm that posterior approaches are generally favored for long-segment involvement because of lower surgical morbidity compared with multilevel anterior corpectomy, yet laminoplasty is associated with higher rates of radiographic OPLL progression than laminectomy with fusion, even though short-to-intermediate term neurologic outcomes are often comparable, so if progression risk is high and alignment is acceptable, adding instrumented fusion may mitigate further ossification growth and late deterioration, albeit with more surgical trauma [^114C5JFS] [^116qGeKy] [^116VLCMJ].

> Hold on, I should verify anterior indications and risks. Anterior corpectomy with fusion offers direct decompression and is particularly advantageous when COR exceeds 50–60%, K-line is negative, or there is localized disease with preserved alignment, but it carries higher risks of dural tear and CSF leak due to frequent dural adhesion, with reported CSF leak rates ranging from roughly 4% to over 30% in some series, necessitating meticulous technique and preparedness for intraoperative repair and postoperative management strategies [^117WdtZe] [^1174b4kK].

> Let me consider special scenarios. In acute traumatic cervical cord injury superimposed on preexisting OPLL, early decompression within 24 hours improved motor recovery in a randomized trial of incomplete tetraplegia without bone injury, and in trauma with facet dislocation, awake closed reduction can precipitate catastrophic neurologic decline in the setting of OPLL, so advanced imaging and staged stabilization strategies should be prioritized when OPLL is suspected or known [^113yGMGa] [^114mW3mB].

> I should confirm thoracic OPLL nuances. Mid-thoracic predominance and frequent coexistence with OLF complicate approach selection, and while posterior decompression with instrumented fusion avoids the morbidity of transthoracic approaches, OPLL may continue to progress radiographically without overt clinical deterioration in some cohorts, reinforcing the need for long-term surveillance and careful selection of patients for direct anterior extirpation when feasible and safe [^116XG1Cs] [^111uioyT] [^116eW5gW].

> Next, I should review long-term outcomes and survivorship. Patients with DCM, including OPLL, generally experience durable neurologic improvement after surgery, but OPLL confers higher risk of neurological failure over time, especially when fusion is not performed, and a longitudinal study found OPLL carried a 2.32-fold higher hazard for neurological failure and that lack of fusion in OPLL was associated with markedly higher failure rates, supporting a lower threshold for adding fusion in OPLL cases when appropriate [^116B9fMG].

> Let me reconsider the decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with OPLL should be managed conservatively with education and interval reassessment, patients with mild myelopathy may reasonably undergo a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation or proceed to surgery based on patient preference, comorbidity, and imaging risk factors, and patients with moderate-to-severe myelopathy or high-grade canal compromise should generally be offered surgical decompression with approach tailored to K-line, COR, number of levels, alignment, and surgeon expertise, recognizing that posterior options are less morbid but may permit progression, whereas anterior options provide direct decompression at the cost of higher complication rates [^111d7x9H] [^114mGYrE] [^1113JsPS].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-linked. There is no role for prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic OPLL, conservative management is appropriate with counseling on progression risk, surgery is indicated for progressive or functionally significant myelopathy or severe stenosis, posterior decompression is favored for multilevel disease with favorable alignment and K-line status while anterior decompression is preferred for focal high-grade ventral compression or K-line negative scenarios, and adding fusion in OPLL may reduce long-term neurological failure, all of which should be contextualized by patient factors and evolving risk-prediction tools for postoperative ossification progression [^112YBLu9] [^111d7x9H] [^112hTRTg] [^116B9fMG] [^116ZabGE].

---

OPLL management should be **individualized** based on symptoms, neurologic status, and imaging [^111d7x9H]. For **asymptomatic or mild cases**, conservative care with activity modification, NSAIDs, and close follow-up is appropriate [^116v24iY]. Surgery is indicated for **moderate-to-severe myelopathy**, progressive neurologic deficits, or refractory radiculopathy; anterior approaches (ACDF/ACCF) are preferred for focal, high-grade stenosis or K-line negative cases [^117TR4j8], while posterior approaches (laminoplasty/laminectomy with fusion) are favored for multilevel disease, preserved lordosis, or high surgical risk [^114C5JFS]. Early surgery offers better outcomes [^114cTb4g], but complications (CSF leak, C5 palsy, hardware failure) are more common in OPLL; preoperative CT/MRI and K-line assessment guide approach selection [^112hTRTg] [^117TR4j8] [^114ZfMbX]. Postoperative OPLL progression can occur after laminoplasty, so surveillance is essential [^116qGeKy].

---

## Clinical presentation and natural history

OPLL typically presents with **myelopathy**, radiculopathy, or axial neck pain [^111d7x9H] [^112hS1wb]. The natural history is **progressive**: approximately 17% of asymptomatic patients develop myelopathy over 30 years, with higher risk when canal compromise exceeds 60% or cervical range of motion is increased [^115h9bXg]. Myelopathy may also develop acutely after minor trauma, especially in patients with preexisting OPLL-related stenosis [^116enHPZ].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Plain radiographs**: Useful for initial screening but limited sensitivity.

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for delineating ossification extent, canal compromise, and dural ossification [^112mg7e8].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Essential for assessing spinal cord compression, signal changes, and soft tissue involvement [^112mg7e8].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for **asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients without significant neurologic deficits**. Strategies include:

- **Activity modification**: Avoidance of high-risk activities and trauma.

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs for pain control.

- **Physical therapy**: Gentle exercises and cervical traction.

- **Regular follow-up**: Serial clinical and imaging assessments to monitor progression [^116v24iY].

---

## Surgical indications

Surgical intervention is indicated for the following scenarios:

- **Moderate-to-severe myelopathy**: mJOA score ≤ 14 or Nurick grade ≥ 3 [^115h9bXg].

- **Progressive neurologic deficits**: Worsening motor or sensory function.

- **Refractory radiculopathy**: Persistent nerve root compression symptoms.

- **Significant canal compromise**: Occupying ratio > 50% or K-line negative [^112hTRTg].

---

## Surgical approaches

| **Attribute** | **Anterior approach (acdf/accf)** | **Posterior approach (laminoplasty/laminectomy with fusion)** |
|-|-|-|
| Indications | Focal, high-grade stenosis; K-line negative; limited levels (< 3) [^117TR4j8] | Multilevel disease; preserved lordosis; high surgical risk [^114C5JFS] |
| Advantages | Direct decompression; superior neurological recovery [^112mg7e8] | Lower complication rates; effective for multilevel disease [^114C5JFS] |
| Disadvantages | Higher complication rates (CSF leak, C5 palsy, hardware failure) [^1174b4kK] | Indirect decompression; potential for residual compression [^112SpsSr] |

---

## Postoperative outcomes and complications

- **Neurological improvement**: Significant improvement in myelopathy symptoms reported in 55–75% of patients [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Higher rates of CSF leak, C5 palsy, and hardware failure compared to non-OPLL cervical myelopathy cases [^notfound].

- **Progression**: OPLL may continue to progress postoperatively, particularly after laminoplasty, necessitating long-term surveillance [^116qGeKy].

---

## Long-term prognosis

Long-term outcomes are generally favorable with surgical intervention, with sustained neurological improvement and low recurrence rates [^116B9fMG]. Conservative management carries a risk of progression to myelopathy, especially in patients with significant canal compromise [^115h9bXg].

---

## Recent advances and emerging therapies

Recent advances include the **development of predictive models** for postoperative OPLL progression [^116ZabGE], improved surgical techniques to reduce complications [^114FaFDL], and ongoing research into pharmacological agents to inhibit ossification progression [^notfound].

---

OPLL management requires a **balanced approach**, with conservative care for mild cases and surgery for significant or progressive neurologic deficits. Anterior approaches offer direct decompression but carry higher complication risks, while posterior approaches are safer for multilevel disease but may allow residual compression.

### Management of cerebrospinal fluid leaks after anterior decompression for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a review of the literature [^1174b4kK]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Anterior decompression is an effective way to treat cervical myelopathy associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL); however, this approach is associated with an increased risk of a dural tear and resultant CSF leak because fusion of the dura with the ossified PLL is common in these cases. The authors review the literature and present an algorithm for treatment of CSF leaks in these patients.

Methods

A MEDLINE review was performed to identify papers related to CSF leak after anterior decompression for OPLL, and data were summarized to identify treatment options for various situations. A treatment algorithm was identified based on these findings and the experience of the authors.

Results

Eleven studies were identified that presented data on intra- and postoperative management of a CSF leak during ventral surgery for OPLL. The incidence of cervical dural tears and CSF leaks after anterior decompression procedures for OPLL ranged from 4.3% to 32%. Techniques including preventative measures, intraoperative dural repair with various materials, and postoperative drainage or shunt placement have all been used.

Conclusions

Although direct dural repair is the preferred treatment for CSF leak, this technique is not always technically possible. In these cases, intraoperative adjuncts in combination with postoperative measures can be used to decrease the pressure gradient across the dural tear.

### Neurological survivorship following surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy: a longitudinal study on 195 patients [^116B9fMG]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term data on postoperative neurological survivorship for patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) undergoing decompressive surgery are limited. The purposes of this study were to assess neurological survivorship after primary decompressive surgery for DCM and to identify predictors for postoperative deterioration.

Methods

A longitudinal clinical data set containing surgical details, medical comorbidities, and radiographic features was assembled for 195 patients who underwent a surgical procedure for DCM between 1999 and 2020, with a mean period of observation of 75.9 months. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted, and a log-rank test was performed for the univariate analysis of factors related to neurological failure. Lasso regression facilitated the variable selection in the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis.

Results

The overall neurological survivorship was 89.3% at 5 years and 77.3% at 10 years. Cox multivariate analysis following lasso regression identified elevated hazard ratios (HRs) for suture laminoplasty (HR, 4.76; p < 0.001), renal failure (HR, 4.43; p = 0.013), T2 hyperintensity (HR, 3.34; p = 0.05), and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) (HR, 2.32; p = 0.032). Subgroup analysis among subjects with OPLL demonstrated that the neurological failure rate was significantly higher in the absence of fusion (77.8% compared with 26.3%; p = 0.019).

Conclusions

Overall, patients who underwent a surgical procedure for DCM exhibited an extended period with neurological improvement. Cervical fusion was indicated in OPLL to reduce neurological failure. Our findings on predictors for early deterioration facilitate case selection, prognostication, and counseling as the volume of primary cervical spine surgeries and reoperations increases globally.

### Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging manifestations of paediatric intervertebral disc calcification combined with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: case report and literature review [^1161ejqh]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

IDC is a rare disease that affects the intervertebral discs and the structures of surrounding vertebrae, muscles, and ligaments. It usually results in local pain or sensorimotor disorders. The potential aetiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease remain unclear, but IDC is typically self-limiting, with clinical symptoms disappearing spontaneously within several weeks or months. IDC has an extremely low incidence, with only approximately 400 cases reported in the literature since it was first described in 1924. OPLL is characterised by the replacement of ligamentous tissue by new ectopic bone. Its aetiology is currently unknown and is mainly studied by researchers in Japan. The prevalence of OPLL is 0.1–1.7% in Europe and the United States, 0.4–3% in Asia (excluding Japan), and 1.9–4.3% in Japan. OPLL mainly affects individuals aged 50–70 years, with the mean age of onset being 51.2 years for men and 48.9 years for women. The disease can be classified into four subtypes based on morphology, namely localised (localised to the intervertebral disc space), segmental (ossification behind each vertebral body), continuous (ossification that spans several vertebral bodies), and mixed (a mixture of both segmental and continuous types). IDC combined with OPLL is extremely rare in children, with only 8 cases reported in the current literature (Table 1).

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^112qPKP1]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Presently, younger age, higher body mass index (BMI), greater ossification thickness, continuous and mixed types of ossification, and expansive laminoplasty (EL) surgery have been identified as clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of OPLL progression. – Unfortunately, the current clinical assessment of OPLL postoperative progression largely relies on physicians' clinical experience to screen and analyze potential risk factors, which presents certain limitations. The lack of multidimensional and comprehensive analysis may result in evaluations that do not accurately reflect the risk of postoperative progression in patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a prediction model based on multidimensional clinical data to forecast and intervene in ossification progression following OPLL surgery. Such a model would be critical for improving treatment accuracy, rehabilitation outcomes, and implementing effective clinical interventions.

Nomogram is one of the most commonly used statistical methods in clinical prediction models. It has the advantages of simplicity, intuition, and easy operation. It can visualize the abstract and complicated regression equations and facilitate the probability calculation, of risk factors. In our previous work, we constructed a dynamic prediction model for predicting the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after spinal surgery based on key indicators such as age, body mass index (BMI), bed rest, and D-dimer, combined with operation-related parameters such as operation time and blood loss. The dynamic prediction model has achieved a good prediction effectin clinical applications. Through the nomogram model, on the one hand, clinicians can more vividly show patients their risk of disease progression and improve patient compliance. In contrast, it can guide doctors, nurses, and managers to conduct early screening, personalized treatment, and follow-up plans for patients at high risk of ossification progression after surgery.

On the basis of this, multidimensional clinical data of 271 patients who were diagnosed with OPLL and underwent posterior cervical spine surgery were collected in this study, including demographic data such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), laboratory tests such as triglyceride, cholesterol, calcium, and magnesium, and imaging data such as ossification thickness and spinal canal anteroposterior diameter. Student t test (continuous variable), χ² test (categorical variable), and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to screen out the risk factors that could be used to predict the progression of ossification after surgery, and then a clinical prediction model was constructed and the risk factors were visualized. Early identification of patients at risk of ossification progression after surgery can achieve accurate patient management and effective allocation of medical resources.

### Clinical results of surgery for thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: operative indication of posterior decompression with instrumented fusion [^116eW5gW]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

This retrospective study was conducted to investigate the clinical outcomes of several surgical procedures for thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Objective

To evaluate the effect of myelopathy treatment and safety of posterior decompression with instrumented fusion.

Summary Of Background Data

Many different surgical procedures have been used for the treatment of thoracic OPLL. However, the possibility of postoperative paraplegia remains a major risk, and consistent protocols and procedures for surgical treatment of thoracic OPLL have also not been established.

Methods

A total of 51 patients who underwent surgery for thoracic OPLL were classified into 3 groups: (1) posterior decompression group (18 patients), which included 12 who underwent laminectomy and 6 who underwent cervicothoracic laminoplasty; (2) OPLL extirpation group (16 patients), which included 4 who underwent anterior decompression through thoracotomy and 12 who underwent anterior decompression through the posterior approach; and (3) posterior decompression and fusion group (17 patients), all of whom underwent laminectomy with posterior instrumented fusion. In each group, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score was used to evaluate thoracic myelopathy, and the recovery rate calculated 1 year after surgery and at final examination.

Results

Mean recovery rate at final follow-up was 41.9% in the posterior decompression group, 62.1% in the OPLL extirpation group, and 59.3% in the posterior decompression and fusion group. Postoperative paralysis occurred in 3 patients in the posterior decompression group and in 3 in the OPLL extirpation group. In the OPLL extirpation group, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid occurred in 8 patients and hydrothorax in 2. Late neurologic deterioration occurred in 7 patients in the posterior decompression group. There were no cases of postoperative paralysis or late neurologic deterioration in the posterior decompression and fusion group.

Conclusions

A considerable degree of neurologic recovery was obtained by posterior decompression with instrumented fusion, despite the anterior impingement of the spinal cord by OPLL remaining. In addition, the rate of postoperative complications was extremely low with this procedure. We recommend that 1-stage posterior decompression and instrumented fusion be selected for patients in whom the spinal cord is severely damaged before surgery and/or when extirpation of OPLL is associated with increased risk.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with neck pain associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament treated with integrative complementary and alternative medicine: a retrospective analysis and questionnaire survey [^111tVjCv]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In the present study, 74.4% of the 78 participants had both OPLL and a cervical HIVD, as determined by MRI. The concurrent incidence of OPLL and HIVD varies depending on various factors. In previous studies that analyzed cases of surgery due to OPLL, 55.6% of 54 patientsand 61% of 141 patients also had an HIVD. Among 142 patients, the rate was 18.3% in one study, which was probably lower because the HIVD was deemed to be present only when neurological symptoms were clearly caused by the HIVD. OPLL has been shown to contribute to the onset of an HIVD. Calcium accumulation in the posterior longitudinal ligament induces ossification and hyaline degeneration. This results in volume reduction of the ligament, thereby leading to abnormal mechanical stimulation in the surrounding disc. Furthermore, pathological changes in the posterior longitudinal ligament attached to the fibrous ring may increase disc protrusion or prolapse. Thus, OPLL can be considered to contribute to the onset of an HIVD. Moreover, a cervical HIVD is common among individuals with OPLL.

In this study, there were different types of OPLL, including segmental (67.9%), continuous (1.3%), mixed (23.1%), and local (7.7%) types. A Korean study on 87 patients in a different hospital reported rates of 60% for the segmental type, 8% for the continuous type, 24% for the mixed type, and 8% for the local type among patients with neck pain only and radiating pain without cervical myelopathy. This shows a trend similar to that observed in this study. Conversely, the rates were 35% for the segmental type, 24% for the continuous type, 24% for the mixed type, and 15% for the local type among patients exhibiting symptoms of myelopathy. In cases of continuous OPLL spanning several segments, HIVD more commonly occurred between — as opposed to the top or bottom of — continuous ossifications. Moreover, patients who also presented with disc degeneration had a primarily segmental or local type of OPLL. Regarding the relationship between the type of OPLL and the incidence of an HIVD, an HIVD most frequently occurs with the segmental type. Although an HIVD does not induce this type of OPLL, patients with segmental-type OPLL have an elevated risk of an HIVD due to the increased fragility of the posterior longitudinal ligament and fibrous ring.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^114n8xkx]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary reason that the univariate analysis showed a statistically significant impact of surgical methods on the progression of ossification postsurgery is that the distribution of mechanical stress after EL surgery is not uniform. This uneven stress may continue to stimulate the remaining ossified areas of the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to disease progression. In contrast, PCF surgery stabilizes the cervical spine with screws and rods, reducing mechanical stimulation. Posterior surgery, due to its relative technical simplicity and lower risk, has become a common choice for the treatment of OPLL. However, anterior surgery retains a pivotal role in specific cases. By directly removing the ossified mass compressing the spinal cord, anterior surgery can effectively relieve neural compression, particularly in patients with significant anterior compression or localized ossification. Nevertheless, anterior surgery is more complex and carries higher risks, especially in cases with extensive ossification or severe calcification, where it may increase the likelihood of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and postoperative complications. Despite these challenges, studies have shown that, for well-selected patients, anterior surgery may offer superior long-term neurological recovery compared with posterior surgery. Therefore, anterior and posterior approaches should be regarded as complementary techniques. Clinical decision-making should consider the patient's specific condition, the morphology of the ossification, and the expertise of the surgical team. A comprehensive evaluation is essential to determine the most suitable surgical strategy, thereby optimizing treatment outcomes.

In addition, an increase in BMI exacerbates postoperative ossification progression, mainly because weight gain increases mechanical stress on the cervical spine, causing microdamage and degeneration of the posterior longitudinal ligament, thereby promoting ossification. Leptin has also been reported to promote ossification formation. However, the reason surgical methods and BMI were not identified as risk factors in the multivariate analysis, despite being significant in the univariate analysis, is likely due to confounding factors. Once these were controlled, the independent effects of these factors were diminished, leading to a loss of statistical significance.

Therefore, when there is a high likelihood of achieving a favorable prognosis, the establishment of a prediction model can assist doctors in assessing the risk of postoperative ossification progression, enabling timely adjustments to treatment plans and rehabilitation strategies, and ultimately reducing the economic and psychological burden on patients. However, predicting the risk of ossification progression after surgery in individual patients remains challenging. Appropriate postoperative follow-up monitoring and comprehensive intervention may be effective strategies to prevent further ossification progression after surgery.

### Outcomes after laminoplasty compared with laminectomy and fusion in patients with cervical myelopathy: a systematic review [^114xdRfF]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and safety of cervical laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical myelopathy, and to identify any patient subgroups for whom one treatment may result in better outcomes than the other.

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical laminoplasty and cervical laminectomy plus fusion are both procedures that treat cervical stenosis induced myelopathy by expanding the space available for the spinal cord. Although there are strong proponents of each procedure, the effectiveness, safety, and differential effectiveness and safety of laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion remains unclear.

Methods

A systematic search of multiple major medical reference databases was conducted to identify studies that compared laminoplasty with laminectomy and fusion. Studies could include either or both cervical myelopathic spondylosis (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Case reports and studies with less than 10 patients in the comparative group were excluded. Japanese Orthopaedic Association, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association, and Nurick scores were the primary outcomes measuring myelopathy effectiveness. Reoperation and complication rates were evaluated for safety. Clinical recommendations were made through a modified Delphi approach by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria.

Results

The search strategy yielded 305 citations, and 4 retrospective cohort studies ultimately met our inclusion criteria. For patients with CSM, data from 3 class of evidence III retrospective cohort studies suggest that there is no difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy or pain: 2 studies reported no significant difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy, and 3 studies found no significant difference in pain outcomes between treatment groups. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, one small class of evidence III retrospective cohort study reported significant improvements in myelopathy severity after laminectomy and fusion compared with laminoplasty, but no differences in long-term pain between treatment groups. The overall evidence on the comparative safety of laminoplasty compared with laminectomy and fusion is inconsistent. Reoperation rates were lower after laminoplasty in 2 of 3 studies reporting. However, the incidence of debilitating neck pain was higher after laminoplasty as reported by one study; results on neurological complications were inconclusive, with 2 studies reporting. Results on kyphotic deformity were inconsistent, with opposite results in the 2 studies reporting. After laminectomy and fusion, 1% to 38% of patients had pseudarthrosis. Infection rates were slightly lower after laminoplasty, but the results are not likely to be statistically significant.

Conclusion

For patients with CSM, there is low-quality evidence that suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy and fusion procedures are similarly effective in treating CSM. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is insufficient. For both patient populations, the evidence as to whether one procedure is safer than the other is insufficient. Higher-quality research is necessary to more clearly delineate when one procedure is preferred compared with the other. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation

For CSM, evidence suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy-fusion procedures can be similarly effective. We suggest that surgeons consider each case individually and take into account their own familiarity and expertise with each procedure.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak.

### Do surgical outcomes differ between cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament? A prospective multicenter study of 935 patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1169VXEU]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Prospective multicenter cohort study.

Objective

To compare surgical outcomes between patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) who underwent cervical spine surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Although both CSM and OPLL cause degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), they differ in anatomical and pathological characteristics. OPLL is more prevalent in East Asian populations and may present with distinct surgical challenges due to rigidity and multilevel ossification. Prior comparative studies were mostly retrospective with limited use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), making it unclear whether disease etiology influences postoperative recovery.

Methods

A total of 935 patients (725 with CSM and 210 with OPLL) who underwent cervical spine surgery at 10 high-volume centers in Japan were prospectively followed for 2 years. Clinical, surgical, and radiographic data were collected. Cervical alignment and range of motion were measured radiographically. Outcomes included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), JOA Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ), and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI). General linear model analyses were used to adjust for potential confounding factors in the evaluation of these outcomes.

Results

OPLL patients were younger, had higher body mass index, and more frequently required instrumented fusion and multilevel decompression. They exhibited lower pre- and postoperative cervical mobility and lordosis. However, both groups demonstrated similar improvements in JOA, VAS, SF-36, JOACMEQ, and NPSI scores at 2 years. Complication rates were comparable, and no progression of deformity or instability was observed. Although baseline PROMs were better in the OPLL group, postoperative outcomes were equivalent between the groups.

Conclusions

Patients with CSM and OPLL achieved similarly favorable outcomes after cervical spine surgery. These findings support a unified surgical strategy for DCM, emphasizing functional severity rather than pathological subtype in clinical decision-making.

### Posterior instrumented fusion suppresses the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a comparison of laminoplasty with and without instrumented fusion by three-dimensional analysis [^116VLCMJ]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is no definitive evidence that additional instrumented fusion following laminoplasty suppresses the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Recently, we reported a novel method involving the creation of three-dimensional (3D) model from computed tomography images to measure the volume of OPLL accurately. The study aim was to evaluate whether laminoplasty with instrumented fusion suppresses the progression of OPLL in comparison with stand-alone laminoplasty by our novel 3D analysis.

Methods

The present study comprised of a group of 19 patients (14 men, five women) with OPLL treated with posterior decompression and fusion (PDF group), and a group of 22 patients (14 men, eight women) treated with laminoplasty alone (LP group). The volume of OPLL was evaluated three times during the follow-up period, and the volume change of OPLL was compared between the two groups.

Results

The PDF group (2.0 ± 1.7%/year; range, -3.0 to 5.3) demonstrated lower annual rate of lesion increase compared to the LP group (7.5 ± 5.6%/year; range, 1.0–19.2) (p < 0.001). In a notable thing, the annual rate of increase from the 2nd to the 3rd measurement significantly decreased compared with that from the 1st to the 2nd measurement in the PDF group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

This is the first study to prove a possible suppressant effect of additional posterior instrumented fusion on OPLL progression using novel 3D analysis.

### Analysis of demographics, risk factors, clinical presentation, and surgical treatment modalities for the ossified posterior longitudinal ligament [^114nrheS]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a rare disease that results in progressive myeloradiculopathy related to pathological ossification of the ligament from unknown causes. Although it has long been considered a disease of Asian origin, this disorder is increasingly being recognized in European and North American populations. Herein the authors present demographic, radiographic, and comorbidity data from white patients with diagnosed OPLL as well as the outcomes of surgically treated patients.

Methods

Between 1999 and 2010, OPLL was diagnosed in 36 white patients at Barrow Neurological Institute. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a group of 33 patients with cervical OPLL and a group of 3 patients with thoracic or lumbar OPLL. Fifteen of these patients who had received operative treatment were analyzed separately. Imaging analysis focused on signal changes in the spinal cord, mass occupying ratio, signs of dural penetration, spinal levels involved, and subtype of OPLL. Surgical techniques included anterior cervical decompression and fusion with corpectomy, posterior laminectomy with fusion, posterior open-door laminoplasty, and anterior corpectomy combined with posterior laminectomy and fusion. Comorbidities, cigarette smoking, and previous spine surgeries were considered. Neurological function was assessed using a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale (mJOAS).

Results

A high-intensity signal on T2-weighted MR imaging and a history of cervical spine surgery correlated with worse mJOAS scores. Furthermore, mJOAS scores decreased as the occupying rate of the OPLL mass in the spinal canal increased. On radiographic analysis, the proportion of signs of dural penetration correlated with the OPLL subtype. A high mass occupying ratio of the OPLL was directly associated with the presence of dural penetration and high-intensity signal. In the surgical group, the rate of neurological improvement associated with an anterior approach was 58% compared with 31% for a posterior laminectomy. No complications were associated with any of the 4 types of surgical procedures. In 3 cases, symptoms had worsened at the last follow-up, with only a single case of disease progression. Laminoplasty was the only technique associated with a worse clinical outcome. There were no statistical differences (p > 0.05) between the type of surgical procedure or radiographic presentation and postoperative outcome. There was also no difference between the choice of surgical procedure performed and the number of spinal levels involved with OPLL.

Conclusions

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament can no longer be viewed as a disease of the Asian population exclusively. Since OPLL among white populations is being diagnosed more frequently, surgeons must be aware of the most appropriate surgical option. The outcomes of the various surgical treatments among the different populations with OPLL appear similar. Compared with other procedures, however, anterior decompression led to the best neurological outcomes.

### Anterior corpectomy versus posterior laminoplasty for multilevel cervical myelopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114C5JFS]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical strategy for multilevel cervical myelopathy resulting from cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) still remains controversial. There are still questions about the relative benefit and safety of direct decompression by anterior corpectomy (CORP) versus indirect decompression by posterior laminoplasty (LAMP).

Objective

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the results of anterior CORP compared with posterior LAMP for patients with multilevel cervical myelopathy.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies comparing anterior CORP with posterior LAMP for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy due to CSM or OPLL from 1990 to December 2012. An extensive search of literature was performed in Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane library. The quality of the studies was assessed according to GRADE. The following outcome measures were extracted: pre- and postoperative Japanese orthopedic association (JOA) score, neurological recovery rate (RR), surgical complications, reoperation rate, operation time and blood loss. Two reviewers independently assessed each study for quality and extracted data. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to the mean number of surgical segments.

Results

A total of 12 studies were included in this review, all of which were prospective or retrospective cohort studies with relatively low quality. The results indicated that the mean JOA score system for cervical myelopathy and the neurological RR in the CORP group were superior to those in the LAMP group when the mean surgical segments were < 3, but were similar between the two groups in the case of the mean surgical segments equal to 3 or more. There was no statistical difference in the surgical complication rate between the two groups when the mean surgical segments < 3, but were significantly higher incidences of surgical complications and complication-related reoperation in the CORP group compared with the LAMP group in the case of the mean surgical segments equal to 3 or more. Besides, the operation time in the CORP group was longer than that in the LAMP group, and the average blood loss was significantly more in the CORP group compared with the LAMP group.

Conclusion

Based on the results above, anterior CORP and fusion is recommended for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy when the involved surgical segments were < 3. Given the higher rates of surgical complications and complication-related reoperation and the higher surgical trauma associated with multilevel CORP, however, it is suggested that posterior LAMP may be the preferred method of treatment for multilevel cervical myelopathy when the involved surgical segments were equal to 3 or more. In addition, taking the limitations of this study into consideration, it was still not appropriate to draw a strong conclusion claiming superiority for CORP or LAMP. A well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trial is necessary to provide objective data on the clinical results of both procedures.

### Conservatively treated ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament increases the risk of spinal cord injury: a nationwide cohort study [^117E62Bz]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) depends on symptoms and is uncertain. Whether the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increased in patients with cervical spinal stenosis or myelopathy caused by OPLL remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of SCI in patients with OPLL of the cervical spine when managed with conservative treatment (no surgery). Study subjects were identified from a nationwide cohort of 26,544,883 people from 1998 to 2005 and were divided into the OPLL group (n = 265), who were hospitalized for OPLL but had conservative treatment (no surgery), and the comparison group (n = 5339), composed of age- and sex-matched people. Until the end of 2008, a total of 5604 subjects were followed-up for 34,723.5 person-years. The propensity score method was used to adjust for covariates. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed. The incidence rate of cervical SCI in the OPLL group was found to be significantly higher than in the comparison group (4.81 versus 0.18 per 1000 person-years; p < 0.001). Cervical SCI was more likely to happen in the OPLL group than in the comparison group (crude hazard ratio [HR] 25.64; p < 0.001). After adjustments, the OPLL group had a 32.16-fold (p < 0.001) higher risk for cervical SCI. Disability caused by SCI had an even higher risk (HR = 110.72, adjusted HR = 104.78; p < 0.001) for the OPLL group. Therefore, cervical SCI and related disabilities are more likely to happen in OPLL patients, who should be cautioned for subsequent SCI if treated conservatively.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with neck pain associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament treated with integrative complementary and alternative medicine: a retrospective analysis and questionnaire survey [^112hS1wb]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a form of hyperostosis that can induce serious neurological disabilitiesand most commonly affects the cervical spine.OPLL symptoms include neck pain, arm pain, sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness, and bladder disturbance, with most symptoms manifesting gradually. The causes of OPLL remain unclear but are likely multifactorial, as OPLL is known to be associated with age, family history, environment, lifestyle, hormonal levels, and history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, thyroid diseases, and osteoporosis. It is more prevalent among Asians than among Europeans and Americans, and its incidence ranges from 1.9% to 4.3% in Japan, where the condition was first described.OPLL can be categorized into continuous, segmental, mixed, and local types. A Korean study involving 3240 adults reported an incidence of approximately 4.6% for OPLL and confirmed that it was more common among men and adults aged ≥ 70 years.

OPLL treatments include conservative and surgical approaches. Surgical treatment is performed for cases of severe myelopathy caused by OPLL. The decision to perform surgery and the choice of surgical technique are determined depending on the symptom severity, patient's status, surgeon's experience, spinal curvature, presence of the K-line, and the size, level, and type of OPLL. On the other hand, conservative treatments for OPLL include fixation of the affected area using braces, traction, bed rest, and physiotherapy.

Integrative Korean medicine treatment (KMT) is also performed in Korea as a form of conservative treatment for OPLL. However, relevant studies on the effectiveness of integrative KMT for OPLL are scarce. Relevant studies in literature mainly consist of case reports. The KMT described in these case reports included acupuncture, herbal medicine, moxibustion, Chuna therapy, and pharmacopuncture. Nonetheless, clinical studies, such as observational studies and randomized clinical trials, are lacking.

Considering this background, we conducted a retrospective observational study on inpatients who received treatment for neck pain caused by OPLL. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of integrative KMT for OPLL.

### Introduction… [^114bJuMF]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Neisseria meningitidis, pertussis, polio, rotavirus, rubella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, tetanus, and varicella vaccines. Doses can be administered at the minimum ages and dose intervals to facilitate completion of a series before travel; inform parents that infants and children who have not received all recommended vaccine doses might not be fully protected. Polio Polio vaccine is recommended for travelers going to countries with evidence of wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus circulating during the last 12 months and for travelers with a high risk for exposure to someone with imported WPV infection when traveling to some countries that border areas with WPV circulation. Current polio vaccine recommendations are available on the CDC Travelers' Health website destination pages. Infants and children should complete as much of the recommended, age-appropriate polio vaccine series as possible before departure, by an accelerated schedule if necessary.

See CDC's Immunization Schedules website for information about accelerated schedules. People ≥ 18 years of age traveling to areas where polio vaccine is recommended and who have received a routine series with either inactivated polio vaccine or live oral polio vaccine in childhood should receive a single lifetime booster dose of IPV before departure. Available data do not indicate the need for more than a single lifetime booster dose with IPV. Requirements for long-term travelers might apply, however, when departing from certain countries. Long-term travelers to countries with poliovirus transmission In May 2014, WHO declared the international spread of polio to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern under the authority of the International Health Regulations.

To prevent further spread of disease, WHO issued temporary polio vaccine recommendations for long-term travelers and residents departing from countries with WPV transmission or with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus types 1 or 3. Cholera is more common in persons living in or traveling to cholera-affected areas for extended periods, travelers visiting friends and relatives, healthcare professionals, and cholera outbreak response workers. In February 2022, ACIP voted to recommend the use of a single-dose, live attenuated oral cholera vaccine, CVD 103-HgR, for children and adolescents aged 2–17 years traveling to an area with active toxigenic. The advantages of the revised schedule are that it is both less expensive and easier to complete prior to travel.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: current state of the art and future directions [^113wZE74]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Narrative overview of the focus issue on cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Objective

To provide an introduction to this special focus issue of Spine journal that deals with CSM.

Summary Of Background Data

CSM is a progressive spine disease and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction worldwide. The shift in population demographics in many parts of the world has motivated the development of this focus issue. With the overall aging of the population, we can predict that global health care systems will be confronted with an increase in patients presenting with degenerative spine changes and various stages of cervical myelopathy.

Methods

The articles in this issue vary in their methods-there are systematic reviews, narrative reviews, a study protocol, and 2 primary research articles.

Results

A summary of the findings of each article is provided as a table within this introduction.

Conclusion

By way of this issue, we have summarized current knowledge gaps and limitations in the evidence to provide direction for future research and investigation. These include the need for a unified nomenclature for referring to CSM, the need to specify the incidence of myelopathy and the prevalence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the need to explore both the safety and efficacy of neuroprotective and neuroreparative pharmacological strategies. Further work is also required to optimize the management of patients with minimal symptoms.

### Radiographic characterization of OPLL progression in patients receiving laminoplasty with a minimum of two-years follow-up [^114jpSqK]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a cause of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) that is particularly common in East Asian countries, with a population prevalence of 0.4 to 3.0%. OPLL most often affects the C4 to C6 cervical levels, whilst classification is according to radiographic findings and includes continuous, mixed, segmental, and localized subtypes. Continuous and mixed OPLL have been shown to be associated with higher rates of progression. The exact pathogenesis of OPLL is unclear but suggested to be secondary to both genetic and environmental factors. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of collagen genes have been implicated in pathogenesis whilst dysfunction of human nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPPS) is proposed to exacerbate tissue calcification. In addition to genetic factors, mechanical stress is a risk factor.

The current standard of care in the treatment of OPLL with neurological impairment is to offer surgical decompression. Direct anterior decompression may be more difficult to achieve when the ossified segment lies posterior to the vertebral body thereby requiring a corpectomy, and as adhesions between the OPLL and ventral dura increases the risk of dural tear and CSF leak. Therefore, when cervical spine alignment is favourable, indirect decompression via a posterior approach is may be preferred particularly in multilevel and/or congenital canal stenosis. For both anterior and posterior approaches, there is the concern that OPLL progression following surgery could lead to recurrence of compression followed by neurological deterioration.

With regards to posterior cervical surgery for OPLL, a recent meta-analysis of laminoplasty in comparison to laminectomy and fusion demonstrated similar neurological outcomes and range of motion after surgery. Shorter operation time and less blood loss was demonstrable following laminoplasty whilst cervical lordotic angle was higher following fusion. It has been reported that up to 70% of patients exhibit progression of OPLL following laminoplasty due to sparing of cervical motion. Nevertheless, recommending laminectomy and fusion when OPLL is treated via a posterior approach remains controversial as some authors have conversely demonstrate increased ossification following fusion, the clinical significance of post-operative OPLL progression remains conflicting, and outcomes at 2-years following laminoplasty remain good in spite of OPLL progression. An additional issue that remains unknown is how OPLL progression differs by cervical level, which has implications on surgical approach, planning, and execution. To address these issues, this study investigated the rates of radiological OPLL progression according to cervical level in patients receiving laminoplasty, with an average post-operative follow-up period exceeding 6-years.

### 540 ° cervical realignment procedure for extensive cervical OPLL with kyphotic deformity [^114xz6zB]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to present a novel, two-stage [posterior and anterior-posterior (P-AP) 540°] procedure for extensive cervical ossification of the longitudinal ligament (OPLL) with kyphotic deformity.

Summary Of Background Data

The optimal surgical strategy for extensive cervical OPLL remains a controversial issue. Neurological injury and dural defect are complications of anterior surgery, while a posterior surgery can lead to poor clinical outcomes related to incomplete decompression.

Methods

We analyzed consecutive cases of patients who underwent procedure described herein, which consists of two stages: the first (P: laminectomy and facet release with segmental screw fixations without rod assembly) and the second 1 week later (AP: multilevel anterior cervical discectomy with fusions (ACDFs) at the apex of the deformity without decompression, placement of lordotic grafts, and posterior fusion). To assess the radiographic parameters, extent of OPLL, maximal canal occupying ratio (%), the distances from the maximal compression to the K-line, and C2–7 angle were analyzed. Clinically, we analyzed visual analog scale of neck and arm pain, neck disability index (NDI), Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and complications.

Results

A total of 18 patients were enrolled (M:F = 15:3, mean age 64.5 yrs, mean follow-up was 30 months). The mean extent of the OPLL was 3.8 vertebral body levels. Posterior fusion was performed on a mean 4.5 segments and anterior fusion was on a mean 2.4 segments. The mean C2–7 Cobb angle was improved from 10.5° to -12.2° at follow-up. The K-line distance to the maximal compression and canal occupying ratio were improved from -3.3mm, 73.5% to 3.8mm, 38.4%, respectively. Preoperative NDI and JOA scores were significantly improved (18.5 to 9.4 and 8.2 to 14.8) at the last follow-up.

Conclusion

The 540° P-AP procedure could provide safe decompression, cervical realignment, and favorable outcomes without the disadvantages of the conventional anterior and/or posterior surgery for extensive cervical OPLL with kyphotic deformity.

### Surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a consensus statement [^1113JsPS]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), including cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, presents a heterogeneous set of variables reflecting its complex nature. Multiple studies in the past have attempted to elucidate an ideal surgical algorithm that surgeons may use when treating these patients, unfortunately all studies to date, including the rigorous systematic review used in this focus issue, have fallen short in identifying a superior approach when addressing DCM. Likely because of a superior approach being nonexistent because there are multiple pathoanatomical considerations. In addition to the multitude of variables that spine surgeons face when deciding the treatment options for patients with DCM, the previous studies that have been published, unfortunately, lack in consistent outcome and complication reporting. Therefore, synthesizing a treatment algorithm remains difficult, however, the articles in this focus issue use the GRADE system to assess the overall quality (strength) of available evidence and, where appropriate, formulate evidence-based recommendations. Factors that should be included in surgical decision making are the sagittal alignment, anatomical location of the compressive pathology, number of levels of compression, presence of absence or instability or subluxation, the type compressive pathology (e.g., spondylosis vs. ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament), neck anatomy, bone quality, and surgeon experience or preference. Fortunately, as reviewed in the accompanying articles, a number of excellent surgical options exist that can be selected on the basis of the aforementioned pathoanatomical considerations.

### Surgical management of cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: natural history and the role of surgical decompression and stabilization [^111ffNW4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a complex multifactorial disease process combining both metabolic and biomechanical factors. The role for surgical intervention and choice of anterior or posterior approach is controversial. The object of this study was to review the literature and present a single-institution experience with surgical intervention for OPLL.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective review of their institutional experience with surgical intervention for cervical OPLL. They also reviewed the English-language literature regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and surgical intervention for OPLL.

Results

Review of the literature suggests an improved benefit for anterior decompression and stabilization or posterior decompression and stabilization compared with posterior decompression via laminectomy or laminoplasty. Both anterior and posterior approaches are safe and effective means of decompression of cervical stenosis in the setting of OPLL.

Conclusions

Anterior cervical decompression and reconstruction is a safe and appropriate treatment for cervical spondylitic myelopathy in the setting of OPLL. For patients with maintained cervical lordosis, posterior cervical decompression and stabilization is advocated. The use of laminectomy or laminoplasty is indicated in patients with preserved cervical lordosis and less than 60% of the spinal canal occupied by calcified ligament in a "hill-shaped" contour.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^116ZabGE]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design.

Retrospective analysis.

Objective.

To develop a nomogram to predict the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) after surgery, identify potential risk factors, and provide a theoretical basis for preventing postoperative ossification progression.

Summary of Background Data.

OPLL is a degenerative condition prevalent in Asian populations, leading to spinal cord and nerve root compression. While surgery is the primary treatment, postoperative ossification progression, particularly after posterior surgeries, remains a challenge, potentially requiring reoperation. Current methods for predicting risk factors rely on clinical experience, highlighting the need for a multidimensional prediction model to identify at-risk patients and improve outcomes.

Materials and Methods.

This retrospective study analyzed 271 patients who underwent posterior cervical spine surgery for OPLL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors for postoperative ossification progression. A nomogram was constructed based on these factors. The model's performance was evaluated using the C-index, ROC curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA), with validation conducted using data from a separate group.

Results.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four independent risk factors for ossification progression after OPLL. A nomogram was subsequently constructed based on these factors. The C-index values in both the training and validation groups demonstrated high accuracy and stability of the model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicated excellent discriminative ability, while the calibration curves showed high agreement between predicted and observed outcomes in both groups. The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram provided the highest net clinical benefit within a probability threshold range 0.01 to 1.

Conclusion.

Younger patients with OPLL, greater initial ossification thickness, more than three affected levels, or continuous/mixed ossification types are at higher risk of postoperative progression. The nomogram provides clinicians with an effective tool to predict and prevent postoperative ossification progression.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with neck pain associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament treated with integrative complementary and alternative medicine: a retrospective analysis and questionnaire survey [^113eG764]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Integrative Korean medicine treatment (KMT) is a conservative treatment approach for the ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in Korea; nonetheless, relevant studies focusing on KMT for OPLL are lacking. A multicenter retrospective analysis of patient medical records and a questionnaire survey were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of integrative KMT in patients with OPLL treated for neck pain.

Patients and Methods

A total of 78 inpatients radiologically diagnosed with OPLL and treated for neck pain at four Korean medicine hospitals from April 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, were enrolled. The primary index was an improvement in the numeric rating scale (NRS) score for neck pain, whereas the secondary outcome indices were improvements in the NRS score for arm pain, neck disability index (NDI) score, and EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) score.

Results

At discharge, the NRS score for neck pain, NRS score for arm pain, and NDI score decreased by 2.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] −2.81 to −2.14), 1.32 (95% CI, −1.73 to −0.91), and 16.02 (95% CI, −18.89 to −13.15), respectively, as compared with the scores at admission (p < 0.001). The EQ-5D-5L score increased by 0.12 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.16) as compared with the score at admission (p < 0.001). This trend was also evident during follow-up. With respect to Patient Global Impression of Change evaluation, 33 (61.1%) patients claimed to have very much improved, whereas 17 (31.5%) patients reported to have much improved.

Conclusion

Inpatients with OPLL who received integrative KMT showed improvements in neck pain, arm pain, the NDI, and quality of life, which were retained throughout the follow-up period.

### Risk of spinal cord injury in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament: a national cohort study [^112Tg2g4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to estimate the risk of spinal cord injury (SCI) in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) with and without ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Also, the study compared the incidence rates of SCI in patients who were managed surgically and conservatively. METHODS This retrospective cohort study covering 15 years analyzed the incidence of SCI in patients with CSM. All patients, identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database, were hospitalized with the diagnosis of CSM and followed up during the study period. These patients with CSM were categorized into 4 groups according to whether they had OPLL or not and whether they received surgery or not: 1) surgically managed CSM without OPLL; 2) conservatively managed CSM without OPLL; 3) surgically managed CSM with OPLL; and 4) conservatively managed CSM with OPLL. The incidence rates of subsequent SCI in each group during follow-up were then compared. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to compare the risk of SCI between the groups. RESULTS Between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2013, there were 17,258 patients with CSM who were followed up for 89,003.78 person-years. The overall incidence of SCI in these patients with CSM was 2.022 per 1000 person-years. Patients who had CSM with OPLL and were conservatively managed had the highest incidence of SCI, at 4.11 per 1000 person-years. Patients who had CSM with OPLL and were surgically managed had a lower incidence of SCI, at 3.69 per 1000 person-years. Patients who had CSM without OPLL and were conservatively managed had an even lower incidence of SCI, at 2.41 per 1000 person-years. Patients who had CSM without OPLL and were surgically managed had the lowest incidence of SCI, at 1.31 per 1000 person-years. The Cox regression model demonstrated that SCIs are significantly more likely to happen in male patients and in those with OPLL (HR 2.00 and 2.24, p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). Surgery could significantly lower the risk for approximately 50% of patients (HR 0.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients with CSM had an overall incidence rate of SCI at approximately 0.2% per year. Male sex, the coexistence of OPLL, and conservative management are twice as likely to be associated with subsequent SCI. Surgery is therefore suggested for male patients with CSM who also have OPLL.

### Surgical treatment for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine [^117WdtZe]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Although classically associated with patients of East Asian origin, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) may cause myelopathy in patients of any ethnic origin. Degeneration of the PLL is followed by endochondral ossification, resulting in spinal cord compression. Specific genetic polymorphisms and medical comorbidities have been implicated in the development of OPLL. Patients should be evaluated with a full history and neurologic examination, along with cervical radiographs. Advanced imaging with CT and MRI allows three-dimensional evaluation of OPLL. Minimally symptomatic patients can be treated nonsurgically, but patients with myelopathy or severe stenosis are best treated with surgical decompression. OPLL can be treated via an anterior (ie, corpectomy and fusion) or posterior (ie, laminectomy and fusion or laminoplasty) approach, or both. The optimal approach is dictated by the classification and extent of OPLL, cervical spine sagittal alignment, severity of stenosis, and history of previous surgery. Anterior surgery is associated with superior outcomes when OPLL occupies > 50% to 60% of the canal, despite increased technical difficulty and higher complication rates. Posterior surgery is technically easier and allows decompression of the entire cervical spine, but patients may experience late deterioration because of disease progression.

### Approach-related complications after decompression for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^114Cdd2W]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

The surgical management of compressive cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) can be challenging. Traditionally, approach indications for decompression of cervical spondylotic myelopathy have been used. However, the postoperative complication profile after cervical OPLL decompression is unique and may require an alternative approach paradigm. The authors review the literature on approach-related OPLL complications and suggest a management strategy for patients with single- or multiple-segment OPLL with or without greater than 50% canal stenosis.

### Surgical treatment of lumbar ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. report of two cases and description of surgical technique [^1126pezi]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2005). Low credibility.

The authors report two cases of patients with lumbar ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). One patient underwent surgery via the single posterior approach, and the other patient underwent combined anterior-posterior surgery. The authors consider the anterior approach for excision of the ossified lesion to be the most reasonable for treatment of lumbar OPLL. It is extremely important, however, to select the surgical procedure according to the individual patient's condition.

### Predictive factors affecting outcome after cervical laminoplasty [^114cTb4g]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To determine whether various preoperative factors affect patient outcome after cervical laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and/or ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical laminoplasty is a procedure designed to decompress the spinal cord by enlarging the spinal canal while preserving the lamina. Prior research has identified a variety of potential predictive factors that might affect outcomes after this procedure.

Methods

A systematic search of multiple major medical reference databases was conducted to identify studies explicitly designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative factors on patient outcome after cervical laminoplasty for CSM or OPLL. Studies specifically designed to evaluate potential predictive factors and their associations with outcome were included. Only cohort studies that used multivariate analysis, enrolled at least 20 patients, and adjusted for age as a potential confounding variable were included. JOA (Japanese Orthopaedic Association), modified JOA, and JOACMEQ-L (JOA Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire lower extremity function section) scores were the main outcome measures. Clinical recommendations and consensus statements were made through a modified Delphi approach by applying the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation)/AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) criteria.

Results

The search strategy yielded 433 citations, of which 1 prospective and 11 retrospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the strength of evidence from the 12 studies is low or insufficient for most of the predictive factors. Increased age was not associated with poorer JOA outcomes for patients with CSM, but there is insufficient evidence to make a conclusion for patients with OPLL. Increased severity of disease and a longer duration of symptoms might be associated with JOA outcomes for patients with CSM. Hill-shaped lesions might be associated with poorer JOA outcomes for patients with OPLL. There is insufficient evidence to permit conclusions regarding other predictive factors.

Conclusion

Overall, the strength of evidence for all of the predictive factors was insufficient or low. Given that cervical myelopathy due to CSM tends to be progressive and that increased severity of myelopathy and duration of symptoms might be associated with poorer outcomes after cervical laminoplasty for CSM, it is preferable to perform laminoplasty in patients with CSM earlier rather than waiting for symptoms to get worse. Further research is needed to more clearly identify predictive factors that affect outcomes after cervical laminoplasty because there were relatively few studies identified that used multivariate analyses to control for confounding factors and many of these studies did not provide a detailed description of the multivariate analyses or the magnitude of effect estimates. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation 1

For patients with CSM, increased age is not a strong predictor of clinical neurological outcomes after laminoplasty; therefore, age by itself should not preclude cervical laminoplasty for CSM.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong.

Recommendation 2

For patients with CSM, increased severity of disease and a longer duration of symptoms might be associated with poorer clinical neurological outcomes after laminoplasty; therefore, we recommend that patients be informed about this.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: For patients with OPLL, hill-shaped lesions might be associated with poorer clinical neurological outcomes after laminoplasty; therefore, surgeons might consider potential benefits and risks of alternative or additional surgery.

### Anterior cervical V-slot decompression and fusion for long-segment cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a follow-up study [^112PoeWY]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

General information

This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee (KLL-2022–551), and all patients provided informed consent.

Inclusion criteria: (1) Diagnosis of multilevel (≥ 2 segments) cervical OPLL; (2) Clinical symptoms consistent with imaging findings; (3) Progressive worsening of spinal cord compression symptoms; (4) Minimum follow-up of 12 months. Exclusion criteria: (1) Previous surgery at the target segments; (2) Concurrent intraspinal tumors, cervical infections, or intramedullary lesions; (3) Severe osteoporosis; (4) Localized OPLL; (5) Chronic underlying diseases incompatible with anesthesia. Based on these criteria, 30 patients treated between December 2021 and March 2024 were enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients

Surgical design and technique

The patient was placed in a supine position with the neck slightly rotated to one side. General anesthesia was administered via oral or nasal intubation, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was implemented. After localizing the target segment using C-arm fluoroscopy, a transverse or longitudinal incision was made in the anterior neck. The visceral and vascular sheaths were carefully separated to expose the target vertebral bodies and intervertebral spaces.

Under microscopic assistance, the anterior intervertebral disc tissue was first resected and gradually deepened. A curved high-speed burr was then used to remove the OPLL at the posterior aspect of the disc space until it was thinned into a sheet-like structure (Fig. 1 a). The lateral extent of resection was confined to the ossification margins. At regions with minimal spinal cord compression (typically located on both sides of the spinal cord, as confirmed preoperatively) a small hole was carefully drilled using the curved high-speed burr to avoid drill displacement and potential spinal cord injury (Fig. 1 b). Subsequently, Rongeurs were used to gradually remove the remaining thin ossified fragments at the segment until the dura mater was exposed, indicating that sufficient decompression of that intervertebral space had been achieved.

### Acute quadriplegia following closed traction reduction of a cervical facet dislocation in the setting of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: case report [^114mW3mB]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of acute quadriplegia resulting from closed traction reduction of traumatic bilateral cervical facet dislocation in a 54-year-old male with concomitant ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Objectives

To report an unusual presentation of a spinal cord injury, examine the approach to reversal of the injury, and review the treatment and management controversies of acute cervical facet dislocations in specific patient subgroups.

Summary Of Background Data

The treatment of acute cervical facet dislocations is an area of ongoing controversy, especially regarding the question of the necessity of advanced imaging studies before closed traction reduction of the dislocated cervical spine. The safety of an immediate closed, traction reduction of the cervical spine in awake, alert, cooperative, and appropriately select patients has been reported in several studies. To date, there have been no permanent neurologic deficits resulting from awake, closed reduction reported in the literature. A case of temporary, acute quadriplegia with complete neurologic recovery following successful closed traction reduction of a bilateral cervical facet dislocation in the setting of OPLL is presented.

Methods

The clinical neurologic examination, radiographic, and advanced imaging studies before and after closed, traction reduction of a cervical facet dislocation are evaluated and discussed. A review of the literature regarding the treatment of acute cervical facet dislocations is presented.

Results

Radiographs showed approximately 50% subluxation of the fifth on the sixth cervical vertebrae, along with computerized tomography revealing extensive discontinuous OPLL. The cervical facet dislocation was successfully reduced with an awake, closed traction reduction, before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation. The patient subsequently had acute quadriplegia develop, with the ensuing MRI study illustrating severe spinal stenosis at the C5, C6 level as a result of OPLL or a large extruded disc herniation. Following an immediate anterior decompression and a posterior stabilization procedure, the patient regained full motor and sensory function.

Conclusions

This case report highlights the advantages and shows some safety concerns regarding immediate, closed traction reduction of cervical facet dislocation with real-time neural monitoring in an awake, alert, oriented, and appropriately select patient before MRI studies in the setting of preexisting central stenosis from OPLL.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: genetics and pathophysiology [^1154ZEM7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a disease of progressive ectopic calcification of the PLL of the spine. It occurs most frequently in the cervical spine, followed by the thoracic spine. The disease was first described in the Japanese population, and the prevalence of OPLL is highest in Japan at a rate of 1.9%-4.3%. Note, however, that OPLL is also seen and is a known cause of cervical myelopathy in other Asian countries and in the white population. Research into the underlying cause of OPLL over the past few decades has shown that it is a multifactorial disease with significant genetic involvement. Genetic studies of OPLL have revealed several gene loci that may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Genes encoding for proteins that process extracellular inorganic phosphate, collagen fibrils, and transcription factors involved in osteoblast and chondrocyte development and differentiation have all been implicated in the pathophysiology of OPLL. In this paper, the authors review current understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of OPLL.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a Chilean population: a CT-based prevalence study in patients aged 60 years and older [^112WWmXC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this study is the first to report OPLL prevalence in a Latin American country and the first conducted outside East Asia using this methodology. The prevalence of OPLL is consistent with non-Asian populations in the United States and lower than the prevalence described in East-Asian countries. Given the effect of ethnic background on OPLL prevalence, our study contributes to a better understanding of this disorder, especially in the Western hemisphere.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSpine international study on 479 patients [^114kPwce]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently, the global population is experiencing a shift in its age structure. According to the WHO, the proportion of the population over 60 years of age is projected to double from 11% in 2010 to 22% in 2050. With this ageing of the population, clinicians worldwide will be required to manage an increasing number of spinal disorders related to advancing age, including degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

DCM is a progressive, degenerative spine disease and the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. It is caused by age-related alterations to the spinal axis including (1) degeneration of the facet joints, intervertebral discs and/or vertebral bodies; (2) hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum; and (3) ossification of the longitudinal ligament (OPLL), all of which may chronically compress the spinal cord. Of patients with evidence of spinal degeneration, approximately one-quarter will develop symptoms of neurological impairment due to mechanical compression of the neural elements.

When patients present with symptomatic myelopathy, surgery is effective at halting further deterioration and improving neurological outcomes, functional status and quality of life. However, there is controversy regarding whether surgical decompression is equally effective and safe in elderly patients as it is in younger patients. Several studies to date have identified age as a significant predictor of surgical outcome, including the recent prospective multicenter AOSpine CSM-North America and CSM-International studies. In general, older patients have reduced recovery potential following surgery due to comorbidities, diminished physiological reserves and age-related changes to the spinal cord, including a decrease in the number of myelinated fibres in the corticospinal tracts and posterior funiculus. Furthermore, the elderly are likely to have more substantial degenerative pathology and may require a more complex surgery.

There are several methodological limitations and knowledge gaps in the current body of literature. These include (1) a lack of multicentre prospective studies with large sample sizes; (2) insufficient evidence reporting the association between age and quality of life (QOL) outcomes such as the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); and (3) a lack of statistical analyses appropriately adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and surgical factors.

### Long-term impacts of different posterior operations on curvature, neurological recovery and axial symptoms for multilevel cervical degenerative myelopathy [^112hUcQF]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Patient population

A total of 147 patients with multilevel CSM who had undergone different cervical posterior operations at our medical center were reviewed retrospectively from January 2000 to January 2005. Of the 147 patients, only 98 patients (68 men and 30 women) were eligible for final analysis in this study, while the rest 49 patients were excluded from the study because of the following reasons: suffering from diseases that had an adverse effect on the results (24 patients), radiological data incompletion (13 patients), loss to follow-up (10 patients) and death (2 patients). The patients' age at the time of surgery ranged from 40 to 75 years (average 56.3 years), and the follow-up periods ranged from 7 to 12 years (average, 9.17 years). All data regarding age, gender, decompressed levels, preoperative symptoms and follow-up period were reviewed and statistically analyzed (Table 1).

Table 1
Patient characteristics

Chi square test: no statistically significant differences among the three groups

Patients considered for the study had at least ≥ 3 levels of cervical spinal cord compression with accompanying symptoms and signs of cervical disk herniation, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spinal canal stenosis or segmental-type ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Exclusion criteria included cases with cervical trauma or continuous-type OPLL, cases with significant cervical anatomic deformity, active infection, and neoplasm, cases whose preoperative or final follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plain radiographs were not complete or interpretable because of motion/metal artifacts or poor quality, and the patients who had dropped out from the study during the follow-up periods.

All patients were classified into three groups based on the different posterior surgical managements. Patients in group LP consisted of 36 cases, with a mean age of 57.1 years (range 42–75 years) who underwent expansive open-door laminoplasty. Patients in group LC consisted of 30 patients, with a mean age of 56.2 years (range 43–74 years) who underwent laminectomy. Patients in group LC + Screw (LCS) included 32 patients, with a mean age of 55.9 years (range 40–72 years) who underwent laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation. This study was approved by the Investigational Review Board at our institution, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

### Genetics and heritability of cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: results of a systematic review [^111xr9FM]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To answer the following 3 clinical questions: (1) What is the evidence supporting a heritable predisposition for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)? (2) What specific genetic polymorphisms have been associated with CSM and OPLL? (3) What is the evidence supporting a genetic basis for predicting postoperative outcomes for patients with CSM and OPLL?

Summary Of Background Data

OPLL and CSM are thought to be multifactorial conditions resulting from a combination of environmental and genetic factors.

Methods

A systematic review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published between 1980 and November 7, 2012. The strength of evidence was determined by 2 independent reviewers using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for studies addressing the first question of heritability and using the criteria set forth by the HuGENet Working Group in the Venice Interim Guidelines to address the last 2 questions of genetic association.

Results

Of the 118 citations identified through the initial literature search, a total of 23 articles remained after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The 3 family association studies related to question 1 supported the principle of an inherited predisposition to CSM and OPLL; however, the strength of evidence supporting these findings was low. Within the 19 case-control studies related to question 2, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (COL6A1/Intron 32(-29) and COL11A2/Intron 6(-4)) were observed at higher frequencies in OPLL cases than in controls in more than 1 study and may be associated with its development. There was insufficient evidence to support an association between CSM and any specific single nucleotide polymorphism or haplotype or to support the association of specific gene alleles with postoperative CSM outcomes.

Conclusion

Existing family studies provide support for the principle of an inherited predisposition to CSM and OPLL. Multiple studies support the association of 2 collagen gene related single nucleotide polymorphisms with OPLL; however, there is insufficient evidence to support the association between CSM and any genetic polymorphism or to support a genetic predictor of surgical outcome. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: STATEMENT 1: Existing family studies provide support for the principle of an inherited predisposition to CSM and OPLL. STATEMENT 2: Two SNPs related to the collagen 6A1 gene (COL6A1/Intron 32(-29)) and the collagen 11A2 gene (COL11A2/Intron 6(-4)) have been associated with OPLL in multiple studies and may be associated with its development. STATEMENT 3: No statement can be made from the literature regarding the association of specific SNPs or haplotypes with CSM. STATEMENT 4: No statement can be made from the literature regarding genetic predictors of surgical outcome in the context of OPLL or CSM.

### Is surgery indicated for asymptomatic or mildly myelopathic patients with significant ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament? [^112YBLu9]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review article.

Objective

To discuss indications and timing of surgery for patients with significant ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) who show no or only mild myelopathic symptoms.

Summary Of Background Data

Among patients with cervical spinal cord injury, the incidence of patients with OPLL is relatively high, and most had no obvious symptoms of cervical myelopathy.

Methods

These topics were discussed on the basis of clinical practice guidelines for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament as published in 2005 by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association and the Committee on Research into OPLL under the auspices of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

Results

No evidence supports the usefulness of surgery for patients with significant OPLL without or with only mild cervical myelopathy.

Conclusion

"Prophylactic" surgery for patients with significant OPLL without or with only mild cervical myelopathy cannot be recommended on the basis of the existing evidence.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^113sxdsS]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Establishment and Validation of an Interactive Risk Prediction Model for Postoperative Progression of OPLL

On the basis of the four independent risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression, a dynamic interactive nomogram was developed to predict the risk of ossification progression after surgery. As shown in Figure 3, patient No. 13 from the modeling group was selected to demonstrate the interactive prediction model. The patient was 52 years old, with an initial posterior longitudinal ligament ossification thickness of 6.3 mm, ossification involving more than three segments, and classified as a continuous type. According to the prediction model, the patient's total score was 2.53, with a predicted probability of postoperative ossification progression of 0.813. The model indicated that this patient had a high risk of postoperative ossification progression, which was consistent with the patient's actual outcome. The user guide is available in Appendix, Supplemental Digital Content 1.

### Laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical degenerative myelopathy [^117GaUT2]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to examine the efficacy of cervical laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Methods

The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to cervical laminectomy, fusion, and CSM. Abstracts were reviewed, after which studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Class I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations which contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer-review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Results

Cervical laminectomy with fusion (arthrodesis) improves functional outcome in patients with CSM and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Functional improvement is similar to laminectomy or laminoplasty for patients with CSM and OPLL. In contrast to laminectomy, cervical laminectomy with fusion it is not associated with late deformity (Class III).

Conclusions

Laminectomy with fusion (arthrodesis) is an effective strategy to improve functional outcome in CSM and OPLL.

### Cervical laminoplasty for the treatment of cervical degenerative myelopathy [^115kU47j]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to examine the efficacy of cervical laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Methods

The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to cervical laminoplasty and CSM. Abstracts were reviewed and studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Results

Cervical laminoplasty has improved functional outcome in the setting of CSM or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale score, approximately 55–60% average recovery rate has been observed (Class III). The functional improvement observed after laminoplasty may be limited by duration of symptoms, severity of stenosis, severity of myelopathy, and poorly controlled diabetes as negative risk factors (Class II). There is conflicting evidence regarding age, with 1 study citing it as a negative risk factor, and another not demonstrating this result.

Conclusions

Cervical laminoplasty is recommended for the treatment of CSM or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (Class III).

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the cervical spine: an 11-year comprehensive national epidemiology study [^112bvZph]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

This study aimed to calculate the incidence and prevalence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the cervical spine with its comorbid disability.

Methods

Using an 11-year nationwide database in Taiwan (National Health Insurance Research Database), this retrospective study cohort analyzed the incidences of cervical OPLL causing hospitalization. All patients admitted for the diagnosis of OPLL, regardless of surgery, were identified. Age- and sex-specific incidences, Poisson regression, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted.

Results

Between 1997 and 2007 covering 241,800,725.8 person-years, 1651 patients were admitted for OPLL. The overall incidence of OPLL-related admission was 6.1 per 1 million person-years. Specifically, male sex and older age were associated with higher OPLL incidences (both p < 0.001). Among the 1651 OPLL patients, 542 (32.8%) received conservative management, 612 (37.1%) had anterior only surgery, 353 (21.4%) had posterior only surgery, and 144 (8.7%) had anterior and posterior surgery. Eighty-five patients were moderately to severely disabled (5.2% cumulative incidence rate). The incidences of disability varied by age, in a decreasing trend, except for the 60- to 69-year-old age group (p = 0.05). Patients who received posterior-only surgery were more likely to have disability.

Conclusions

In a large cohort of the Chinese population, the incidence of cervical OPLL-related admission is 6.1 per 1 million person-years, and the prevalence rate is 7.7 per 100,000 person-years. Higher incidences are observed in elderly and male patients, which implies the disease's degenerative nature. After adjustments for demographics, the incidences and trends of OPLL-related comorbid disability are associated with age and surgical approaches.

### Radiographic characterization of OPLL progression in patients receiving laminoplasty with a minimum of two-years follow-up [^113d9LW1]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient recruitment and follow-up

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of our institution and conducted according to the principles detailed in the Preferred Reporting Of CasE Series in Surgery (PROCESS) Guidelines. We identified patients with DCM and radiological evidence of cervical canal narrowing due to OPLL who had undergone cervical laminoplasty between 1 November 2009 and 31 September 2019 at an academic spinal unit. At our centre, we favour laminoplasty for indirect decompression in patients with cervical OPLL and a stable lordotic cervical spine. Our rationale for favouring laminoplasty over laminectomy and posterior fusion is due to its motion-sparing nature and non-inferior clinical outcomes together with lower risk of C5 palsy. Open door laminoplasties were performed as previously described, with a full-thickness trough made at the junction of the laminae and lateral mass on one side, and a partial-thickness trough over the contralateral side to allow for lamina opening. Upon discharge, patients were assessed at 2-weeks to review the wound condition, then at 3-months, 6-months, 12-months and yearly intervals for clinical and radiologically monitoring. We excluded patients suffering from DCM secondary to other causes, patients without radiological evidence of OPLL upon lateral cervical X-rays, patients having received previous cervical spinal operations, patients with neurological deterioration associated with traumatic cervical injury, and patients with less than 2 years of clinical and radiological follow-up. 80 patients with an operative diagnosis of ossified posterior longitudinal ligament who underwent cervical laminoplasty in the abovementioned period were identified using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. A flowchart for patient recruitment, resulting in 29 patients included for analysis, is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Flowchart for patient recruitment

Demographic data, including age at operation, gender, details of the laminoplasty procedure, pre- and post-operative neurological function (modified JOA score) and occurrence of any surgical complications (infection, hardware malposition, neurological deterioration) were retrieved from electronic medical records. Lateral cervical x-rays from pre- and post-operative periods, as well as pre-op cervical MRIs, were retrieved from the hospital picture archiving and communication system (PACS).

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^116zL8U1]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experimental Design

Multidimensional data from OPLL patients undergoing posterior cervical spine surgery were collected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation sets (7:3). Univariate logistic regression identified potential risk factors, which were further analyzed using multivariate logistic regression to determine independent factors. A dynamic nomogram was constructed and validated through C-index, ROC curve, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Flowchart illustrating the construction and validation process of the postoperative progression prediction model for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

Study Population

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with OPLL who underwent posterior cervical spine surgery in the Department of Spine Surgery at The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2018 to August 2021. The follow-up period for each patient was at least three years. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age 18 years or older; (2) patients diagnosed with OPLL through imaging who underwent either EL or posterior cervical fusion (PCF); (3) availability of complete case data and sufficient clinical information. Exclusion criteria: patients were excluded if they met any of the following conditions: (1) diagnosed with OPLL but treated conservatively; (2) patients with tumors, inflammatory diseases, or immune-related conditions; (3) incomplete or missing medical records. The diagnosis of OPLL was confirmed by two experienced spine surgeons who reconstructed axial and sagittal CT images using RadiAnt DICOM Viewer software (Medixant Co. Ltd). The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Clinical Outcomes and Definitions

OPLL progression was defined as an increase of more than 2 mm in the sagittal thickness and/or longitudinal extent of the ossified mass, based on the most commonly used criteria. Postoperative patients were divided into two groups: the OPLL-P group, for those with ossification progression, and the OPLL-N group, for those without ossification progression.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^114qTxiJ]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a degenerative disease – characterized by heterotopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots. OPLL is prevalent in Asian countries, with an average prevalence of 3.08% reported in the Chinese population. – This condition is one of the common causes of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), a syndrome characterized by progressive neurological dysfunction resulting from spinal cord compression. DCM often leads to spinal cord impingement, manifesting as neck pain, sensory disturbances, limb weakness, and, in severe cases, paralysis. The disease not only significantly impairs patients' quality of life but also imposes a substantial economic and social burden on society. Surgical treatment, primarily through anterior or posterior approaches, aims to alleviate symptoms by decompressing the spinal canal. However, posterior surgeries do not remove the ossified tissue, which can continue to grow, leading to further spinal cord compression and, in some cases, necessitating reoperation. Therefore, identifying and predicting risk factors for ossification progression after posterior cervical spine surgery is crucial for developing personalized treatment and follow-up strategies.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaCervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^114ZfMbX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic neck pain is a leading cause of disability, with nearly 50% of individuals experiencing ongoing or recurrent symptoms. Radiographs are appropriate as initial imaging for cervical or neck pain in the absence of "red flag" symptoms or if there are unchanging chronic symptoms; however, spondylotic changes are commonly identified and may result in both false-positive and false-negative findings. Noncontrast CT can be complementary to radiographs for evaluation of new or changing symptoms in the setting of prior cervical spine surgery or in the assessment of extent of ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Noncontrast MRI is usually appropriate for assessment of new or increasing radiculopathy due to improved nerve root definition. MRI without and with contrast is usually appropriate in patients with new or increasing cervical or neck pain or radiculopathy in the setting of suspected infection or known malignancy. Imaging may be appropriate; however, it is not always indicated for evaluation of cervicogenic headache without neurologic deficit. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Comparison of the outcome after anterior cervical ossified posterior longitudinal ligament en bloc resection versus posterior total laminectomy and fusion in patients with ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^117TR4j8]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal procedure for the treatment of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of anterior cervical ossified posterior longitudinal ligament en bloc resection (ACOE) with posterior laminectomy and fusion with bone graft and internal fixation (PTLF) for the surgical management of patients with this condition. Between July 2017 and July 2019, 40 patients with cervical OPLL were equally randomized to undergo surgery with an ACOE or a PTLF. The clinical and radiological results were compared between the two groups. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery rate in the ACOE group were significantly higher than those in the PTLF group during two years postoperatively, provided that the canal occupying ratio (COR) was > 50%, or the K-line was negative. There was no significant difference in JOA scores and rate of recovery between the two groups in those in whom the COR was < 50%, or the K-line was positive. There was no significant difference in the Cobb angle between C2 and C7, sagittal vertical axis, cervical range of motion (ROM), and complications between the two groups. Compared with PTLF, ACOE is a preferred surgical approach for the surgical management of patients with cervical OPLL in that it offers a better therapeutic outcome when the COR is > 50%, or the K-line is negative, and it also preserves better cervical curvature and sagittal balance. The prognosis of ACOE is similar to that of PTLE when the COR is < 50%, or the K-line is positive.

### Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy as a complication of anterior decompression and fusion for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^112vTQzA]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of bilateral phrenic nerve palsy as a complication of anterior decompression and fusion for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Objectives

To present a case of a rare and serious complication of cervical spinal surgery and to investigate its cause.

Summary Of Background Data

There have been a number of reports of phrenic nerve palsy after cardiac surgery, but the authors have found no previous description of this complication related to spinal surgery.

Methods

The authors describe the clinical presentation and management of a case of bilateral phrenic nerve palsy subsequent to the surgery for cervical OPLL. Also, the literature is reviewed concerning surgical approaches for the treatment of OPLL and the occurrence of phrenic nerve palsy subsequent to any form of therapy.

Results

Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy occurred after anterior decompression and fusion for cervical OPLL. Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy was diagnosed radiographically: postoperative chest radiograph showed bilateral laxity of the diaphragm. Movement of the bilateral diaphragm appeared 3 weeks after surgery. The patient successfully returned to normal daily life after ventilatory support for 3 months, although nocturnal oxygen support was still necessary at the latest follow-up, 3 years after surgery. The possible causes of this complication include bilateral C4 nerve root stretching, iatrogenic injury of the gray matter in the ventral horn, alteration of blood circulation related to spinal edema, or re-impingement on the spinal cord at the cranial part of the decompression site.

Conclusions

Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy occurred after anterior decompression and fusion for cervical OPLL. Bilateral phrenic nerve palsy should be kept in mind as a serious complication of spinal surgery. It should be considered when patients unexpectedly fail to wean from the ventilator after surgery.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a Chilean population: a CT-based prevalence study in patients aged 60 years and older [^115GHPzy]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is (OPLL) is a hyperostotic condition characterized by bone formation of the posterior longitudinal ligament. OPLL can lead to spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression, resulting in neurological involvement, including myelopathy, which has been well-described in Japan and other East Asian populations. The prevalence of OPLL has primarily been studied in East Asian countries, but its prevalence in Western populations remains to be elucidated. In Asian countries, the prevalence varies from 4.1% to 8.9%, - whereas in Western countries, very few studies have been conducted, with reported prevalences ranging from 1.8% to 2.5%. Interestingly, the prevalence of OPLL appears to be more closely related to ethnicity than to geographic or environmental factors, as evidenced by a study in the United States showing that the prevalence among Asian Americans was twice that of other ethnic groups in the same country. To our knowledge, no studies evaluating the prevalence of OPLL have been conducted in Latin American countries.

The first studies assessing OPLL prevalence relied on plain radiographs -; however, the diagnostic accuracy of this tool is low. Although CT scans are the benchmark imaging modality for detecting OPLL, their use in prevalence studies is limited due to the radiation exposure involved because research strategies should employ a screening tool independent of the presence of spinal symptoms. Recently, a few studies conducted in East Asian countries have used whole-body positron emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) to evaluate the prevalence of OPLL, reporting rates of 6.3% in Japan,4.1% in China, and 8.9% in South Korea. The advantage of using PET-CT is its ability to assess spinal conditions unrelated to spine symptoms, allowing for accurate imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine, in both sagittal and axial views - (Figure 1).

### Ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament: a review [^112pYk3a]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Ossification of the cervical posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) represents a continuum beginning with hypertrophy of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) followed by progressive coalescence of centers of chondrification and ossification. Early OPLL mimicking disc disease appears opposite multiple disc spaces associated with significant retrovertebral extension, helping to differentiate it from spondylosis. On computerized tomography examinations, the single- and double-layer signs indicate possible dural penetration with the increased potential for an intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula during dissection. Direct ventral resection of OPLL in patients younger than 65 years of age is optimal and includes single- or multilevel anterior corpectomy with fusion, the latter accompanied by posterior fusion. For patients older than the age of 65 years, with a well-preserved cervical lordosis, laminectomy with or without fusion and/or laminoplasty may suffice in providing indirect dorsal decompression. Patients undergoing circumferential procedures with halo devices are managed with a specific anesthetic protocol, including awake intubation and positioning with intraoperative monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, electromyography, and the option of undergoing motor evoked potential monitoring. Intubation is maintained during the 1st postoperative night. When circumferential procedures are performed intubation is always maintained during the 1st postoperative night, and fiberoptic postoperative extubation is electively performed by specifically trained anesthesiologists when deemed appropriate. Patients exhibiting three or more major risk factors are considered candidates for delayed extubation and rarely, tracheostomy. Repeated anterior surgery, operations lasting more than 10 hours, involving four or more levels (including C-2), obesity, asthma, and blood transfusions of more than 4 U (1000–1200 ml) are all considered major risk factors.

### Acute cervical spinal cord injury complicated by preexisting ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a multicenter study [^116enHPZ]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective multicenter study.

Objective

To review the clinical characteristics of traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Summary Of Background Data

Despite its potentially devastating consequences, there is a lack of information about acute cervical SCI complicated by OPLL.

Methods

This study included consecutive patients with acute traumatic cervical SCI (Frankel A, B, and C) who were admitted within 48 hours of injury to 34 spine institutions across Japan. For analysis of neurologic outcome, patients who had completed at least a 6-month follow-up were included. Neurologic improvement was defined as at least one grade conversion in Frankel grade.

Results

A total of 453 patients were identified (367 men, 86 women; mean age, 59 years). OPLL was found in 106 (23%) patients (87 men, 19 women; mean age, 66 years). Most of the patients with OPLL (94 of 106) were without bone injury, presenting with incomplete SCI. The prevalence of OPLL reached 34% in SCI without bone injury. The cause of SCI was predominantly falls (74%). Only 25% of the patients were aware of OPLL. Half of the OPLL patients reported gait disturbance before injury. Forty-eight (52%) OPLL patients without bone injury underwent surgery (median, 13.5 days after injury), mostly laminoplasty. Overall, no significant difference was noted in neurologic improvement between surgery group and conservative group. However, further stratification showed that surgery was associated with greater neurologic recovery in patients who had gait disturbance before injury (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Prevalence of OPLL among cervical SCI was alarmingly high, especially in those without bone injury. Most of cervical SCI associated with OPLL were incomplete, without bone injury, and caused predominantly by low-energy trauma. The majority of the patients were unaware of OPLL. Surgery produced better neurologic recovery in patients who had gait disturbance before injury.

### National trends and complications in the surgical management of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) [^11446axt]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective database analysis.

Objective

The aim of this study was to analyze US trends in surgical approaches for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL); and to compare US patient and hospital characteristics, length of stay, total charges, and 30-day complications by surgical approach in OPLL management.

Summary Of Background Data

A robust literature on surgical management of OPLL in East Asian countries, where OPLL has a higher prevalence, exists. However, there is a paucity of literature evaluating the surgical management of OPLL in non-Asian countries.

Methods

Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), we identified surgically treated OPLL patients from 2003 to 2014. Data on patient characteristics, surgical approaches, complications, hospital characteristics, length of stay, and hospital charges were extracted and analyzed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-squared tests were used to assess variation across categorical variables. Linear regression was used to evaluate the trend of surgical management for OPLL over the study timeframe.

Results

Five thousand two hundred twelve patients fit our inclusion criteria. The overall complication rate was 21.5%, but the highest complication rate was for patients undergoing a combined anterior-posterior decompression/fusion (44.7%). Patients undergoing a combined anterior-posterior decompression/fusion had a longer length of stay and higher total charges (P < 0.01). Overall, surgical OPLL cases significantly increased from 2003 to 2014 (336–920; P < 0.01).

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the largest study examining the surgical treatment of OPLL in a non-Asian country. OPLL surgical cases increased over the study timeframe and the overall surgical complication rate was 21.5%. The percentage of Asians or Pacific Islanders with OPLL undergoing surgical intervention was 10.8%, which is higher than the prevalence in the US population (4.9%). This suggests a potential genetic component to OPLL. Future work is warranted to determine how best to decrease the high complication rate.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a Chilean population: a CT-based prevalence study in patients aged 60 years and older [^113KCXJ8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

To determine the sample size, we assumed a condition with a 2% prevalence; using an error margin of 5% and a confidence level of 95%, the minimal sample size was calculated to be 753 patients. Statistical analyses were done using the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 (SPSS).

We tested the sample for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Prevalence was expressed as a proportion of patients, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data were described as median and range, and categorical variables as percentages. We used the Mann-Whitney test to analyze continuous variables, and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. A logistic regression analysis was done to determine the independent effect of age and sex on the presence of OPLL; the results were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Anterior cervical V-slot decompression and fusion for long-segment cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a follow-up study [^116T85rV]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

To expand the decompression range of ACDF, various modifications have been proposed. Sun et al. introduced anterior controllable ante displacement fusion (ACAF), which involves partial anterior vertebral resection and anterior displacement of the posterior vertebral body and ossified posterior longitudinal ligament to enlarge the spinal canal. While ACAF extends the applicability of anterior approaches for long-segment OPLL, it remains an indirect decompression method and carries risks such as significant trauma and vascular injury. Lei et al. first proposed the concept of extended ACDF for severe localized OPLL, achieving broader decompression by resecting the posterior endplate and part of the vertebral body through the intervertebral space. Lee et al. later applied this technique to cervical spondylosis, further validating its feasibility and efficacy.

Currently, there is no optimal surgical solution for continuous or mixed-type long-segment OPLL. Building on Lei et al.'s work, we innovatively developed ACVDF. This technique combines extended ACDF to directly decompress long-segment OPLL while preserving most of the vertebral bone structure, providing stable fixation points for implants and ensuring postoperative cervical stability. This study details the surgical technique and reports clinical and radiological outcomes, offering a new reliable option for long-segment OPLL.

### Clinical and surgical predictors of complications following surgery for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy: results from the multicenter, prospective AOSpine international study of 479 patients [^111TYKbN]. Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is generally safe and effective. Nonetheless, complications occur in 11% to 38% of patients. Knowledge of important predictors of complications will help clinicians identify high-risk patients and institute prevention and management strategies.

Objective

To identify clinical and surgical predictors of perioperative complications in CSM patients.

Methods

Four hundred seventy-nine surgical CSM patients were enrolled in the prospective CSM-International study at 16 sites. A panel of physicians reviewed all adverse events and classified each as related or unrelated to surgery. Univariate analyses were performed to determine differences between patients who experienced a perioperative complication and those who did not. A complication prediction rule was developed using multiple logistic regression.

Results

Seventy-eight patients experienced 89 perioperative complications (16.25%). On univariate analysis, the major clinical risk factors were ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) (P = 0.055), number of comorbidities (P = 0.002), comorbidity score (P = 0.006), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.001), and coexisting gastrointestinal (P = 0.039) and cardiovascular (P = 0.046) disorders. Patients undergoing a 2-stage surgery (P = 0.002) and those with a longer operative duration (P = 0.001) were at greater risk of perioperative complications. A final prediction model consisted of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, P = 0.060), number of comorbidities (OR = 1.20, P = 0.069), operative duration (OR = 1.07, P = 0.002), and OPLL (OR = 1.75, P = 0.040).

Conclusion

Surgical CSM patients have a higher risk of perioperative complications if they have a greater number of comorbidities, coexisting diabetes mellitus, OPLL, and a longer operative duration. Surgeons can use this information to discuss the risks and benefits of surgery with patients, to plan case-specific preventive strategies, and to ensure appropriate management in the perioperative period.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a Chilean population: a CT-based prevalence study in patients aged 60 years and older [^117AFETS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, it relied on patients undergoing examinations with PET-CT for cancer screening, who may not represent the general population; however, obtaining CT scans in healthy subjects for research purposes would be unethical due to the radiation exposure. Moreover, OPLL is associated with specific risk factors that may not directly align with those of a cancer-screening cohort; however, this distinction reinforces the validity of our approach. Because this population is not expected to have an inherently higher prevalence of OPLL, it minimizes the risk of overestimation due to selection bias. Conversely, individual ethnicity was not recorded in our patient cohort; furthermore, because of regional and ethnic genetic heterogeneity across Latin America, our findings may not be generalizable to all Latin American populations. In addition, we lacked access to clinical or laboratory data, and thus, we could only evaluate age and sex as variables influencing the prevalence of OPLL. Also, we evaluated patients in a small age range, which may explain why age was not an independent predictor of OPLL. Finally, our study only included patients from a big tertiary care academic center in Santiago, Chile; although these patients may not represent the complete country population, our institution covers an ample range of population in our country, including those with public and private insurances.

### Conservative management of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. A review [^116v24iY]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) can result in significant myelopathy. Surgical treatment for OPLL has been extensively documented in the literature, but less data exist on conservative management of this condition.

Methods

The authors conducted a systematic review to identify all reported cases of OPLL that were conservatively managed without surgery.

Results

The review yielded 11 published studies reporting on a total of 480 patients (range per study 1–359 patients) over a mean follow-up period of 14.6 years (range 0.4–26 years). Of these 480 patients, 348 (72.5%) were without myelopathy on initial presentation, whereas 76 patients (15.8%) had signs of myelopathy; in 56 cases (15.8%), the presence of myelopathy was not specified. The mean aggregate Japanese Orthopaedic Association score on presentation for 111 patients was 15.3. Data available for 330 patients who initially presented without myelopathy showed progression to myelopathy in 55 (16.7%), whereas the other 275 (83.3%) remained progression free. In the 76 patients presenting with myelopathy, 37 (48.7%) showed clinical progression, whereas 39 (51.5%) remained clinically unchanged or improved.

Conclusions

Patients who present without myelopathy have a high chance of remaining progression free. Those who already have signs of myelopathy at presentation may benefit from surgery due to a higher rate of progression over continued follow-up.

### Multilevel cervical oblique corpectomy in the treatment of ossified posterior longitudinal ligament in the presence of ossified anterior longitudinal ligament [^117CmStU]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical study.

Objective

To highlight the value of the oblique corpectomy in managing patients with cervical myelopathy caused by extensive ossified posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) who also have a coexisting ossified anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL).

Summary Of Background Data

OPLL, OALL, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) may coexist, and the surgical treatment is varied. Patients with cervical myelopathy who are asymptomatic for the OALL may be managed by either anterior or posterior approaches, while those with dysphagia are best managed by an anterior approach that can deal with both pathologies simultaneously. The OALL resection is indicated only if symptomatic. The central corpectomy, while a good option for anterior decompression, requires complex reconstruction procedures. The oblique corpectomy preserves the ventral half of the vertebral body and does not require stabilization.

Methods

In a series of 135 patients undergoing multilevel oblique corpectomy for cervical myelopathy, 3 had OPLL with massive OALL that was asymptomatic. The OPLL was removed using microdrills while preserving the OALL. Preoperative and postoperative MR imaging assessed cord compression and spinal alignment, whereas dynamic plain roentgenography assessed stability. Patients were assessed clinically for signs of dysphagia and dysphonia.

Results

The cervical myelopathy improved in all 3 patients at a follow-up of 3 years, 1 year, and 6 months, respectively, with no development of dysphagia. One patient had a Horner's syndrome that improved by 6 months and another had a C5 radiculopathy that was improving by 6 months. Imaging showed good decompression of the spinal cord, with no kyphosis or instability.

Conclusion

The oblique corpectomy is a surgical option in patients with asymptomatic OALL in the setting of progressive myelopathy due to OPLL with intrinsic stability as a result of their OALL. This technique avoids a multilevel central corpectomy that is associated with significant instability often requiring reconstructive procedures.

### Surgical results and complications of anterior decompression and fusion as a revision surgery after initial posterior surgery for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^114PZjBd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a progressive disease. An anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) procedure for cervical OPLL is theoretically feasible, as the lesion exists anteriorly; however, such a procedure is considered technically demanding and is associated with serious complications. Cervical laminoplasty is reportedly an effective alternative procedure with few complications; it is recognized as a comparatively safe procedure, and has been widely used as an initial surgery for cervical OPLL. After posterior surgery, some patients require revision surgery because of late neurological deterioration due to kyphotic changes in cervical alignment or OPLL progression. Here, the authors retrospectively investigated the surgical results and complications of revision ACDF after initial posterior surgery for OPLL. METHODS This was a single-center, retrospective study. Between 2006 and 2013, 19 consecutive patients with cervical OPLL who underwent revision ACDF at the authors' institution after initial posterior surgery were evaluated. The mean age at the time of revision ACDF was 66 ± 7 years (± SD; range 53–78 years). The mean interval between initial posterior surgery and revision ACDF was 63 ± 53 months (range 3–235 months). RESULTS The mean follow-up period after revision ACDF was 41 ± 26 months (range 24–108 months). Before revision ACDF, the mean maximum thickness of the ossified posterior longitudinal ligament was 7.2 ± 1.5 mm (range 5–10 mm), and the mean C2–7 angle was 1.3° ± 14° (range -40° to 24°). The K-line was plus (OPLL did not exceed the K-line) in 8 patients and minus in 11 (OPLL exceeded the K-line). The mean Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved from 10 ± 3 (range 3–15) before revision ACDF to 11 ± 4 (range 4–15) at the last follow-up, and the mean improvement rate was 18% ± 18% (range 0%-60%). A total of 16 surgery-related complications developed in 12 patients (63%). The main complication was an intraoperative CSF leak in 8 patients (42%). Neurological function worsened in 5 patients (26%). The deterioration was due to spinal cord herniation through a defective dura mater in 1 patient, unidentified in 1 patient, and C-5 palsy that gradually recovered in 3 patients. Reintubation, delirium, and hoarseness were observed in 1 patient each (5%). No patient required reoperation for reconstruction failure, and all patients eventually had a solid bony fusion. CONCLUSIONS ACDF as revision surgery after initial posterior surgery for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL is associated with a high incidence of intraoperative CSF leakage and an extremely low improvement rate. The authors think that while the use of revision ACDF must be limited, it is indispensable in special cases, such as progressing myelopathy following posterior surgery due to a very large beak-type OPLL that exceeds the K-line. Postoperative OPLL progression and/or kyphotic changes can possibly cause later neurological deterioration. Fusion should be recommended at the initial surgery for many cases of cervical OPLL to prevent such a challenging revision surgery.

### Comparative analysis of outcomes and kyphotic risk factors after cervical laminoplasty in 2 different ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament groups and cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^112DzgsU]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cervical laminoplasty is commonly used to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Postoperative kyphotic changes can restrict spinal cord dorsal shift, leading to poor neurological outcomes. This study analyzes risk factors for loss of cervical lordosis (LCL) after laminoplasty in 3 groups: CSM, continuous OPLL, and other OPLL. It also evaluates postoperative changes in cervical spine parameters: C2–7 sagittal vertical axis, C2–7 Cobb angle (CA), T1 slope, and C2 slope.

Methods

This retrospective study included 154 patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty from January 2018 to January 2023. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: CSM (Group 1), continuous OPLL group (Group 2), and noncontinuous OPLL group (Group 3). Preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters were measured. Analysis of variance and Tukey HSD post hoc tests identified significant differences among the groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the cutoff value of K-line tilt.

Results

Kyphotic changes (> 10°) were observed in 18.2% of patients postoperatively: 23.8% in Group 1, 1.7% in Group 2, and 28.3% in Group 3. Significant differences were found among the groups in preoperative K-line, C2–7 CA, extension C2–7 CA, and C2 slope (P < .05). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that greater age, higher K-line tilt, lower preoperative CA-extensor CA, and lower extensor muscle volume were significant risk factors of LCL in Groups 1 and 3. In Group 2, higher preoperative K-line tilt and K-line negative status were associated with greater LCL. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that K-line tilt is a strong predictive parameter with a threshold of 15.15°.

Conclusion

The continuous OPLL group had a lower likelihood of postoperative kyphosis due to structural support. K-line tilt, dynamic extension reserve, and extensor muscle volume were significant predictors of LCL in CSM and segmental OPLL groups. K-line tilt is a valuable radiographic parameter for predicting outcomes and guiding surgical decisions in cervical laminoplasty patients.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^114FLVcz]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Application

Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the clinical utility of the prediction model. The DCA results for the nomogram predicting postoperative ossification progression are shown in Figure 5. DCA demonstrated that within a threshold probability range of 0.01 to 1, the constructed prediction model provided greater net benefit compared with the two fusion-free curves. This indicates that, in clinical practice, utilizing the nomogram to predict the risk of postoperative ossification progression and adjusting treatment and rehabilitation strategies accordingly can effectively reduce the risk of progression.

Figure 5
DCA for the nomogram predicting postoperative ossification progression in OPLL. The Y -axis represents net benefit. The red solid line indicates the predicted risk from the nomogram. The thin solid line assumes that all patients experience postoperative ossification progression, while the thick solid line assumes no patients experience progression. The decision curve shows that using the nomogram to predict postoperative ossification progression provides greater clinical benefit compared with intervening in all patients or in none.

### Clinical indicators of surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a prospective multicenter study [^111wGUPB]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A prospective multicenter study.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate patient-reported outcomes using the Japanese Orthopedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire (JOACMEQ) and clarify clinical factors that affect the therapeutic effects for patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Summary Of Background Data

Although previous studies identified factors that affected the surgical outcomes, their assessment was mainly based on the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which only includes neurological function. Investigating this pathology through multiple functions and quality of life (QOL) is pivotal to understanding the comprehensive clinical pictures of the cervical OPLL and its therapeutic outcomes.

Materials and Methods

This study was performed by the Japanese Multicenter Research Organization for Ossification of the Spinal Ligament. A total of 478 patients with myelopathy caused by cervical OPLL from 28 institutions were prospectively registered from 2014 to 2017 and followed up for 2 years. Of the patients, 168 received laminoplasties and fully completed questionnaires. Demographic information, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were grouped according to effective or ineffective surgical outcomes as defined by the JOACMEQ using logistic regression analyses.

Results

Laminoplasty resulted in functional improvement in the cervical spine and upper extremity around 40% of the patients, while QOL showed only 21.4% (P < 0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed that younger age and a postoperative decrease in arm or hand pain were correlated with significantly improved function of the upper extremities. A reduction in lower limb pain favorably affected the postoperative lower extremity function. A postoperative reduction in upper extremity pain enhanced the QOL recovery.

Conclusions

Surgeons should recognize the diversity of surgical outcomes after laminoplasty and understand the necessity of pain management even after the surgery to enhance bodily functions and QOL in patients with cervical OPLL.

### Laminectomy for cervical myelopathy [^113QqERP]. Spinal Cord (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cervical laminectomy with or without fusion, or laminoplasty, successfully address congenital or acquired stenosis, multilevel spondylosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and ossification of the yellow ligament (OYL). To optimize surgical results, however, these procedures should be applied to carefully selected patients.

Objectives

To determine the clinical, neurodiagnostic, appropriate posterior cervical approaches to be employed in patients presenting with MR- and CT-documented multilevel cervical disease. To limit perioperative morbidity, dorsal decompressions with or without fusions should be performed utilizing awake intubation and positioning and continuous intraoperative somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring.

Setting

United States of America.

Methods

The clinical, neurodiagnostic, and varied dorsal decompressive techniques employed to address pathology are reviewed. Techniques, including laminectomy, laminoforaminotomy, and laminoplasty are described. Where preoperative dynamic X-rays document instability, simultaneous fusions employing wiring or lateral mass plate/screw or rod/screw techniques may be employed. Nevertheless, careful patient selection remains one of the most critical factors to operative success as older individuals with prohibitive comorbidities or fixed long-term neurological deficits should not undergo these procedures.

Results

Short- and long-term outcomes following dorsal decompressions with or without fusions vary. Those with myelopathy over 65 years of age often do well in the short-term, but demonstrate greater long-term deterioration. Factors that correlated with greater susceptibility to deterioration include advanced age (> 70 years at the time of the first surgery), severe original myelopathy, and recent trauma.

Conclusions

Success rates of laminectomy with or without fusion, or laminoplasty may be successfully employed to address multilevel cervical pathology in a carefully selected population of patients.

### Transient paraparesis after laminectomy for thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ossification of the ligamentum flavum [^116bokKT]. Spinal Cord (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objectives

To report a case with thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF), in which postoperative paralysis occurred after laminectomy and was reversed after an additional posterior instrumented fusion.

Setting

A University Hospital in Japan.

Case Report

A 71-year-old woman, with a spastic palsy of both lower extremities, had OPLL and OLF at T10-T11, which pinched the spinal cord anteriorly and posteriorly. She underwent a laminectomy at T10-T11, and no further neurological deterioration was seen immediately after surgery. Over the next 18 h, however, myelopathy worsened, showing severe paraparesis. An additional posterior instrumented fusion at T7-L1 was performed without correction of the kyphosis. After fusion, neurological deficits gradually recovered, despite the presence of residual anterior impingement of spinal cord by the OPLL.

Conclusions

The present case provides evidence for the possibility that laminectomy alone produces postoperative paralysis for combined thoracic OPLL and OLF, and we recommend that a posterior instrumented fusion should be added when posterior decompression is performed for this disorder.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: pathogenesis, management, and current surgical approaches. A review [^112mg7e8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is an important cause of cervical myelopathy that results from bony ossification of the cervical or thoracic posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). It has been estimated that nearly 25% of patients with cervical myelopathy will have features of OPLL. Patients commonly present in their mid-40s or 50s with clinical evidence of myelopathy. On MR and CT imaging, this can be seen as areas of ossification that commonly coalesce behind the cervical vertebral bodies, leading to direct ventral compression of the cord. While MR imaging will commonly demonstrate associated changes in the soft tissue, CT scanning will better define areas of ossification. This can also provide the clinician with evidence of possible dural ossification. The surgical management of OPLL remains a challenge to spine surgeons. Surgical alternatives include anterior, posterior, or circumferential decompression and/or stabilization. Anterior cervical stabilization options include cervical corpectomy or multilevel anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion, while posterior stabilization approaches include instrumented or noninstrumented fusion or laminoplasty. Each of these approaches has distinct advantages and disadvantages. While anterior approaches may provide more direct decompression and best improve myelopathy scores, there is soft-tissue morbidity associated with the anterior approach. Posterior approaches, including laminectomy and fusion and laminoplasty, may be well tolerated in older patients. However, there often is associated axial neck pain and less improvement in myelopathy scores. In this review, the authors discuss the epidemiology, imaging findings, and clinical presentation of OPLL. The authors additionally discuss the merits of the different surgical techniques in the management of this challenging disease.

### Small extracellular vesicle-mediated miR-320e transmission promotes osteogenesis in OPLL by targeting TAK1 [^113iaLro]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Osteogenesis is a synergistic event involving various cell types, such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In OPLL, although no study has been dedicated to identifying what cell types may take part in disease development, there are studies that claim mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or the ligament cells themselves are responsible for the ossification process. From a histological perspective, the posterior longitudinal ligament is composed of layers of fibroblast-like ligament cells. During the early stages of the disease, the ligament becomes atrophied, and calcified foci begin to develop. During this time, increased blood supply around the ligament often develops. As the disease progresses, calcified foci became bony structures that are isolated from the vertebrae, exhibiting a unique "double layer" sign on computed tomography. Whether the bone formation process in the ligament occurs through endochondral ossification, extension of the existing bone, or the dystrophic calcification-bony metaplasia sequence is still under debate. However, in our previous studies, we provided evidence that OPLL patient-derived posterior longitudinal ligament cells can be differentiated into osteoblasts and are more prone to osteoblast differentiation than normal ligament cells. Nevertheless, we considered all ossification-related cells, including MSCs, ligament cells and even monocytes (osteoclast precursor cells), and examined the effect of OPLL-derived sEVs on these cells. During our research, we found that ligament cells, MSCs and monocytes are all affected by OPLL-derived sEVs during osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation in vitro, indicating that OPLL ligaments are more prone to ossification.

### Progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the thoracic spine following posterior decompression and stabilization [^111uioyT]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Despite its potential clinical impact, information regarding progression of thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is scarce. Posterior decompression with stabilization is currently the primary surgical treatment for symptomatic thoracic OPLL; however, it remains unclear whether thoracic OPLL increases in size following spinal stabilization. It is also unknown whether patients' clinical symptoms worsen as OPLL size increases. In this retrospective case series study, the authors examined the postoperative progression of thoracic OPLL.

Methods

Nine consecutive patients with thoracic OPLL who underwent posterior decompression and fixation with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included in this study. Thin-slice CT scans of the thoracic spine obtained at the time of surgery and the most recent follow-up were analyzed. The level of the most obvious protrusion of ossification was determined using the sagittal reconstructions, and the ossified area was measured on the axial reconstructed scan at the level of the most obvious protrusion of ossification using the DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) software program. Myelopathy severity was assessed according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale score for lower-limb motor function on admission, at postoperative discharge, and at the last follow-up visit.

Results

The OPLL area was increased in all patients. The mean area of ossification increased from 83.6 ± 25.3 mm² at the time of surgery to 114.8 ± 32.4 mm² at the last follow-up visit. No patients exhibited any neurological deterioration due to OPLL progression.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrated that the size of the thoracic OPLL increased after spinal stabilization. Despite diminished local spinal motion, OPLL progression did not decrease or stop. Physicians should pay attention to ossification progression in patients with thoracic OPLL.

### A new concept for making decisions regarding the surgical approach for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: the K-line [^112hTRTg]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

To report a new index, the K-line, for deciding the surgical approach for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Objective

To analyze the correlation between the K-line-based classification of cervical OPLL patients and their surgical outcome.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies showed that kyphotic alignment of the cervical spine and a large OPLL are major factors causing poor surgical outcome after laminoplasty for cervical OPLL patients. However, no report has evaluated these 2 factors in 1 parameter.

Methods

The K-line was defined as a line that connects the midpoints of the spinal canal at C2 and C7. Twenty-seven patients who had cervical OPLL and underwent posterior decompression surgery were classified into 2 groups according to their K-line classification. OPLL did not exceed the K-line in the K-line (+) group and did exceed it in the K-line (-) group. By intraoperative ultrasonography, we evaluated the posterior shift of the spinal cord after the posterior decompression procedure. The Japanese Orthopedic Association scores before surgery and 1 year after surgery were evaluated, and the recovery rate was calculated.

Results

Eight patients were classified as K-line (-), and 19 patients were classified as K-line (+). The mean recovery rate was 13.9% in the K-line (-) group and 66.0% in the K-line (+) group (P < 0.01). Ultrasonography showed that the posterior shift of the spinal cord was insufficient in the K-line (-) group.

Conclusion

The present results demonstrate that a sufficient posterior shift of the spinal cord and neurologic improvement will not be obtained after posterior decompression surgery in the K-line (-) group. Our new index, the K-line, is a simple and practical tool for making decisions regarding the surgical approach for cervical OPLL patients.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine: etiology and natural history [^1173oekb]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review article.

Objective

To review the etiology, natural history, measurement tools, and image diagnosis of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) of the cervical spine.

Summary Of Background Data

OPLL is a well-known disease that causes myelopathy. Genetic factors are very important for development of OPLL. However, the pathogenetic gene and natural history of OPLL have not been clarified.

Methods

The authors reviewed studies about the etiology, natural history, measurement tools, and diagnosis of OPLL, which had been performed by the members of the Investigation Committee on the Ossification of the Spinal Ligaments of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare.

Results

The prevalence of OPLL in the general Japanese population was reported to be 1.9% to 4.3% among people older than 30 years. Genetic factors are important for development of OPLL, and some candidate genes have been reported. Clinical course of OPLL has been clarified by a prospective long-term follow-up study. Some radiographic predictors for development of myelopathy were introduced. Image diagnosis of OPLL is easy by plain radiographs, but magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are useful to determine cord compression by OPLL.

Conclusion

OPLL should be managed on the basis of the consideration of its natural history. Elucidation of pathogenetic genes of OPLL will introduce a new approach for management of OPLL.

### Ten-year follow-up of posterior decompression and fusion surgery for thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^117JKELd]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We evaluated the clinical, functional, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes of surgical treatment of thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (T-OPLL).

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 51 patients followed for ≥ 10 years after posterior decompression and corrective fusion surgery for T-OPLL. The data collected included demographics, comorbidities, and pre- and postoperative symptoms. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, numerical rating scale (NRS) for back and leg pain, and EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) were used to assess neurological function, pain, and QoL. Imaging evaluations were conducted to assess changes in kyphotic angles and ossification progression.

Results

A significant improvement was observed in the JOA score from preoperatively (3.7) to 2 years postoperatively (7.9) (p < 0.05); the score remained stable thereafter. The mean EQ-5D-5L score improved from 0.53 preoperatively to 0.68 at 10 years postoperatively (p < 0.001). NRS scores for back and leg pain decreased from 5.4 to 3.5 and 4.0 to 3.0, respectively, from preoperatively to 10 years (p < 0.001 for both). Radiographic outcomes showed changes in kyphotic angles and ossification areas, with no significant progression after 2 years. Fourteen (27.5%) of the patients experienced postoperative complications. Of these, 8 (15.7%) required reoperation, 6 (11.8%) in the perioperative period and 2 (3.9%) later. Four (7.8%) of the patients underwent additional surgeries for conditions including lumbar spinal canal stenosis and cervical OPLL. Nonetheless, physical function in all cases with postoperative complications or additional surgery remained stable over the decade.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of T-OPLL is effective in improving neurological function, QoL, and pain management over an extended period. The long-term outcomes of T-OPLL surgery revealed that, although cervical and lumbar spinal lesions led to reoperations, they did not affect QoL, and relative improvement was maintained even after 10 years.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a review [^114KS4U2]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is most commonly found in men, the elderly, and Asian patients. There are many diseases associated with OPLL, such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other spondyloarthropathies. Several factors have been reported to be associated with OPLL formation and progression, including genetic, hormonal, environmental, and lifestyle factors. However, the pathogenesis of OPLL is still unclear. Most symptomatic patients with OPLL present with neurological deficits such as myelopathy, radiculopathy, and/or bowel and bladder symptoms. There are some reports of asymptomatic OPLL. Both static and dynamic factors are related to the development of myelopathy. Plain radiography, CT, and MR imaging are used to evaluate OPLL extension and the area of spinal cord compression. Management of OPLL continues to be controversial. Each surgical technique has some advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of operation should be made case by case, depending on the patient's condition, level of pathology, type of OPLL, and the surgeon's experience. In this paper, the authors attempt to review the incidence, pathology, pathogenesis, natural history, clinical presentation, classification, radiological evaluation, and management of OPLL.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

### Radiographic characterization of OPLL progression in patients receiving laminoplasty with a minimum of two-years follow-up [^116LhJxc]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common cause of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) in Asian populations. Characterization of OPLL progression following laminoplasty remains limited in the literature. 29 patients with OPLL received cervical laminoplasty and a minimum of 2-years follow-up. Clinical and radiological surveillance occurred at 3-months, 6-months, 12-months post-op and then at yearly intervals. Transverse (anteroposterior) diameter and sagittal length of OPLL in relation to their cervical vertebral level of localisation was assessed upon immediate post-op radiographs compared to those obtained at subsequent follow-up. OPLL progression was defined as an increase in transverse dimensions and/or length by ≥ 2 mm. The average period of clinical follow-up was 6.7 ± 3.3 years. Upon latest follow-up, 79% of patients demonstrated at least 2 mm of transverse or longitudinal progression of OPLL. This corresponded to 2-years and 5-year progression rates of 54% and 71% respectively. OPLL located over C5 demonstrated the greatest transverse progression rate at (0.24 ± 0.34 mm / year). The mean overall longitudinal progression rate was 1.61 ± 2.06 mm / year. No patients experienced neurological decline resulting from OPLL progression requiring revision decompression during the period of post-operative observation. Characterizing transverse and longitudinal progression by cervical level via radiographs has implications in surgical planning for OPLL and should be consolidated upon post-operative CT/MRI scans as well as larger sample sizes.

### Comparison of outcomes of surgical treatment for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament versus other forms of degenerative cervical myelopathy: results from the prospective, multicenter AOSpine CSM-international study of 479 patients [^113TbcAf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an all-encompassing term that includes cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), and other spinal abnormalities that cause cervical cord compression. It is unclear whether surgery is equally effective and safe for patients with OPLL as it is for those with other forms of DCM. The purpose of this study was to compare surgical outcomes of patients with OPLL and those with other forms of DCM.

Methods

Four hundred and seventy-nine patients with symptomatic DCM were prospectively enrolled in the CSM-International study at sixteen sites. Patients' functional status was evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA) and the Nurick score. Quality of life was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, including the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Short Form (SF)-36. Postoperative functional and quality-of-life outcomes were assessed at two years of follow-up, and scores were compared between patients with and without OPLL.

Results

Of 479 patients, 135 (28.2%) had radiographic evidence of OPLL, and 344 (71.8%) had other forms of DCM. The two groups did not differ significantly in demographics, surgical approach, or baseline myelopathy severity. Patients with OPLL achieved similar functional outcomes by two years following surgery compared with patients with other forms of DCM. With respect to quality of life, the NDI and most of the subscales of the SF-36 were not different between the two diagnostic groups. There was a higher risk of perioperative complications in the OPLL group (p = 0.054), although this relationship did not reach statistical significance. Rates of neurological complications did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups.

Conclusions

Surgical decompression for the treatment of OPLL resulted in improvements in functional status and quality of life comparable to those seen in patients with other forms of DCM. Patients with OPLL were at a higher risk of perioperative complications than patients with other forms of DCM.

### Effect of early vs delayed surgical treatment on motor recovery in incomplete cervical spinal cord injury with preexisting cervical stenosis: a randomized clinical trial [^113yGMGa]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that results in lifelong disability, long-term risks of medical complications, and use of health care resources. It is estimated that 18 000 new SCI cases occur annually in the United States. Over the past decades, the number of cervical SCIs associated with falls among the older adults has continued to increase, emerging as a major public health issue. Such SCIs are mostly incomplete, caused by low-energy trauma, and associated with preexisting canal stenosis due to degenerative changes or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

The timing of surgical treatment for SCI has long been an issue of intense debate. Although accumulated information from both experimental and clinical studies has exhibited the benefits of early surgical decompression, high-quality evidence to settle the argument is still limited. The superiority of early surgical decompression, especially for incomplete cervical SCI without concomitant bone injuries, has not been established, resulting in a substantial divergence in treatment choices among physicians.

To address this issue, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of early surgical treatment in patients with motor-incomplete tetraplegia associated with preexisting canal stenosis but without bone injury. The aim of this study was to determine whether early surgical decompression within 24 hours results in better motor recovery than delayed surgical treatment after at least 2 weeks of conservative treatment.

### A patient with two re-surgeries for delayed myelopathy due to progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments after cervical laminoplasty [^111pDqjd]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To discuss the development of delayed myelopathy due to the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) after cervical laminoplasty.

Summary Of Background Data

The progression of OPLL after cervical laminoplasty for the treatment of OPLL is often shown in long-term follow-up; however, few patients with reoperation due to OPLL progression have been reported.

Methods

The patient was a 70-year-old male carpenter. At 57-years of age, he underwent open door laminoplasty between C3 and C7 with dome-like laminectomy of C2 for the treatment of myelopathy due to mixed-type OPLL (continuous type at C3-C4 and segmental type at C5). Five years after the initial surgery, the disorder of skilled motor activity in the bilateral hands and ambulatory difficulties recurred as a result of cranial progression of OPLL (between C2 and C4). He underwent laminectomy and posterior fusion between C2 and C5 and returned to work. Four years after resurgery, the same symptoms recurred.

Results

CT revealed the progression of OPLL thickness at C5 level and longitudinal progression of OPLL to C6/7. Sagittal view of MRI demonstrated spinal cord compression between C5 and C6/7 because of OPLL at C5 and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Posterior fusion extending up to C7 with laminectomy of C6 and C7 was performed. His symptoms were alleviated and he could walk again.

Conclusion

We reported a patient with OPLL who had undergone resurgery twice because of myelopathy due to the progression of ossification. It was important to establish a sufficiently longitudinal and transverse decompression, taking the risk of the unexpected progression of ossification into consideration.

### Are there differences in the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament following laminoplasty versus fusion? a meta-analysis [^116qGeKy]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies for the treatment of cervical myelopathy with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) treated with laminoplasty or fusion.

Objective

To delineate whether OPLL continues to progress after laminoplasty compared with fusion and to clarify the relationship between radiological progression of OPLL and neurological decline.

Summary Of Background Data

Laminoplasty is usually performed in patients with multilevel OPLL due to the surgical morbidity of anterior surgery. However, the disadvantage of laminoplasty is that the remaining OPLL can progress after the surgery.

Methods

A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library was performed to identify investigations concerning the progression of OPLL after laminoplasty or fusion. The pooled results were analyzed by calculating the effect size based on the event rate and the logit event rate.

Results

We included data from 11 studies involving 530 patients, of whom 429 underwent laminoplasty and 101 underwent fusion surgery. The prevalence of radiological OPLL progression was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.3%-69.3%) for the laminoplasty group and 7.6% (95% CI 3.4%-15.9%) for the fusion group. The laminoplasty displayed substantially high prevalence of the progression of OPLL compared with the fusion group. In the laminoplasty group, the prevalence of OPLL progression increased with time and reached 60% at about 10-year follow-up. The prevalence for neurological decline was similar for about 2 years, 8.3% (95% CI 3.7%-17.9%) for the laminoplasty group and 3.8% (95% CI 1.3%-10.2%) for the fusion group.

Conclusion

Laminoplasty frequently induces progression of OPLL compared with fusion surgery, but does not make significant clinical deterioration. However, laminoplasty may not be recommended for OPLL patient because it can be getting worse with time.

### Clinical course of patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a minimum 10-year cohort study [^115h9bXg]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) may produce quadriplegia. The course of future neurological deterioration in patients with radiographic evidence of OPLL, however, is not known. The authors conducted a long-term follow-up cohort study of more than 10 years to clarify the clinical course of this disease progression.

Methods

A total of 450 patients, including 304 managed conservatively and 146 treated by surgery, were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent neurological and radiographical follow-up examinations for a mean of 17.6 years. Myelopathy was graded using Nurick classification and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale. Fifty-five (17%) of 323 patients without myelopathy evident at the first examination developed myelopathy during the follow-up period. Risk factors associated with the evolution of myelopathy included greater than 60% OPLL-induced stenotic compromise of the cervical canal, and increased range of motion of the cervical spine. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the myelopathy-free rate in patients without first-visit myelopathy was 71% after 30 years. A significant difference in final functional outcome was not observed between nonsurgical and surgical cases in which preoperative Nurick grades were 1 or 2. In patients with Nurick Grade 3 or 4 myelopathy, however, only 12% who underwent surgery eventually became wheelchair bound or bedridden compared with 89% of those managed conservatively. Surgery proved ineffective in the management of patients with Grade 5 disease.

Conclusions

Results of this long-term cohort study elucidated the clinical course of OPLL following conservative or surgical management. Surgery proved effective for the management of patients with Nurick Grades 3 and 4 myelopathy.

### Resection of spinous processes can cause spinal cord injury in patient with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the thoracic spine [^116YBX7P]. Spinal Cord (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To report intraoperative spinal cord injury by resection of spinous processes in a 73-year-old man with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the thoracic spine.

Methods

A 73-year-old man presented with cervicothoracic OPLL with bilateral numbness and clumsiness of his hand, weakness of his lower extremities and severe gait disturbance. His Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was 7.5 out of 17. Cervical laminoplasty (C2–6), cervicothoracic laminectomy (C7-T10) and posterior fusion (C7-T10) were performed in the prone position with electrophysiologic monitoring of the spinal cord-evoked potentials (SCEPs).

Results

The spinal processes with supra- and interspinous ligaments between C7 and T10 were resected. After resection, the amplitude of SCEP waveforms decreased rapidly to < 10% of control levels. Laminectomy was performed, and, after 80min of SCEP deterioration, an instrumented fusion with correction for kyphosis was completed. The SCEP amplitude recovered gradually. Immediately after surgery, the patient suffered severe motor loss in both lower limbs. His neurological recovery progressed gradually from 2 days after surgery, and he was able to walk at 3 months after surgery. At 6 years after surgery, the JOA score was 11.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that intraoperative spinal cord injury can occur before posterior decompression by resection of spinal processes with supra- and interspinous ligaments. The timing of the instrumented stabilization using a temporary rod is important and should be considered immediately after posterior exposure of the spine.

A case report of a 55-year-old patient with extensive cervicothoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) that was treated with posterior decompression and fusion.

Objective

To report the preventive effect of posterior instrumentation on postoperative paralysis in extensive cervicothoracic OPLL.

Summary Of Background Data

Thoracic myelopathy caused by OPLL in the thoracic spine was treated with operative decompression of the spinal cord via an anterior, posterior, or posterolateral approach. However, the lack of availability for some approaches in specific cases, as well as reports of some problems for each approach, indicates that a lack of consensus still remains regarding the choice of operative procedure.

Methods

A 55-year-old female with extensive cervicothoracic OPLL presented with progressive numbness in the both hands and a gate disturbance. Cervical laminoplasty, thoracic laminectomy, and posterior fusion were performed with electrophysiologic monitoring of the spinal cord evoked potential.

Results

After thoracic laminectomy, the amplitude of spinal cord evoked potential waveforms decreased but recovered after a posterior fusion by instrumentation.

Conclusion

Prevention of postoperative paralysis from increasing by posterior instrumentation was shown using neurophysiologic monitoring.

### Exceptional conditions for favorable neurological recovery after laminoplasty in cases with cervical myelopathy caused by K-line (-) ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^113F8BDG]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective observational study.

Objective

To clarify the exceptional conditions for a favorable neurological recovery after laminoplasty (LMP) for cervical myelopathy caused by K-line (-) ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

Summary Of Background Data

The K-line-based classification of cervical OPLL was developed to predict insufficient neurological recovery after LMP. For patients with K-line (-) OPLL, LMP generally yields the least improvement because of inadequate decompression of the spinal cord; however, there are some exceptional cases wherein LMP promotes favorable neurological recoveries.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 106 consecutive patients who underwent LMP for cervical OPLL to determine the demographic data, radiographic findings, and neurological recoveries of the patients as assessed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively by their Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores. The factors associated with favorable outcomes after LMP in patients with K-line (-) were then investigated.

Results

Of 106 total patients, 31 were classified as K-line (-), of whom 21 achieved the least neurological recovery after LMP (JOA recovery rate < 50%), while the remaining 10 patients achieved favorable outcomes (JOA recovery rate ≥ 50%). Among the K-line (-) group patients, those with ext-K-line (+), which changed to K-line (+) in the neck-extended position, and the patients with up-K-line (-), in whom the lesion responsible for myelopathy in the upper cervical spine (C3 or above), showed favorable neurological recoveries after LMP.

Conclusion

Our data shows that, even for patients with K-line (-) OPLL, a favorable neurological recovery can be expected after LMP in cases in which the OPLL is in the upper cervical spine or the K-line changes to (+) in the neck-extended position. This means that K-line-based predictions of surgical outcomes after LMP should be indicated for patients with OPLL in the middle and lower cervical spine with limited extension mobility. Level of Evidence: 4.

### Management of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the thoracic spine [^115ZhpCW]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

The management of thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament has been studied by many spinal surgeons. Indications for operative intervention include progressive radiculopathy, myelopathy, and neurological deterioration. The ideal surgery for decompression remains highly debatable as various methods of surgical treatment of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament have been devised. Although numerous modifications to the 3 main approaches have been identified (anterior, posterior, or lateral), the indication for each depends on the nature of compression, the morphology of the lesion, the level of the compression, the structural alignment of the spine, and the neurological status of the patient. The authors discuss treatment techniques for thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, cite case examples from a single institution, and review the literature.

### Does ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament progress after laminoplasty? Radiographic and clinical evidence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament lesion growth and the risk factors for late neurologic deterioration [^112SpsSr]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a disease process characterized by progressive growth and calcification resulting in spinal canal compromise and serious neurological sequelae in advanced cases. Historically, OPLL has most commonly been treated with posterior surgical decompression. Although this procedure indirectly decompresses the spinal cord, it does not address the offending pathological entity, and further growth of the lesion may result in delayed neurological deterioration. This fact is particularly relevant because a number of long-term studies have revealed both longitudinal and transverse disease progression in individuals treated both surgically and conservatively. Despite these high rates of radiographically documented progression, however, the rate of neurological decline in patients undergoing posterior surgery with laminoplasty is low. In this article, the authors review the pathophysiology of OPLL, evidence of disease progression, and outcome data addressing conservative and surgical treatments.

### Anterior cervical V-slot decompression and fusion for long-segment cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a follow-up study [^114FaFDL]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the following technical considerations require particular attention:
(1) Precision in Resection Range: The grinding drill resection must be meticulously controlled, avoiding excessive lateral extension beyond the dural sac to prevent vertebral artery or lateral nerve root injury. Over-resection in the sagittal plane may compromise cage placement and lead to cervical instability. (2) Intraoperative Neuromonitoring: Continuous neurophysiological monitoring is essential to promptly detect spinal cord traction or ischemic signals, thereby minimizing the risk of spinal cord injury. (3) Management of Dural Adhesion: In cases of dural adhesion, complete ossification removal should not be pursued at the expense of safety. A thin residual ossified fragment may be left in situ to ensure adequate decompression while reducing the risk of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and spinal cord injury.

Although this study demonstrates favorable outcomes of the presented technique for long-segment OPLL, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center retrospective analysis with a relatively small sample size (n = 30). Second, the mean follow-up Duration was 14.70 ± 1.62 months (range: 12–18), which may be insufficient to evaluate long-term efficacy, particularly regarding adjacent segment pathology. Additionally, all procedures were performed by a single surgeon, potentially introducing operator bias. Future studies should involve multicenter randomized controlled trials with larger cohorts, extended follow-up periods, and direct comparisons with alternative surgical approaches (e.g. ACCF, ACAF) to enhance the robustness of the findings.

### Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament? [^11712gkb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Object

Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p > 0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results.

Results

The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p > 0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 mL and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 mL and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p < 0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p > 0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p > 0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p > 0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Patients with CSM due to either degenerative disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological outcomes with laminoplasty. The VAS neck pain scores did not improve significantly with laminoplasty for either group. Laminoplasty may limit extension ROM.

### Anterior decompression for cervical spondylosis associated with an early form of cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^113dQYwL]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Object

The goal of this study was to determine the appropriate surgical strategy for cervical spondylosis associated with an early form of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (EOPLL) of the cervical spine.

Methods

Patients with EOPLL-associated cervical spondyosis were selected for treatment. Medical records and radiographs were retrospectively reviewed. Specimens taken at the time of operation were histologically examined. There were 24 men and six women ranging in age from 39 to 74 years (mean 57.6 years). Symptoms consisted of myelopathy in 28 cases and radiculopathy in two cases. Anterior decompressive surgery was performed. The EOPLL, hypertrophy of the posterior longitudinal ligament (HPLL), and the disc-PLL complex were directly resected. The mean preoperative Japan Orthopaedic Association score was 12.6, and the mean postoperative score was 14.4. Histologically, EOPLL was consistent with foci of compact lamellar bone in the degenerative thickening of the PLL.

Conclusions

Appropriate corpectomy should follow direct removal of EOPLL associated with HPLL compressing the spinal cord to achieve good outcomes.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^111d7x9H]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) occurs as heterotopic bone forms in the posterior longitudinal ligament, resulting in neural compression, myelopathy, and radiculopathy. OPLL is most commonly observed in East Asian populations, with prevalence rates of 1.9% to 4.3% reported in Japan. OPLL rates are lower in North American and European patients, with reported prevalence of 0.1% to 1.7%. Patients typically develop symptoms due to OPLL in their cervical spines. The etiology of OPLL is multifactorial, including genetic, metabolic, and anatomic factors. Asymptomatic or symptomatic patients with OPLL can be managed nonsurgically, whereas patients with neurologic symptoms may require surgical decompression from an anterior, posterior, or combined approach. Surgical treatment can provide notable improvement in neurologic function. Surgical decision making accounts for multiple factors, including patient comorbidities, neurologic status, disease morphology, radiographic findings, and procedure complication profiles. In this study, we review OPLL epidemiology and pathophysiology, clinical features, radiographic evaluation, management, and complications.

### Dorsal versus ventral surgery for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: considerations for approach selection and review of surgical outcomes [^112yLLF7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is a common cause of radiculopathy and myelopathy that often requires surgery to achieve decompression of the neural elements. With the evolution of surgical technique and a greater understanding of the biomechanics of cervical deformity, the criteria for selecting one approach over the other has been the subject of increased study and remains controversial. Ventral approaches typically consist of variations of the cervical corpectomy, whereas dorsal approaches include a wide range of techniques including laminoplasty, laminectomy, and laminectomy with instrumented fusion. Herein, the features and limitations of these approaches are reviewed with an emphasis on complications and outcomes.

### Anterior cervical V-slot decompression and fusion for long-segment cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a follow-up study [^1179E1DR]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

OPLL is a disorder characterized by Heterotopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, leading to spinal cord compression and neurological dysfunction. The cervical spine is one of the most affected regions. OPLL can be classified into localized, continuous, segmental, and mixed types. The reported prevalence of OPLL in individuals over 30 years old is as high as 4.3%.

The progression of cervical OPLL is irreversible, and surgical intervention still the most effective treatment. Surgical approaches are divided into anterior and posterior methods. Posterior approaches, such as cervical laminectomy and laminoplasty, offer lower operative risks and fewer complications. However, their indirect decompression effect, achieved by posterior displacement of the spinal cord, is often inferior to direct decompression via anterior approaches. In contrast, anterior approaches enable more thorough spinal cord decompression by directly removing ossified lesions, resulting in better clinical outcomes despite higher surgical risks and complication rates. Among anterior techniques, ACDF is considered the "gold standard" for cervical spondylosis due to its standardized procedure and reliable efficacy. However, its limited operative field poses challenges for addressing posterior ossified lesions. ACCF effectively removes posterior ossified lesions but requires extensive vertebral resection, increasing the risks of complications such as dural tears and implant subsidence. Moreover, reduced fixation segments may lead to biomechanical deficiencies, and compromising stability as the force arm length increases. Additionally, irreversible loss of normal intervertebral discs may accelerate cervical motion degeneration. This "efficacy-trauma" paradox highlights the need for a technique that retains the minimally invasive and biomechanical advantages of ACDF while overcoming its limitations in addressing posterior vertebral body lesions — a key scientific challenge in optimizing OPLL surgical strategies.

### Acute cervical cord injury associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^112UAfac]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) sometimes present with acute spinal cord injury caused by only minor trauma. In the present study, we reviewed our experience of acute cervical cord injury associated with OPLL to understand the pathomechanisms and to provide clinical information for management of this disorder.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients were retrospectively analyzed. There were 26 men and 2 women, aged 45 to 78 years (mean, 63.0 yr). Most patients experienced incomplete spinal cord injury (Frankel Grade A, 3; B, 1; C, 15; and D, 9).

Results

Radiological studies revealed continuous- or mixed-type OPLL in 14 patients and segmental-type OPLL in 14 patients. The sagittal diameter of the spinal canal was reduced to 4.1 to 10 mm at the narrowest level as a result of OPLL. Developmental size of the spinal canal was significantly smaller in the group with segmental OPLL. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed that spinal cord injury occurred predominantly at the caudal edge of continuous-type OPLL or at the disc levels. Surgery was performed in 24 patients either by posterior (18 patients) or anterior (6 patients) decompression at various time intervals after the trauma. Twenty patients (71%) displayed improvement in Frankel grade.

Conclusion

The present study demonstrates the preexisting factors and pathomechanisms of acute spinal cord injury associated with cervical OPLL. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful to understand the level and mechanism of injury. Further investigation will be needed to elucidate the role of surgical decompression.

### Risk factor analysis and risk prediction model construction of ossification progression after postoperative cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament [^116CDJfA]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study developed a nomogram that effectively predicts the risk of postoperative progression of OPLL, providing important reference for the identification and personalized management of high-risk patients. However, the model primarily focuses on predicting the risk of postoperative OPLL progression, enabling early proactive intervention for patients identified as high risk, rather than directly preventing the progression of OPLL. Future research should combine the predictive results of the model with comprehensive intervention strategies, such as optimizing surgical plans, enhancing postoperative rehabilitation management, and controlling relevant risk factors, to better prevent further progression of ossification.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective, single-center study with a limited sample size, its generalizability may be restricted, potentially weakening the statistical analysis and introducing bias, thereby limiting the external applicability of the findings. Second, the model was primarily developed and validated using data from an Asian population, which may raise uncertainties regarding its applicability to other ethnic groups. This study primarily developed a nomogram based on commonly used clinical and imaging parameters. The various OPLL classification systems mentioned by Tetreault et al. may contribute to further improving the model's accuracy, and this will be a focus of our future research. Finally, the measurement of initial and final CT ossification thickness, as well as related distances and angles, is prone to errors even when averaged across multiple observers, which may undermine the accuracy of patient grouping and related outcomes. Future research should focus on validating the model in larger and more diverse populations, incorporating additional variables, and employing noninteractive automated measurement techniques powered by artificial intelligence to achieve precise assessments. These efforts would further enhance the model's accuracy and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

### Small extracellular vesicle-mediated miR-320e transmission promotes osteogenesis in OPLL by targeting TAK1 [^115FKPFt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common spinal disease involving ectopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and it is often accompanied by severe compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, resulting in quadriparesis or other myelopathy manifestations. In the early stages of the disease, the ossification of the ligament advances slowly, and most patients are not aware of the disease until they develop obvious myelopathy symptoms due to the large osteophytes that progress over time. Thus, patients with late-stage OPLL are often hospitalized, and the clinical outcome of these patients is usually not satisfactory. Moreover, the molecular pathogenesis has not been elucidated and no efficient therapeutic strategy, especially pharmacotherapy and/or a preventive intervention for OPLL, has been suggested, making surgical management by indirect decompression of the spinal cord the only option for symptomatic OPLL patients.

OPLL is known to be an idiopathic and multifactorial disease in which familial inheritance (genetic factors) and nongenetic factors, including diet, obesity, physical strain on the posterior longitudinal ligament, age, and diabetes mellitus, are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Studies have shown that various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of osteogenesis-related genes are related to the development of abnormal ossification in OPLL –; however, they were also found to play critical roles in normal ossification processes, such as endochondral bone formation or osteocyte differentiation (such as Col6a1, Tgf-β1, Npp1, Bmp2, etc.) –. This phenomenon implies that key disease-specific factors or regulatory networks are still being unraveled in the development of OPLL. A recent genome-wide association study identified new disease-related lociand new OPLL-specific factors related to disease development.

### Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in a Chilean population: a CT-based prevalence study in patients aged 60 years and older [^114DSqqt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

From a total of 1,009 patients evaluated, 597 were men (59.17%) and 412 women (40.83%). The median age of our cohort was 66 years (range: 60 to 73 years).

Among those 1,009 patients, 19 had OPLL (16 men and three women), with a prevalence of 1.88% (1.04 to 2.72). Men had a higher prevalence (2.68%) than women (0.73%; P = 0.02). All cases in our sample presented C-OPLL, with one case only also showing T-OPLL (0.09% prevalence). The median age of patients with OPLL (64 years) was not markedly different from those without OPLL (66 years; P = 0.09).

Logistic regression analysis showed that male sex independently affected the presence of OPLL (OR = 3.85 [1.11 to 13.33]); however, age was not an independent predictor of the presence of OPLL (OR = 0.89 [0.78 to 1.02]). Four patients with OPLL exhibited concurrent DISH. Regarding the types of OPLL, we found three segmental, three mixed, and 13 localized.

### Comment on, "Radiographic characterization of OPLL progression in patients receiving laminoplasty with a minimum of two-years follow-up" [^114zdryh]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

The article by Liu et al. (2024) investigates the progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in 29 patients post-cervical laminoplasty. The study meticulously tracks transverse and longitudinal OPLL progression, providing crucial insights into surgical planning and patient outcomes. While the research design is commendable, reliance on X-ray imaging limits precision compared to CT or MRI scans. The sample size, though adequate for initial findings, may not fully capture OPLL variability, and the follow-up period could be extended to better assess long-term outcomes. Future studies should incorporate advanced imaging techniques, larger cohorts, and patient-reported outcomes to enhance the understanding of OPLL progression, thereby refining surgical strategies and improving personalized care for OPLL patients.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^116XG1Cs]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP — thoracic spinal stenosis epidemiology and lesion distribution: Thoracic spinal stenosis is a relatively rare disease characterized by narrower spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord and/or nerve root. In a systematic review, diagnoses included ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in 18.7%, ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in 41.5%, both OPLL and OLF in 7.4%, and thoracic disc herniation producing spinal stenosis in 32.4%. Thoracic OPLL occurred mostly at the middle thoracic spine (43.4%), OLF predominantly at the lower thoracic spine (63.1%), thoracic disc herniation was mainly localized in the middle (46%) and lower thoracic (50.3%) spine, and tandem spinal stenosis was observed in 52.1% with accompanying cervical diseases and 35.9% with lumbar diseases.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: methodological approaches to evaluate the literature and establish best evidence [^115asfeA]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review of methods.

Objective

To provide a detailed description of the methods undertaken in the articles in this focus issue pertaining to cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and to describe the process used to develop summary statements and clinical recommendations regarding factors associated with the mechanisms, diagnosis, progression, and treatment of CSM and OPLL.

Summary Of Background Data

We present methods used in conducting the systematic, evidence-based reviews and development of expert panel summary statements and clinical recommendations of the mechanisms, diagnosis, progression, and treatment of CSM and OPLL. Our intent is that clinicians will combine the information from these systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and primary research studies with an understanding of their own capacities and experience to better manage patients with CSM or OPLL and consider future research for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

Methods

For the systematic reviews, which make up the bulk of the studies in this focus issue, a systematic search and critical review of the English language literature was undertaken for articles published on the mechanisms, diagnosis, progression, and treatment of CSM and OPLL. Articles were screened for relevance using a priori criteria and relevant articles were critically reviewed. Whether an article was included for review depended on whether the study question was descriptive, one of therapy, or one of prognosis. The strength of evidence for the overall body of literature in each topic area was determined by 2 independent reviewers considering risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of results using a modification of the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Findings from articles meeting inclusion criteria were summarized. From these summaries, summary statements or clinical recommendations were formulated among subject experts through a modified Delphi process using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Methods for the 2 primary research studies and the narrative reviews are also reviewed.

Results

Because of the nature of questions that needed to be addressed, not all studies in this focus issue were amenable to systematic review. As a result, this focus issue consists of several different article types, including 1 research protocol, 2 primary research studies, 2 narrative literature reviews, 7 systematic reviews, and 3 articles that combine a systematic review component with either a narrative section (n = 2) or a provider survey (n = 1). In general, the strength of evidence ratings ranged from insufficient to moderate. Summary statements or clinical recommendations were made according to available evidence and study type: 16 summary statements were made across 8 articles, and 17 clinical recommendations were made across 9 articles. Three articles had both summary statements and clinical recommendations, 5 had summary statements only, 6 had clinical recommendations only, and 1 (the research protocol) was not amenable to either.

Conclusion

Systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and primary research studies were undertaken to understand the mechanisms, diagnosis, progression, and treatment of CSM and OPLL and to provide summary statements and clinical recommendations. This article reports the methods used in the studies in this focus issue. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: The objectives of this focus issue were met using a variety of article and study designs, each of which has some unique methodological aspects associated with it. The reader should refer to the full article in this issue for additional details specific to that topic. The methods for systematic review follow accepted standards for rigor and, together with the application of Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation, are intended to allow for transparency in the process for creating the clinical recommendation.
