## Question

anemia in chronic kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anemia in chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining anemia in CKD and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify screening and diagnostic evaluation, including when to suspect CKD-related anemia. Next, I will review iron management thresholds and routes, followed by ESA initiation, targets, and monitoring. After that, I need to check ESA hyporesponsiveness and special populations. Finally, I will consider emerging therapies, controversies, and synthesize a practical algorithm with safety checks and shared decision-making points.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology. Anemia in CKD is typically defined as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in adult men and less than 12.0 g/dL in adult women, and it becomes increasingly prevalent as eGFR declines, especially when eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with higher likelihood below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² in the absence of other causes, which aligns with guideline thresholds and CKD staging conventions [^115ZN9ST].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The dominant mechanism is erythropoietin deficiency from progressive nephron loss, compounded by iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to impaired iron mobilization and utilization, with contributions from inflammation, uremic toxins, and shortened red cell survival; this mechanistic framing explains why iron repletion and ESAs are foundational, but also why inflammation blunts ESA response and why higher hemoglobin targets may not translate to better outcomes [^116rH9yg] [^112UTSei].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening cadence. I should verify guideline recommendations. For adults with CKD, routine hemoglobin monitoring is suggested at least annually in CKD G3 and at least twice yearly in CKD G4–5 not on dialysis, with more frequent checks if anemia is present or evolving; in dialysis, monthly hemoglobin is standard during ESA maintenance, which matches KDIGO and UK guidance [^115ZN9ST] [^11529EC7] [^111VdAXF].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation of anemia in CKD. Let me think about excluding other causes before attributing to CKD. Recommended steps include assessing for occult blood loss, B12 and folate deficiency, hemolysis, and inflammatory states, and confirming iron status with ferritin and transferrin saturation; importantly, erythropoietin levels are not routinely measured because they rarely change management in CKD anemia [^115ZN9ST] [^113QmS8S].

> I will now examine iron management thresholds and route selection. I should confirm that iron is indicated when TSAT is less than 30% and ferritin is less than 500 ng/mL if the goal is to raise hemoglobin, reduce transfusion needs, or lower ESA dose; routine iron beyond these thresholds is discouraged due to limited benefit and potential harm, and IV iron is generally favored in dialysis or when rapid correction is needed, whereas oral iron may be tried in non-dialysis CKD if adherence and tolerability are acceptable [^112ECYw9] [^114tPZ4j] [^114RozD9] [^112iWpEq].

> Wait, let me verify the practical dosing cadence. For IV iron, many programs use high-dose, low-frequency regimens, but I should acknowledge that evidence for optimal frequency in non-dialysis CKD and peritoneal dialysis is limited; KDIGO emphasizes tailoring route and frequency to severity of iron deficiency, venous access, prior response, and cost, which supports individualized decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all schedule [^112iWpEq] [^114Pdv41].

> Now, ESA initiation: I should double-check thresholds and the principle of shared decision-making. KDIGO suggests considering ESA therapy in adults with non-dialysis CKD when hemoglobin is less than 10.0 g/dL, balancing benefits such as improved quality of life and fewer transfusions against risks like stroke, vascular access thrombosis, and hypertension; in dialysis, initiating around 9.0–10.0 g/dL to avoid drops below 9.0 g/dL is reasonable, and UK guidance similarly frames ESA use around patients likely to benefit in QoL and transfusion avoidance, especially transplant candidates [^1141MfbX] [^1133gid7] [^114bD8JD] [^115fS46w].

> Let me consider treatment targets carefully, because this is where harm can occur. I should confirm that KDIGO advises avoiding routine maintenance of hemoglobin above 11.5 g/dL in adults with CKD, while KDOQI historically supported a target range of 11.0–12.0 g/dL with a hard cap at 13.0 g/dL; UKKA 2025 recommends achieving 10.0–12.0 g/dL in adults and children aged 2 years and older on ESA therapy, and explicitly notes these targets apply to ESA-treated patients, not to iron-only therapy, which is a critical distinction to avoid overtreatment [^117Xp2Gv] [^116tev9u] [^116zSyq8] [^111R9NXw].

> But wait, what if we chase higher hemoglobin for better quality of life? I should verify the evidence. Meta-analyses and large RCTs show no consistent QoL advantage to normalizing hemoglobin and signal increased cardiovascular harm at higher targets, particularly in non-dialysis CKD; thus, individualized QoL gains must be weighed against stroke and mortality risks, and dose minimization with careful monitoring is prudent [^115d8Nyb] [^115iMAuk] [^113sPf28].

> Next, I should review monitoring and dose adjustment. During ESA maintenance, hemoglobin should be checked at least monthly in dialysis and about every 3 months in non-dialysis CKD, with iron status assessed at least every 3 months; dose changes of roughly 10–25% are commonly used to titrate, but abrupt large decreases can worsen cycling, so I need to ensure smooth titration and avoid chasing transient fluctuations [^111VdAXF] [^11529EC7] [^111vEPEQ] [^111nHquB].

> I will now examine ESA hyporesponsiveness. Let me first confirm the definition and approach. Hyporesponsiveness is typically defined by failure to reach target hemoglobin despite appropriate weight-based dosing, or by requiring escalating doses beyond about four times the initial dose; causes to evaluate include iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, malnutrition, uncorrected hyperparathyroidism, and blood loss, and if hyporesponsiveness persists after correction, individualized decisions include accepting lower hemoglobin, continuing ESA at the lowest effective dose, or pivoting to transfusions, with emerging consideration of HIF-PHIs in selected cases [^116KkVh8] [^1122wx3a] [^112XaMQq] [^112a4NQ3].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and cautions. In children, target hemoglobin ranges are lower and should reflect age-appropriate norms, with careful growth and developmental monitoring; in patients with active malignancy, especially when cure is the goal, ESA use warrants caution due to potential tumor growth signals; in patients with a history of stroke, ESA therapy may increase recurrence risk, so shared decision-making and conservative targets are essential [^113cf2UM] [^113RaHNu].

> Let me consider emerging therapies and controversies. HIF-PHIs offer oral, physiology-mimicking erythropoiesis and may reduce IV iron needs, but long-term safety, particularly cardiovascular and oncologic, remains under evaluation; KDIGO controversies conferences highlight both promise and uncertainty, so I should avoid overpromising benefit and emphasize enrollment in trials or careful post-marketing surveillance when used [^1126mfw2] [^116xKfSw].

> I should double-check the overarching principle so I don't over-treat. The modern paradigm is individualized anemia management: correct iron deficiency first, start ESAs only when benefits outweigh risks, target modest hemoglobin ranges rather than normalization, monitor closely for harm, and continuously reassess the need for ongoing therapy; this approach reduces transfusions and may improve symptoms while avoiding the cardiovascular harms seen with aggressive hemoglobin chasing [^112LmH9F] [^115wiTUJ] [^111D8jUz].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Screen and diagnose anemia in CKD using standard thresholds and exclude other causes; assess iron status and replete if TSAT is less than 30% and ferritin is less than 500 ng/mL, choosing IV iron when rapid correction is needed or oral iron when feasible; consider ESA initiation in non-dialysis CKD when hemoglobin is less than 10.0 g/dL and in dialysis when hemoglobin approaches 9.0–10.0 g/dL, using shared decision-making; target 10.0–12.0 g/dL in adults on ESAs and avoid routine maintenance above 11.5–12.0 g/dL; monitor hemoglobin and iron indices at guideline-specified intervals; evaluate and correct causes of hyporesponsiveness; and adapt therapy to patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidity, transplant candidacy, and preferences, documenting rationale at each step [^115ZN9ST] [^112ECYw9] [^1141MfbX] [^116zSyq8] [^117Xp2Gv] [^111VdAXF] [^111vEPEQ].

---

Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is primarily due to **erythropoietin deficiency** and **iron-restricted erythropoiesis**, with contributions from inflammation, blood loss, and nutritional deficits [^116rH9yg]. It is common, worsens with declining kidney function, and is linked to fatigue, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular complications, and mortality [^115wiTUJ]. Management centers on **iron repletion** (prefer IV iron when rapid correction is needed) [^114RozD9] and **ESA therapy** to maintain hemoglobin 10–12 g/dL, balancing benefits (symptom relief, reduced transfusions) against risks (hypertension, thrombosis, stroke) [^116zSyq8] [^111DHSBi]. HIF-PH inhibitors are emerging alternatives for ESA-resistant or intolerant patients [^112a4NQ3]. Regular monitoring and individualized targets are essential to optimize outcomes [^11529EC7] [^116dBd6c].

---

## Pathophysiology

Anemia in CKD arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Erythropoietin deficiency**: Reduced renal production of erythropoietin impairs erythropoiesis [^116rH9yg].
- **Iron-restricted erythropoiesis**: Impaired iron mobilization and utilization due to hepcidin-driven blockade [^116rH9yg].
- **Inflammation**: Cytokines (e.g. IL-6) increase hepcidin, reduce iron availability, and blunt ESA response [^116rH9yg].
- **Blood loss**: Gastrointestinal bleeding and dialysis-related losses contribute [^notfound].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies may coexist [^115ZN9ST].

---

## Clinical significance

Anemia in CKD is associated with:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, reduced exercise capacity, and impaired quality of life [^115WRST1].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased cardiovascular mortality [^115wiTUJ].
- **Progression of CKD**: Anemia may accelerate kidney disease progression [^notfound].
- **Increased mortality**: Higher mortality rates correlate with lower hemoglobin levels [^115wiTUJ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis and evaluation include:

- **Hemoglobin measurement**: Routinely at least annually in CKD G3, and more frequently in advanced CKD [^115ZN9ST].
- **Iron studies**: Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) to assess iron status [^111vEPEQ].
- **Evaluation of other causes**: Exclude blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, and inflammatory conditions [^115ZN9ST].
- **Erythropoietin levels**: Not routinely measured [^115ZN9ST].

---

## Management strategies

### Iron supplementation

Iron therapy is foundational; **IV iron** is preferred for rapid correction, in dialysis, or when oral iron is ineffective, whereas **oral iron** may be used in non-dialysis CKD if tolerated [^114RozD9] [^112iWpEq]. Targets include TSAT > 20% and ferritin > 100 ng/mL, while avoiding ferritin > 500 ng/mL to limit oxidative stress [^112ECYw9] [^114tPZ4j].

---

### Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)

- **Indication**: Initiate when hemoglobin < 10 g/dL after iron repletion, balancing benefits and risks [^1141MfbX] [^1133gid7].
- **Targets**: Maintain hemoglobin 10–12 g/dL; avoid routine maintenance > 11.5 g/dL [^116zSyq8] [^117Xp2Gv].
- **Risks**: Hypertension, thrombosis, stroke, and possible tumor growth; individualize decisions, especially in malignancy or stroke history [^111DHSBi] [^113RaHNu].

---

### Emerging therapies

HIF-PH inhibitors are oral agents that **enhance endogenous erythropoietin** and improve iron utilization; they are promising for ESA-resistant or intolerant patients, though long-term safety remains under study [^1126mfw2] [^112a4NQ3].

---

## Monitoring and individualized care

Regular monitoring of hemoglobin, iron parameters, and blood pressure is essential, with **individualized targets** based on symptoms, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^11529EC7] [^116dBd6c].

---

Anemia in CKD is a **common and consequential complication** driven by erythropoietin deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis, with inflammation and blood loss as key contributors. Management focuses on **iron repletion**, **ESA therapy** to modest hemoglobin targets, and emerging HIF-PH inhibitors, all within a framework of regular monitoring and individualized care to balance benefits and risks.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: problems and solutions. A position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels. To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base. The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources in generating a common evidence report, whose recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally. This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116xKfSw]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials that warrant a re-examination of previous recommendations. Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO decided to convene 2 Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the current KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused mainly on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111nsaSA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among patients suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect patient quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this patient population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, patients may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). Chronic kidney disease patients may not be able to utilise their own body's iron stores effectively and hence, many patients, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may require additional iron treatment, usually provided by infusion. With further weakening of kidney function, patients with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in patients with chronic kidney disease. Any patients will eventually require treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection. Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products have been licensed for treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen chronic kidney disease patients for anaemia, which patients to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat patients with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

### Should hemoglobin be normalized in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^116UZMd7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

In the last decade the nephrology community has learned much about the impact of anemia on patients with kidney disease. Therapy of anemia can correct many of the symptoms which seriously compromise patient function. Despite the obvious benefits, controversy continues regarding the optimal target hemoglobin concentration both in patients prior to dialysis and in dialysis populations. In this editorial we review the clinical data that contribute to this controversy and the physiologic concepts underlying the treatment of anemia. Furthermore, we discuss the need to individualize hemoglobin targets for specific patient populations and the importance of early identification and treatment of anemia in patients with kidney disease. The economic impact of normalizing hemoglobin with the use of erythropoietin and intravenous or oral iron has affected clinical practice over the last decade. Current guidelines published by Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (KDOQI), the European Working Group on Anemia Management, and the Canadian Society of Nephrology all recommend target hemoglobin concentrations and thresholds for initiation of therapy and also suggest the need for reevaluation of current targets in light of new evidence. This editorial supports those guidelines and challenges the reader to critically evaluate current practice in the context of the accumulating data and the physiologic principles discussed herein. The therapy of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is an essential component of care in patients with CKD. However, the effects of therapy will be most impressive when accompanied by the optimal care of all hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with CKD.

### Anemia management in chronic kidney disease: what have we learned after 17 years? [^1177cduK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

Anemia management remains controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The overwhelming conclusion from retrospective data analyses show a strong correlation between higher hemoglobin values and improved outcomes, including mortality, hospitalization, left ventricular hypertrophy, and quality of life. However, the evidence available from two large prospective trials in CKD comparing hemoglobin values near the current target of 11–12 g/dl with normalization or near normalization were stopped, as there was a trend toward worsening outcomes in the higher hemoglobin groups. This disparity suggests that patients who have or achieve high hemoglobin values on low doses or no erythropoietin may be inherently different from the general CKD population. Therefore targeting to a hemoglobin value above the current recommendation with intermittent erythropoietin seems unwarranted until randomized prospective trials demonstrate both safety and efficacy.

### Optimizing renal anaemia management – benefits of early referral and treatment [^116UFECY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Despite clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia of chronic kidney disease and a growing literature concerning the treatment of renal anaemia in diverse patient groups, there remain uncertainties over definitions and descriptions for optimal management of renal anaemia. The patients most likely to derive the greatest long-term benefit from correction of anaemia are those with chronic kidney disease who are pre-dialysis. Early intervention to correct anaemia has the potential to impact on the progression of chronic kidney disease and affect patient morbidity, hospitalization rates, quality of life and mortality. This review considers current guidance on anaemia management, the evidence behind the guidance and the data shortfalls in an attempt to provide a topical overview of current understanding and future directions for optimal management of renal anaemia, particularly in high-risk groups.

### The treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease: understandings in 2006 [^112oXMTQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Anemia is a well recognized complication of chronic kidney disease and is associated with significant morbidity. It is important for clinical care to identify appropriate treatments and targets for hemoglobin. This review describes current understandings of the treatment of anemia using the most recent published articles.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies, including observational and randomized control trials, of varying sizes and using both surrogate and hard outcomes have been published. On balance, there is little to support normalization of hemoglobin in the chronic kidney disease population. While some studies have described harm, there are some issues related to overinterpretation based on study trial reporting. The treatment of anemia can be successfully achieved with the use of oral or intravenous iron and erythropoiten-stimulating agents. Caution should be exercised when treating those with significant cardiovascular morbidity, and those who require very high doses of erythropoiten-stimulating agents to achieve normal hemoglobin.

Summary

Large observational population-based studies continue to demonstrate the association of low hemoglobin with adverse outcomes, and randomized control trials fail to show a benefit of normalized hemoglobin. Anemia therapy does improve quality of life. In the current era of aggressive chronic kidney disease management, it does not appear that anemia therapy attenuates left ventricular growth or changes cardiovascular outcomes.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116pqhvF]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline structure

This manuscript provides an overview of the Recommendations made within the guideline with associated rationale. More information can be found in the full guideline document which is provided as a Supplementary appendix. The guideline Working Group provided recommendations on the use of therapies to manage anaemia of chronic kidney disease, how they can be used, research recommendations (what areas of ongoing clinical uncertainty exist) and audit recommendations (how effective implementation can be demonstrated). The group have reviewed the additional evidence from July 2016 using systematic literature searches to identify all published clinical evidence relevant to the review questions, via database (MEDLINE, PUBMED, Embase, and The Cochrane Library) searches using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms and study-type filters where appropriate.

This guideline update from the previous published 2017 guidance covers the management of anaemia in adults, children and young people with anaemia associated with CKD.

The evidence for these recommendations has been assessed using the modified GRADE system. The modified GRADE system defines both the strength of the recommendations of the guideline authors and the level of evidence upon which each of the recommendations is based (Table 1). This grading system classifies expert recommendations as "strong" (Grade 1) or "weak" (Grade 2) based upon the balance between the benefits and risks, burden and cost. The quality or level of evidence is designated as high (Grade A), moderate (Grade B), low (Grade C) or very low (D) depending on factors such as study design, directness of evidence and consistency of results. Grades of recommendation and quality of evidence may range from 1 A to 2D.

A summary of all the clinical practice guidelines on anaemia of chronic kidney disease is in Table 2.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^114aGiPg]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia guideline methods for guideline development and implementation describe the update plan, recommendation structure, benefit–harm assessment, patient preferences, algorithms, and implementation scope. There is no date set for updating, and the need for updating will depend on publication of new evidence with ongoing studies reviewed periodically for potential impact. Each guideline chapter contains recommendations for management of CKD patients at risk for or with anemia, with the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence provided in parenthesis within each recommendation. The benefits and harm for each comparison of interventions are provided in summary tables and summarized in evidence profiles, and many recommendations are Level 2 or 'discretionary' which indicates a greater need to help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. Algorithms are referenced when appropriate with a graphical description of care stages (see Chapter 4). Implementation notes state these recommendations are global, that review criteria were not suggested because implementation is discretionary, and that suggestions were provided for future research. Methodological frameworks cited include the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation criteria, the Conference on Guideline Standardization checklist, and the Institute of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, with supplementary appendices describing online search strategies and concurrence with Institute of Medicine standards.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115WRST1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease — Selection of the hemoglobin (Hb) target and the Hb level for initiating erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy is stated for "the individual patient with CKD and anemia" and "should include consideration of potential benefits (including improvement in quality of life and avoidance of transfusion) and potential harms (including the risk of life-threatening adverse events)", with the Work Group concluding that "improvement in quality of life and avoidance of transfusion are the most likely treatment benefits and that there is potential for harm when aiming for high Hb targets". In randomized controlled trials, initiation "has generally been initiated when the baseline Hb decreases within, at, or less than the assigned Hb target". The evidence base "does not allow precise recommendations for each individual patient", and these limitations "argue for engaging the patient and for maintaining flexibility when setting Hb targets for ESA therapy". Regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL), "Most studies show some improvement in HRQoL in patients assigned to higher Hb targets compared with those assigned to lower Hb targets", although "there is heterogeneity in the HRQoL domains showing benefit in the higher Hb treatment group by instrument and by report". Reported benefits span multiple domains using validated instruments, including the "36-Item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey" and the "Kidney Disease Questionnaire", and "The improvement in HRQoL with higher Hb targets has been seen in the earliest assessment performed, even in studies in which treatment assignment was masked to participating patients". Over time, "HRQoL scores deteriorate over time in dialysis patients", and "HRQoL benefits of higher Hb targets diminish over time", though effects "have been seen in some domains to persist for at least 2 years".

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^114cCcxo]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for anemia — COGS checklist scope and methods are outlined as follows: Management of adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney transplant recipients at risk for or with anemia is the focus, and the goal is to assist the practitioner caring for patients with CKD and anemia and to prevent deaths, cardiovascular disease events and progression to kidney failure while optimizing patients' quality of life. Intended users include Providers: Nephrologists (adult and pediatric), Dialysis providers (including nurses), Internists, and Pediatricians; Patients: adult and children with CKD at risk for or with anemia; and Policy Makers: Those in related health fields. Evidence collection included searches limited to years 2005–2010 for studies related to anemia interventions, with transfusion literature searched from 1989–2010; a separate search was run for observational studies on iron overload and hemoglobin status as predictors for clinical outcomes; and searches were run in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Quality assessment used a three-tiered grading system for individual studies, and strength of the recommendation was graded in a two-level grading system adapted from GRADE for KDIGO with the quality of overall evidence graded on a four-tiered system. For systematic review topics, summary tables and evidence profiles were generated, and for recommendations on treatment interventions, the steps outlined by GRADE were followed. Prerelease review included internal review by the KDIGO Board of Directors in June 2011 and external review in September 2011, with public review comments compiled and fed back to the Work Group, which considered comments in its revision of the guideline.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^117XwWin]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — research recommendations identify unanswered questions to inform future studies. The guideline notes that in cohort studies moderate anemia is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and asks whether anemia is a true risk factor or a marker. It highlights uncertainty about optimal Hb targets for ESA therapy, querying the risk–benefit ratio of low Hb targets < 10.0 g/dl (< 100 g/l) or high targets of 11.5–13.0 g/dl (115–130 g/l) compared with conventional targets of 10.0–11.5 g/dl (100–115 g/l). It asks whether the objective of therapy should be improvement in clinical outcomes provided Hb concentration is within 10.0–13.0 g/dl (100–130 g/l), explores ESA responsiveness versus dose and clinical outcomes, examines intravenous vs subcutaneous administration and biosimilar comparability, and requests data on appropriate, weight-based dosing for younger pediatric patients, especially those under the age of two years.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^115pRMGc]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to ESAs, management of ESA hyporesponsiveness, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to consider individualizing treatment in patients remaining hyporesponsive despite correcting treatable causes, accounting for relative risks and benefits of:

- decline in hemoglobin concentration

- continuing ESA, if needed to maintain hemoglobin concentration, with due consideration of the doses required

- blood transfusions.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^117WjGeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease provides clinicians with comprehensive evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care. In this commentary, we review these recommendations and the underlying evidence. Most recommendations are well reasoned. For some, the evidence is unclear and recommendations require some qualification. While the KDIGO guideline stresses the potential risks of intravenous iron therapy, withholding iron might have its own risks. The recommendation to avoid hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL sets a lower bound of "acceptability" that may increase blood transfusion. Given the lack of research supporting the optimal transfusion strategy for end-stage renal disease patients, it is difficult to weigh the risks and benefits of red blood cell transfusion. We find a paucity of evidence that hemoglobin concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk. Although the evidence that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use improves patient quality of life is poor, it is possible that the instruments used to measure quality of life may not be well attuned to the needs of chronic kidney disease or dialysis patients. Our last section focuses specifically on the recommendations to treat anemia in children.

### The controversy surrounding hemoglobin and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: what should we do now? [^116JaVN7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been intensely debated during the past 2 years. Treatment with ESAs has transformed the lives of millions of patients with CKD, with fewer blood transfusions and improved quality of life. However, randomized trials have suggested that targeting greater hematocrits/hemoglobin levels and/or exposure to high doses of ESAs is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. The US Food and Drug Administration has inserted a boxed warning for ESAs and, along with the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI), decreased recommended target hemoglobin ranges for ESA therapy. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has decreased ESA dosing recommendations in the Medicare claims policy for ESAs. Managing the anemia of CKD in the era of the hemoglobin level and ESA controversy has required aiming for appropriate hemoglobin levels, using the lowest effective ESA dose, and better managing the problem of ESA hyporesponsiveness.

### Higher hemoglobin levels and quality of life in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: no longer a moving target? [^115d8Nyb]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease suggest target hemoglobin levels ≤ 11.5 g/dl (115 g/l), with individualized consideration of slightly higher hemoglobin targets to improve quality of life. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials demonstrates no significant improvement in quality of life with erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy targeting higher hemoglobin levels. Limitations of the available data suggest that individualized targets should nonetheless remain an option in future clinical practice guidelines.

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease? [^112UTSei]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially taken to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality ignores the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations point to overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, as the likely culprit. This Review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. I have focused on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

Lay summary

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among people suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, people with chronic kidney disease may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). People with chronic kidney disease may not be able to use their own body's iron stores well and hence, many people, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may need additional iron treatment, usually provided by injection.

With further weakening of kidney function, people with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in people with chronic kidney disease. These people will eventually need treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection.

Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products (synthetic products and those stimulating the body's own erythropoietin) have been licensed for treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen people with chronic kidney disease for anaemia, which people to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat people with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing and monitoring of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

KDIGO anemia guideline — recommendation grading and evidence quality definitions are specified as follows: Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D. For Level 1 "We recommend", "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". For Level 2 "We suggest", "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The "Not Graded" category "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence". Evidence quality meanings are: A High — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect"; B Moderate — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C Low — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; D Very Low — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^11788xQt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease — strength of guideline recommendations specifies that the strength of a guideline recommendation could be rated as either "strong" or "moderately strong". A "strong" guideline requires support by evidence of "high" quality, and a "strong" rating indicates the expectation that the guideline recommendation will be followed unless there are compelling reasons to deviate from the recommendation in an individual and is based on "high"-quality evidence and the assumption that most well-informed individuals will make the same choice. A "moderately strong" guideline requires support by evidence of at least "moderate" quality, and a "moderately strong" rating indicates the expectation that consideration will be given to follow the guideline recommendation and is based on at least "moderate"-quality evidence and the assumption that a majority of well-informed individuals will make this choice, but a substantial minority may not. In the absence of "high"- or "moderate"-quality evidence or when additional considerations did not support "strong" or "moderately strong" evidence-based guideline recommendations, the Work Group drafted "CPRs" based on consensus, and the Work Group recommends that clinicians give consideration to following these "CPRs" for eligible patients.

### Kidney disease: improving global outcomes guidelines on anaemia management in chronic kidney disease: a European renal best practice position statement [^116GXUQA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group has produced comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia in CKD patients. These guidelines addressed all of the important points related to anaemia management in CKD patients, including therapy with erythropoieis stimulating agents (ESA), iron therapy, ESA resistance and blood transfusion use. Because most guidelines were 'soft' rather than 'strong', and because global guidelines need to be adapted and implemented into the regional context where they are used, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice Advisory Board some of its members, and other external experts in this field, who were not participants in the KDIGO guidelines group, were invited to participate in this anaemia working group to examine and comment on the KDIGO documents in this position paper. In this article, the group concentrated only on those guidelines which we considered worth amending or adapting. All guidelines not specifically mentioned are fully endorsed.

Anemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease and is associated with a high burden of morbidity and adverse clinical outcomes. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline for the diagnosis and management of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data from studies assessing established and emerging therapies for the treatment of anemia and iron deficiency have become available. Beginning in 2019, KDIGO planned 2 Controversies Conferences to review the new evidence and its potential impact on the management of anemia in clinical practice. Here, we report on the second of these conferences held virtually in December 2021, which focused on a new class of agents-the hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). This report provides a review of the consensus points and controversies from this second conference and highlights areas that warrant prioritization for future research.

### Anaemia management and mortality risk in chronic kidney disease [^115wiTUJ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Renal anaemia is a frequent complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 90 g/l) is associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiac complications, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular disease, and impaired quality of life. Randomized controlled trials have tested the hypothesis that increasing haemoglobin level using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) lowers these risks and improves quality of life. Use of ESAs to normalize haemoglobin levels (to ≥ 130 g/l) versus the partial correction of anaemia (to haemoglobin levels of 90–110 g/l) has repeatedly been shown to have no cardiac benefit and to be associated with no incremental improvement in outcomes and quality of life (except fatigue), but has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. Use of more-intense iron dosing has been proposed in order to reduce ESA dosing but liberal intravenous iron therapy is also associated with complications, and its long-term safety has not yet been adequately investigated. For patients with CKD on dialysis, US medication labels recommend administering ESAs at doses sufficient to avoid transfusions, whereas European and Canadian labels recommend targeting haemoglobin levels of 100–120 g/l and 110–120 g/l, respectively. Treatment of anaemia to haemoglobin levels of 90–110 g/l in patients with CKD accomplishes what we want — a reduced need for transfusions and possible reductions in fatigue, while avoiding high doses of ESA or iron in order to achieve a specific haemoglobin goal.

### Anaemia of chronic kidney disease: an under-recognized and under-treated problem [^112YcXpi]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) almost invariably develop anaemia, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and reduced quality of life. Anaemia begins early in the course of CKD, and although treatment with erythropoietin is effective, the condition is often under-treated. Because of the growing body of scientific literature on the significant morbidity and mortality associated with anaemia of CKD, a Renal Anaemia Management Period (RAMP) was proposed. This is defined as the time after onset of CKD when anaemia develops and requires early diagnosis and treatment. The RAMP was developed to call attention to the need to improve outcomes for patients with CKD and possibly lower the economic burden by correcting anaemia earlier. It is an important opportunity for preventive care and has the potential to limit costs associated with comorbidities of CKD.

Summary of clinical practice guidelines on anaemia of chronic kidney disease

Evaluating and diagnosing Anaemia in CKD (guidelines 1.1–1.5)

Guideline 1.1 – Evaluation of anaemia - screening for anaemia

We suggest that haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be routinely measured to screen for anaemia:
at least annually in patients with CKD G3 and
at least twice a year in patients with CKD G4–5 not on dialysis (2B)

Guideline 1.2 - evaluation of anaemia – Haemoglobin levels

We recommend that all patients with chronic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be investigated for the cause and possible treatment, irrespective of the grade of kidney disease or requirement for renal replacement therapy if:
their haemoglobin (Hb) levels are less than 110 g/L (less than 105 g/L if younger than 2 years) or
they develop symptoms attributable to anaemia

This is to ensure the correct diagnosis and management of anaemia. (1A)

Guideline 1.3 - evaluation of anaemia - renal function

We suggest that CKD should be considered as a possible cause of anaemia when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². It is more likely to be the cause if the GFR is < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (< 45/min/1.73 m² in patients with diabetes) and no other cause, e.g. blood loss, folic acid or vitamin B 12 deficiency, is identified. (2B)

Guideline 1.4 - evaluation of anaemia - erythropoietin measurement

We recommend that measurement of erythropoietin levels should not routinely be considered for the diagnosis or management of anaemia for patients with CKD. (1A)

### Anemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^115UdBCs]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

Anemia is common and contributes to both poor QOL and increased risk for adverse outcomes including death. Treatment of anemia improves QOL; however, thus far, evidence is lacking for a benefit of anemia treatment on progression of kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes. The NKF recommends that physicians consider treating anemia in patients with diabetes and kidney disease when Hb is < 11 g/dl in patients. Further, they recommend a Hb target of 11–12 g/dl, not to exceed 13 g/dl, when using an ESA as part of the therapeutic regimen for managing anemia. Currently available ESA combined with iron supplementation can be used safely and effectively to achieve this goal. However, available clinical trial evidence leaves sufficient uncertainty regarding the optimal Hb target and ESA dose for a given individual. For this reason, the NKF recommends individualizing treatment of anemia with ESA. Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to more precisely define these parameters for an individual patient. Future studies are also needed to elaborate the mechanisms of anemia in patients with diabetes and CKD including the role of iron metabolism, inflammation, and resistance.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease hemoglobin target — ESA dosing and achieved Hb relative to targets: 10% to 16% dose changes can be an effective maintenance dose-titration strategy; holding ESA doses may lead to steep downward Hb excursions and high amplitude Hb cycling; imposing a fixed 25% dose decrease in response to greater-than-target Hb levels appears to promote greater Hb variability and more greater-than-target Hb values. In practice, when the target Hb is 11 g/dL or greater or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achievement of Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range is associated with lower mortality and less frequent hospitalization rates compared with achievement of lower Hb levels, and the same inverse relationship was seen in RCTs within assigned treatment arms (including arms with targets ≥ 13 g/dL); however, failure to show between-group benefits confirms that the relationship is not causal. The results are consistent with the conclusion that when the target Hb is greater than 11.0 g/dL or 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, achieved Hb levels greater than the 11.0-g/dL threshold or greater than the 11.0- to 12.0-g/dL range do not constitute increased risk to patients; in general, higher facility- and country-specific achieved mean Hb and a lower percentage below target are associated with increased ESA use, and adjustment for ESA dose administered does not diminish the relationship between baseline Hb and mortality or hospitalization risk.

### Is there an established hemoglobin target range for patients undergoing chronic dialysis? [^111JNYV2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) remains a common approach in managing anemia of CKD. The 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in CKD suggests avoiding ESA therapy use to maintain Hb level above 11.5 g/dL. However, optimal Hb target range in adult patients undergoing chronic dialysis remains unknown. Clinical studies suggest risks associated with normalization of Hb levels in adult patients with CKD. In this article, we briefly review some of these studies and the concerns associated with higher Hb targets in this patient population. We also suggest a target Hb range for adult chronic dialysis patients receiving ESAs. It is currently undetermined if this target Hb range would apply to newer agents that are being studied for anemia management in this population.

By 1991, in dialysis, there were no longer patients requiring regular transfusions for severe anemia, and dialysis center–based transfusions had decreased by more than 65%. 1 For many reasons., including the establishment of financial incentives that rewarded overuse, aggressive treatment of anemia in dialysis-requiring patients with increasingly higher doses of ESA became the norm, and mean hemoglobin concentrations in patients receiving dialysis increased from 10. 5 g/dL in 1995 to
12. 0 g/dL in 2005.

### Iron dosing in kidney disease: inconsistency of evidence and clinical practice [^115Gg7am]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is difficult. The availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has increased treatment options for previously transfusion-requiring patients, but the recent evidence of ESA side effects has prompted the search for complementary or alternative approaches. Next to ESA, parenteral iron supplementation is the second main form of anemia treatment. However, as of now, no systematic approach has been proposed to balance the concurrent administration of both agents according to individual patient's needs. Furthermore, the potential risks of excessive iron dosing remain a topic of controversy. How, when and whether to monitor CKD patients for potential iron overload remain to be elucidated. This review addresses the question of risk and benefit of iron administration in CKD, highlights the evidence supporting current practice, provides an overview of standard and potential new markers of iron status and outlines a new pharmacometric approach to physiologically compatible individualized dosing of ESA and iron in CKD patients.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: reading between the (guide) line (s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist health-care providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision, based on evidence and expert judgment. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^116rH9yg]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common feature of CKD associated with poor outcomes. The current management of patients with anemia in CKD is controversial, with recent clinical trials demonstrating increased morbidity and mortality related to erythropoiesis stimulating agents. Here, we examine recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD. These insights hold promise for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies that directly target the pathophysiologic processes underlying this form of anemia.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cf2UM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 3.1 - treatment of Anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents

We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion; especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation. (1B)

Audit measure

Proportion of patients on renal replacement therapy (on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months) with Hb level < 100 g/L who are not prescribed an ESA.

Rationale

Treatment of anaemia in CKD with ESA can be expensive, takes time to work and carries a small but significant risk to the patient. It is therefore reasonable, as with any therapy, to treat only those who are expected to benefit in the time frame that therapy is being considered. For example, patients with severe sepsis/inflammation/acute bleeding are unlikely to respond.

Patients with a very short life expectancy (days or weeks) are not likely to survive long enough for therapy to provide benefit in terms of an increase in Hb. The clinician and patient should agree on a therapeutic plan and, at an appropriate time, review whether therapy is providing enough benefit to continue treatment.

Guideline 3.2 - treatment of Anaemia - choice of ESA

We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on local availability of ESAs. (1B)

Audit measure

Each renal unit should audit the type, route and frequency of administration and weekly dose of ESA prescribed.

Rationale

Many studies have been published comparing different ESA products against each other when used at different dosing intervals, by different routes of administration and in different patient groups. All the available products are efficacious when administered according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The choice of ESA will be dependent upon the clinician and patient agreeing a management plan and local supply arrangements.

Guideline 3.3 - treatment of Anaemia with ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that patients with CKD on ESA therapy should achieve Hb between:
100 and 120 g/L in adults, young people and children aged 2 years and older (2B)
95 and 115 g/L in children younger than 2 years of age (reflecting the lower normal range in that age (2B)

Guideline 3.4 - treatment of Anaemia without ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that these Hb targets apply exclusively to patients receiving ESA and are not intended to apply to the treatment of iron deficiency in patients receiving iron therapy without the use of ESAs. (2B)

KDIGO grading — levels and implications: Grade Level 1 'We recommend' means, for patients, 'Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not', for clinicians, 'Most patients should receive the recommended course of action', and for policy, 'The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure'. Grade Level 2 'We suggest' means, for patients, 'The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not', for clinicians, 'Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences', and for policy, 'The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined'. An additional 'Not Graded' category 'was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence', with examples 'regarding monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists', and such statements 'are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations'.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease guideline development methods — aim, process, roles, and timelines are outlined: The overall aim of the project was to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for management of anemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The development process included appointing Work Group members and Evidence Review Team (ERT), identifying populations, interventions or predictors, and outcomes of interest, developing and implementing literature search strategies, screening abstracts and retrieving full text articles based on predefined eligibility criteria, creating data extraction forms, extracting data and performing critical appraisal of the literature, tabulating study data, grading quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations, finalizing recommendations with rationale statements, sending the guideline draft for peer review to the KDIGO Board of Directors in June 2011 and for public review in September 2011, and publishing the final version of the guideline. The Work Group, KDIGO Co-Chairs, ERT, and KDIGO support staff met for two 2-day meetings for training in the guideline development process. Tufts Center for Kidney Disease Guideline Development and Implementation at Tufts Medical Center was contracted to conduct systematic evidence review and provide methodology expertise; the ERT consisted of physician-methodologists with expertise in nephrology, a project coordinator and manager, and a research assistant, performed literature searches and screening, and coordinated, defined, and standardized methodologies for literature searches and data extraction while summarizing the evidence. The Work Group took the primary role of writing the guidelines and rationale statements and retained final responsibility for the content, and in light of new evidence an update of the topics presented in the 2006 and 2007 KDOQI guidelines was chosen as the best approach.

We recommend choosing an ESA based on the balance of pharmacodynamics, safety information, clinical outcome data, costs, and availability. We suggest using only ESAs that have been approved by an independent regulatory agency, and specifically for 'copy' versions of ESAs, true biosimilar products should be used.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — upper thresholds and routine iron use: In most patients with TSAT > 30% or serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml (> 500 μg/l), any erythropoietic response to iron supplementation alone will be small, and we do not recommend routine use of iron supplementation in patients with TSAT > 30% or serum ferritin > 500 ng/ml (> 500 μg/l). Previous guidelines usually cited ferritin limits of 500–800 ng/ml (500–800 μg/l) above which additional IV iron was generally not recommended, but no randomized controlled trials and few other studies have examined providing IV iron to maintain ferritin levels > 500–800 ng/ml (> 500–800 μg/l).

Surrogate outcome trials — appraisal criteria emphasize validity, effect size and durability, and clinical applicability. Validity asks for "a strong, independent, consistent association between the surrogate end point and the clinical end point" and whether randomized trials "in other drug classes" or "in the same drug class" show that improving the surrogate consistently improves the target outcome. Results should address, "How large, precise, and lasting was the treatment effect? Effect should be large, precise, and lasting to consider a surrogate trial reasonable basis for offering patients the intervention". Applicability weighs benefits, harms, and costs: "Offer intervention on basis of surrogate data only if patient's risk of the target outcome is high, patient places a high value on avoiding the target outcome, and there are no satisfactory alternative therapies". The table notes that "Answers to one or both of these questions should be "yes" for a surrogate trial to be an adequate guide for clinical action".

Criteria for updating KDOQI anemia guidelines — triggers and surrogate endpoint considerations: An update is prompted when there is new evidence on important clinical outcomes, when evidence comes from studies adequately powered for the outcomes of interest, and when the new evidence would be likely to change the magnitude of the estimate of the effect or change the assessment of the balance of benefits and harms. Evidence from surrogate end point trials can prompt an update if criteria from the Users' Guide for a Surrogate End Point Trial are met, but the Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study did not initiate an update because it examined a surrogate outcome (change in Hb) after short follow-up duration (6 weeks).
