## Question

ataxia telangiectasia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ataxia-telangiectasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic basis and molecular pathophysiology. Then, I should classify the clinical phenotypes and their trajectories. Next, I will review systemic complications, including immunodeficiency, pulmonary disease, radiosensitivity, and malignancy risk. After that, I need to outline diagnostic strategies and biomarkers. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, prognosis, and emerging therapies, while verifying key claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation and core biology. Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in ATM on 11q22.3, encoding a serine/threonine kinase central to the DNA double-strand break response and checkpoint signaling, with phosphorylation of hundreds of substrates that coordinate repair, cell-cycle control, and apoptosis, which mechanistically links neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition [^114gUdFr] [^113hDhAq] [^114hmHrL]. Hold on, I should verify the functional nuance: ATM is not absolutely required for all DSB repair, but it is indispensable for a subset of complex lesions, including heterochromatin-associated breaks and specialized recombination processes like V(D)J recombination and class-switch recombination, explaining the immunologic phenotype and chromosomal instability seen in A-T [^114gS5hA] [^116MJXQG].

> Next, I should review the phenotypic spectrum and avoid premature assumptions. Classic A-T typically presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, oculomotor apraxia, and later conjunctival/cutaneous telangiectasias, and most patients lose ambulation before adolescence with median survival in the second to third decade due to malignancy or respiratory failure, correlating with absent ATM kinase activity from truncating mutations [^114gUdFr] [^113hDhAq] [^113vrLTf]. Wait, let me verify the variant phenotype: individuals with residual ATM kinase activity have milder, later-onset neurological disease, often with predominant extrapyramidal features such as dystonia or myoclonus, and may lack telangiectasias or have normal alpha-fetoprotein, which contributes to substantial diagnostic delay and underrecognition in adulthood [^116xmaP7] [^112ACpmf] [^111iDgfU].

> I will now examine the neurological evolution and movement disorder profile. Initially, I thought parkinsonism and myoclonus were uncommon early features, but wait, I should double-check the longitudinal data: while cerebellar ataxia dominates early, over time dystonia, choreoathetosis, myoclonus, and tremor emerge in the majority, with extrapyramidal signs often becoming prominent in variant A-T, and some adults present with isolated extrapyramidal syndromes that mimic primary torsion dystonia or myoclonus-dystonia, underscoring the need to consider A-T in unexplained movement disorders [^117HmMxC] [^116vEpk1] [^111iDgfU]. Let me reconsider the oculomotor profile: oculomotor apraxia is classic, but in variant A-T, saccadic dysmetria without frank apraxia and even near-normal eye movements can occur, which can mislead clinicians if they anchor on oculomotor apraxia as a mandatory sign [^116vEpk1] [^112ACpmf].

> Next, I should review systemic complications, starting with immunodeficiency. Classic A-T commonly shows progressive lymphopenia, particularly naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells, and variable humoral defects including IgA and IgG2 deficiency, with a subset exhibiting a hyper-IgM phenotype due to impaired class-switch recombination; these abnormalities are less frequent or milder in variant A-T, but when present correlate with infection burden and survival [^1175wekN] [^114nPomJ] [^116Jed22]. Hold on, I should verify modifiers: recent work suggests additional variants in antigen processing/presentation and DSB repair pathways, such as XRCC3, may modulate CSR defects and infection risk, offering a partial explanation for immunologic heterogeneity within shared ATM genotypes [^1164EESE] [^113j1HSg].

> I need to check pulmonary disease next, as it is a major driver of morbidity and mortality. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections with bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, and a restrictive ventilatory pattern with impaired cough mechanics are common in classic A-T and progress with age and neurological decline; in contrast, variant A-T generally lacks clinically significant respiratory disease, though vigilance remains prudent [^112w9oVY] [^112ACpmf]. But wait, what if respiratory failure is the terminal event even in long-term survivors? Yes, in classic A-T cohorts, chronic pulmonary disease and infections are leading causes of death, reinforcing the need for aggressive airway clearance, vaccination, and early treatment of exacerbations [^112w9oVY] [^111hdRo8].

> Radiosensitivity deserves explicit attention. Patients with A-T have increased clinical and cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and standard oncologic dosing can cause severe toxicity; thus, radiation protocols must be modified or avoided when possible, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for A-T in young patients with dramatic radiation reactions or atypical responses to DNA-damaging chemotherapy [^114gUdFr] [^116gF5Zu]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across the spectrum: even some variant patients can manifest clinically significant radiosensitivity despite milder cellular assays, so individualized risk assessment and multidisciplinary oncology planning are essential [^116gF5Zu].

> Now, malignancy risk and surveillance. I should confirm the magnitude: individuals with A-T have a markedly elevated risk of hematologic malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell ALL, and also face increased solid tumors with age, with a cumulative cancer incidence around 29% by age 35 in a large cohort and very high standardized mortality ratios after cancer diagnosis; notably, missense mutations in ATM are associated with milder neurology but higher malignancy risk, and treatment-related toxicities are frequent when standard regimens are used [^113Wyjon] [^116xmaP7] [^114gUdFr]. Let me verify feasibility: whole-body MRI surveillance has been piloted and appears acceptable in children and young adults with A-T, offering a radiation-sparing approach to early detection, though consensus guidelines are still evolving [^115t2NPc].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy and biomarkers. Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein is a supportive clue in childhood but can be normal in a subset of variant cases, so a normal AFP does not exclude A-T; chromosomal radiosensitivity testing and detection of characteristic 7;14 translocations can assist, but definitive diagnosis rests on biallelic ATM variants identified by targeted panels or exome sequencing, ideally with functional assessment of ATM protein expression and kinase activity when available [^114gyLnG] [^114gUdFr] [^116ycfPp]. Wait, let me verify the role of newborn screening: TREC-based assays can flag lymphopenia and prompt early evaluation, but they are not specific for A-T and require confirmatory testing; nonetheless, early recognition facilitates timely interventions for infections and developmental support [^1175wekN] [^113ZfsNE].

> Next, I should review neuroimaging correlates. MRI typically shows progressive cerebellar atrophy with vermian predominance, and susceptibility-weighted imaging frequently reveals supratentorial microbleeds or telangiectatic vessels that accumulate with age, even in childhood; these vascular-appearing lesions are often asymptomatic but underscore the broader cerebrovascular vulnerability in A-T [^1142VqAi] [^112ruWQx] [^116oBDBk]. Hold on, I should verify that these findings are not universal: some variant patients have minimal cerebellar atrophy early on, which can further delay diagnosis if imaging is used as a gatekeeper [^116vEpk1].

> Management must be multidisciplinary and anticipatory. I need to ensure we cover neurologic rehabilitation with speech therapy for dysarthria, physiotherapy for mobility and postural control, and occupational therapy for adaptive function; speech characteristics include ataxic and hyperkinetic components with reduced intelligibility, and slowing the speech rate improves communication, which should be incorporated into therapy plans [^116EFVR8] [^116CB44r] [^116VTK9p]. For immunoglobulin deficiency or recurrent infections, immunoglobulin replacement and infection prophylaxis are indicated; for pulmonary disease, airway clearance, vaccination, and aggressive treatment of exacerbations are key; for malignancy, modified chemotherapy dosing and avoidance or reduction of radiation are critical, ideally within centers experienced in A-T care [^116VTK9p] [^114gUdFr] [^113Wyjon]. I should double-check perioperative considerations: although comorbidities are common, most patients tolerate anesthesia with minor issues when planned carefully, but postoperative oxygen needs and temperature management require forethought [^1129k4DV].

> Prognosis is genotype- and complication-driven. Classic A-T confers high risks of early malignancy and respiratory failure, with median survival historically in the late teens to mid-twenties, whereas variant A-T is compatible with prolonged survival into adulthood and even parenthood in some cases, albeit with a persistent malignancy risk that mandates surveillance; notably, survival does not track tightly with neurological severity, underscoring the primacy of systemic complications [^113vrLTf] [^112ACpmf] [^114gUdFr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that variant A-T has normal life expectancy; I should correct that: while many survive decades, cancer risk remains elevated and individualized surveillance is essential even when neurology is mild [^116xmaP7] [^113Wyjon].

> Emerging therapies are investigational but mechanistically aligned. Trials of nicotinamide riboside to enhance NAD+ metabolism have shown signals of improved ataxia scores in small open-label studies, though benefits waned on withdrawal, suggesting a metabolic component amenable to modulation; similarly, triheptanoin as an anaplerotic therapy targets mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ER–mitochondria calcium coupling, with early clinical programs underway [^116z3pww] [^1155AJMh]. Let me verify the translational angle: recent work implicates ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CD98HC in amino acid transport and glutamate handling, providing a plausible mechanism for N-acetylcysteine benefit beyond antioxidant effects and identifying a novel therapeutic axis for exploration [^116ow3rF]. I should also note that biomarker development is a priority to enable rigorous trials, as current clinical scales are subjective and variable, and validated progression markers are lacking [^112i9s53] [^111PfUzA].

> Finally, I need to ensure carrier counseling is addressed. Heterozygous ATM pathogenic variant carriers are asymptomatic for A-T but have increased radiosensitivity and elevated cancer risk, particularly breast cancer, prompting discussions about risk modification and, in some settings, enhanced screening; large-scale studies are ongoing to refine age- and sex-specific risk estimates and management recommendations [^113rDrWz] [^117Musfq]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: not all ATM variants confer the same risk, so precise variant classification and family history remain critical in counseling and cascade testing strategies [^117Musfq].

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by **ATM mutations** [^114gUdFr], with a prevalence of ~1:40,000–100,000 [^112Ca6eb] and an incidence of ~1:300,000 [^114gUdFr]. It features progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and a markedly increased risk of malignancy, especially lymphoid cancers [^116oBDBk] [^113Wyjon]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, chromosomal radiosensitivity, and **ATM genetic testing** [^114gUdFr] [^112i9s53]. Management is multidisciplinary and supportive, with no curative therapy; prognosis is poor, with median survival ~25 years, often due to respiratory failure or malignancy [^113vrLTf] [^112i9s53].

---

## Genetic basis and pathophysiology

- **Gene and mutations**: A-T is caused by biallelic mutations in ATM on 11q22.3, encoding a serine/threonine kinase central to the DNA double-strand break response [^114gUdFr] [^111nJ9cD].
- **Pathophysiology**: ATM loss impairs DNA repair, checkpoint signaling, and oxidative stress responses, leading to neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and malignancy [^114gUdFr] [^113hDhAq].
- **Genotype-phenotype correlation**: Null mutations cause classic severe disease; hypomorphic mutations cause milder variant A-T with residual ATM activity and slower progression [^114gUdFr] [^116xmaP7].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### Neurological features

- **Cerebellar ataxia**: Early childhood onset, progressive, causing gait instability, dysarthria, and dysmetria [^114gUdFr] [^115trJc4].
- **Oculomotor apraxia**: Difficulty initiating saccades, a hallmark feature [^112i9s53] [^117HmMxC].
- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Dystonia, choreoathetosis, tremor, and myoclonus are common [^117HmMxC] [^116vEpk1].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Distal sensory loss and weakness occur in many patients [^112i9s53] [^112ACpmf].

---

### Systemic features

- **Telangiectasias**: Dilated conjunctival and cutaneous vessels, typically appearing by age 3–6 years [^116pRgpu] [^1142VqAi].
- **Immunodeficiency**: Variable T- and B-cell defects, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and IgA/IgG2 deficiency [^1175wekN] [^114nPomJ].
- **Radiosensitivity**: Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, complicating cancer therapy [^114gUdFr] [^116gF5Zu].
- **Malignancy**: High risk of lymphoid malignancies (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, T-ALL) and solid tumors [^113Wyjon] [^114gUdFr].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis integrates clinical features, laboratory tests, and **genetic confirmation**:

| **Diagnostic method** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Clinical evaluation | Progressive ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency [^112BkPmE] [^114gUdFr] |
| Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) | Elevated in > 95% of patients; useful screening marker [^114gyLnG] [^114gUdFr] |
| Chromosomal radiosensitivity | Increased chromosomal breakage after irradiation [^114gUdFr] |
| ATM genetic testing | Gold standard; detects pathogenic variants [^112i9s53] |

---

## Management strategies

Management is **supportive and multidisciplinary**:

- **Neurological management**: Physical therapy, speech therapy, and symptomatic treatment of movement disorders [^116EFVR8] [^113tuoxC].
- **Immunological management**: Immunoglobulin replacement, prophylactic antibiotics, and vaccination [^113ZfsNE].
- **Respiratory management**: Regular monitoring, airway clearance, and aggressive treatment of infections [^112w9oVY].
- **Oncological management**: Modified chemotherapy, avoidance of radiotherapy when possible, and close surveillance [^113Wyjon] [^116gF5Zu].

---

## Prognosis and life expectancy

Classic A-T is severe, with median survival ~25 years, often due to respiratory failure or malignancy [^113vrLTf] [^112w9oVY]. Variant A-T is milder, with slower progression and longer survival, though malignancy risk remains elevated [^116xmaP7] [^112ACpmf].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **gene therapy** to correct ATM mutations, small molecules to restore ATM function or bypass defects, and biomarker development to track disease progression and treatment response [^112i9s53] [^111PfUzA]. Early-phase trials of nicotinamide riboside and related agents targeting mitochondrial dysfunction are underway [^116z3pww] [^1155AJMh].

Ataxia telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive DNA repair disorder characterised by complex neurological symptoms, with an elevated risk of malignancy, immunodeficiency and other systemic complications. Patients with variant ataxia telangiectasia-with some preserved ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase activity-have a milder and often atypical phenotype, which can lead to long delays in diagnosis. Clinicians need to be aware of the spectrum of clinical presentations of ataxia telangiectasia, especially given the implications for malignancy surveillance and management. Here, we review the phenotypes of ataxia telangiectasia, illustrated with case reports and videos, and discuss its pathological mechanisms, diagnosis and management.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare, neurodegenerative, and multisystem disease, characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, progressive respiratory failure, and an increased risk of malignancies. It demands specialized care tailored to the individual patient's needs. Besides the classic ataxia-telangiectasia phenotype, a variant phenotype exists with partly overlapping but some distinctive disease characteristics. This guideline summarizes frequently encountered medical problems in the disease course of patients with classic and variant ataxia-telangiectasia, in the domains of neurology, immunology and infectious diseases, pulmonology, anaesthetic and perioperative risk, oncology, endocrinology, and nutrition. Furthermore, it provides a practical guide with evidence- and expert-based recommendations for the follow-up and treatment of all these different clinical topics.

Summary

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene, resulting in faulty repair of breakages in double-stranded DNA. The clinical phenotype is complex and is characterized by neurologic abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, susceptibility to malignancies, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and cutaneous abnormalities. Lung disease is common in patients with A-T and often progresses with age and neurological decline. Diseases of the respiratory system cause significant morbidity and are a frequent cause of death in the A-T population. Lung disease in this population is thought to exhibit features of one or more of the following phenotypes: recurrent sinopulmonary infections with bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, and lung disease associated with neurological abnormalities. Here, we review available evidence and present expert opinion on the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of lung disease in A-T, as discussed in a recent multidisciplinary workshop. Although more data are emerging on this unique population, many recommendations are made based on similarities to other more well-studied diseases. Gaps in current knowledge and areas for future research in the field of pulmonary disease in A-T are also outlined.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that was initially thought to present exclusively in childhood. With the discovery of the ATM gene, the phenotypic spectrum of the condition has expanded. This review elaborates the expanded phenomenology, including oculomotor apraxia and immunodeficiency, and estimates the presence of each movement disorder feature from previously reported literature. Initial manifestations of Ataxia-telangiectasia include cerebellar symptoms (67%), dystonia (18%), choreoathetosis (10%), and tremor (4%), with parkinsonism and myoclonus not reported as initial features. The prevalence of movement disorders during the course of the disease includes cerebellar symptoms (96%), dystonia (89%), parkinsonism (41%), choreoathetosis (89%), myoclonus (92%), and tremor (74%). Phenomenology and age of onset is modulated by presence of residual ATM kinase activity, with genotypes heavily truncating the ATM protein associated with the most severe phenotypes.

Introduction

Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) (OMIM 208900) is a rare autosomal recessive DNA repair disorder associated with neurodegeneration, elevated malignancy risk, respiratory disease, immunodeficiency and metabolic disruptions. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene encodes the ATM protein, a serine-threonine kinase mainly involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks and oxidative stress. Patients with a complete lack of ATM kinase activity have "classic A-T" with characteristic disabling neurological symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal features and oculomotor apraxia. Most patients are wheelchair-dependent by the time they begin their second decade of life and have a markedly reduced average life expectancy to their mid-twenties due to malignancy, lung failure, or infection. Diagnosis of A-T currently relies on clinical correlation by experienced clinicians and ordering the correct exome sequencing panels. Patients with residual ATM kinase activity have milder disease, the so-called "variant A-T", generally without respiratory insufficiency or immunodeficiency. Variant A-T patients have a diverse neurological phenotype, often leading to delayed diagnosis of sometimes up to 20 years.

A-T causes significant morbidity and there is no known cure and only supportive, non-specific treatments are available to date. With an incidence rate between 1:40,000 to 1:100,000, the scope for developing large-scale studies is challenging. In the era of widely available exome sequencing and newborn screening for immunodeficiencies, there is a need for reliable diagnostic biomarkers to prove or disapprove pathogenetic of ATM variants, and to predict the course of the disease. Previous clinical treatment studies have mainly focused on clinical severity scores such as the Scale for Assessing and Rating Ataxia (SARA), International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) or the AT-NEST score. Although severity scores are useful for rapid clinical correlation, suitably trained investigators are required to perform the clinical examination to ensure reproducibility. Mild improvements in clinical severity scores may reflect day-to-day symptom fluctuation. Disease progression biomarkers would serve as an unbiased objective measure to evaluate treatment effectiveness but they are currently lacking.

### Classic ataxia-telangiectasia: the phenotype of long-term survivors [^1149MRCc]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In its most common form, A–T is a severe, multisystem and progressive disease. Long-term survival of classic A–T is accompanied by an increase in both physical as psychosocial problems. Ongoing and structured follow-up of A–T patients, also in the final stage of their disease, is important for prevention, timely identification, and management of these problems.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^116xmaP7]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Variant ataxia-telangiectasia is caused by mutations that allow some retained ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Here, we describe the clinical features of the largest established cohort of individuals with variant ataxia-telangiectasia and explore genotype-phenotype correlations.

Methods

Cross-sectional data were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified as variant ataxia-telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity.

Results

The study includes 57 individuals. Mean age at assessment was 37.5 years. Most had their first symptoms by age 10 (81%). There was a diagnostic delay of more than 10 years in 68% and more than 20 years in one third of probands. Disease severity was mild in one third of patients, and 43% were still ambulant 20 years after disease onset. Only one third had predominant ataxia, and 18% had a pure extrapyramidal presentation. Individuals with extrapyramidal presentations had milder neurological disease severity. There were no significant respiratory or immunological complications, but 25% of individuals had a history of malignancy. Missense mutations were associated with milder neurological disease severity, but with a higher risk of malignancy, compared to leaky splice site mutations.

Interpretation

Individuals with variant ataxia-telangiectasia require malignancy surveillance and tailored management. However, our data suggest the condition may sometimes be mis- or underdiagnosed because of atypical features, including exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms, normal eye movements, and normal alpha-fetoprotein levels in some individuals. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^112qbQ6N]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The true clinical spectrum of variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is unknown, and it is not clear which factors determine the extreme clinical variability that has been reported. It is unclear whether affected individuals require specific surveillance for systemic complications and malignancy, similar to existing management recommendations of classic ataxia‐telangiectasia. 22, 23

Here, we report the clinical features of the largest established cohort of patients with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia. We provide prognostic information and explore genotype‐phenotype correlations to inform management guidelines.

### Survival probability in ataxia telangiectasia [^113vrLTf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare, multiorgan neurodegenerative disorder with enhanced vulnerability to cancer and infection. Median survival in two large cohorts of patients with this disease, one prospective and one retrospective, is 25 and 19 years, with a wide range. Life expectancy does not correlate well with severity of neurological impairment.

### Molecular pathology of ataxia telangiectasia [^113hDhAq]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is one of a group of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias. Presentation is usually by the age of 2 years and ataxia of both upper and lower limbs develops, such that by early teenage most patients require a wheelchair for mobility. Speech and eye movement are also affected. Other important features are t(7;14) translocations, immunodeficiency, a high serum alpha fetoprotein concentration, growth retardation, telangiectasia-most noticeably on the bulbar conjunctiva-and a very high risk of developing a lymphoid tumour. Patients also show an increased sensitivity to ionising radiation. The classic form of A-T results from the presence of two truncating ATM mutations, leading to total loss of the ATM protein, a protein kinase. Importantly, A-T shows clinical heterogeneity, including milder forms where neurological progression may be slower or of later onset. In these cases there is a correlation between the preservation of neurological function, decreased radiosensitivity, and the degree of retained ATM protein kinase activity. Considerable scope remains for understanding the progress of the disorder in relation to the types of ATM mutation present.

### Neurologic presentation in children with ataxia-telangiectasia: is small head circumference a hallmark of the disease? [^115trJc4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the neurologic characteristics and course of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T).

Study Design

Retrospective cross-sectional chart study of 57 children (ages 2 to 19 years) followed at an A-T clinic. Cerebellar and extracerebellar symptoms were graded according to degree of functional impairment. Head circumferences were plotted from the charts and z-scores were calculated and compared with that of family members.

Results

Ataxia was present in 87.7%, followed by dysarthria (82.1%), dysmetria (75.4%), bradykinesia (69.2%), hyperkinetic movements (58.9%), and dystonia (15.8%). All features aggravated with age. The most striking clinical observation in our patients was low head circumference (z-score below 1), which was present in 60.9%; 17% had true microcephaly (z-score below 2). Microcephaly appeared postnatally, was proportionate to height and weight, and did not correlate with severity of ataxia or genotype.

Conclusions

In addition to cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal symptoms, especially bradykinesia, were frequent and disabling. Microcephaly is an integral part of A-T; understanding its pathogenesis may shed light on the mechanism by which ATM mutation causes dysfunction in the nervous system.

### Gene expression phenotype in heterozygous carriers of ataxia telangiectasia [^113rDrWz]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The defining characteristic of recessive diseases is the absence of a phenotype in the heterozygous carriers. Nonetheless, subtle manifestations may be detectable by new methods, such as expression profiling. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a typical recessive disease, and individual carriers cannot be reliably identified. As a group, however, carriers of an AT disease allele have been reported to have a phenotype that distinguishes them from normal control individuals: increased radiosensitivity and risk of cancer. We show here that the phenotype is also detectable, in lymphoblastoid cells from AT carriers, as changes in expression level of many genes. The differences are manifested both in baseline expression levels and in response to ionizing radiation. Our findings show that carriers of a recessive disease may have an "expression phenotype". In the particular case of AT, this suggests a new approach to the identification of carriers and enhances understanding of their increased cancer risk. More generally, we demonstrate that genomic technologies offer the opportunity to identify and study unaffected carriers, who are hundreds of times more common than affected patients.

### Biomarkers in ataxia-telangiectasia: a systematic review [^115iaTys]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a very rare multisystem disease of DNA repair, associated with progressive disabling neurological symptoms, respiratory failure, immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition, leading to premature death. There are no curative treatments available for A-T but clinical trials have begun. A major limiting factor in effectively evaluating therapies for A-T is the lack of suitable outcome measures and biomarkers. We have performed a systematic review to collect the information currently available on biomarkers for A-T both in patients and preclinical studies. We have identified 56 reports discussing potential A-T biomarkers in both pre-clinical models and patients. These studies report on diagnostic biomarkers but prognostic biomarkers and responsive markers of clinical status are currently lacking. Some biomarkers of neurodegeneration in A-T show promise, including non-invasive neuroimaging biomarkers. Some biomarkers of oxidative stress and responsive markers to radiotherapy and steroid treatment have potential value in clinical trials. The formation of the A-T biomarker working group with international experts is an important step forward to facilitate the sharing of materials, data and expertise with the common goal of finding effective biomarkers for A-T.

### Classic ataxia-telangiectasia: the phenotype of long-term survivors [^114kFhD1]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ataxia telangiectasia (A–T) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene, coding for an enzyme that plays a role in cell cycle control and DNA repair. A–T is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal movement disorders, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency and pulmonary dysfunction. Due to the underlying DNA repair defect, patients are radiosensitive and at increased risk of cancer. Most patients become wheelchair bound around the age of 10 years and generally die in the second or third decade of life due to malignancies or respiratory insufficiency.

Some A–T patients survive beyond the age of 30 years. Most of them have 'variant A-T' and their prolonged survival results from the presence of some residual ATM kinase activity. These patients have a milder neurological disease course with absence of immunodeficiency and pulmonary problems. A small proportion of A–T patients who survive beyond the age of 30 years, however, lack ATM kinase activity and have classic A–T. These patients are labelled 'long-term survivors', representing exceptional cases in a group with a severely reduced life-expectancy. Detailed descriptions of long-term survivors with classic A–T are rare and were never studied systematically. Importantly, improvements in symptomatic treatment of patients with A–T may lead to an increase in survival. Therefore, the problems that older patients with A-T are confronted with, need to be recognized. Here we aim to comprehensively define the phenotype of long-term survivors with classic A–T by combining data from the Dutch cohort with a review of the literature.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia in iran: clinical and laboratory features of 104 patients [^116PcdaJ]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a multisystem disorder characterized by progressive neurologic impairment, variable immunodeficiency, impaired organ maturation, x-ray hypersensitivity, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and a predisposition to malignancy. To evaluate clinical and immunologic features of Iranian patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, the records of 104 patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (54 male, 50 female) with the age range of 1.6–23.5 years were reviewed. The Iranian Primary Immunodeficiency Registry was used as the data source. Progressive ataxia was seen in all the patients. Other symptoms were eye movement disorders (n = 84), slurred speech (n = 70), mental retardation (n = 10), and ocular (n = 87) and cutaneous (n = 73) telangiectasia. Three patients developed leukemia and lymphoma, and 17 patients had family history of malignancy. Positive correlation was seen between clinical immunologic symptoms and immunoglobulin deficiencies (P = 0.004). The predominant infections were sinopulmonary and acute and recurrent infections (78 cases). Infections included pneumonia (56 patients), otitis media (34 patients), and sinusitis (50 patients). Average serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 149 ± 137 ng/dL. The incidence of ataxia-telangiectasia in Iran is high, possibly due to familial marriages. Treatment should be focused on supportive management to prolong survival.

### First international workshop of the ATM and cancer risk group (4–5 December 2019) [^117Musfq]. Familial Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The first International Workshop of the ATM and Cancer Risk group focusing on the role of Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene in cancer was held on December 4 and 5, 2019 at Institut Curie in Paris, France. It was motivated by the fact that germline ATM pathogenic variants have been found to be associated with different cancer types. However, due to the lack of precise age-, sex-, and site-specific risk estimates, no consensus on management guidelines for variant carriers exists, and the clinical utility of ATM variant testing is uncertain. The meeting brought together epidemiologists, geneticists, biologists and clinicians to review current knowledge and on-going challenges related to ATM and cancer risk. This report summarizes the meeting sessions content that covered the latest results in family-based and population-based studies, the importance of accurate variant classification, the effect of radiation exposures for ATM variant carriers, and the characteristics of ATM-deficient tumors. The report concludes that ATM variant carriers outside of the context of Ataxia-Telangiectasia may benefit from effective cancer risk management and therapeutic strategies and that efforts to set up large-scale studies in the international framework to achieve this goal are necessary.

### Clinical spectrum of ataxia-telangiectasia in adulthood [^115cCpUN]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the phenotype of adult patients with variant and classic ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), to raise the degree of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis variant A-T, and to assess a genotype-phenotype relationship for mutations in the ATM gene.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics and course of disease in 13 adult patients with variant A-T of 9 families and 6 unrelated adults with classic A-T and mutation analysis of the ATM gene and measurements of ATM protein expression and kinase activity.

Results

Patients with variant A-T were only correctly diagnosed in adulthood. They often presented with extrapyramidal symptoms in childhood, whereas cerebellar ataxia appeared later. Four patients with variant A-T developed a malignancy. Patients with classic and variant A-T had elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and chromosome 7/14 rearrangements. The mildest variant A-T phenotype was associated with missense mutations in the ATM gene that resulted in expression of some residual ATM protein with kinase activity. Two splicing mutations, c.331 + 5G > A and c.496 + 5G > A, caused a more severe variant A-T phenotype. The splicing mutation c.331 + 5G > A resulted in less ATM protein and kinase activity than the missense mutations.

Conclusions

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) should be considered in patients with unexplained extrapyramidal symptoms. Early diagnosis is important given the increased risk of malignancies and the higher risk for side effects of subsequent cancer treatment. Measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein and chromosomal instability precipitates the correct diagnosis. There is a clear genotype-phenotype relation for A-T, since the severity of the phenotype depends on the amount of residual kinase activity as determined by the genotype.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases associated with neurologic manifestations [^1129STaP]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of the immune system, predisposing individuals to recurrent infections, allergy, autoimmunity, and malignancies. A considerable number of these conditions have been found to be also associated with neurologic signs and symptoms. These manifestations are considered core features of some immunodeficiency syndromes, such as ataxia-telangiectasia and purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, or occur less prominently in some others. Diverse pathological mechanisms including defective responses to DNA damage, metabolic errors, and autoimmune phenomena have been associated with neurologic abnormalities; however, several issues remain to be elucidated. Greater awareness of these associated features and gaining a better understanding of the contributing mechanisms will lead to prompt diagnosis and treatment and possibly development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we aim to provide a brief description of the clinical and genetic characteristics of PID associated with neurologic complications.

### Cerebral abnormalities in adults with ataxia-telangiectasia [^116oBDBk]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defect of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene, is characterized by progressive neurologic impairment with cerebellar atrophy, ocular and cutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation and susceptibility to developing lymphoreticular malignancy. Supratentorial brain abnormalities have been reported only rarely. In this study, brain MRI was performed in 10 adults with ataxia-telangiectasia having stable neurologic impairment. Intracerebral telangiectasia with multiple punctate hemosiderin deposits were identified in 60% of subjects. These lesions were apparently asymptomatic. They are similar in appearance to radiation-induced telangiectasia and to cryptogenic vascular malformations. Also noted, in the 2 oldest subjects, was extensive white matter T2 hyperintensity, and in 1 of these a space-occupying fluid collection consistent with transudative capillary leak and edema as evidenced by reduced levels of metabolites on MR spectroscopic imaging. Asymptomatic supratentorial vascular abnormalities appear to be common in adults with ataxia-telangiectasia.

### Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia [^116EFVR8]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia is characterized by uncontrolled, ataxic, and involuntary movements; therefore, the primary advice to improve speech is positioning the individual in a stable sitting position. 28 Attention to breath control and speaking at the beginning of an exhalation is the next step in therapy. 21 Finally, speech intelligibility often improves by slowing down the rate of speech.

Besides providing information on the type and severity of dysarthria in individuals with ataxia telangiectasia, this study illustrates the availability and potential applicability of two recently developed clinical instruments to assess the characteristics and severity of dysarthria in children and adults in general. These instruments may provide useful tools for monitoring the effects of speech therapy of individuals with ataxia telangiectasia, as well as objective outcome measures in clinical research, especially in future therapeutic intervention studies.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^1154Ymsp]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is caused by mutations that allow some retained ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated (ATM) kinase activity. Here, we describe the clinical features of the largest established cohort of individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia and explore genotype‐phenotype correlations.

Methods

Cross‐sectional data were collected retrospectively. Patients were classified as variant ataxia‐telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity.

Results

The study includes 57 individuals. Mean age at assessment was 37.5 years. Most had their first symptoms by age 10 (81%). There was a diagnostic delay of more than 10 years in 68% and more than 20 years in one third of probands. Disease severity was mild in one third of patients, and 43% were still ambulant 20 years after disease onset. Only one third had predominant ataxia, and 18% had a pure extrapyramidal presentation. Individuals with extrapyramidal presentations had milder neurological disease severity. There were no significant respiratory or immunological complications, but 25% of individuals had a history of malignancy. Missense mutations were associated with milder neurological disease severity, but with a higher risk of malignancy, compared to leaky splice site mutations.

Interpretation

Individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia require malignancy surveillance and tailored management. However, our data suggest the condition may sometimes be mis‐ or underdiagnosed because of atypical features, including exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms, normal eye movements, and normal alpha‐fetoprotein levels in some individuals. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes.

### Progressive depletion of B and T lymphocytes in patients with ataxia telangiectasia: results of the Italian primary immunodeficiency network [^114nPomJ]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a rare genetic multisystem disorder of childhood due to mutations in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene. To date, over 600 distinct ATM mutations have been reported. Different types of ATM gene mutations are associated to different forms of the disease. Truncating mutations are related to the classic form of AT and are associated to the complete absence of the protein function. Splice site mutations or missense mutations allow for some residual ATM kinase activity, and this causes milder forms of AT. ATM protein exerts a central role in the signal-transduction pathway activated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); therefore, AT is considered the prototype of the DNA-repair defect syndromes. Of note, gene rearrangements and DSBs repair by ATM are required for a proper maturation of either T or B cells. Moreover, in B cells the absence of a functional ATM protein leads to a defect in class switch recombination (CSR), thus supporting a role of ATM also in this process.

The clinical phenotype of AT mainly includes oculocutaneous telangiectasia; immunodeficiency; growth failure; autoimmune diseases; endocrine, hepatic, and cardiovascular disorders; high incidence of neoplasms; and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiations. The hallmark of the disease is a progressive neurological degeneration, with ataxia and movement disorders, due to selective depletion of Purkinje cells, invariably confining the patients to wheelchair with great worsening of the quality of life. Both humoral and cellular immune system may be impaired, being characterized by inadequate production of immunoglobulins, T cell lymphopenia, and defective proliferative response to mitogens, predisposing to recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections.

The aim of this study is to better define the immunological features and the clinical immune-related manifestations at diagnosis and during follow-up of an Italian cohort of AT patients. Results are compared to the genotype.

### The critically ill patient with ataxia-telangiectasia: a case series [^112xJ7LA]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the presentation, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with ataxia-telangiectasia.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Setting

Adult and pediatric intensive care units at an urban tertiary academic center.

Patients

Seven consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia had nine intensive care admissions between January 1995 and December 2009.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Mean age at time of admission 15.9 yrs (median, 13.9 yrs; range, 7.3–33.9 yrs). Mean duration of intensive care unit stay was 17 days (median, 9 days; range, 2–39 days). The most common admitting diagnosis was respiratory distress (six of seven patients). There was no difference in ventilator settings or duration of intensive care unit stay between survivors and nonsurvivors (p > .05). Forty-three percent (three of seven patients) survived to intensive care unit discharge with a 3-yr survival that was 14% (one of seven patients).

Conclusions

Critically ill patients with ataxia-telangiectasia have complex, multisystem diseases. In this case series, the most common intensive care unit admission diagnosis was respiratory failure. Suspected or confirmed bacterial infections were prevalent. Neuropathologic autopsy findings were similar to those previously reported. Special considerations for the critical care of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia are discussed.

### ATM: translating the DNA damage response to adaptive immunity [^116MJXQG]. Trends in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

ATM is often dubbed the master regulator of the DNA double stranded break (DSB) response. Since proper induction and repair of DNA DSBs forms the core of immunological diversity, it is surprising that patients with ataxia telangiectasia generally have a mild immunodeficiency in contrast to other DSB repair syndromes. In this review, we address this discrepancy by delving into the functions of ATM in DSB repair and cell cycle control and translate these to adaptive immunity. We conclude that ATM, despite its myriad functions, is not an absolute requirement for acquiring sufficient levels of immunological diversity to prevent severe viral and opportunistic infections. There is, however, a more clinically pronounced antibody deficiency in ataxia telangiectasia due to disturbed class switch recombination.

### The pleiotropic movement disorders phenotype of adult ataxia-telangiectasia [^116vEpk1]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the clinical spectrum of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) in adults, with a focus on movement disorders.

Methods

A total of 14 consecutive adults with A-T were included at 2 tertiary adult movement disorders centers and compared to 53 typical patients with A-T. Clinical evaluation, neurophysiologic and video-oculographic recording, imaging, laboratory investigations, and ATM analysis were performed.

Results

In comparison with typical A-T cases, our patients demonstrated later mean age at onset (6.1 vs 2.5 years, p < 0.0001), later loss of walking ability (p = 0.003), and longer survival (p = 0.0039). The presenting feature was ataxia in 71% and dysarthria and dystonia in 14% each. All patients displayed movement disorders, among which dystonia and subcortical myoclonus were the most common (86%), followed by tremor (43%). Video-oculographic recordings revealed mostly dysmetric saccades and 46% of patients had normal latencies (i.e., no oculomotor apraxia) and velocities. The α-fetoprotein (AFP) level was normal in 7%, chromosomal instability was found in 29% (vs 100% of typical patients, p = 0.0006), and immunoglobulin deficiency was found in 29% (vs 69%, p = 0.057). All patients exhibited 2 ATM mutations, including at least 1 missense mutation in 79% of them (vs 36%, p = 0.0067).

Conclusion

There is great variability of phenotype and severity in A-T, including a wide spectrum of movement disorders. Karyotype and repeated AFP level assessments should be performed in adults with unexplained movement disorders as valuable clues towards the diagnosis. In case of a compatible phenotype, A-T should be considered even if age at onset is late and progression is slow.

### Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^114gUdFr]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) — definition, incidence, and phenotype — AT is an autosomal recessive multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous system, immune system, and respiratory system, with individuals having a high risk of malignancy, particularly leukemia and lymphoma, and a very high risk of BC at a young age, alongside increased radiosensitivity at both the cellular and clinical level; oculocutaneous telangiectasia and raised alpha-fetoprotein are helpful clues for making the clinical diagnosis. The incidence of AT has been estimated at between 1 in 300,000 and 1 in 100,000. Classical AT occurs in people who have biallelic ATM GPVs, which result in absent ATM protein or a mutant protein with no ATM kinase activity, with other laboratory findings including increased chromosomal radiosensitivity and increased chromosomal translocations in T-lymphocytes involving T cell receptor genes on chromosomes 7 and 14; clinically, classical AT usually presents with unsteadiness in early childhood, and children lose ambulation before their teenage years, neurological features include cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, extrapyramidal features (such as dystonia or chorea), oculomotor apraxia, and peripheral neuropathy, and individuals with classical AT have a predisposition to lymphoid tumors in childhood or as young adults and a predisposition to developing BC at a young age.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^114hmHrL]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Ataxia‐telangiectasia is a rare autosomal‐recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene on chromosome 11q22.3 (MIM 208900). 1 The ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated (ATM) protein is a serine‐threonine protein kinase, which phosphorylates more than 700 substrates and is a key player in the cellular response to double‐stranded DNA damage. 2 The clinical and genetic features of ataxia‐telangiectasia vary, and two forms of the disease have been described.

Classic (or typical) ataxia‐telangiectasia presents with a severe phenotype and has an estimated incidence of 1 in 300,000. 3 Individuals with classic ataxia‐telangiectasia have absent ATM kinase activity, 4 either attributed to two null mutations or mutations which result in protein without ATM kinase activity. It is a multisystem neurodegenerative disease which also causes immunological defects, respiratory problems, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and an increased risk of malignancy. 5, 6 Affected children are usually wheelchair bound before teenage years and have severe neurological disability, including cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal features, oculomotor dyspraxia, and polyneuropathy. 7 Most individuals with classic ataxia‐telangiectasia die before the age of 30; malignancy or respiratory failure are the main causes of death. 8, 9

In addition to classic ataxia‐telangiectasia a second form, variant ataxia‐telangiectasia has been described as a cause of neurological dysfunction. 10, 11 A study of 51 patients with ataxia‐telangiectasia (including 9 with retained ATM kinase activity) showed that individuals with retained ATM kinase activity have a milder neurological phenotype. 4 Variant ataxia‐telangiectasia results either from leaky splice site mutations which allow expression of some normal ATM protein or missense mutations which produce a mutant ATM protein with activity. 12 It has been speculated that the presence of some ATM kinase activity relates to a milder neurological phenotype and a lower risk of systemic complications. Furthermore, a range of atypical neurological presentations have been reported to occur in some individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia.

Previously published reports of variant ataxia‐telangiectasia are limited to small cohorts of less than 15 individuals 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 or case studies of unusual presentations. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

### ATM specifically mediates repair of double-strand breaks with blocked DNA ends [^111nJ9cD]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia is caused by mutations in ATM and represents a paradigm for cancer predisposition and neurodegenerative syndromes linked to deficiencies in the DNA-damage response. The role of ATM as a key regulator of signalling following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been dissected in extraordinary detail, but the impact of this process on DSB repair still remains controversial. Here we develop novel genetic and molecular tools to modify the structure of DSB ends and demonstrate that ATM is indeed required for efficient and accurate DSB repair, preventing cell death and genome instability, but exclusively when the ends are irreversibly blocked. We therefore identify the nature of ATM involvement in DSB repair, presenting blocked DNA ends as a possible pathogenic trigger of ataxia telangiectasia and related disorders.

### Biomarkers in ataxia-telangiectasia: a systematic review [^116PkuNu]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Systematic review protocol

We aimed to identify specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for A-T. The parameters for the systematic review were defined by the A-T International Working Group meeting and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42024536897). The systematic review is reported following the guidelines set out by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. (10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097).

Literature search strategy

To include all existing literature on biomarkers in A-T, we searched PubMed using a combination of free words and controlled vocabulary terms — (ataxia telangiectasia OR ATM OR AT OR Louis-Bar syndrome) AND (biomarker OR surrogate marker OR marker) on 25th August 2022. We restricted the time frame to 1995 to present, as the ATM mutation underlying A-T was first reported and described in 1995 (10.1126/science.7792600).

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^112ACpmf]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study describes the largest published cohort of individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia who have undergone detailed genetic and clinical evaluation. We show that all individuals included in this survey have neurological involvement, while systemic features are mild or absent, apart from an increased risk of malignancy.

Our study confirms that disease severity in variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is milder compared to the classic form. Our cohort includes 31 patients aged ≥ 40 years, 26% were still ambulant, 6 had children, and 11 were in paid or voluntary employment. Consistent with other reports, 13 the majority of individuals included in this study had their symptom onset in early childhood. However, disease progression is then much slower than in the classic form.

We formally graded disease severity according to a combination of neurological rating scales (A‐T NEST, SARA) and assessment of mobility and self‐care. According to this grading, 32% of patients had mild disease and only 19% severe disease. Similar to multiple sclerosis, another multisystem neurological disease, we have chosen to grade disease severity mainly according to functional impairment and mobility. 34 Further studies will be required to validate our severity rating.

All individuals in our cohort showed neurological abnormalities on clinical examination. A range of neurological systems were affected (cerebellum, peripheral nerves, eye movements, and extrapyramidal system), but none universally. For example, 10 individuals had no significant cerebellar features, 11 had normal eye movements, and 8 had no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement. A large proportion had extrapyramidal symptoms, and in some, extrapyramidal presentation was the predominant or only clinical feature. The most common extrapyramidal symptoms were dystonia and dystonic tremor. Chorea and parkinsonism were rare. Presence of exclusive extrapyramidal symptoms has not been reported in classic A‐T. This suggests possible differences in neuronal vulnerability and pathways between the classic and variant form of the disease and could be further explored with imaging studies.

### Conventional MRI findings in hereditary degenerative ataxias: a pictorial review [^1142VqAi]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia

Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a primary immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in AT mutated (ATM) gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase. Disease onset is usually between 6 and 18 months, and the clinical phenotype can be highly variable, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculo-cutaneous telangiectasia, variable immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, susceptibility to malignancies, and metabolic disorders. Involuntary movements (e.g. chorea, dystonia, athetosis, myoclonic jerks, or various tremors) can be present, while cognitive impairment is usually observed in up to 30% of patients. Disease duration is less than 25 years, with the two most common causes of exitus that are chronic pulmonary diseases and malignancy.

At brain MRI, AT patients typically demonstrates progressive cerebellar atrophy, with significant vermian involvement (Fig. 12). In addition, in some cases, supratentorial white matter T2-weighted and SWI hypointensities can be detected, representing hemosiderin deposits and deep cerebral telangiectatic vessels (Fig. 12). In older patients, diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensity of the cerebral white matter can be found as an expression of vascular damage.

### DNA damage-induced signalling in ataxia-telangiectasia and related syndromes [^1119shLA]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

ATM, the protein mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia, functions by responding to radiation damage to DNA, primarily DNA double strand breaks (dsb), to reduce the risk of genome instability, cancer and neurodegeneration. ATM is rapidly activated as an existing protein to phosphorylate a number of downstream proteins that are involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint activation. While the exact mechanism of activation of ATM has not been determined, it is now evident that it relies heavily on the Mre11 complex (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) and a series of post-translational events for this activation. The Mre11 complex acts as a sensor for the break, recruits ATM to this site where it is autophosphorylated and then is capable of phosphorylating substrates that participate in DNA repair and cell cycle control. A greater understanding of how ATM is activated and functions through different signalling pathways is paramount to devising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of A-T patients. This knowledge can also be used to advantage in sensitizing cells to radiation and ultimately deriving novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer.

### Ataxia telangiectasia: presentation and diagnostic delay [^113dwYc6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare progressive, multisystem genetic disease. Families of children with ultra-rare diseases often experience significant diagnostic delays. We reviewed the diagnostic process for A-T in order to identify causes of delay in an attempt to facilitate earlier identification of A-T in the future.

Methods

A retrospective case note review of 79 children at the National Paediatric A-T clinic seen since May 2009. Data were collected on the nature and age of initial symptoms, the age at first presentation, measurement of alpha feto-protein (AFP) and age of genetic diagnostic confirmation.

Results

At presentation, 71 children (90%) had ataxia. The median presentation delay (from first parental concern to presentation) was 8months (range 0–118months), and the median diagnostic delay (genetic confirmation of diagnosis) was 12months (range 1–109months).

Conclusions

There are significant delays in presentation and diagnostic confirmation of A-T. A greater awareness of A-T and early measurement of AFP may help to improve this.

### Variant ataxia telangiectasia identified during evaluation for short stature [^116CDsW1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) (OMIM 208900) is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterised by progressive cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency and a predisposition to malignancy. 'Variant' A-T has later onset of neurological symptoms and slower progression compared with the 'classic' form. A woman presented with short stature in late childhood. Karyotype revealed rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and 14. A chromosomal breakage disorder gene panel demonstrated compound heterozygote mutations in her ATM gene including one mutation c.7271T > G with residual ATM function, confirming the diagnosis of variant A-T. Since diagnosis, she has developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and telangiectasias. Long-standing restrictive and aversive feeding behaviours presented challenges for her management and necessitated gastrostomy.

### ATM expression and activation in ataxia telangiectasia patients with and without class switch recombination defects [^113ZfsNE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ataxia telangiectasia is characterized by a heightened sensitivity to radiation and inborn errors of immunity, both of which have been evaluated by in-vivo and in-vitro assays in A-T patients. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of this sensitivity, it is crucial to identify the molecular defect related to ATM protein activation. This should be initiated by the evaluation of residual expression or function in affected individuals and be linked with the prognosis of the disease. In our study, we investigated nine A-T patients with an assessment of their ATM expression and activation as the p-ATM under radiation.

The median age of diagnosis of A-T in our patients was 3 (IQR: 1.75–7.5) years, which was lower than that reported in other studies: 11 (IQR: 5.7–17) years, 5 (IQR:3–7) years, and 5.3 (IQR: 2.9–8.0) years. Patients with A-T are rarely diagnosed in their first year of life, as their typical neurological manifestations are noted at a later age, often leading to misdiagnosis. Early detection in newborns can lead to a correct diagnosis and early interventions, including specialized care for pulmonary function, prophylactic antibiotics or Ig replacement therapy for recurrent infections, and adapted treatment for malignancies. Classic A-T patients have no symptoms in their first year of life, but progressive symptoms start shortly thereafter. Therefore, an early diagnosis and predictor of the severity of the disease are crucial in providing appropriate medical support and interventions for these patients.

### Genetic risk variants for class switching recombination defects in ataxia-telangiectasia patients [^116Jed22]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), also known as Louis-Bar syndrome (OMIM #208,900), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase (ATM). A-T patients exhibit a broad range of clinical manifestations, including progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, variable immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and susceptibility to malignancies. Other phenotypes such as infections, pulmonary diseases, insulin-resistant diabetes, growth failure, gonadal atrophy, cutaneous abnormality, and metabolic and cardiovascular disease have also been reported in these patients. The ATM protein plays a major role in DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair, cell cycle regulation, and genomic stability. Furthermore, ATM plays important role in B and T cell development (particularly in antigen receptor rearrangement) and class switching recombination (CSR) in mature B cells.

Overall, A-T patients manifest significantly variable clinical and immunological features without genotype–phenotype correlation, involving modifying factors. Based on serum immunoglobulins (Ig) profile, patients with A-T could be assigned to one of the following subgroups: normal Ig level, IgA deficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, and hyper IgM (HIgM) phenotype known as Ig CSR defect (CSR-D). The most frequent immunodeficiencies in A-T individuals are related to IgG2 and IgA deficiencies. On the other hand, a minority of A-T patients present HIgM phenotype, who manifest low switched Igs (IgG, IgA, and IgE) with normal or increased IgM. In our previous study performed in 2017, we showed that about 20% of A-T patients show Ig CSR-D. Generally, A-T patients with HIgM experience a more severe course of the disease leading to a lower quality of life and shorter survival.

### X-linked TLR7 deficiency underlies critical COVID-19 pneumonia in a male patient with ataxia-telangiectasia [^115QD1Ck]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

IEIs other than those disrupting type I IFN have not been reported to underlie critical COVID-19. Among them, ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, pleiotropic, autosomal recessive IEI due to ATM gene mutations, presenting with cerebellar degeneration with ataxia, ocular and cutaneous telangiectasias, progressive childhood-onset immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility, and radiation sensitivity. A-T patients may exhibit a combined immunodeficiency with recurrent infections, neurological complications and a shortened lifespan. However, their potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown. Herein, we present the detailed clinical, immunological and genetic characterization of a unique IEI patient with critical COVID-19 pneumonia, who has pathogenic mutations in both X-linked TLR7 and autosomal ATM (reported as P6 in a large COVID-19 cohort, with a TLR7 mutation).

### Ataxia-telangiectasia presenting with a novel immunodeficiency [^11257EfR]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and variable degrees of immunodeficiency. Immunologic evaluations of affected patients often reveal anomalies of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We describe a case of ataxia-telangiectasia with an atypical immunodeficiency and a novel mutation in the ATM gene. The patient presented at age 3 years with a perineal cellulitis associated with profound neutropenia and T-cell lymphopenia. Serum immunoglobulin levels and antibody titers were normal. Neurologic evaluation revealed minimal hypotonia and wide-based gait, without other signs of cerebellar dysfunction. The alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated, and molecular genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia, uncovering a novel ATM gene mutation c.3931C > T (p. Gln1311X) in exon 28. This patient presents a unique immunologic pattern with normal immunoglobulin levels, significant lymphopenia, and profound neutropenia. The diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia should be considered in children presenting with gait disorder and immunologic defects, regardless of subtype and severity.

### Severe reaction to radiotherapy for breast cancer as the presenting feature of ataxia telangiectasia [^116gF5Zu]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The relationship between the clinical and cellular radiosensitivity in patient A-T213 is of some importance because despite not having the more extreme cellular radiosensitivity of a 'classical A-T patient', she clearly showed a severe clinical radiosensitivity. There are insufficient data to relate the severity of the clinical end point to that of the cellular end point, in terms of radiosensitivity. It is not possible to determine whether the residual activity of ATM protein expressed in her cells afforded her some degree of protection against the worst possible effect of the irradiation dose or, more generally, what is the threshold of cellular radiosensitivity that will result in a clinically severe reaction to IR.

### Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia [^115miuMC]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides classic ataxia telangiectasia, there is a milder clinical phenotype which is designated 'variant ataxia telangiectasia'. Individuals with this have residual ATM kinase activity, 5 which is associated with a later onset (80% have their first symptoms by age of 10y 6), fewer systemic symptoms, and milder neurological impairment. 7 In addition, individuals with variant ataxia telangiectasia have much longer lifespans compared with individuals with the classic form. 4, 7

As part of the complex cerebellar and extrapyramidal movement disorders in ataxia telangiectasia, dysarthria is a common symptom. 8, 9 Although the literature describes the occurrence of dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia, little attention has been given to the precise description of its characteristics and to the resulting communication limitations in these individuals. Ten years ago, we studied the characteristics of cognition and speech in eight children with ataxia telangiectasia, and showed that dysarthria was present in all participants. 9 All children had a mixture of the ataxic and hyperkinetic types of dysarthria. In most of the children, speech was moderately to severely affected, and they were hampered by decreased speech intelligibility. The speech‐related activities and functional capabilities in these children were not studied. Because dysarthria has a profound impact on children's development, social interactions, and quality of life, knowledge about dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia is essential to optimize speech and language therapy, and by doing so to improve quality of life.

Standardized and validated assessment tools to examine dysarthria in general, let alone in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia, are lacking. For adults, the need for such a tool is covered by the Radboud Dysarthria Assessment (RDA), which was finished and released in 2014. 10, 11 Since speech problems in children differ from those found in adults, a paediatric version of this assessment, the paediatric RDA (p‐RDA), was finished and released in 2019. 12

The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the characteristics and severity of dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia, using the RDA and the p‐RDA. In this way, we aimed to get more insights into the motor abnormalities that underlie dysarthria in individuals with ataxia telangiectasia, as well as their functional consequences, to improve advice for treatment and training by speech language pathologists.

### Genetic risk variants for class switching recombination defects in ataxia-telangiectasia patients [^114puGVb]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we identified variants at loci involved in antigen processing and presentation pathways and DSB repair pathway using a case–control comparative approach between groups of A-T patients differing in class switching recombination. The presence of these variants along with ATM mutations may suggest mechanisms involved in the CSR defect phenotype observed in a subset of A-T patients.

The clinical features of A-T are complex and multi-systemic, including neurological abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, recurrent infections, immunodeficiencies, and susceptibility to cancers. In this study, all A-T patients exhibited ataxia and telangiectasia as the main clinical features, but there was no significant difference between the onsets of these manifestations in the two groups. Moreover, we did not observe a significant difference between the onsets of other clinical manifestations in the two groups. Recurrent infections are the most common manifestation associated with immunodeficiency in A-T patients and a major factor for early age morbidity and mortality. We found significantly increased episodes of infections (especially respiratory tract infections) in the CSR-D group compared to the CSR-N group. Since environmental factors should be considered the main modifying factor, the female frequency was higher in previously reported cases with CSR-D compared to CSR-N, as was observed in the current assay as well.

### Anesthetic and perioperative risk in the patient with ataxia-telangiectasia [^1129k4DV]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Aim

To report our relatively large experience with perioperative care for patients with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) and to identify the nature and frequency of complications.

Background

Ataxia-Telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting in progressive multisystem degeneration and characteristic findings including complex neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, increased risk of malignancy, and lung disease. Anecdotal reports have suggested high perioperative morbidity in patients with A-T, but few data exist.

Methods/Materials

The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Clinical Center database was cross-referenced with operative records between 1995 and 2009 to identify patients with perioperative A-T, and medical records were reviewed for preoperative history, management techniques, and complications.

Results

Twenty-one patients with A-T underwent 34 anesthetics during the study period. The median age was 12.5 years (range 6–33 years). Common comorbidities included neurologic (100%), pulmonary (68%), immunologic (50%), oncologic (47%), and gastroenterologic (35%) disorders. Supplemental oxygen was required on postanesthesia care unit discharge for 24% of patients with a maximal duration of 24 h. Although mild postoperative hypothermia was relatively common (44% of anesthetics), there were no major complications, no unplanned admissions, and no mortality in this series.

Conclusions

Although limited by its retrospective nature, this is the first series describing perioperative risk for patients with A-T. Our results indicate that general anesthesia, airway manipulation, and perioperative mechanical ventilation may be tolerated with only minor postoperative anesthetic concerns. Perioperative providers should be aware of the complex multisystem medical concerns that may arise in these patients.

### Biomarkers in ataxia-telangiectasia: a systematic review [^1175wekN]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunodeficiency

Most classic A-T patients show variable signs of immunodeficiency that, conversely, are uncommon in patients with variant A-T. Cases of A-T have been diagnosed using the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC)-base newborn screening. Reduced T- and B-cell counts, principally naïve CD4 + T, CD8 + T and B cell numbers, are found in almost all classic A-T patients. Of note, in an Italian cohort of 66 A-T patients, lymphopenia at diagnosis was associated with earlier age at disease onset and reduced life expectancy.

Deficiency of humoral immunity in A-T is more variable, including decreased or absent serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG 2, or IgE, increased serum IgM levels, and impairment of antibody responses to a variety of microbial antigens. In one retrospective study on 61 A-T patients, selective deficiency of IgG 2 and the hyper IgM phenotype correlated with reduced survival. Immunodeficiency in these patients may become clinically apparent over time due to progressive ageing of the immune system in the context of reduced ATM kinase activity.

Ineffective immune responses against viruses and cancer may contribute to A-T disease progression and reduced survival. Monitoring of immunoglobulin levels to characterize individual immunodeficiency profiles and prevent risk of infection is recommended.

### Variant ataxia-telangiectasia presenting as primary-appearing dystonia in Canadian mennonites [^111iDgfU]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the phenotype of primary-appearing dystonia due to variant ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) with that of other dystonia ascertained for genetics research.

Methods

Movement disorder specialists examined 20 Canadian Mennonite adult probands with primary-appearing dystonia, as well as relatives in 4 families with parent-child transmission of dystonia. We screened for the exon 43 c.6200 C > A (p. A2067D) ATM mutation and mutations in DYT1 and DYT6. Clinical features of the individuals with dystonia who were harboring ATM mutations were compared with those of individuals without mutations.

Result

Genetic analysis revealed a homozygous founder mutation in ATM in 13 members from 3 of the families, and no one harbored DYT6 or DYT1 mutations. Dystonia in ATM families mimicked other forms of early-onset primary torsion dystonia, especially DYT6, with prominent cervical, cranial, and brachial involvement. Mean age at onset was markedly younger in the patients with variant A-T (n = 12) than in patients with other dystonia (n = 23), (12 years vs 40 years, p < 0.05). The patients with A-T were remarkable for the absence of notable cerebellar atrophy on MRI, lack of frank ataxia on examination, and absence of ocular telangiectasias at original presentation, as well as the presence of prominent myoclonus-dystonia in 2 patients. Many also developed malignancies.

Conclusion

Ataxia and telangiectasias may not be prominent features of patients with variant A-T treated for dystonia in adulthood, and variant A-T may mimic primary torsion dystonia and myoclonus-dystonia.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated loss-of-function displays variant and tissue-specific differences across tumor types [^113jDNAN]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity in response has limited the efficacy of targeted therapies, such as DNA-damaging chemotherapies, radiation, and DDR inhibitors, against cancers harboring ATM LOF. Due to the fact that ATM kinase dysfunction affects multiple downstream pathways that mediate cell survival and proliferation, as well as the prevalence of ATM LOF across cancer types, ATM aberrations have the potential to be exploited for biomarker development, although efforts to do so have yet to be clinically successful in a pan-cancer fashion. Here, we begin elucidating the factors linking specific ATM aberrations to clinical outcomes. We performed the largest and most comprehensive pan-cancer study of ATM aberrations to date and showed that variants in the ATM gene are found across the entirety of the coding sequence and across cancer types, with the majority of variants identified as missense variants and unique to a single individual with cancer (Fig. 3). Notably, we identified "hotspots" for ATM variants shared between patients, which have not been previously well described. Furthermore, we showed that the kinase domain of the gene was significantly more likely to have disease-associated missense variants with a known deleterious impact on the associated ATM protein function, which is consistent with an analysis of ATM missense mutations in TCGA.

### Simple measurement of IgA predicts immunity and mortality in ataxia-telangiectasia [^112es3xG]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The potential immunopathogenic mechanisms with reference to this clinical heterogeneity are often not clear but have resulted in a plethora of possible mechanisms in those patients with mild or severe clinical phenotype. This prompted us to analyze the clinical history and immunological data of patients with classical A-T with and without IgA deficiency who attended the Frankfurt Goethe-University Hospital and the mortality data of the European Society for Immunodeficiency (ESID) registry.

### ATM signalling and cancer [^114UmLR5]. Oncogene (2014). Low credibility.

ATM, the protein kinase mutated in the rare human disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), has been the focus of intense scrutiny over the past two decades. Initially this was because of the unusual radiosensitive phenotype of cells from A-T patients, and latterly because investigating ATM signalling has yielded valuable insights into the DNA damage response, redox signalling and cancer. With the recent explosion in genomic data, ATM alterations have been revealed both in the germline as a predisposing factor for cancer and as somatic changes in tumours themselves. Here we review these findings, as well as advances in the understanding of ATM signalling mechanisms in cancer and ATM inhibition as a strategy for cancer treatment.

### ATM specifically mediates repair of double-strand breaks with blocked DNA ends [^114gS5hA]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Deficiencies in the DNA-damage response (DDR) are the cause of several human genetic syndromes. Common hallmarks of these disorders include neurodegeneration and/or cancer predisposition, which are a probable consequence of deficient and inaccurate repair of DNA damage. Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a rare autosomal recessive syndrome that results from inactivation of the PIKK family Ser/Thr protein kinase ATM (A-T Mutated), is perhaps the paradigm for diseases of this type. It is characterized by a symptomatology that includes progressive cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, hypogonadism and increased cancer incidence (mainly leukaemia and lymphoma). Multiple functions have been assigned to ATM and its list of phosphorylation substrates is extensive. Despite this versatility, its main function, or at least the best understood, is to trigger the initial phosphorylation wave of the DDR to double-strand breaks (DSBs). This fact, together with the exquisite radiosensitivity displayed by ATM-deficient cells and individuals and the symptomatological overlap of A-T with other break repair-defective human syndromes, strongly suggests a link between DSBs and pathology in A-T patients.

On the basis of all of this, one could anticipate that ATM would be essential, or at least important, for the repair of DSBs. Strikingly, this is not the case, as ATM loss does not result in obvious defects in the DSB repair rate. It has therefore been proposed that the radiosensitivity and chromosomal instability observed in ATM-deficient cells more likely arises from deficient checkpoint allowing cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA. However, there is a subset of DSBs, 10–20% depending on the DNA-damaging agent used, which do require ATM. The current understanding is that these DSBs correspond to damage occurring in heterochromatin, where ATM is required to open the chromatin structure, allowing access of the repair machinery. Interestingly, in addition to this, ATM is involved in specialized DSB-repair mechanisms that are not heterochromatin associated, such as V(D)J, class-switching and meiotic recombination. These processes are related to important aspects of A-T pathogenesis such as immunodeficiency, increased incidence of lymphoma and sterility. Fully understanding the nature of DSBs that specifically require ATM for repair could therefore provide important clues into disease pathogenesis.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia patients presenting with hyper-IgM syndrome [^113DPkkh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterised by progressive neurological abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasias and immunodeficiency (decreased serum IgG subclass and/or IgA levels and lymphopenia). However, 10% of A-T patients present with decreased serum IgG and IgA with normal or raised IgM levels. As cerebellar ataxia and oculocutaneous telangiectasias are not present at very young age, these patients are often erroneously diagnosed as hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM). Eight patients with A-T, showing serum Ig levels suggestive of HIGM on first presentation, are described. All had decreased numbers of T lymphocytes, unusual in HIGM. The diagnosis A-T was confirmed by raised alpha-fetoprotein levels in all patients. To prevent mistaking A-T patients for HIGM it is proposed to add DNA repair disorders as a possible cause of HIGM.

### Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia [^116hcKVn]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited, complex, and progressive multi‐system disorder, caused by pathogenic variants in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, which encodes the ATM kinase enzyme. 1 ATM kinase plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes such as repair of double‐strand DNA breaks, cell growth and apoptosis, mitochondrial energy metabolism, cell cycle control, and oxidative stress responses. 1, 2

Classic ataxia telangiectasia is associated with the absence of ATM kinase activity. Individuals with ataxia telangiectasia and a classic phenotype have an early childhood‐onset cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal movement disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, the disease is characterized by the presence of oculocutaneous telangiectasias, which are prominent dilated blood vessels on the eye sclerae and sun‐exposed skin, abnormal immunological and respiratory functions, and an increased risk of developing malignancies. 3 Individuals with classic ataxia telangiectasia generally do not survive beyond the age of 30 years owing to mortality from malignancies and respiratory failure. 4 There is no cure for ataxia telangiectasia.

### Elevated IgM levels as a marker for a unique phenotype in patients with ataxia telangiectasia [^116WeJxb]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Taken together, our findings further support previous reports suggesting that AT patients with elevated IgM levels represent a distinct group with a severe disease phenotype and worse prognosis resulting from a prominent CSR defect.

Further larger prospective studies in this subpopulation would be needed to establish a tailored management approach including close surveillance with early and aggressive treatment.

### New diagnosis of atypical ataxia-telangiectasia in a 17-year-old boy with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a novel ATM mutation [^112SdbFD]. Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive chromosome breakage disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Typically, it presents in early childhood with progressive cerebellar dysfunction along with immunodeficiency and oculocutaneous telangiectasia. An increased risk of malignancy is also associated with the syndrome and, rarely, may be the presenting feature in small children. We describe a 17-year-old boy with slurred speech, mild motor delays and learning disability diagnosed with atypical A-T in the setting of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Suspicion for A-T was raised after review of a peripheral blood karyotype demonstrating rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and/or 14. The diagnosis was confirmed after molecular testing identified a novel homozygous missense variant in ATM (c.5585T > A; p. Leu1862His) that resulted in protein instability and abolished serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent A-T and lymphoid malignancy diagnoses in an older child or adult with only mild neurological disease. Our experience suggests that screening for the disorder should be considered in any individual with lymphoid malignancy and neurological findings, especially as radiation and certain chemotherapy protocols are contraindicated in A-T.

### Classic ataxia-telangiectasia: the phenotype of long-term survivors [^111XJbpH]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Dutch cohort

Clinical, genetic and laboratory data of classic A–T patients who survived beyond the age of 30 years were retrospectively collected from their medical records and from our database of genetically confirmed A–T cases. All Dutch patients had the classic A–T phenotype as described in the " Introduction " and all but two had demonstrated absence of residual ATM kinase activity. The remaining two siblings were compound heterozygous for a frameshift mutation and a nonsense mutation, respectively, that would both prevent expression of any ATM protein. As expected from the presence of these mutations they had a classic phenotype as previously described.

Literature search

We searched the PubMed database for reports on patients with classic A–T beyond the age of 30 years. We combined search terms for 'ataxia telangiectasia' (Louis–Bar syndrome), with search terms for 'old' (adult*, long, surviv*, elder*, matur*, senior) or 'classic' (classic*). Patients with a mild, atypical or variant phenotype (other than only a long-term survival) and patients with proven residual ATM kinase activity were excluded. Additional reports were identified through hand-searching of reference lists of relevant papers.

Extraction of data

The following data were retrieved from the patients' medical records or our database: sex, age, age of death, cause of death, ATM mutations, and results from studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines (i.e. expression of ATM protein and absence of residual ATM kinase activity). For patients who were annually seen at our centre, medical records were searched for medical history, prescribed medication, and problems mentioned during interviews. Abnormal findings at physical examination and from laboratory and other diagnostic tests were collected. Furthermore, medical histories and our database were specifically queried for diseases, abnormalities or problems that were found in other patients or in the literature, in an iterative manner. For deceased patients who were not annually followed at our centre, data were retrieved from the patients' primary medical centre. If mentioned, the same data were extracted for the patients described in the literature. If data were not reported, these were noted as 'missing' instead of 'not present'. The only exception we made was for malignancy: if its presence was not reported in a detailed case description, we assumed this was not present.

### Underexpression and abnormal localization of ATM products in ataxia telangiectasia patients bearing ATM missense mutations [^115aMUFg]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune defects and predisposition to malignancies. A-T is caused by biallelic inactivation of the ATM gene, in most cases by frameshift or nonsense mutations. More rarely, ATM missense mutations with unknown consequences on ATM function are found, making definitive diagnosis more challenging. In this study, a series of 15 missense mutations, including 11 not previously reported, were identified in 16 patients with clinical diagnosis of A-T belonging to 14 families and 1 patient with atypical clinical features. ATM function was evaluated in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines by measuring H2AX and KAP1 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation, confirming the A-T diagnosis for 16 cases. In accordance with previous studies, we showed that missense mutations associated with A-T often lead to ATM protein underexpression (15 out of 16 cases). In addition, we demonstrated that most missense mutations lead to an abnormal cytoplasmic localization of ATM, correlated with its decreased expression. This new finding highlights ATM mislocalization as a new mechanism of ATM dysfunction, which may lead to therapeutic strategies for missense mutation associated A-T.

### Morbidity and mortality from ataxia-telangiectasia are associated with ATM genotype [^116aB67V]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare genetic disease caused by germline biallelic mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) that result in partial or complete loss of ATM expression or activity. The course of the disease is characterized by neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers.

Objective

We studied A-T progression and investigated whether manifestations were associated with the ATM genotype.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study in France of 240 patients with A-T born from 1954 to 2005 and analyzed ATM mutations in 184 patients, along with neurologic manifestations, infections, and cancers.

Results

Among patients with A-T, the Kaplan-Meier 20-year survival rate was 53.4%; the prognosis for these patients has not changed since 1954. Life expectancy was lower among patients with mutations in ATM that caused total loss of expression or function of the gene product (null mutations) compared with that seen in patients with hypomorphic mutations because of earlier onset of cancer (mainly hematologic malignancies). Cancer (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6–4.5) and respiratory tract infections (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8) were independently associated with mortality. Cancer (hazard ratio, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.9–11.6) was a major risk factor for mortality among patients with null mutations, whereas respiratory tract infections (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.8–9.1) were the leading cause of death among patients with hypomorphic mutations.

Conclusion

Morbidity and mortality among patients with A-T are associated with ATM genotype. This information could improve our prognostic ability and lead to adapted therapeutic strategies.

### Biomarkers in ataxia-telangiectasia: a systematic review [^114gyLnG]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

A total of 56 reports met our inclusion criteria. The complete articles were grouped based on biomarker subtype, in vitro model, patient studies or interventional clinical trials. Full data extraction can be found in Supplementary File 2. Where possible, the demographic data and effect size have been included, such as fold change, mean, standard deviation, or range, if discussed in the original manuscript.

Evaluation of biomarkers.

Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP)

Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) is a foetal protein that is still present in serum in high concentrations at birth and slowly decreases to normal"adult" levels around the age of two years. In patients with A-T, serum AFP levels usually remain elevated. The precise mechanism for the failed decrease in serum AFP levels in patients with A-T is unknown. Although AFP is considered a reliable diagnostic biomarker for the disease, in a small proportion of variant A-T patients, AFP can be normal. Furthermore, there is no clear association of AFP levels with disease severity, making this biomarker not suitable for therapeutic trials.

Lipoproteins

Altered lipid metabolism has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis but the mechanism is unclear. Impaired lipid homeostasis can potentially lead to impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic syndromes are frequently associated with classic A-T. Commonly, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are elevated with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lower vitamin E (per total lipid ratios). We also note associated fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes which is progressive with age. Such findings are not specific to A-T, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is also associated with elevated lipid levels. The correlation between lipoprotein levels and clinical presentation of A-T has not been elucidated.

### Classic ataxia-telangiectasia: the phenotype of long-term survivors [^111hdRo8]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A–T is generally considered to be a childhood disease since the majority of patients present in early life and die in or before early adulthood. However, some patients survive longer than would be expected. Their clinical picture includes a combination of medical, psychosocial and existential problems.

General problems

The number of classic A–T patients beyond the age of 30 years who developed a malignancy seems to be somewhat higher compared to percentages found in larger A–T cohort studies, probably due to the longer follow-up duration. Survival after the development of a malignancy is short in A–T, at least partly due to the fact that radiation and chemotherapy cannot be applied at appropriate doses due to the underlying disease mechanism (DNA repair defect, increased radiosensitivity). Older patients with A–T have the additional disadvantage of a severe restrictive impairment of their lung function, which makes mechanical ventilation, and therefore oncologic surgery, challenging.

The presence of tachypnea and tachycardia in older patients with A–T seems to reflect their poor, mainly restrictively disturbed lung function. Severe pulmonary infections occurred frequently in older patients with A–T and were a cause of death in the majority of them, due to a combination of a troublesome general condition, impairments of pulmonary function, and severe motor disturbances including dysphagia. The immunodeficiency in older patients with A–T does not seem to progress. Interestingly, three Dutch patients who had an IgG 2 deficiency managed to survive beyond the age of 30 years, whilst IgG 2 deficiency is correlated with poor survival in A–T. Apparently, other factors played a role in these cases. IgM was asymptomatically elevated in four Dutch patients. None of them had a hyper-IgM phenotype with IgA and IgG deficiency, a phenotype that is associated with a severe reduction in life expectancy.

### Brain glucose metabolism in adults with ataxia-telangiectasia and their asymptomatic relatives [^1151JHaY]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a recessive genetic disorder (ATM is the mutated gene) of childhood with severe motor impairments and whereas homozygotes manifest the disorder, heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Structural brain imaging and post-mortem studies in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have reported cerebellar atrophy; but abnormalities of motor control characteristic of extrapyramidal dysfunction suggest impairment of broader motor networks. Here, we investigated possible dysfunction in other brain areas in individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia and tested for brain changes in asymptomatic relatives to assess if heterozygocity affects brain function. We used positron emission tomography and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose to measure brain glucose metabolism (quantified as µmol/100 g/min), which serves as a marker of brain function, in 10 adults with ataxia-telangiectasia, 19 non-affected adult relatives (12 siblings, seven parents) and 29 age-matched healthy controls. Statistical parametric mapping and region of interest analyses were used to compare individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia, asymptomatic relatives, and unrelated controls. We found that participants with ataxia-telangiectasia had lower metabolism in cerebellar hemispheres (14%, P < 0.001), anterior vermis (40%, P < 0.001) and fusiform gyrus (20%, P < 0.001) compared with controls or siblings, and lower metabolism in hippocampus (12%, P = 0.05) compared with controls, and showed significant intersubject variability (decreases in vermis ranged from 18% to 60%). Participants with ataxia-telangiectasia also had higher metabolism in globus pallidus (16%, P = 0.05), which correlated negatively with motor performance. Asymptomatic relatives had lower metabolism in anterior vermis (12%; P = 0.01) and hippocampus (19%; P = 0.002) than controls. Our results indicate that, in addition to the expected decrease in cerebellar metabolism, participants with ataxia-telangiectasia had widespread changes in metabolic rates including hyperactivity in globus pallidus indicative of basal ganglia involvement. Changes in basal ganglia metabolism offer potential insight into targeting strategies for therapeutic deep brain stimulation. Our finding of decreased metabolism in vermis and hippocampus of asymptomatic relatives suggests that heterozygocity influences the function of these brain regions.

### ATM mutations associate with distinct Co-mutational patterns and therapeutic vulnerabilities in NSCLC [^113KvvVj]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a key role in response to double-stranded DNA breaks by mediating the repair of DNA damage while activating cell-cycle checkpoints via TP53. Loss of ATM can facilitate oncogenesis, as demonstrated by the association between ATM germline mutations and the Ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, which includes in its clinical manifestation increased rate of cancers and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Somatic mutations in ATM are also common across cancer types, and in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) they have been observed in approximately 5%–10% of tumors, representing the most frequently mutated DNA damage repair (DDR) gene. However, despite their prevalence, the significance of ATM mutations in NSCLC, including the ATM co-mutation landscape, the effect of ATM loss on lung cancer biology, and their therapeutic implications, has not been fully elucidated.

### Diagnosis and management of progressive ataxia in adults [^113tuoxC]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Episodic ataxia type 2 is characterised by periods of cerebellar dysfunction lasting for hours or days, sometimes with migraine, and rarely epilepsy. Later in life, the ataxia becomes progressive, and MRI may show cerebellar atrophy. Attacks can be precipitated by stress, exertion, caffeine and alcohol, and patients should be counselled appropriately. Acetazolamide remains the mainstay of treatment but carries a risk of renal calculi and (more commonly) of paraesthesia. As well as good hydration, we recommend annual ultrasound scans of the urinary tract. Flunarizine and 4-aminopyridine, a potassium channel blocker, can also help but (like acetazolamide) they are not licensed in the UK to use in episodic ataxia type 2. Dichlorphenamide is extremely effective and well tolerated but is currently too expensive to use routinely. Having seizures is a contraindication to using 4-aminopyridine.

Allied health professional interventions

The multidisciplinary team is clearly important in evaluating and managing patients with ataxia. Speech and language therapy (for both communication and swallowing), occupational therapy and physiotherapy can each make important contributions at different stages of the patient journey. It can be difficult to access interested and knowledgeable therapists in the community, and this type of expertise is rare outside of specialist ataxia clinics. The guidelines have sections in each of these fields, giving comprehensive advice on the types of assessments and interventions that need to be done, and may serve as an educational resource to accompany referrals to community therapy teams. In our experience, the nurturing of local 'champions' in ataxia management (frequently a therapy colleague working in a district general hospital) can generate enthusiasm and help develop local expertise; in time these therapists frequently become effective access points for services for patients and their carers.

Reviews and monitoring

Patients with progressive ataxias should be offered 6–12 monthly reviews, ideally by a general neurologist or (where available) an ataxia specialist (neurologist or nurse). There are also services specifically for adults and children with ataxia-telangiectasia, where specialist input (again by multiprofessional teams) can tackle the complications associated with this condition, including cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency and lung disease. Patients require regular review to identify any new symptoms early that may need treatment, and for patients to take advantage of advances in diagnostics and any new available treatments. In addition, those with no established cause for their ataxia can undergo thorough and repeated review of the clinical features and investigation results, which sometimes leads to a clearer diagnosis.

### Pigmentary anomalies in ataxia – telangiectasia: a clue to diagnosis and an example of twin spotting [^114hPqrU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A 6-year-old girl with consanguineous parents presented with a history of progressive ataxia and patchy, segmental pigmentary changes, some reminiscent of Blaschko's lines. There was no evidence of oculocutaneous telangiectases or signs of immunodeficiency. A clinical diagnosis of ataxia — telangiectasia (AT) was suggested and confirmed by the presence of a low serum IgA, raised alpha-fetoprotein and chromosomal rearrangements of chromosomes 7 and 14. This case of AT is unique for having hypopigmentation and hyperpigmented patches adjacent to each other, which is a feature that has been described as 'cutis tricolor', and is unusual for having pigmentary skin changes, some in the lines of Blaschko without telangiectases. Clinicians should be aware that a diagnosis of AT may be made in the absence of telangiectases.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated loss-of-function displays variant and tissue-specific differences across tumor types [^111bNhd8]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in cancer and is involved in multiple cellular processes including DNA damage response (DDR) and cell-cycle regulation. The inheritance of two aberrant copies of the ATM gene, which results in the autosomal-recessive condition known as ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome, is associated with a significantly elevated lifetime risk of multiple cancer types, including adult-onset epithelial cancers. Heterozygous germline variants in ATM are seen in 1% to 2% of the population, and individuals with deleterious or inactivating germline variants in ATM also carry an increased risk of various types of cancer, including hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, with the strongest evidence for breast cancer. Somatic variants in ATM are frequently found in cancer as well, including in hematologic and solid malignancies. However, the penetrance and cancer phenotypes characterized by somatic ATM mutations are less clear than those induced by somatic mutations in DDR genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2).

Preclinical studies have shown that cancers with ATM LOF are susceptible to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, radiation, and DDR inhibitors, the latter of which includes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) inhibitors (ATRi), in various tissue lineages. However, clinical studies assessing variants in ATM or loss of ATM protein expression (LOP) as a putative predictive biomarker have yielded mixed results. For example, although ATM LOP has retrospectively been shown to predict the benefit of oxaliplatin chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer, retrospective studies of patients with prostate cancer who received platinum chemotherapy did not show a definitive benefit specific to ATM gene aberrations. Furthermore, early-phase trials of the PARPi, olaparib, in treating advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) indicated potential clinical benefit in ATM -mutant tumors, but these results were not validated in subsequent prospective and retrospective clinical analyses. In contrast, findings from these trials revealed minimal clinical benefit from single-agent PARPi for patients with ATM variants (somatic or germline), particularly when compared with CRPC patients harboring BRCA2 mutations. Preclinical studies have indicated that ATM -null cancers respond to ATRi to a greater degree than to PARPi, with early-phase studies showing durable responses in patients with ATM aberrancy of varying types. However, recently reported subsequent expansion trial data of single-agent ATRi in patients with ATM-aberrant cancers have shown heterogeneity in response.

### Hashimoto thyroiditis associated with ataxia telangiectasia [^1112p8GQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare genetic disease characterized by neurological manifestations, infections, and cancers. In addition to these cardinal features, different autoimmune diseases can be seen in patients with ataxia telangiectasia. Although there were reports of positive autoimmune thyroid antibodies associated with ataxia telangiectasia, to our knowledge, we report the first cases of nodular Hashimoto thyroiditis in two patients with ataxia telangiectasia in the English medical literature. These cases illustrate that despite the rarity of nodular Hashimoto thyroiditis associated with ataxia telangiectasia, physicians should be aware of this possibility. Furthermore, thyroid examination of patient with ataxia telangiectasia is recommended for early diagnosis.

### Abnormal head oscillations in neuro-ophthalmology and neuro-otology [^112xEEcA]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The study describes the clinical phenomenology and contemporary pathophysiology of concurrent oscillations of the eyes and the head that are present in neurological conditions with diverse causes.

Recent Findings

One classic example is spasmus nutans in which the eye oscillations are the primary cause, whereas head nodding is thought to be an operant conditional response that suppresses the eye oscillations to facilitate clear vision. The second example is a combination of head tremor and inadequate compensatory eye movements because of vestibular hypofunction leading to the illusion of pendular nystagmus - hence, the condition is called pseudonystagmus. Cerebellar degeneration in ataxia-telangiectasia or synchronized spontaneous discharge from the inferior olive and cerebellum in the syndrome of ocular palatal tremor with dystonia are examples of eye and head oscillations because of the impairment in cerebellar outflow. Infantile nystagmus syndrome also presents with eye and head oscillations, but here the relationship between the two types of oscillations differs among patients and is still unclear.

Summary

The clinical features and putative pathophysiology of diverse disorders of the eyes and head that produce unwanted oscillations are reviewed. Key clinical pearls that are essential to separate these disorders at the bedside are also emphasized.

### Characterization of ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts with extended life-span through telomerase expression [^112JEJYU]. Oncogene (2001). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiencies, genomic instability and gonadal atrophy. A-T patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and have an elevated cancer risk. Cells derived from A-T patients require higher levels of serum factors, exhibit cytoskeletal defects and undergo premature senescence in culture. We show here that expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) in primary A-T patient fibroblasts can rescue the premature senescence phenotype. Ectopic expression of hTERT does not rescue the radiosensitivity or the telomere fusions in A-T fibroblasts. The hTERT+AT cells also retain the characteristic defects in cell-cycle checkpoints, and show increased chromosome damage before and after ionizing radiation. Although A-T patients have an increased susceptibility to cancer, the expression of hTERT in A-T fibroblasts does not stimulate malignant transformation. These immortalized A-T cells provide a more stable cell system to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular phenotypes of Ataxia-telangiectasia.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^1174o6XZ]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurological Phenotype

Three distinct patterns of neurological deficits were observed. The neurological features and treatments in each group are summarised in Supplementary Table 2.

Group A (Predominant Cerebellar Ataxia and/or Peripheral Neuropathy With Minimal or no Extrapyramidal Involvement)

Nineteen individuals (33%) were in Group A. Severe oculomotor dyspraxia was common (11 of 19; 58%) and 6 patients had mild eye movement abnormalities (32%). A 15‐year‐old with mild disease had normal eye movements. The other patient with normal eye movements presented initially with a severe reaction to radiotherapy for breast cancer and had a mild phenotype consisting of peripheral neuropathy with only minimal limb ataxia. 31 Disease severity was moderate or severe, except in the individual described above and 2 pediatric patients aged 11 and 15 years. Mean disease duration was 32 years.

Group B (Disability Determined by a Mixture of Ataxia and/or Peripheral Neuropathy Plus Additional Extrapyramidal Features)

Twenty‐eight individuals (49%) were in Group B. Their extrapyramidal features included dystonic posturing/neck dystonia (12 patients), dystonic tremor (11 individuals), choreiform movements (9 patients), and orofacial dystonia (5 patients). Two patients had a resting tremor. In this group, 12 of 28 (43%) exhibited prominent oculomotor dyspraxia, 43% had mildly abnormal eye movements, and 4 patients had normal eye movements. Disease severity was widely distributed. Six individuals had mild disease, 15 moderate disease, and 4 individuals were severely affected (not documented in 3). Mean disease duration was 30 years.

### Prevalence and outcomes of cancer and treatment-associated toxicities for patients with ataxia telangiectasia [^113Wyjon]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a DNA repair disorder with cancer predisposition.

Objective

We sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of hematologic and solid cancers and treatment-associated toxicities in individuals with A-T.

Methods

Data were retrospectively analyzed from the Johns Hopkins Ataxia Telangiectasia Clinical Center cohort. Cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios of cancer, survival probability after cancer diagnosis, and standardized mortality ratios were calculated. Cox regression estimated risk of death on the basis of chemotherapy (standard vs reduced) dosing, and multivariable logistic regression evaluated cancer risk associations with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) exons and variants.

Results

Eighty-four (16.5%) of 508 individuals were diagnosed with a primary cancer, of whom 62 (74%) were hematologic in origin and 22 (26%) were solid-organ cancers. The cumulative incidence of cancer was 29% by age 35 years. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurred most frequently (n = 39), whereas solid cancers disproportionately affected those 18 years and older (n = 22). The standardized mortality ratio was 24.6 (95% CI, 21.1–28.4) overall and 232.9 (95% CI,178.1–299.2) among individuals with cancer. Risk of death was higher when treated with standard/unknown versus modified chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.4; p = 0.024). Chemotherapy-associated toxicities developed in 58% of individuals, predominantly neurologic (n = 14) and gastrointestinal (n = 10) systems. Three exons were enriched for cancer-associated variants.

Conclusions

Individuals with A-T experience a wide array of blood and solid-organ malignancies, high mortality rates, and treatment-related toxicities, highlighting need for targeted therapies to mitigate toxicity and optimize survival.

### Genetic risk variants for class switching recombination defects in ataxia-telangiectasia patients [^113j1HSg]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Clinical Characterization

Based on patients' immunologic profiles, we considered 20 unrelated A-T patients (10 A-T patients with normal CSR (CSR-N) and 10 A-T patients with CSR defect (CSR-D)) with the median interquartile range (IQR) age of 5.0 (4.2–7.7) years old at the time of diagnosis. All the patients suffered from ataxia and telangiectasia. Other presentations of our patients were recurrent infections (60%) predominated by respiratory infections (50%), followed by diarrhea (35%), dermatologic manifestations (30%), hepatosplenomegaly (35%), and autoimmunity (15%). We found that the frequency of total infections and respiratory infections in A-T patients with CSR-D were significantly higher than in the CSR-N group (p = 0.020 and p = 0.025, respectively). Increased serum level of AFP was seen in all patients, but there was no significant difference between the serum AFP concentrations of the two subgroups. The main demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients are provided in Table 1. In addition, the distribution of immunoglobulins for each patient in both groups is shown in Figure S1.

### Genetic risk variants for class switching recombination defects in ataxia-telangiectasia patients [^1164EESE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene. A-T patients manifest considerable variability in clinical and immunological features, suggesting the presence of genetic modifying factors. A striking heterogeneity has been observed in class switching recombination (CSR) in A-T patients which cannot be explained by the severity of ATM mutations.

Methods

To investigate the cause of variable CSR in A-T patients, we applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 20 A-T patients consisting of 10 cases with CSR defect (CSR-D) and 10 controls with normal CSR (CSR-N). Comparative analyses on modifier variants found in the exomes of these two groups of patients were performed.

Results

For the first time, we identified some variants in the exomes of the CSR-D group that were significantly associated with antigen processing and presentation pathway. Moreover, in this group of patients, the variants in four genes involved in DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair signaling, in particular, XRCC3 were observed, suggesting an association with CSR defect.

Conclusion

Additional impact of certain variants, along with ATM mutations, may explain the heterogeneity in CSR defect phenotype among A-T patients. It can be concluded that genetic modulators play an important role in the course of A-T disease and its clinical severity.

### Dysgerminoma in a child with ataxia-telangiectasia [^115qwvDM]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, high incidence of cancer, and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The authors report a case of dysgerminoma in a child with high alpha-fetoprotein, CA125 and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, who has been followed-up for ataxia-telangiectasia for 2 years.

### Genotype, extrapyramidal features, and severity of variant ataxia-telangiectasia [^115h2pCc]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Each of the five sets of siblings included here showed similar neurological features. For example, 3 affected sisters all have ataxia together with peripheral neuropathy, dystonic tremor, and essentially normal eye movements. Three Dutch siblings all presented with resting tremor and distal muscle weakness attributed to anterior horn cell involvement. 18 This similarity between siblings is consistent with the fact that the neurological phenotype is partly determined by shared "genetic background". However, we did not find significant genotype‐phenotype association with regard to neurological group in the cohort overall, indicating an additional influence of shared environmental factors or disease modifying genes.

Systemic complications were mild or absent, apart from the increased risk of malignancy. This is consistent with previous reports 4, 13, 14 and has significant implications on surveillance and management of these patients. None of the individuals in this study had significant respiratory disease. Functional testing with arterial blood gases and overnight oximetry was essentially normal. Even though 42 of 53 tested individuals had a detectable abnormality on immunological testing, in general this was subtle and of doubtful clinical significance. No individual required treatment with immunoglobulin replacement, and only 2 used prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent pulmonary infections. Our cohort includes only 2 patients with diabetes mellitus, which suggests a similar prevalence to in the general population. However, more than one quarter of included individuals had abnormalities in their liver function tests, the relevance of which needs to be further investigated in future studies.

Our results suggest that variant ataxia‐telangiectasia is likely to be under‐ or misdiagnosed. The time from first symptoms to diagnosis was over 10 years in more than half of our cohort, and we included individuals with only very mild neurological symptoms. Clinicians may not be familiar with the wide range of clinical presentations of variant ataxia‐telangiectasia, where eye movements can be normal, conjunctival telangiectasia absent, neurological presentation mainly extrapyramidal, and AFP levels within normal range.

Individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia require surveillance for malignancy and management guidance — including breast screening in women, minimising exposure to ionising radiation and facilitating specialist assessments. Missense mutations are associated with milder neurological presentations, but have a particularly high malignancy risk, and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these phenotypes.

### Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia [^116CB44r]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the characteristics and severity of dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia.

Method

All children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia who visited our multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for ataxia telangiectasia were asked to participate in this study, which took place in March 2019. To evaluate dysarthria, we used the Radboud Dysarthria Assessment in adults (older than 18y) and the paediatric Radboud Dysarthria Assessment in children (5–18y), including the observational tasks 'conversation' and 'reading', and the speech-related maximum performance tasks 'repetition rate', 'phonation time', 'fundamental frequency range', and 'phonation volume'. Speech intelligibility was measured using the Intelligibility in Context Scale.

Results

Twenty-two individuals (15 children [5–17y], seven adults [19–47y]; 14 males and eight females; mean age 19y, SD 15y 2mo) participated. Dysarthria was present in all participants and characterized by ataxic components in adults and similar uncontrolled movements in children. In most participants, speech was mildly to mildly/severely affected. Almost all participants had an abnormal score for at least one maximum performance task.

Interpretation

Dysarthria in ataxia telangiectasia is characterized by uncontrolled, ataxic, and involuntary movements, resulting in monotonous, unstable, slow, hypernasal, and chanted speech.

What This Paper Adds

Dysarthria in ataxia telangiectasia is characterized by uncontrolled, ataxic, and involuntary movements. Dysarthria in ataxia telangiectasia results in monotonous, unstable, slow, hypernasal, and chanted speech. Dysarthria in ataxia telangiectasia can be assessed using the Radboud Dysarthria Assessment and the paediatric Radboud Dysarthria Assessment.

### ATM expression and activation in ataxia telangiectasia patients with and without class switch recombination defects [^116tbWT1]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune deficiency is a concern in about one-third of cases, which can make patients more susceptible to respiratory infections and other illnesses. Particularly, in A-T patients, a class switch recombination (CSR) mechanism in B cells is defective, and therefore, the production of diverse antibody isotypes in response to antigen stimulation during primary B cell maturation might be impaired. During the process of CSR, the constant region of the heavy chain changes, while the variable domain remains unaltered from the original immunoglobulin (Ig). This process involves the activation of DNA damage sensors, including ATM, which harmonize downstream pathways in mainly cell-cycle checkpoints and later apoptosis and senescence.

At present, there is no definitive treatment strategy for A-T, but some treatments may help alleviate immune system symptoms/infections, prevent cancer development, and slow down neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that patients with severe immune defects exhibit defective CSR, as evidenced by an increase in IgM levels and a decrease in IgA, IgE, and IgG levels, the relationship between CSR mechanism defects, ATM molecule expression, and kinase activity remains unclear. ATM protein expression and kinase activity could potentially contribute to the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, identifying the underlying genetic mutation impact via investigation of the residual ATM protein expression and function could improve prognosis estimation and treatment efficacy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of ATM protein and its kinase activity in A-T patients with CSR defect (CSR-D) and CSR normal (CSR-N) conditions to reveal the expression of residual ATM kinase and its association with the severity of the disease and the phenotypic-genotypic correlation in A-T patients.

### Dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia [^116y3Wcv]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, different aspects of dysarthria in children and adults with ataxia telangiectasia were investigated. With the exception of a descriptive study in a small number of children with ataxia telangiectasia, 9 this is the first study describing dysarthria in detail in this population as far as we are aware.

Dysarthria: prevalence, severity on function and activity level, and characteristics

Dysarthria was present in all participants. On function level, most had mild/severe speech impairment and none were anarthric. Despite the fact that the median score on the severity of function scale was 2.47 in children and 2.71 in adults, a larger distribution in function level was seen among children (1–4 in children and 2–3 in adults). The larger distribution on function level in children can probably be explained by several factors. As classic ataxia telangiectasia arises in childhood, children with ataxia telangiectasia may have a milder speech impairment than adults and, owing to the progressive course of classic ataxia telangiectasia, children invariably show more severe speech impairments as they grow older. Additionally, the variation in development of the motor and linguistic system in children may contribute to the wider range in severity on function level.

In almost all participants, severity on function level was higher than severity on activity level. This means that individuals with ataxia telangiectasia have a relatively good intelligibility compared with their severity on function level. An explanation for the better score on activity level is that many participants lower their speech rate to compensate for better intelligibility.

Dysarthria was characterized by uncontrolled movements in all children and ataxic components in all adults (that is, in comparable forms of expression). Characteristics of uncontrolled or ataxic speech were monotonous, unstable, slow, hypernasal, and chanted speech. These findings are in line with the clinical description of people with ataxia telangiectasia 3 and previous study findings. 9 Additionally, one child showed involuntary movements which fits in with extrapyramidal movement disorders in ataxia telangiectasia. Another child had strained components of dysarthria, which can be related to a compensation mechanism to suppress involuntary movements.

### Accumulation of brain hypointense foci on susceptibility-weighted imaging in childhood ataxia telangiectasia [^112ruWQx]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

SWI hypointense cerebral lesions have been reported in adults with the inherited cerebellar neurodegenerative disorder ataxia telangiectasia. This study aims to establish the prevalence, age-dependency, and spatial distribution of these lesions in children and young people with ataxia telangiectasia.

Materials and Methods

Participants with classic ataxia telangiectasia and matched controls underwent SWI acquisition at 3T at 1 or 2 time points. SWI hypointense lesions were manually labeled according to the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale. Differences in prevalence of lesion number between groups with ataxia telangiectasia and without ataxia telangiectasia were tested with the Fisher exact test, and differences in age between participants with ataxia telangiectasia with and without lesions were tested using independent samples Mann-Whitney U test. The relationship between age and lesion number was modeled as an exponential function.

Results

Analyzable SWI datasets from 17 participants with ataxia telangiectasia (with median age at first scan of 12.4 years; range, 4.6–20.2 years; 8 [47%] were female) and 22 matched healthy controls showed prevalence of SWI hypointense lesions in 41% of participants with ataxia telangiectasia and 0% in controls (P = 0.001, Fisher exact test). Lesions were exclusively supratentorial and predominantly lobar. Participants with ataxia telangiectasia with SWI hypointense lesions were older than those without (median age 5.2 years versus 9.3 years, U = 10.5, P = 0.014). An exponential curve described the relationship between age and lesion number (R² = 0.67).

Conclusions

SWI hypointense lesions are common in children and young people with ataxia telangiectasia, accumulating from 12 years of age onward. In contrast to cerebellar-dominant neurodegeneration in ataxia telangiectasia, SWI hypointense lesions were exclusively supratentorial. Further investigation is needed to establish the clinical relevance of these imaging-detected lesions.

### Genetic risk variants for class switching recombination defects in ataxia-telangiectasia patients [^113sauoi]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Given that similar mutations in the ATM gene result in different clinical phenotypes, including different immunological profiles in A-T patients, additional genetic alternations are thought to play important roles in A-T disease outcomes. In the present study, the relationship between the genotype of A-T patients and the CSR defect phenotype was investigated for the first time. Our findings showed that in addition to the ATM gene variants, variants in genes related to this process could help explain CSR defects in A-T patients. Further research at the functional level is required to complete and confirm the findings conclusively.

### Biomarkers in ataxia-telangiectasia: a systematic review [^115t2NPc]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers related to mitochondrial dysfunction

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) accumulation or depletion can be an indicator of mitochondrial degeneration and neurodegenerative disorders. The accumulation of a common deletion (Δ-mtDNA 4977) can be used as a surrogate marker for total mtDNA damage. Radiation exposure to immortalised radiosensitive A-T fibroblasts leads to the accumulation of Δ-mtDNA 4977, raising the possibility that mtDNA abnormalities may contribute to the neurodegeneration in A-T. The role of mitochondria and DNA repair in A-T is unclear, however, it is thought that the fusion of mitochondria from healthy cells is facilitated by ATM.

Radiosensitivity and cancer biomarkers

Cancer predisposition in A-T (irrespective of neurological disease severity) and heterozygous carriers highlight the importance of early diagnosis. A Delphi-based consensus survey of 35 panelists from 6 continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, North and South America) support the need for evidence-based guidelines for cancer surveillance. Currently, there are no universally agreed guidelines for cancer screening in A-T, although a recently completed feasibility trial (NCT05252819) of whole-body MRI cancer surveillance showed the approach is feasible and well-accepted by children and young people with A-T and their families.

Tumour suppressor gene p53 is vital in DNA repair responses. A-T fibroblasts showed lower induction of p53 and p21 and their phosphorylated substrates after irradiation compared to fibroblasts from breast cancer patients, A-T heterozygotes and controls. The clinical significance of this is unknown and does not explain why heterozygous carriers are also at increased risk of cancer. The reduced level of phosphorylated p53 has also been reported in A-T-like disorder (ATLD).

### Non-hodgkin B-cell lymphoma of the ovary in a child with ataxia-telangiectasia [^112RQXSR]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a multisystem, life-limiting, recessively inherited genetic disorder caused by mutations in the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene. It is characterized by the onset of changes in neurological and immunological development, organ maturation in childhood, as well as a high incidence of malignancies.

Case

We describe a case of an 11-year-old girl with a history of progressive ataxia and new finding of bilateral pelvic masses. Given an elevated alpha-fetoprotein, the pre-operative working diagnosis was a malignant germ cell tumor. Final ovarian pathology revealed a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma with Burkitt-like morphology.

Summary

We present the first case of a primary ovarian non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma in a child with Ataxia-telangiectasia.

### Loss of CD98HC phosphorylation by ATM impairs antiporter trafficking and drives glutamate toxicity in ataxia telangiectasia [^116ow3rF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by neurological defects, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, radiosensitivity, decreased blood vessel integrity, and diabetes. ATM, the protein mutated in Ataxia-telangiectasia, responds to DNA damage and oxidative stress, but its functional relationship to the progressive clinical manifestation of this disorder is not understood. CD98HC chaperones cystine/glutamate and cationic/neutral amino acid antiporters to the cell membrane, and CD98HC phosphorylation by ATM accelerates membrane localization to acutely increase amino acid transport. Loss of ATM impacts tissues reliant on heterodimeric amino acid transporters relevant to Ataxia-telangiectasia phenotypes, such as endothelial cells (telangiectasia) and pancreatic α-cells (fatty liver and diabetes), with toxic glutamate accumulation. Bypassing the antiporters restores intracellular metabolic balance in ATM-deficient cells and mouse models. These findings provide insight into the long-known benefits of N-acetyl cysteine in Ataxia-telangiectasia cells beyond oxidative stress through removing glutamate excess by producing glutathione.

Results

The Dutch cohort consisted of seven classic A–T patients (four male and three female) who survived beyond the age of 30 years. Their ages ranged from 32 to 54 years. Three patients were alive at the end of follow-up, while four patients had deceased. All seven patients were previously described (see Table 1). A case description with photo- and video material of both the youngest (patient 1, age 32 years) and oldest (patient 7, age 54 years) patient from this series are shown in Online Resources 1 (case descriptions), 2 (photos of patient 1), and 3 (video of patient 7), respectively.

Fourteen additional A–T patients beyond the age of 30 were retrieved by the literature search (see Table 2). In only three of them it was mentioned that the diagnosis of A–T was confirmed genetically. In ten patients, the clinical diagnosis of A–T was supported by elevated serum alpha-protein (AFP) levels, and/or the presence of typical cytogenetic abnormalities (see Online Resource 4). In one patient, the clinical diagnosis, which we considered convincing enough to include the patient in the present study, was not substantiated by laboratory results.

The problems that were found in classic A–T patients beyond the age of 30 years are listed in Table 3. We decided to divide these problems into four categories: general, neurological, functional and psychosocial problems. These results will be discussed in the next section.

Mutation Analysis

Mutation analysis (Supplementary Table 1) revealed mutations in 111 of 114 alleles. Patients were classified based on the mutation present causing the retained kinase activity.

Individuals in Genetic Group 1 all have a leaky splice site mutation, which allows some normal ATM protein to be expressed with kinase activity. Fourteen patients in this group have the c.5763‐1050A > G mutation.

Individuals in Genetic Group 2 all have a missense mutation, which results in the presence of a mutant protein with some ATM kinase activity.

Individuals in Genetic Group 3 have mutations affecting the initiator methionine codon. These mutations allow expression of a very low level of truncated protein. 31 Patients with these mutations have been noted to have a milder clinical course, 24 and there is some uncertainty of ATM activity associated with these mutations.

Individuals in Genetic Group 4 have one confirmed mutation and one mutation which has not been identified or not been completely characterized. Patient 50 has a missense mutation Val2716Ala which is associated with retained ATM activity. The other 6 patients showed a low level of ATM protein and low level of ATM kinase activity. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was examined in these cases. Two have alterations found at the cDNA level, but no potentially causative mutations found in genomic DNA. The mutations giving protein with activity are likely to be intronic splice site mutations.

Twelve patients (1, 2, 18a, b, 26, 31, 33, 35 and 37a‐c, 41) had two "milder" mutations, which are both known to be associated with retained ATM kinase activity.

(C) Graphs shows cross‐sectional clinical neurological disease severity in patients with retained ATM kinase activity attributed to a missense mutation or a leaky splice‐site mutation. (D) Graph shows number of malignancies diagnosed in patients with retained ATM kinase activity attributed to a missense mutation or a leaky splice‐site mutation. ATM = ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated.

Although there were no statistically significant differences in neurological group, it is striking that predominant extrapyramidal signs were only observed in patients with missense mutations (Group 2 and patient 50).

Individuals with a high ATM protein level had lower AFP levels (p = 0.0235; CI = [–1.7628, –0.1270]), and slightly higher A‐T NEST scores (p = 0.0319; CI = [0.0713, 1.5825]).

There were no statistically significant associations between chromosomal radiosensitivity or number of mild mutations with neurological or other clinical features.

Table 2
Clinical details and evidence for pathogenicity of mutation positive cases

Figure 1 A and B show the patients classified by clinical features and mutation status. We found that the most likely predictors of detecting a mutation were: an adolescent age of onset, a complex phenotype, a family history and a progressive disorder. The highest detection rate was therefore in the progressive adolescent-onset cases with a family history where three of four (75%) had a molecular diagnosis made. However, one notable exception were those cases of ataxia plus retinitis pigmentosa where no mutations were identified.

A more detailed examination of the gene-positive cases revealed the value of using the ataxia NGS panel (Table 2). In three cases (Cases 14, 14 and 37) the clinical phenotype included an ataxia with a prominent eye movement disorder (sometimes known as ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, because of the neurological similarities with ataxia-telangiectasia). The most common gene mutations associated with ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder are in aprataxin (APTX ;) and senataxin (SETX; causing ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2;). In Case 14 the diagnosis of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 had not previously been made because of lack of availability of genetic testing, however Case 15 was more complex. The diagnosis of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 was suspected on clinical grounds (adolescent onset ataxia, an eye movement disorder, raised alpha fetoprotein) but a western blot to screen for mutations in SETX was found to be normal (Fig. 3). However, on NGS testing two mutations were identified in SETX; a known missense mutation, F1756S, and a clear splice variant in intron 23. The western blot probably appeared normal because the missense allele would produce a normal sized protein product whereas the splice variant either produced an abnormal protein size that was missed, or induced nonsense-mediated decay resulting in no protein produced from that allele, thus leading to a false negative result. In Case 37, the phenotype was also an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder with ataxia and a prominent eye movement disorder. The diagnosis of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 was considered but excluded by sequencing on a research basis. Mutations in MRE11 also cause an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder phenotype but sequencing of the MRE11 gene was not available. Our analysis identified one known missense mutation, N117S [shown to be pathogenic by] and one novel splice mutation, 314+4_314+7del in MRE11. Bioinformatics predicted a damaging splice mutation and retrospectively a western blot confirmed the pathogenicity of these mutations (Fig. 4).

Conclusion

In summary, this study suggests that ATM and p-ATM protein expression may have clinical implications for prognostic evaluation and the severity of ataxia telangiectasia symptoms. While the findings offer a better understanding of the potential impact of X-ray radiation on ATM expression, further research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between protein expression levels and the exact effect of radiation dose in A-T patients' cells.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in ataxia-telangiectasia [^115No6BZ]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays a central role in DNA damage responses, and its loss leads to development of T-cell malignancies. Here, we show that ATM loss also leads to intrinsic mitochondrial abnormalities in thymocytes, including elevated reactive oxygen species, increased aberrant mitochondria, high cellular respiratory capacity, and decreased mitophagy. A fraction of ATM protein is localized in mitochondria, and it is rapidly activated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Unexpectedly, allelic loss of the autophagy regulator Beclin-1 significantly delayed tumor development in ATM-null mice. This effect was not associated with rescue of DNA damage signaling but rather with a significant reversal of the mitochondrial abnormalities. These data support a model in which ATM plays direct roles in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and associated increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species contribute to the cancer-prone phenotype observed in organisms lacking ATM. Thus, ataxia-telangiectasia should be considered, at least in part, as a mitochondrial disease.

Disorders of DNA Repair and Genomic Stability

Ataxia‐Telangiectasia

The most common and best studied disorder of DNA repair and genomic stability is ataxia‐telangiectasia (AT), caused by mutation of the ATM gene and likely the third most common recessive ataxia in most regions. Damage to DNA, specifically double stranded DNA breaks, initiates a molecular cascade that triggers activation of the ATM protein (Fig 1). ATM is a serine/threonine kinase that subsequently phosphorylates hundreds of proteins involved in cell‐cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, suppression of chromatin rearrangements, and maintenance of genome stability in response to DNA replication stress. In addition to its role in DNA repair and related pathways, multiple lines of evidence suggest that, within neurons, ATM also participates in other functions including synaptic vesicle dynamics, calcium homeostasis, autophagy, neurotransmission, and oxidative stress that likely contribute to disease pathogenesis, although the precise mechanisms still remain unclear. Additional disorders in this class are highlighted in Figure 1 and include the AT‐like disorders and the ataxias with oculomotor apraxia (AOAs), such as AOA1 and AOA2. Loss‐of‐function mutations in ATM lead to the classic form of AT that presents clinically with progressive ataxia often starting before age 4 years as wells as the hallmark conjunctival telangiectasias, oculomotor apraxia, extrapyramidal movements (eg, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, or tremor), elevated serum α‐fetoprotein (often > 1,000μg/L), immunodeficiency with recurrent infections, and an increased risk of developing malignancy, often leukemia or lymphoma. Less severe ATM mutations (eg, leaky splice site or otherwise hypomorphic missense mutations) allow residual ATM kinase activity and give rise to a milder, often later onset, "variant AT" phenotypes, often with predominating dystonia and/or neuropathy phenotypes.

### Mutation analysis of the ATM gene in two Chinese patients with ataxia telangiectasia [^1118SEj4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency, elevated alpha-fetoprotein level, chromosomal instability, predisposition to cancer, and radiation sensitivity. Although a lot of mutations in the ATM gene have been described, there is still no report about ATM mutations in Chinese population. Using a molecular approach, we screened for ATM mutations in two patients from two unrelated Chinese families. 100 normal controls were analyzed to exclude possibility of polymorphism. Two novel mutations in the ATM gene were identified. The first one is a novel, homozygous, 1346G > C (Gly449Ala) missense mutation. The second one is a compound heterozygous mutation, which consists of a novel, 610G > T (Gly204Stop) nonsense mutation, combined with a previously reported, 6679C > T (Arg2227Cys) missense mutation. The transversions 1346G > C (Gly449Ala) and 610G > T (Gly204Stop) are not localized either in the conserved PI-3 kinase domain or in the other domains of the ATM protein. The phenotypic features were characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular telangiectasia, elevated alpha-fetoprotein level, immunodeficiency (agammaglo-bulinemia and T-cell defect), and rearrangements of chromosomes 7 and 14; brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy, brain SPECT showed cerebellar regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) hypoperfusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ATM mutations in Mainland China, in which the transversions 1346G > C (Gly449Ala) and 610G > T (Gly204Stop) are two novel, disease-causing mutations.

Patients and Methods

Probands

Clinical data were retrospectively collected from case notes for all individuals with variant ataxia‐telangiectasia who have attended the National Adult Ataxia‐Telangiectasia service (Papworth Hospital, UK), the Ataxia‐Telangiectasia Specialist Centre (Nottingham City Hospital, UK), and the Excellence Centre of Movement Disorders (Radboud UMC, Nijmegen, Netherlands). Analysis includes single cross‐sectional data using the most recent recorded clinical assessment.

Molecular Genetics Studies

Patients were classified as having variant ataxia‐telangiectasia based on retained ATM kinase activity. Patients with a mutation in the initiator methionine codon were included because of some uncertainty of ATM activity associated with these mutations. ATM mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing of PCR‐amplified ATM exon sequences. A lymphoblastoid cell line was derived from each patient's blood, and immunoblotting for ATM expression and ATM activity assays were performed using methods as previously described. 24 Chromosomal radiosensitivity was measured following exposure to 1Gy of gamma rays at cell cycle phase G2.

Neurological Assessment

Clinical neurological assessment was performed by a neurologist with a special interest in ataxia‐telangiectasia. The Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) 25 and Ataxia‐Telangiectasia Neurological Examination Scale Toolkit (A‐T NEST) scores 11 were recorded. As part of the neurological examination, a subjective assessment of eye movement abnormalities was recorded by the examining neurologist as normal eye movements, mildly abnormal eye movements (including nystagmus, slowing of saccades, and mild oculomotor dyspraxia), or severely abnormal eye movements (including marked oculomotor apraxia).

Neurological Phenotype

Individuals were categorized into three neurological phenotypic groups to reflect those neurological symptoms, which have been reported to most commonly occur in variant ataxia‐telangiectasia:

Group A: Cerebellar ataxia and/or peripheral neuropathy with minimal or no extrapyramidal involvement

Group B: Cerebellar ataxia and/or neuropathy plus additional extrapyramidal features

Group C: Extrapyramidal signs without significant ataxia and/or peripheral neuropathy

Clinical outcomes in platinum-treated or ATR inhibition treated patients

Through retrospective chart review, we identified 77 patients from the prospectively ATM-stained cohort who had received platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting with available follow-up data. Progression-free survival (PFS) is displayed using Kaplan–Meier curve for patients with ATM inactivation/loss (Tier 1 variant and/or LOP) versus patients without definitive ATM loss compared using log-rank test. Results were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.

In addition, we identified through chart review 43 patients with ATM variants treated on clinical trial(s) at our institution with single-agent ATR kinase inhibition that has previously been reported and had available follow-up data to assess outcomes. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, applicable International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and applicable laws and regulations. All patients provided written informed consent. Clinical benefit rate is defined as stable disease or better for greater than 180 days. PFS is displayed using Kaplan–Meier curve for patients by tumor type using the log-rank test. Results were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.

This study was granted approval by the institutional review board. Data sources and methods are fully described in supplementary materials.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia: treating mitochondrial dysfunction with nicotinamide riboside (ATNAD) [^116z3pww]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Study design: Single arm open-label clinical trial in ataxia-telangiectasia to test the effects of nicotinamide riboside on ataxia scales, immune function, and neurofilament light chain. Study population: 6–10 patients with Ataxia-Telangiectasia. Dose: Nicotinamide riboside 25 mg/kg/day in 3 equal divided doses. Primary endpoint: Scales for assessment and rating of ataxia, and International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Improvement of at least ½ standard deviation in key clinical scales which includes either; a) significant improvement in total combined scores from the SARA and ICARS scales, and /or b) significant improvements any aspects of the SARA and ICARS scales individually, especially pertaining to; Postural and gait improvements, Improved syllable speed and articulation, Improved fine motor skills.

This in turn resulted in reduced calcium release from the ER and less transfer to mitochondria providing further evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in A-T cells. We have recently completed a Phase 2A/B clinical trial exploring the efficacy and tolerability of C7 in AT patients. The cellular pool of NAD+ and NADH is tightly regulated through a careful balance between its biosynthesis and its breakdown by NAD+-consuming enzymes. NAD+ deficiency plays a role in disease mechanisms underlying DNA repair disorders. Mitochondrial damage and NAD+ depletion are key features in ataxia telangiectasia. Two groups have explored Nicotinamide Riboside supplementation in small groups of A-T patients via single arm, open label access, proof-of-concept clinical trials. Both have demonstrated improvements in validated ataxia scales. Improvements in immunoglobulin-G levels were observed, no alterations were noted in NFlc.

Improvements were lost in the wash out period. NR was well tolerated with no reported adverse events. Primary efficacy endpoint: Improvement of at least ½ standard deviation in key clinical scales which includes either; a) significant improvement in total combined scores from the SARA and ICARS scales, and /or b) significant improvements any aspects of the SARA and ICARS scales individually, especially pertaining to; Postural and gait improvements, Improved syllable speed and articulation, Improved fine motor skills.

### Ataxia-telangiectasia: treating mitochondrial dysfunction with a novel form of anaplerosis (A-TC7) [^1155AJMh]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Ataxia Telangiectasia is a rare, genetic, progressive, life-limiting, neuro-degenerative condition affecting a variety of body systems resulting in ataxia, immune deficiency, respiratory complications and a predisposition to cancer. Currently there is no cure for A-T. Over the years, a number of small clinical trials using steroids, antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents have had little success. The investigators have also shown this increased sensitivity to nutrient deprivation for primary epithelial cells from patients and in immortalised patient cells. Together these data point to a reduced capacity of A-T mitochondria to support energy metabolism and provide additional evidence for a mitochondrial defect in A-T cells. The investigators have recently demonstrated that this hypersensitivity to glucose deprivation can be explained by a novel mechanism involving defective signalling between the ER and the mitochondrion.

The investigators demonstrated that this was caused by defective assembly of the VDAC1-GRP75-IP3R1 calcium channel and less ER-mitochondria contact points as determined by transmission electron microscopy. This in turn resulted in reduced calcium release from the ER and less transfer to mitochondria providing further evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in A-T cells. It has eight categories with accumulative score ranging from 0 to 40; Gait, Stance, Sitting, Speech disturbance, Finger chase, Nose-finger test, Fast alternating hand movement, Heel-shin slide. Secondary objectives
- Determine to what extent the beneficial effects of triheptanoin on epithelial cells in culture translate to clinical efficacy in patients with A-T. Clinical endpoints will include ataxia rating; MRI imaging; lung function; eye movement changes and speech assessment.
- Provide validation of our primary and secondary endpoints to plan a phase 3 trial and form the basis of future trials |Quality of Life Measures|Paediatric Side Effect Questionnaire is a 19-item measure consisting of five sub-scales: cognitive, motor, behavioural, general neurological, and weight side effects. The investigators will add five items for gastrointestinal side effects to the questionnaire, including gastrointestinal pain, acid reflux, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation.

### Home-based complex intervention for children with ataxia telangiectasia… [^112Ca6eb]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Ataxia telangiectasia usually presents in early childhood, primarily affecting the pulmonary, neurological and immunological systems. World-wide prevalence estimates vary between 1 in 40, 000 and 1 in 100, 000 live births. A-T typically presents with cerebellar ataxia in early childhood, generally before the age of four years, such that by early teenage most patients require a wheelchair for mobility. Oculomotor, extrapyramidal and peripheral nervous system problems occur in later childhood and adolescence. Lung disease and difficulties with feeding, swallowing and nutrition are also common. A-T also carries a high risk of malignancy, and life-expectancy for individuals with A-T is decreased, with survival time of 25 years. People living with A-T require coordinated multi-disciplinary care to optimally manage their complex needs. Symptomatic management and rehabilitation is advocated to improve quality of life and minimize complications that could increase morbidity and mortality.

However, the feasibility and acceptability of allied health interventions and outcome measures for this population group are under-researched. Parents participating in a research engagement meeting reported being unclear about how best to deal with the signs and symptoms of A-T at home, how to find help and how and when to access support. This uncertainty is echoed by therapists treating children and adults with ataxia. Evidence is lacking about what type of therapy is needed and how it might be best delivered. The investigators intend to address these concerns and perspectives by investigating the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a home-based exercise intervention that offers therapeutic interventions for the impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions related to A-T.

An extensive review undertaken at the beginning of this overall project scoping the evidence on care and management of A-T provided by allied health professionals and nurses, identified a range of interventions that reportedly positively impact A-T related impairments, together with quality of life, indicating that outcomes can be improved for this population. Objectives
- Assess the effectiveness of the complex home-based exercise intervention on physical function, respiratory muscle strength, participation, and quality of life Investigate the feasibility of the complex home-based exercise intervention in terms of:

- online and remote delivery by a multi-disciplinary health profession team with an allied health-professional lead
- participant and families' abilities to undertake the exercises.
