## Question

Past cholesterol medication for a mixed hyperlipidemia for a young 30-year-old female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication choices and overall management for mixed hyperlipidemia in a 30‑year‑old female. Let's break this down step‑by‑step. First, I need to think about confirming the lipid phenotype and excluding secondary causes. Then, I should evaluate for familial hypercholesterolemia given the young age. Next, I will assess short‑term versus lifetime cardiovascular risk and risk enhancers. After that, I must address reproductive planning because pregnancy fundamentally changes statin decisions. Then, I will select initial therapy and alternatives, integrate lifestyle measures, and outline monitoring and escalation. Finally, I will tie this together with long‑term management, shared decision‑making, and a succinct algorithmic summary, verifying each step against guidelines and labels as I go [^111XGpnH] [^114tPbMV] [^111ttfyW] [^112VoFpE] [^1177zbsg].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity of mixed hyperlipidemia in a 30‑year‑old by ensuring there is an elevated LDL‑C together with elevated triglycerides, documenting exact values and obtaining a fasting or appropriately interpreted nonfasting lipid panel, while simultaneously screening for secondary causes such as pregnancy, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes/metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney or liver disease, and medication effects, including atypical antipsychotics like clozapine that can drive severe mixed dyslipidemia; I should also remember that simvastatin trials in mixed hyperlipidemia report baseline LDL‑C often in the 188–244 mg/dL range with median TG around 128–168 mg/dL, which helps frame severity but does not substitute for this patient's actual labs [^111XGpnH] [^111wycoR] [^1177zbsg].

> Hold on, I should verify familial hypercholesterolemia considerations because young age with elevated LDL‑C warrants a structured screen: clinical suspicion rises with LDL‑C ≥ 190 mg/dL in adults, a family history of premature ASCVD, or stigmata like tendon xanthomas, and when suspicion is high I should consider genetic testing of LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 and pursue cascade screening of first‑degree relatives if FH is diagnosed, using clinical criteria with DNA confirmation when feasible to improve diagnostic certainty [^114tPbMV] [^114nN96v] [^113x2Gh9] [^113QAXns].

> Next, I need to check cardiovascular risk framing carefully because traditional 10‑year risk tools will underestimate risk at age 30; guidelines recommend estimation of lifetime or 30‑year risk in adults younger than 40, and prolonged exposure to elevated non‑HDL‑C or LDL‑C in young adulthood meaningfully increases later CHD risk even when 10‑year risk is low, so I should incorporate lifetime risk, risk enhancers, and the cumulative burden of dyslipidemia when discussing early treatment benefits [^111jMSpQ] [^1169S29F] [^116g1NRB].

> But wait, I must prioritize reproductive health discussions because statins are contraindicated during pregnancy: per ACC/AHA guidance, discontinue statins 1–2 months before attempting conception and stop immediately if pregnancy is discovered, and ensure reliable contraception during statin therapy while aligning treatment timing with the patient's pregnancy plans through shared decision‑making [^111ttfyW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "postpartum/breastfeeding: can resume statins since they are not secreted in breastmilk", but hold on, I should verify that; regulatory labeling and standard guidance advise avoiding statins during breastfeeding, so I need to correct myself and recommend deferring statins until breastfeeding is completed, while continuing lifestyle therapy and considering non‑statin options only when benefits clearly outweigh risks in exceptional circumstances [^1175doYF] [^113Ernn1] [^111ttfyW].

> For initial pharmacotherapy if pregnancy is not planned in the near term and contraception is reliable, I was about to say "start high‑intensity statin such as simvastatin 20–40 mg", but wait, let me reconsider because that is not high‑intensity; simvastatin up to 40 mg is generally a moderate‑intensity regimen, whereas guidelines define high‑intensity statins as atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg when indicated, with the choice individualized to baseline LDL‑C, FH status, and risk enhancers, and simvastatin remains an effective moderate‑intensity option per FDA labeling when that intensity is appropriate [^112VoFpE] [^117GbC23] [^1175doYF].

> If LDL‑C reduction with a maximally tolerated statin is insufficient or statin intolerance emerges, I should confirm adherence and secondary causes first, then add ezetimibe 10 mg daily as an evidence‑based next step for mixed hyperlipidemia and FH to achieve further LDL‑C lowering, recognizing its favorable tolerability profile and guideline‑supported role as second‑line therapy [^111dKNYA] [^114uL7ay] [^112VoFpE].

> I will now examine triglyceride management: if fasting TG are ≥ 500 mg/dL, the immediate priority is pancreatitis risk reduction by addressing secondary causes and lifestyle, with consideration of a fibrate such as fenofibrate 145 mg daily or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, while recognizing that for TG 175–499 mg/dL the emphasis remains on lifestyle, secondary cause correction, and appropriate statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction in line with age‑appropriate guidance [^115BvHcv] [^112zuBPQ] [^111XGpnH].

> For patients actively planning pregnancy soon or who become pregnant, I should avoid statins entirely, focus intensively on lifestyle measures during pregnancy, and, in very high‑risk FH scenarios, discuss specialized options such as LDL apheresis in collaboration with lipid and maternal‑fetal medicine specialists, deferring routine lipid‑lowering pharmacotherapy until after pregnancy and breastfeeding conclude [^113n4iNa] [^111ttfyW].

> Let me think about lifestyle and nonpharmacologic therapy because it is foundational across scenarios: adopt a Mediterranean‑style dietary pattern with reduced saturated fat and elimination of trans fats, pursue at least 150 minutes per week of moderate‑intensity aerobic activity, avoid tobacco, limit alcohol, aim for healthy weight, and implement stress reduction, counseling that lifestyle remains essential even when FH is present and pharmacotherapy is required [^116X4tTn] [^111XGpnH].

> Next, I should review monitoring: recheck a lipid panel 4–12 weeks after therapy initiation or adjustment to confirm percent LDL‑C reduction and non‑HDL‑C trends, obtain baseline hepatic enzymes and follow clinically if indicated, screen for pregnancy if of reproductive potential and on statins, assess adherence systematically, and, when TG remain ≥ 200 mg/dL after LDL‑C is addressed, use non‑HDL‑C as a secondary target consistent with NCEP‑informed labeling [^112VoFpE] [^113oo72Q].

> I need to ensure treatment goals are framed correctly: for severe hypercholesterolemia and FH we target a ≥ 50% LDL‑C reduction from baseline, and in very high‑risk states more intensive thresholds may apply per ESC/EAS, whereas in primary prevention without very high risk the emphasis is on appropriate statin intensity and percent reduction rather than rigid LDL‑C cut points, tailored to lifetime risk and risk enhancers in this young adult [^112VoFpE] [^113poDiK].

> If LDL‑C remains ≥ 100 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe in a 30‑year‑old with heterozygous FH, I should double‑check eligibility and consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor per guideline criteria, recognizing that recommendations are strongest in FH and very high‑risk profiles and that evidence is insufficient for routine addition in FH without ASCVD when goals are reasonably met on statin plus ezetimibe [^112Z9Zyv] [^111m3gRq] [^1113iAKR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging: CAC scoring is primarily validated for adults 40–75 to refine decisions when uncertainty persists, and while detectable CAC at a young age can be informative, I should reserve CAC for carefully selected cases and prioritize lifetime risk assessment and risk enhancers in this 30‑year‑old, documenting the rationale if CAC is deferred or pursued [^111U9Dm6] [^112FABwM] [^111jMSpQ].

> For long‑term management across the reproductive years, I should annually revisit pregnancy intentions and contraception, reinforce family cascade screening if FH is diagnosed, stop statins immediately when pregnancy occurs, prioritize lifestyle and safety in pregnancy, consider LDL apheresis for severe FH, and resume appropriate pharmacotherapy after pregnancy and breastfeeding consistent with labeling and guideline cautions, embedding this in a life‑course model of FH care when relevant [^111ttfyW] [^113n4iNa] [^115JiELU].

> Shared decision‑making is essential: I should explain that early lipid lowering in appropriately selected young adults may deliver larger lifetime absolute risk reductions than later initiation, discuss benefits and uncertainties transparently, incorporate the patient's values and reproductive plans, and improve adherence using structured supports, all of which should be documented clearly in the care plan [^116g1NRB] [^115YnKKk] [^112jxwwR].

> In summary, my verified algorithm is as follows: confirm mixed hyperlipidemia and exclude secondary causes; screen for FH and initiate cascade testing if diagnosed; estimate lifetime risk and consider risk enhancers; align treatment with reproductive plans, avoiding statins during pregnancy and breastfeeding; start guideline‑appropriate statin intensity when not pregnant and contraception is reliable, add ezetimibe if needed, treat severe hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis, and escalate to PCSK9 inhibitors in eligible FH not at goal despite statin plus ezetimibe; embed robust lifestyle therapy, structured monitoring, and shared decision‑making throughout to optimize long‑term outcomes in this 30‑year‑old patient [^111XGpnH] [^112VoFpE] [^111dKNYA] [^115BvHcv] [^112Z9Zyv].

For a 30-year-old female with mixed hyperlipidemia, **statins are first-line** [^112VoFpE] to lower LDL-C and non-HDL-C, with **fibrates for TG > 500 mg/dL** to reduce pancreatitis risk. Ezetimibe [^111dKNYA] or omega-3s [^111XGpnH] are added if goals are unmet or TG remain high. Niacin is rarely used due to side effects. Statins are contraindicated in **pregnancy**; stop 1–2 months before conception and use non-pharmacologic options if needed [^111ttfyW]. Lifestyle therapy is **essential** [^111XGpnH], and monitor lipids and liver enzymes regularly [^113oo72Q].

---

## Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)

Statins are the **cornerstone of therapy** for mixed hyperlipidemia, effectively lowering LDL-C and non-HDL-C and modestly reducing triglycerides. They are generally well-tolerated and have a favorable safety profile in young adults [^112VoFpE].

- **Simvastatin**: Reduces LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides; increases HDL-C; maximal response in 4–6 weeks [^1177zbsg].

- **Lovastatin**: Similar efficacy; maximal response in 4–6 weeks [^113Ernn1].

- **Fluvastatin**: Reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol; modest triglyceride reduction [^113xnorr].

Statins are contraindicated in **pregnancy**; discontinue 1–2 months before conception or immediately if pregnancy occurs [^111ttfyW].

---

## Fibrates

Fibrates are particularly **effective in lowering triglycerides** and are indicated when triglycerides are significantly elevated (> 500 mg/dL) to reduce pancreatitis risk. Gemfibrozil 600 mg PO BID significantly lowers **triglycerides** and modestly increases HDL-C [^112zuBPQ], and **Fenofibrate** 145 mg PO daily offers similar efficacy with once-daily dosing [^115BvHcv]. Fibrates are generally **well-tolerated** but can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and, rarely, myopathy, especially when combined with statins.

---

## Ezetimibe

Ezetimibe **inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption** and is typically used as adjunctive therapy [^114uL7ay] when statins alone do not achieve lipid goals. A typical regimen is **Ezetimibe** 10 mg PO daily, which reduces LDL-C and non-HDL-C with minimal effect on triglycerides [^111dKNYA]. Ezetimibe is generally **well-tolerated**, with minimal side effects.

---

## Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are **effective in lowering triglycerides** [^111XGpnH] and are often used adjunctively in mixed hyperlipidemia. Typical dosing of 2–4 g/day significantly reduces triglycerides with minimal effect on LDL-C; **Omega-3 fatty acids are generally well-tolerated**, with minimal gastrointestinal side effects.

---

## Niacin (nicotinic acid)

Niacin **effectively lowers LDL-C and triglycerides** and increases HDL-C, though its use has declined due to side effects such as flushing, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hepatotoxicity. When used, **Niacin ER** 500 mg PO qHS, titrated to 1,000–2,000 mg PO qHS, produces significant lipid improvements [^113gwetG]. Niacin is contraindicated in **pregnancy** and requires careful monitoring of liver enzymes.

---

## Special considerations for young female patients

- **Pregnancy**: Statins and niacin are contraindicated; discontinue 1–2 months before conception or immediately if pregnancy occurs.

- **Family planning**: Discuss contraception and pregnancy planning due to teratogenic risks of lipid-lowering medications.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Emphasize diet, exercise, and weight management as foundational therapy [^116X4tTn].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** of lipid profiles, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase is essential to assess treatment efficacy and safety. Adjustments should be made based on lipid targets and patient tolerance [^113oo72Q].

---

Statins are **first-line therapy** [^112VoFpE] for mixed hyperlipidemia in young females, with fibrates, ezetimibe, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin as adjuncts. Pregnancy and family planning require careful consideration due to teratogenic risks [^111ttfyW].

The effects of simvastatin tablets on total cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were assessed in controlled clinical studies involving adult patients with heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of hyperlipidemia and mixed hyperlipidemia. Simvastatin tablets significantly decreased total-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides (TG), while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Maximal to near-maximal response was generally achieved within 4 to 6 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Genetic criteria and interpreting genetic test results

The term 'HoFH' dates from the pre-genomic era when scientists and clinicians envisioned a simple scenario in which the identical pathogenic variant was present on both alleles of an affected individual, as sometimes observed in consanguineous matings. Pathogenic variants were mainly in three main genes, LDLR (loss-of-function), APOB (receptor-binding defective), and PCSK9 (gain-of-function), accounting for 85%–90%, 5%–10%, and 1%–3%, respectively, of all variants causing semi-dominant FH. More recently, a rare autosomal recessive form of FH [autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia (ARH)] accounting for < 1% of cases was identified, caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in LDLRAP1; heterozygotes are true 'carriers' with normal LDL-C levels.

As an autosomal semi-dominant condition, individuals with one copy of a pathogenic DNA variant — i.e. mono-allelic or heterozygous FH (HeFH) — express an abnormal biochemical phenotype, sometimes with characteristic clinical features. Individuals with bi-allelic pathogenic variants (one pathogenic variant inherited from each parent, each on a different chromosome, i.e.g.enotypic HoFH) have more extreme LDL-C deviation and more severe clinical features from a younger age. Mono-allelic and bi-allelic forms — i.e. HeFH and HoFH — have a prevalence of approximately 1 in 250–300 and approximately 1 in 250,000–360,000, respectively. In some populations, such as French Canadians, Afrikaners in South Africa, or Christian Lebanese, HoFH prevalence may be at least 10-fold higher.

### Interventions to improve adherence to lipid-lowering drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jxwwR]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

There were 31 unique inclusion criteria across the studies. The number of criteria varied from 1 to 9.

- **Age requirements**: These were the most common, with 24 studies stating them explicitly. Sixteen studies set a minimum age of 18 years, one set a minimum age of 19, three established a minimum age of 40, three established a minimum age of 65, and one only enrolled participants aged 50 or 60 years.
- **Prescribed medication**: This criterion was seen in 15 studies, with four explicitly requiring a "statin" prescription.
- **Specific diagnosis**: A specific diagnosis was a prerequisite in 10 studies, with hyperlipidaemia being the most prevalent.
- **Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) threshold**: Three studies specified a minimum LDL-C threshold for inclusion, with two requiring an LDL-C value greater than 130 mg/dL and one including patients with an LDL-C range of 70 to 189 mg/dL.

Among the 35 included studies, only seven studies specified the duration for which participants had been taking lipid-lowering medications (LLMs). Three studies included participants who were newly initiated on LLMs, while four included participants who were not newly initiated on LLMs. In particular, one study classified LLM duration into three categories: those on LLMs for less than 1 year, 1–5 years, or more than 5 years. Improvements in adherence were mixed among these studies, with only one study in each subgroup (newly initiated LLM and not newly initiated LLM) reporting statistically significant improvements in adherence.

### Performance of guideline recommendations for prevention of myocardial infarction in young adults [^113EzoyR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The 2018 cholesterol guidelines of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) modified 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) eligibility criteria for primary prevention. This change included multiple risk enhancers and introduced novel intensive lipid-lowering therapies for secondary prevention.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to determine how guideline changes affected identification for preventive therapy in young adults with premature myocardial infarction (MI).

- **Methods**: The study identified adults presenting with first MI at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Statin therapy eligibility was determined using the 2013 ACC/AHA and 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines criteria. The study also assessed potential eligibility for intensive lipid-lowering therapies (very high risk) under the 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines by evaluating the composite of all-cause death, reMI, or stroke rates in adults considered "very high risk" versus not.

- **Results**: Among 6,639 patients with MI, 41% were < 55 years of age ("younger"), 35% were 55 to 65 years of age ("middle-aged"), and 24% were 66 to 75 years of age ("older"). Younger adults were more frequently smokers (52% vs. 38% vs. 22%, respectively) and obese (42% vs. 34% vs. 31%, respectively), with metabolic syndrome (21% vs. 19% vs. 17%, respectively) and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (117 vs. 107 vs. 103 mg/dl, respectively) (p trend < 0.01 for all). Pre-MI, fewer younger adults met guideline indications for 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.

### Canadian cardiovascular society position statement on familial hypercholesterolemia: Update 2018 [^111VSB58]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly concerning general principles, the 2018 CCS guidelines recommend instituting a personalized treatment plan. This should consider, at a minimum, factors such as age, additional cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial and socioeconomic elements, as well as personal and family preferences. The development of this plan should be a shared decision-making process. Diagnosis using validated clinical criteria and/or genotyping may occur at any age, and it imparts a high, lifelong risk of ASCVD.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: An expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^112cUGew]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

In 2007, a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies analyzed ischemic heart disease mortality as a function of total cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), stratified by sex and age (5th to 9th decade). The relative risk of ischemic heart disease mortality related to the level of total cholesterol or non-HDL-C was highest among 40–49-year-olds. Relative risk decreased in a graded fashion with each advancing decade but remained statistically significant to age 80–89 years. In contrast, absolute risk was lowest in the youngest age group and increased with advancing age.

The prospective Copenhagen General Study investigated the association of LDL-C with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in 91,131 participants ranging in age from 20 to 100 years old. Among these, 10,591 participants were 70–79 years old, and 3,188 participants were 80–100 years old. Higher LDL-C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age. As in the Prospective Studies Collaboration, relative risks of MI and ASCVD, expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRadj), were highest in the youngest (20–49-year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.68 [95% CI 1.45–1.87]; ASCVD HRadj 1.47 [95% CI 1.32–1.64]) and lowest in the oldest (80–100-year-old) age group (MI HRadj 1.28 [95% CI 1.08–1.52]; ASCVD HRadj 1.16 [95% CI 1.05–1.29]). By contrast, the absolute risk of events was lowest in the youngest age group and highest in the oldest age group. Based on these prospective observational data, the authors estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent MI or another cardiovascular event in these age groups.

### Cholesterol treatment guidelines update [^1118M91z]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major contributors to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in our society. The National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Institutes of Health has created a set of guidelines that standardize the clinical assessment and management of hypercholesterolemia for practicing physicians and other professionals in the medical community. In May 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program released its third set of guidelines, reflecting changes in cholesterol management since their previous report in 1993.

In addition to modifying strategies of risk assessment, the new guidelines stress the importance of an aggressive therapeutic approach in the management of hypercholesterolemia. The major risk factors that modify low-density lipoprotein goals include age, smoking status, hypertension, high-density lipoprotein levels, and family history. The concept of "CHD equivalent" is introduced — conditions requiring the same vigilance used in patients with coronary heart disease. Patients with diabetes and those with a 10-year cardiac event risk of 20 percent or greater are considered CHD equivalents. Once low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is at an accepted level, physicians are advised to address the metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceridemia.

The 2019 guidelines from AAPA, ABC, ACC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, AHA, APhA, ASPC, and PCNA recommend addressing and treating lifestyle factors, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, secondary factors like diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, and hypothyroidism should be considered. Medications that increase triglyceride levels should also be reviewed in adult patients aged 20 years and older who present with moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting or non-fasting triglycerides between 175–499 mg/dL (2.0–5.6 mmol/L).

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Statin therapy for young adults: A long-term investment worth considering [^113wFdxn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Statins, or HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, significantly decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This reduction leads to the stabilization, and in some cases regression, of atherosclerotic plaque, subsequently reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. At the time of writing, there remains a paucity of data to guide the use of statins in young adults (20–49 years old). This article aims to summarize the potential benefits and risks of statin therapy in younger adults, outlining a possible approach to statin use.

Early identification and treatment of young individuals at risk for ASCVD offer the potential to significantly reduce the lifetime risk of ASCVD. However, there is a lack of data on the potential side effects of long-term statin use over many decades. Comprehensive risk assessment, including the calculation of lifetime ASCVD risk, and incorporating non-traditional risk factors — such as lipoprotein (a), a strong family history of premature ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C level, and the presence of underlying systemic inflammatory disorders — can be helpful in identifying young adults who stand to benefit the most from statin therapy.

Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment, as well as potentially polygenic risk scores, can be considered in situations where there remains uncertainty regarding risk assessment. Importantly, the decision for statin treatment should occur in the context of a patient-centered shared decision-making process.

### Challenges and opportunities for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease among young adults: Report from a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working group [^1131FT1p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guidelines for the primary prevention of ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) have been based on evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials enrolling individuals aged ≥ 40 years. These trials focus on endpoints, including ASCVD events, heart failure, cardiovascular or total mortality, or atherosclerosis progression. Few trials have specifically targeted a primary prevention population, which includes younger participants. Identifying highly effective interventions that significantly reduce the relative risk of ASCVD, as well as precisely identifying the most susceptible populations with the highest risk of near-term ASCVD events, remains imperative.

### Life course approach for managing familial hypercholesterolemia [^1127KwpD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia is directed toward the moment of the medical encounter. However, the risk for heart disease as a consequence of having familial hypercholesterolemia is related to lifelong exposure to elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, rather than the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at a specific time point. The purpose of this review is to reassess contemporary research on the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and evidence-based guidelines. It presents an approach that emphasizes treatment across the life course and recognizes the importance of family experiences to care.

To accomplish this, we review the changing treatment needs that emerge across the life course, from birth through childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, peripregnancy, middle age, and late in life. Special attention is paid to improving adherence to treatment, the potential role of monitoring atherosclerosis in a lifelong model of care, and medical issues related to care transitions: from pediatric to internal medicine care, peripregnancy, following a cardiac event, and care after age 70 years in the absence of a cardiac event. Novel considerations related to the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are discussed.

The summary identifies research gaps that need to be closed to move from the point-of-care model to one that considers treatment over the life course.

### Lovastatin [^113Ernn1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce total cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in both heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of primary hypercholesterolemia, as well as in mixed hyperlipidemia. A significant response was observed within 2 weeks, with maximum therapeutic effects occurring within 4 to 6 weeks. This response was maintained with continued therapy. Single daily doses, administered in the evening, proved more effective than morning doses, likely due to cholesterol synthesis occurring mainly at night.

In multicenter, double-blind studies involving patients with familial or non-familial hypercholesterolemia, lovastatin, at doses ranging from 10 mg q.p.m. to 40 mg b.i.d., was compared to placebo. Lovastatin consistently and significantly decreased plasma total-C, LDL-C, total-C/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Additionally, lovastatin produced variable increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and modestly decreased very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and plasma triglycerides (TG).

Lovastatin was evaluated against cholestyramine in a randomized open parallel study with patients who had hypercholesterolemia and were at high risk of myocardial infarction. Tables II through IV, although referenced, are not present in the text.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: An expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association and the American Geriatrics Society [^11691nfh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Although several ASCVD and global cardiovascular disease risk stratification algorithms are available for clinicians to use in individuals older than 75 years, they have notable limitations including a small number of individuals in this age group in the derivation cohort, limited non-white enrollment, or derivation in countries outside the United States, all limiting generalizability to the overall U.S. population. The pooled cohort risk equations (PCE), which are sex and race-specific, were derived from five community-based cohorts of Black and White participants in the U.S. aged 40–79 years and are generally considered most applicable to the U.S. population.

Similar to other risk stratification algorithms, the PCE are heavily influenced by age, yielding risk estimates among older individuals with favorable risk profiles that are well above the traditional 10-year ASCVD risk thresholds used to perform risk discussion regarding statin treatment. Despite these limitations, the use of the PCE could be helpful for individual patients for several reasons.

- **Risk communication**: Clinicians could use the 10-year risk estimation as a medium to communicate risk in a numeric form to the patient and to discuss healthy lifestyle choices.

- **Identification of driving risk factors**: A higher risk may identify which risk factor(s) might be driving the higher ASCVD risk in an older adult and allow clinicians and patients to focus prevention efforts on those specific risk factors (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, smoking).

Clinicians could discuss how the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk would be impacted by modifications in these risk factors.

### Lovastatin [^113oo72Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines are summarized below:

- **Secondary target of therapy**: After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if triglycerides (TG) are still ≥ 200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.

- **Initiation of drug therapy**: At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C is ≥ 130 mg/dL. See NCEP Guidelines above for further details.

- **Monitoring treatment response**: Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available should total cholesterol (total-C) be used to monitor therapy.

- **Use of lovastatin tablets**: Although lovastatin tablets USP may be useful to reduce elevated LDL-C levels in patients with combined hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, where hypercholesterolemia is the major abnormality (Type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia), it has not been studied in conditions where the major abnormality is the elevation of chylomicrons, VLDL, or IDL (i.e. hyperlipoproteinemia types I, III, IV, or V).

The NCEP classification of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease is summarized below:

- **Re-evaluation in adulthood**: Children treated with lovastatin in adolescence should be re-evaluated in adulthood, and appropriate changes should be made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen to achieve adult goals for LDL-C.

### Hyperlipidemia in early adulthood increases long-term risk of coronary heart disease [^1169S29F]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

Many young adults with moderate hyperlipidemia do not meet statin treatment criteria under the new American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology cholesterol guidelines because they focus on a 10-year cardiovascular risk. This study evaluated the association between years of exposure to hypercholesterolemia in early adulthood and future coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.

- **Methods and results**: We examined Framingham Offspring Cohort data to identify adults without incident cardiovascular disease up to 55 years of age (n = 1478). We explored the association between the duration of moderate hyperlipidemia (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL) in early adulthood and subsequent CHD. At the median 15-year follow-up, CHD rates were significantly elevated among adults with prolonged hyperlipidemia exposure by 55 years of age: 4.4% for those with no exposure, 8.1% for those with 1 to 10 years of exposure, and 16.5% for those with 11 to 20 years of exposure (P < 0.001). This association persisted after adjustment for other cardiac risk factors, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 55 years of age (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.85 per decade of hyperlipidemia). Overall, 85% of young adults with prolonged hyperlipidemia would not have been recommended for statin therapy at 40 years of age under National guidelines. However, among those not considered statin therapy candidates at 55 years of age, there remained a significant association between cumulative exposure to hyperlipidemia in young adulthood and subsequent CHD risk.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, specifically with respect to statins, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a moderate-intensity statin in intermediate-risk adult patients. This recommendation applies if a decision is made for statin therapy within the context of a risk discussion, as statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD.

### Using age- and sex-specific risk thresholds to guide statin therapy: One size may not fit all [^116Jad8d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

New cholesterol guidelines emphasize the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to identify adults eligible for statin therapy as primary prevention. However, the question of whether these CVD risk thresholds should be individualized by age and sex has not been explored.

- **Objectives**: This study evaluated the potential impact of incorporating age- and sex-specific CVD risk thresholds into cholesterol guidelines.

- **Methods**: Using data from the Framingham Offspring Study, this study assessed treatment recommendations among age- and sex-specific groups in 3,685 participants free of CVD. It evaluated how varying age- and sex-specific 10-year CVD risk thresholds for statin treatment affected the sensitivity and specificity for incident 10-year CVD events.

- **Results**: Basing statin therapy recommendations on a 10-year fixed risk threshold of 7.5% results in lower statin consideration among women than men (63% vs. 33%; p < 0.0001), yet most study participants aged 66 to 75 years were recommended for statin treatment (90.3%). The fixed 7.5% threshold had relatively low sensitivity for capturing 10-year events in younger women and men (40 to 55 years of age). Sensitivity of the recommendations was substantially improved when the treatment threshold was reduced to 5% in participants 40 to 55 years of age. Among older adults (66 to 75 years of age), specificity was poor, but when the treatment threshold was raised to 10% in women and 15% in men, specificity significantly improved with minimal loss in sensitivity.

- **Conclusions**: Cholesterol treatment recommendations may benefit from refining thresholds based on age and sex to improve the balance between sensitivity and specificity in various demographics.

### The expected 30-year benefits of early versus delayed primary prevention of cardiovascular disease by lipid lowering [^116g1NRB]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering recommendations for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease rely principally on estimated 10-year risk. We sought to determine the optimal time for initiation of lipid-lowering in younger adults as a function of expected 30-year benefit.

- **Methods**: Data from 3,148 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2009–2016) participants, age 30 to 59 years, not eligible for lipid-lowering treatment recommendation under the most recent US guidelines, were analyzed. We estimated the absolute and relative impact of lipid lowering as a function of age, age at initiation, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level on the expected rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease over the succeeding 30 years. We modeled expected risk reductions based on shorter-term effects observed in statin trials (model A) and longer-term benefits based on Mendelian randomization studies (model B).

- **Results**: In both models, potential reductions in predicted 30-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk were greater with older age and higher non-HDL-C level. Immediate initiation of lipid lowering (i.e. treatment for 30 years) in 40- to 49-year-old patients with non-HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL would be expected to reduce their average predicted 30-year risk from 17.1% to 11.6% (model A; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 5.5%) or 6.5% (model B; ARR 10.6%). Delaying lipid lowering by 10 years (treatment for 20 years) would result in a residual 30-year risk of 12.7% (A; ARR 4.4%) or 9.9% (B; ARR 7.2%), and delaying by 20 years (treatment for 10 years) would lead…

### 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: What was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better.

- **Prioritization of statin therapy**: The guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy.
- **Areas for enhancement**: We contend that the guideline could be improved by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on the evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age.

We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review the best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

- **HeFH in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older**: Fluvastatin capsules were studied in two open-label, uncontrolled, dose-titration trials. The first trial enrolled 29 pre-pubertal males, aged 9 to 12 years, who had an LDL-C level above the 90th percentile for their age and a parent with primary hypercholesterolemia, along with either a family history of premature ischemic heart disease or tendon xanthomas. The mean baseline LDL-C was 226 mg/dL (range, 137 to 354 mg/dL).

	- All patients started on fluvastatin capsules at 20 mg daily, with dose adjustments every 6 weeks to 40 mg daily, then 80 mg daily (40 mg twice daily) to achieve an LDL-C goal between 97 to 124 mg/dL. Endpoint analyses were performed at year 2. Fluvastatin decreased plasma levels of total-C and LDL-C by 21% and 27%, respectively. The mean achieved LDL-C was 161 mg/dL (range, 74 to 336 mg/dL).

	- The second trial enrolled 85 male and female patients, aged 10 to 16 years, who had an LDL-C above 190 mg/dL, or an LDL-C above 160 mg/dL with one or more risk factors for coronary heart disease, or an LDL-C above 160 mg/dL and a proven LDL-receptor defect.

### Lipid-lowering treatment to the end? A review of observational studies and RCTs on cholesterol and mortality in 80+-year olds [^113gHcaS]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

People aged 80 or older are the fastest growing population in high-income countries. One of the most common causes of death among the elderly is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipid-lowering treatment is common; for instance, one-third of 75–84-year-old Swedes are treated with statins. The assumption that hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor at the highest ages seems to be based on extrapolation from younger adults. A review of observational studies shows a trend where all-cause mortality was highest when total cholesterol (TC) was lowest, indicating a 'reverse J-shaped' association between TC and all-cause mortality. Low TC (< 5.5 mmol/l) is associated with the highest mortality rate in 80+-year-olds. No clear optimal level of TC was identified.

A review of the few randomized controlled trials, including 80+-year-olds, did not provide evidence of an effect of lipid-lowering treatment on total mortality in this age group. There is not sufficient data to recommend anything regarding initiation or continuation of lipid-lowering treatment for the population aged 80+ with known CVD. It is even possible that statins may increase all-cause mortality in this group of elderly individuals without CVD.

### Incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in young adults at low short-term but high long-term risk [^111jMSpQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

To guide lipid-lowering treatment decisions, the 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) cholesterol guideline recommends using pooled cohort equations (PCEs) to estimate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. However, the PCEs are not directly applicable to young adults because they were developed in and recommended only for adults 40 to 75 years of age. The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline recommends the estimation of lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk for adults younger than 40 years of age.

A few studies have reported that some adults may have a low 10-year but a high lifetime predicted ASCVD risk. Because age is the strongest contributor to the 10-year predicted risk, young adults generally have a low 10-year ASCVD predicted risk even if their risk factor profile indicates a high lifetime risk. Individuals with a low 10-year but a high lifetime predicted ASCVD risk have a higher incidence of subclinical ASCVD compared with those with both low 10-year and lifetime predicted risk, suggesting this subgroup would benefit from preventive measures.

Existing lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk tools were derived from a single cohort of non-Hispanic Whites aged 20 to 59 years. It is unclear how well these long-term ASCVD risk prediction tools, along with the PCE 10-year risk equation, discriminate high vs. low ASCVD risk among young adults, especially among those who are not non-Hispanic White. In the present study, we compared the performance of 10-year, 30-year, and lifetime ASCVD risk prediction tools recommended by the guidelines.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with a ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with a 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that the initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in aging populations.

### Managing hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: An expert clinical consensus from the national lipid association and the American geriatrics society [^116BFpBU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age; for example, a healthy 85-year-old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years and would likely benefit from primary prevention, whereas a frail, multimorbid 85-year-old woman may have less than two years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status, and frailty to estimate life expectancy.

- **Morbidity and life expectancy**: If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended. If the life expectancy is approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should be the guiding factor in decision-making.

- **Tools and patient preferences**: An online calculator, ePrognosis, can help clinicians incorporate evidence-based information about life expectancy for older adults into decisions about preventive therapies such as statins. For example, for an individual with advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy. In such cases, the goals of therapy may shift over time from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life.

For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment, or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in decisions about statin therapy is essential for patient-centered care.

### Life course approach for managing familial hypercholesterolemia [^115JiELU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia is often focused on the immediate medical encounter. However, the risk of heart disease as a consequence of familial hypercholesterolemia is associated more with lifelong exposure to elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than with levels at specific time points. This review aims to reassess contemporary research on the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and evidence-based guidelines. It presents an approach emphasizing treatment across the life course and recognizes the significance of family experiences in care.

To achieve this, we examine the evolving treatment needs across different life stages — from birth through childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, peripregnancy, middle age, and into later life. Special attention is given to improving adherence to treatment, the role of monitoring atherosclerosis in a lifelong care model, and addressing medical issues related to care transitions. These transitions include moving from pediatric to internal medicine care, peripregnancy stages, post-cardiac event care, and care beyond the age of 70 in the absence of a cardiac event.

- **Adherence to treatment**: Focus on strategies to improve patient compliance with prescribed therapies.
- **Monitoring atherosclerosis**: Consider the benefits and methods for tracking atherosclerosis over a patient's lifetime.
- **Care transitions**: Address issues in transitioning care at various life stages, such as:
	- From pediatric to internal medicine.
	- During the peripregnancy phase.
	- Post-cardiac event care strategies.
	- Care considerations after age 70 without a cardiac event.

Novel considerations related to treating homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia are also discussed. The summary identifies research gaps that need to be addressed to transition from the current point-of-care model to one that incorporates treatment over the life course.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: New treatments and clinical guidance [^113n4iNa]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

This 2023 statement updates clinical guidance for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH), explains the genetic complexity, and provides pragmatic recommendations to address inequities in HoFH care worldwide. Key strengths include updated criteria for the clinical diagnosis of HoFH and the recommendation to prioritize phenotypic features over genotype. Thus, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 10 mmol/L (> 400 mg/dL) is suggestive of HoFH and warrants further evaluation. The statement also provides state-of-the-art discussion and guidance to clinicians for interpreting the results of genetic testing and for family planning and pregnancy.

Therapeutic decisions are based on the LDL-C level. Combination LDL-C-lowering therapy — both pharmacologic intervention and lipoprotein apheresis (LA) — is foundational. The addition of novel, efficacious therapies (i.e. inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, followed by evinacumab and/or lomitapide) offers potential to attain the LDL-C goal or reduce the need for LA. To improve HoFH care around the world, the statement recommends the creation of national screening programmes, education to improve awareness, and management guidelines that account for the local realities of care, including access to specialist centres, treatments, and cost. This updated statement provides guidance that is crucial to early diagnosis, better care, and improved cardiovascular health for patients with HoFH worldwide.

### Glycogen storage disease type 1a - a secondary cause for hyperlipidemia: Report of five cases [^116T1cBv]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of the treatment, which is mainly dietary, is to maintain a nearly euglycemic state to prevent secondary metabolic disturbances, neurologic involvement, and ensure normal growth.

The rarity of this condition implies that no single metabolic center has experience with a large number of patients. As the diagnosis is usually made in childhood, the follow-up is conducted in pediatric centers. With improved life expectancy, these patients reach adulthood and require continued management of complications associated with the natural history of the disease.

One of the manifestations almost always present is severe hyperlipidemia, rarely associated with premature atherosclerosis, although some studies report an increased cardiovascular risk. GSD I affects many organ systems, such as renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, bone, and cardiovascular systems, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach that includes nutritional support to ameliorate the frequently present complications. It is important to be familiar with the disease.

The authors present a report of five adult patients with GSD type Ia followed in internal medicine appointments and subspecialties.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^114DMnA5]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

For use in daily clinical practice, we constructed a flowchart with advice on when to initiate, continue, and deprescribe lipid-lowering drugs in fit and frail adults aged ≥ 75 years. The recommendations align with the Dutch addendum 'CVRM in (frail) older adults'. The cut-off of ≥ 75 years of age is arbitrary but consistent with the majority of available evidence. For each patient, a discussion of estimated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk of adverse effects, and consideration of patient preferences should precede decisions on prescribing lipid-lowering drugs.

In older patients with pre-existing CVD and a reasonable life expectancy (more than 1–2 years), the lifetime risk of CVD is high enough to benefit from initiating or continuing lipid-lowering therapy. However, if there are severe negative effects (e.g. side effects) or if life expectancy is limited (less than 1–2 years), the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy do not outweigh potential adverse effects. For frail older patients without pre-existing CVD, we propose to deprescribe or not initiate lipid-lowering treatment. Their lifetime risk of CVD is not sufficient to benefit from lipid-lowering therapy in terms of preventing a cardiovascular event in the time left to live. Additionally, frailty may exacerbate adverse effects of therapy. In fit older adults with a life expectancy of ≥ 2 years, initiate or continue lipid-lowering therapy only if a patient is at high risk of CVD, such as having diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol > 8 mmol/L, or blood pressure > 180/110 mm Hg.

### Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in older adults calls for a patient-centred approach [^117Gq854]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Due to an increasing number of older adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the sum of older adults eligible for lipid-lowering drugs will increase. This has raised questions about the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults with a varying number of cardiovascular comorbidities and functional status. The heterogeneity in physical and functional health increases with age, leading to a much wider variety in cardiovascular risk and life expectancy than in younger adults. We suggest treatment decisions on hypercholesterolaemia in adults aged ≥ 75 years should shift from a strictly 10-year cardiovascular risk-driven approach to a patient-centred and lifetime benefit-based approach. With this, the estimated 10-year risk of CVD should be placed into the perspective of life expectancy. Moreover, frailty and safety concerns must be taken into account for a risk-benefit discussion between clinician and patient. Based on the Dutch addendum 'Cardiovascular Risk Management in (frail) older adults', our approach offers more detailed information on when not to initiate or deprescribe therapy than standard guidelines. Instead of using traditional risk-estimating tools which tend to overestimate risk of CVD in older adults, a competing risk-adjusted, older adults-specific risk score should be used (available at https://u-prevent.com). By filling in a patient's cardiovascular health profile (e.g. cholesterol, renal function), the tool estimates risk of CVD and models the effect of medication in terms of absolute risk reduction for an individual patient.
