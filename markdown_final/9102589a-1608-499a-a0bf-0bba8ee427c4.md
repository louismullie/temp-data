## Question

How is the physical examination of the neck performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to perform the neck physical examination across key presentations such as neck mass, neck pain, trauma, and pre-manipulation vascular screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about history and triage to frame risk and urgency. Then, I should move to general inspection and palpation. Next, I will assess active and passive range of motion. After that, I will tailor special tests to the clinical context: mass, pain, trauma, and vascular concerns. I will then complete a focused neurological examination, consider infection control and imaging triggers, and finally document and interpret findings with guideline-based risk stratification and referral thresholds [^114a5mDi] [^111tqt5H].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and immediately screen for red flags so I do not miss serious disease. For a neck mass, I should ask about duration, fluctuation, infectious symptoms, and features suggesting malignancy risk such as persistence beyond two weeks without clear infection, while also recognizing key exam risk features like firmness, fixation, size greater than 1.5 cm, and overlying skin ulceration per AAO-HNSF 2017, because this determines urgency and imaging pathways [^115cPJa9] [^114YbGbf]. For neck pain, I need to screen for serious pathology including infection, cancer, arterial insufficiency, upper cervical ligamentous insufficiency, and fracture, as emphasized by APTA 2017, and triage trauma with validated rules such as NEXUS or Canadian C-spine, reserving early imaging for high-risk scenarios or neurological deficits [^113zDrdG] [^114ogT9S]. But wait, I should also consider infectious spondylodiscitis when new or worsening neck pain coexists with fever, elevated ESR/CRP, bacteremia, or endocarditis, prompting MRI and urgent evaluation per IDSA 2015 and ACR 2019 guidance for suspected infection or progressive radiculopathy [^113Eo7xp] [^117MvHAM].

> Now, I will perform a general inspection, but let me slow down and ensure I sequence this safely if trauma is suspected. I observe posture, head-neck alignment, and any torticollis or craniocervical kyphosis, scan the skin for scars, erythema, or ulceration, and watch for visible masses, asymmetry, or pulsations, while also noting respiratory status for stridor or distress that might require prioritizing airway evaluation before proceeding, as neck examination is integral even for patients presenting with headache and upper aerodigestive complaints that may require targeted visualization [^114pDrNK] [^113PkA7B].

> Next, I will palpate systematically, but hold on, I should verify how I approach the carotids to avoid error. I methodically examine all cervical lymph node levels and the supraclavicular fossae, documenting size, consistency, mobility, and tenderness, because firmness, fixation, size over 1.5 cm, and skin ulceration increase malignancy risk and guide escalation [^114YbGbf]. I palpate the thyroid for enlargement, nodules, and tenderness, and assess soft tissues and muscles including the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and paraspinals, since paraspinal tenderness can align with facetogenic pain hypotheses and influence my working differential, though I should confirm with the rest of the exam rather than assume causality [^1174nqvw]. I was about to palpate carotid pulses bilaterally at once, but wait, I need to check myself — comparison should be sequential, not simultaneous, and in trauma I should also look for hematoma, thrill, or pulse deficit as potential hard signs of vascular injury that change management pathways [^113qsL7w].

> I will now examine cervical range of motion, keeping safety in mind. Active motions include flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation, with documentation of degrees or a descriptive qualifier and any reproduction of concordant pain, followed by cautious passive assessment only when appropriate and safe, particularly avoiding forceful movements in suspected instability or acute trauma [^114ogT9S]. Let me verify the classification framework I plan to use: APTA 2017 supports using motion limitations, trauma history, referred or radiating pain, and headache features to classify neck pain into mobility deficits, movement coordination impairments, cervicogenic headache, and radiating pain, and it supports specific tests such as the cervical flexion-rotation test and segmental mobility assessment to refine that classification and guide treatment [^111tqt5H] [^115P5mao].

> If the presentation is a neck mass, I need a targeted head and neck exam with mucosal visualization. I should perform or arrange a targeted examination that visualizes the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx in patients at increased malignancy risk, using in-office flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy where indicated, since identifying a mucosal primary site changes staging and workup in suspected head and neck cancer or unknown primary scenarios [^113PkA7B] [^115GP5rV]. Let me consider adjuncts: narrow band imaging can enhance mucosal lesion detection on endoscopy and may be helpful, though I will not rely on it alone for definitive decisions without correlating with biopsy and imaging when appropriate [^112qUqNF].

> If the clinical problem is neck pain, I should tailor tests to the hypothesized mechanism. I need to check neurodynamic tension tests when neuropathic involvement is suspected, use the Spurling test and distraction test to support cervical radiculopathy hypotheses, and cautiously interpret Valsalva-provoked pain as low-specificity supportive information rather than a standalone diagnostic marker, while the cervical flexion-rotation test helps support cervicogenic headache and the cranial cervical flexion test informs deep neck flexor performance in movement coordination impairments [^111tqt5H] [^115P5mao]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these maneuvers support classification and require correlation with the full clinical picture and, when appropriate, imaging or electrodiagnostics to avoid overdiagnosis [^111tqt5H].

> In trauma, I should first screen for life threats and then apply a selective, evidence-based imaging strategy. I need to check for hard signs of vascular or aerodigestive injury such as active bleeding, expanding hematoma, bruit, thrill, or pulse deficit, perform a focused neurological screen, and palpate for midline tenderness to help decide immobilization and imaging needs, with NEXUS or Canadian C-spine rules informing initial triage after blunt trauma [^114ogT9S]. But wait, I should verify the contemporary approach in penetrating trauma — the modern "no-zone" strategy relies on clinical examination plus multidetector CT angiography in stable patients, sparing unnecessary explorations and recognizing that physical exam alone can miss vascular injuries in gunshot trauma, which is why CTA has become central to evaluation, with similar selective strategies adapted in pediatrics when stable [^111jor4M] [^113qsL7w] [^116YQ6dk].

> For pre-manipulation vascular screening or when vascular symptoms are suspected, I must adopt the IFOMPT vascular framework. Initially, I thought I should perform vertebral artery positional tests or a modified Wallenberg maneuver, but wait, let me reconsider — IFOMPT emphasizes a history-driven risk assessment and adapting the physical examination to explore a vasculogenic hypothesis rather than relying on provocative positional tests with limited diagnostic accuracy, so I should prioritize symptom chronology, risk factors, cranial or brainstem signs, blood pressure asymmetries, and gentle sustained end-range exposures only if justified and safe, stopping immediately if concerning symptoms appear [^111gswcG]. I need to ensure referral for urgent imaging and specialist evaluation if the history or exam suggests cervical artery dysfunction or dissection to avoid iatrogenic harm [^111gswcG].

> I will now examine the neurological system to complete the assessment. I should confirm cranial nerve integrity, with special attention to IX–XII in suspected upper aerodigestive tract pathology and XI for trapezius and sternocleidomastoid strength, and perform upper extremity myotome, dermatome, and reflex testing to map potential cervical root involvement, integrating these findings with my mechanical tests and history [^114RysGY] [^111tqt5H]. If myelopathy is on the differential, I need to check for gait disturbance, balance impairment, lower extremity weakness, and bowel or bladder changes, and escalate urgently when present to avoid delay in definitive management [^113rMUix].

> Special operational considerations can materially change how I examine and test. During respiratory viral outbreaks, I should employ appropriate PPE for aerosol-generating upper airway procedures such as nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and even avoid or defer nonessential aerosolizing maneuvers where feasible to protect staff and patients, while still ensuring that essential diagnostic steps are not omitted [^116RT7dY] [^1157mQSX]. Let me verify imaging adjuncts for masses — high-resolution ultrasound is highly informative for superficial neck lumps and is often first-line in some pathways, but in patients at increased risk for malignancy the AAO-HNSF guideline recommends contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to stage deep spaces and plan tissue diagnosis, so I should align the modality with risk and clinical question [^112QrDpK] [^112q1Kq9]. For preoperative or airway risk assessment, I may consider bedside screens such as Mallampati, recognizing that diagnostic accuracy varies across airway difficulty domains and no single test is definitive [^115MtnDj].

> I should double-check my imaging triggers in neck pain to avoid overuse and underuse. For suspected infection, new or worsening nontraumatic neck pain with systemic signs, or concerning radiculopathy, cervical MRI with contrast is appropriate, whereas in chronic nontraumatic neck pain without red flags, initial radiographs may suffice, with CT considered next when specific pathology such as ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is identified on X-ray and further bony delineation is needed, consistent with ACR guidelines [^117MvHAM] [^115iW6Yz] [^1156VQ3e]. Hmm, wait a minute — imaging symptomatic patients with a normal head and neck clinical examination for cancer has low yield, so I should rely on risk-stratified clinical evaluation before ordering advanced imaging in that context to reduce unnecessary tests [^112qAqiy].

> Documentation and interpretation must be standardized to support reliable decisions. I need to record the precise location of findings, lymph node size in centimeters, consistency, mobility, tenderness, thyroid features, and cervical ROM measures, and then synthesize malignancy risk for a neck mass using AAO-HNSF criteria while classifying neck pain according to APTA 2017 categories to guide care or referral [^114YbGbf] [^111tqt5H]. I should confirm escalation thresholds: in patients deemed at increased risk for malignancy, obtain contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the neck and arrange specialist evaluation and tissue diagnosis rather than empiric antibiotics or prolonged observation to avoid delays in cancer care [^112q1Kq9].

> To conclude and ensure quality, I need to ensure my method is reproducible and focused on the most reliable components. Interrater reliability for manual assessment techniques varies, whereas muscle length evaluation and cervical ROM show higher reliability, so I should prioritize standardized, repeatable measurements and clear descriptors to track change over time and to communicate effectively with consultants and across care transitions [^115j43sc]. Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with the core components across all contexts — inspection, palpation, ROM, targeted special tests, neurological screening, and rigorous documentation — so that my examination remains comprehensive yet appropriately tailored to the clinical hypothesis [^111tqt5H].

The physical exam of the neck is a structured assessment to identify **red flags** and guide management [^113zDrdG]. It includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, and neurologic testing, with attention to lymph nodes, thyroid, and vascular structures. Key findings such as **firm, fixed, > 1.5 cm nodes** [^114YbGbf] or persistent masses ≥ 2 weeks without infection history warrant urgent evaluation [^115cPJa9]. Imaging is guided by clinical suspicion, with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI [^112q1Kq9] for suspected malignancy or infection [^117MvHAM], and ultrasound for superficial masses [^112QrDpK] [^114uFw34].

---

## Inspection

Assess head and neck **posture and alignment**, noting torticollis, kyphosis, or scoliosis [^1134SRgp]. Examine the skin for erythema, swelling, scars, sinus tracts, or ulceration. Document any **visible masses** — location, size, shape, and movement with swallowing or tongue protrusion [^116NAgip]. Observe for jugular venous distension or abnormal pulsations [^111gswcG].

---

## Palpation

- **Lymph nodes**: Systematically palpate occipital, posterior auricular, preauricular, submandibular, submental, anterior and posterior cervical, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular nodes. Assess size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, and matting [^114YbGbf].
- **Thyroid gland**: Palpate for enlargement, nodules, tenderness, and movement with swallowing [^114uFw34].
- **Trachea**: Assess midline position and mobility [^111uF4T5].
- **Carotid arteries**: Palpate gently for pulsations, thrills, or bruits [^111gswcG].
- **Muscles**: Palpate sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, and paraspinal muscles for tenderness, spasm, or atrophy [^111tqt5H].

---

## Range of motion (ROM)

Assess **active range of motion** for flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation, noting any limitations, pain, or crepitus [^115j43sc]. Perform **passive range of motion** if active movement is limited or painful. For suspected radiculopathy, use Spurling's test, the distraction test, and the Valsalva maneuver. For cervicogenic headache, apply the cervical flexion-rotation test [^115P5mao].

---

## Neurologic examination

- **Cranial nerves**: Assess cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII for dysphagia, dysarthria, shoulder weakness, or tongue deviation [^114RysGY].
- **Motor strength**: Test upper extremity strength, focusing on C5-T1 myotomes.
- **Sensory testing**: Evaluate dermatomal sensation in the upper extremities.
- **Reflexes**: Test biceps (C5–6), brachioradialis (C6), and triceps (C7) reflexes [^111tqt5H].
- **Upper motor neuron signs**: Assess for hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and Hoffmann's sign [^113rMUix].

---

## Vascular assessment

Auscultate the **carotid arteries** for bruits, indicating possible stenosis or aneurysm, and assess the **jugular veins** for distension or abnormal pulsations, suggesting cardiac or vascular pathology [^111gswcG].

---

## Red flag findings

- **Malignancy**: Firm, fixed, non-tender lymph nodes > 1.5 cm [^114YbGbf], persistent ≥ 2 weeks without infection, or ulceration of overlying skin [^115cPJa9].
- **Infection**: Fever, erythema, fluctuance, or rapidly enlarging mass [^113WW878].
- **Vascular injury**: Expanding hematoma, bruit, thrill, or pulse deficit [^111jor4M].
- **Neurologic compromise**: Myelopathy, radiculopathy, or cranial nerve deficits [^113rMUix].

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

Order imaging when malignancy, infection [^117MvHAM], or vascular injury is suspected: contrast-enhanced CT or MRI [^112q1Kq9] in these scenarios, and ultrasound for superficial masses or thyroid nodules [^112QrDpK] [^114uFw34]. Obtain **fine-needle aspiration biopsy** for persistent or suspicious masses, and order laboratory tests such as CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid function tests, or infectious disease serologies as indicated [^111uF4T5] [^113Eo7xp].

---

## Documentation

Record the **location** with a precise anatomical description; **size** in centimeters; **consistency** (soft, firm, hard, or rubbery); **mobility** (mobile, fixed, or matted); and **tenderness** (present or absent) [^111uF4T5]. Note the overlying skin as normal, erythematous, or ulcerated, and document associated findings such as neurologic deficits, vascular abnormalities, and systemic symptoms [^1174JGGT].

---

In conclusion, **use a systematic approach** — inspect, palpate, assess ROM and neurologic status — and escalate care for red flags. Tailor imaging to clinical suspicion [^116NAgip].

### Response assessment after induction chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: From physical examination to modern imaging techniques and beyond [^115DrHxq]. Head & Neck (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of imaging after induction chemotherapy, but before subsequent locoregional therapy, is based on the ability to predict clinical response and survival after sequential definitive therapy (i.e. concurrent [chemo]radiation or surgery). It is not always essential to achieve a complete response after induction chemotherapy, because subsequent definitive (chemo)radiation may eradicate residual disease.

Rough classification systems for tumor response have been used for decades because precise techniques were not yet widely available. However, more recent morphological and functional imaging techniques may allow for more reliable reporting on changes during or after treatment. Therefore, individual figures can be used in reporting response assessment, and categories can be made based on optimal cutoff values.

Because new treatment paradigms and new imaging modalities and techniques require continued reevaluation of response assessment tools, the RECIST working group recently proposed organ-specific modifications; however, these are not yet defined for head and neck cancer.

Although the WHO and the RECIST criteria have historically focused on a reliable assessment of any response after induction chemotherapy, new quantitative functional imaging techniques will determine a cutoff value for optimal prediction of response after subsequent chemoradiation. These cutoff values will be dependent on alternative treatment options, available treatment modifications, and the opinions of patients and their clinicians.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112bvBZZ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Can history and physical examination be used to identify a painful facet joint, or to select people for prognostic blocks?

Cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most commonly implicated in neck pain, while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration. Injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain (see below for whiplash).

Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥ 4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least 6 weeks in the absence of focal neurological findings. The targeted facet joints are usually decided based on patient report and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy. In postsurgical patients, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty.

Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain, such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis. In a study by Cohen et al. that evaluated historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes, pain radiating to the occiput and a history of…

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^115oyJxc]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The physical examination of the neck is crucial for diagnosing atlanto-occipital (AO) and atlantoaxial (AA) pain. The AA joint complex is responsible for 60% of cervical rotational movement. This pivot articulation occurs between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the transverse ligament of the atlas and the anterior arch. Common historical and physical examination findings of AA dysfunction include limited range of motion (ROM) during rotation as well as flexion and extension, depending on the extent of tectorial membrane impairment. In more advanced cases, examination signs can include severely restricted rotation and lateral flexion of the cervical spine to the affected side, crepitus, prominent tenderness at the occipito–cervical junction, craniocervical kyphosis, and torticollis. The presence of gait abnormalities, radicular symptoms, and audiovisual symptoms are unlikely to be related to isolated AO or AA dysfunction.

Although the AO and AA joints can be visualized on imaging, including plain radiographs, imaging cannot confirm the origin of pain. Normal imaging does not rule out arthropathy, and radiographic joint abnormalities are incapable of identifying a painful joint. For example, in a study involving 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 45.8% had radiographic evidence of AA involvement, but only 45.4% of those individuals had neck pain. Paradoxically, greater AA joint ventral subluxation was associated with less pain. Alternative imaging, including bone window CT views of the AA joint, MRI, or cervical myelography, may be needed to rule out concurrent alternative cervical spine pathology.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for salivary gland cancer, and specifically concerning history and physical examination, the AAO-HNSF 2017 guidelines recommend regarding patients with a neck mass as at increased risk for malignancy based on the presence of one or more of the following physical examination characteristics:

- **Fixation to adjacent tissues**: This indicates a potential concern for malignancy.

- **Firm consistency**: This is another indicator of a possible malignancy.

- **Size > 1.5 cm**: A larger size could suggest an increased risk.

- **Ulceration of overlying skin**: Ulceration can be a sign of malignancy.

### Practical challenges of mask-to-mask encounters with patients with head and neck cancers amid the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic [^116RT7dY]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Physical examination is a key diagnostic study in the management of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). We administer a questionnaire that screens for fever or new and worsening symptoms of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, or vomiting/diarrhea in anyone entering the facility. Patients with a positive screen may require formal testing for COVID-19, whereas those with a negative screen require further evaluation, including a physical examination conducted with physical distancing.

However, physical distancing is not possible when conducting a proper head and neck examination, and the transoral examination and in-office nasopharyngolaryngoscopy place the examiner and others in the room at substantial risk of exposure/infection. If a patient coughs or sneezes during the examination, COVID-19 can become aerosolized. Nasal decongestion and anesthetization before fiberoptic examination is also an aerosolization procedure. The American Academy of Otolaryngology has recommended that all upper airway procedures should be done with personal protective equipment (PPE), such as an N95 mask, gown, eye shield, and gloves.

We have avoided the use of fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy in most cases, except where it is essential for management, because it is an aerosol-generating procedure that requires the use of valuable fitted respirator masks and other PPE. Similarly, we have eliminated the use of manual examination of the oral cavity and tongue depressors in the vast majority of cases, as this does not comply with the mask-to-mask policy.

### The association between physical activity and neck and low back pain: a systematic review [^113ezDQk]. European spine journal (2011). Low credibility.

Assessment of physical activity

One study used an objective instrument, such as an accelerometer, and 11 studies employed self-reported questionnaires to assess physical activity level. The remaining study used both self-reported questionnaires and an accelerometer. Nine studies examined physical activity during leisure time, while three studies assessed physical activity during both work and leisure time. The remaining study did not clearly specify which setting was examined.

Assessment of neck and low back pain

Two studies examined neck pain only, and six studies investigated low back pain only. One study evaluated neck and upper back pain, while the remaining four studies measured both neck and low back pain. Eleven studies employed self-reported questionnaires to evaluate neck and/or low back pain, and the remaining two studies used interviews. The recall period for neck and/or low back pain varied greatly, ranging from one month to a lifetime.

Evidence of association between physical activity and neck pain

Of the seven high-quality studies, one investigated the association in the working population, while six examined it in school children.

In the working population, Van den Heuvel et al. conducted a cohort study and found no association between physical activity during leisure time and neck pain among working populations. However, the authors concluded that walking or cycling to…

### Neck pain: Clinical practice guidelines help ensure quality care [^1147fPdn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In 2008, physical therapists published the first clinical practice guidelines for neck pain. These guidelines have been updated and are now available in the July 2017 issue of JOSPT. To update these guidelines, physical therapists collaborated with the International Collaboration on Neck Pain to identify leading practices. The revised guidelines provide direction to clinicians for screening, evaluating, diagnosing, and making treatment-based classifications of neck pain. They also outline the best nonsurgical treatment options based on the published literature. Ultimately, the best care is a combination of leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. These guidelines help inform the first step in this process.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^111kmQiH]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Cooper et al. conducted a study in 194 patients with neck pain who received dual LA diagnostic medial branch blocks (MBB). They reported that the most common cervical facet joints associated with neck pain were C2–3 (36%), followed by C5–6 (35%), and C6–7 (17%). Joints at C1–2, C3–4, and C4–5 were each symptomatic in less than 5% of cases. Among patients with cervical facet joint pain, 52% had only one symptomatic joint. In the remainder, multiple symptomatic joints occurred in various combinations, including bilateral joints at the same segment (e.g. C2–3 or C5–6), adjacent joints on the same side (e.g. C5–6, C6–7), and non-adjacent joints on the same side (e.g. C2–3 and C5–6). When C3–4 and C4–5 facet joints were symptomatic, it was usually in combination with an adjacent joint.

- **Studies examining history and physical examination signs**: Physical examination of the neck was found to have high sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosing facetogenic pain. In a study, 77% of subjects were identified as having primarily facet joint pain. However, other studies have suggested that specific physical examination maneuvers can identify cervical facet joints as the primary cause of neck pain.

- **Figures and maps**: Posterior and lateral segmental maps show pain referral patterns from the cervical facet joints (C2–3, red; C3–4, black; C4–5, green; C5–6, purple; C6–7, yellow; C7–T1, blue). Striped areas represent overlapping cervical facet joint pain maps.

### Penetrating paediatric neck trauma [^116YQ6dk]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

As a result, a similar approach has been proposed in the paediatric population, with selective exploration based on clinical signs and radiological findings. This practice of selective management of penetrating neck injuries, based on physical examination and selective use of investigations, appeared safe with a low negative exploration rate and no missed injuries. Moreover, a high rate of negative neck explorations has been reported in the paediatric literature when management is based solely on penetration of the platysma or zone II involvement. In our case, although there were no hard signs of injury on clinical examination, the CT scan demonstrated penetration of the carotid artery by the pencil, mandating surgical exploration and repair of the vascular injury.

In conclusion, penetrating neck trauma in children is a rare yet serious presentation in paediatric emergency departments. Management includes selective neck exploration based on physical examination and the use of CTA in stable patients, similar to adult recommendations.

- **Learning points**:
	- Penetrating neck injuries in children are uncommon but may result in significant morbidity and mortality.
	- A penetrating object should never be removed at the scene and should only be removed under direct surgical visualization.
	- Emergent neck exploration is required for patients presenting with penetrating cervical trauma and hard signs of vascular injury or airway compromise.
	- In stable paediatric patients with no hard signs of injury or airway compromise, selective neck exploration should be considered.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^116Cq9Ae]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neck pain, particularly in relation to physical therapy for neck pain with mobility deficits, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend offering a multimodal approach for patients with chronic neck pain and mobility deficits.

- **Thoracic manipulation and cervical manipulation or mobilization**: These techniques are suggested as part of the intervention.

- **Mixed exercise for cervical/scapulothoracic regions**: This includes neuromuscular exercises such as coordination, proprioception, and postural training, as well as stretching, strengthening, endurance training, aerobic conditioning, and incorporating cognitive-affective elements.

- **Dry needling, laser, or intermittent mechanical/manual traction**: These methods may also be incorporated as part of the multimodal strategy.

### Diagnostic approach to penetrating neck trauma: What you need to know [^111jor4M]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of penetrating neck trauma has evolved considerably over the last several decades. The contemporary approach to these injuries is based primarily on clinical signs of injury and multidetector computed tomographic angiography. The neck is evaluated as a unit, rather than relying on the surface anatomy zones in which external injuries are seen to guide the workup of internal injuries. This "no-zone" approach safely spares many patients from negative explorations and unnecessary invasive tests. The purpose of this review is to describe an evidence-based approach to the diagnostic evaluation of penetrating neck trauma, including indications for adjunctive testing beyond physical examination and multidetector computed tomographic angiography.

### Airway physical examination tests for detection of difficult airway management in apparently normal adult patients [^115MtnDj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The unanticipated difficult airway is a potentially life-threatening event during anesthesia or acute conditions. An unsuccessfully managed upper airway is associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Several bedside screening tests are used in clinical practice to identify those at high risk of difficult airway; their accuracy and benefit, however, remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to characterize and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Mallampati classification and other commonly used airway examination tests for assessing the physical status of the airway in adult patients with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities. This analysis was performed individually for each of the four descriptors of the difficult airway: difficult face mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult tracheal intubation, and failed intubation.

- **Search methods**: We searched major electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL, as well as regional, subject-specific, and dissertation and theses databases from inception to December 16, 2016, without language restrictions. Additionally, the Science Citation Index was searched, and references of all relevant studies were checked. We hand-searched selected journals, conference proceedings, and relevant guidelines. This search was updated in March 2018, but the results have not yet been incorporated.

- **Selection criteria**: Full-text diagnostic test accuracy studies of any individual index test, or a combination of tests, against a reference standard were considered.

### Evaluation of neck masses in adults [^111uF4T5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Neck masses are often seen in clinical practice, and the family physician should be able to determine the etiology of a mass using organized, efficient diagnostic methods. The first goal is to determine if the mass is malignant or benign; malignancies are more common in adult smokers older than 40 years. Etiologies can be grouped according to whether the onset/duration is acute (e.g. infectious), subacute (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma), or chronic (e.g. thyroid), and further narrowed by patient demographics. If the history and physical examination do not find an obvious cause, imaging and surgical tools are helpful. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the initial diagnostic test of choice in adults. Computed tomography angiography is recommended over magnetic resonance angiography for the evaluation of pulsatile neck masses. If imaging rules out involvement of underlying vital structures, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be performed, providing diagnostic information via cytology, Gram stain, and bacterial and acid-fast bacilli cultures. The sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration biopsy in detecting a malignancy range from 77% to 97% and 93% to 100%, respectively.

### Interrater reliability of the history and physical examination in patients with mechanical neck pain [^115j43sc]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the interrater reliability of the history and physical examination in patients with mechanical neck pain.

- **Design**: Single-group repeated measures for interrater reliability.
- **Setting**: Outpatient physical therapy clinic.
- **Participants**: Twenty-two patients with mechanical neck pain underwent a standardized history and physical examination by a physical therapist.
- **Intervention**: Following a 5-minute break, a second therapist who was blind to the findings of the first examiner performed the second standardized history and physical examination.
- **Main outcome measures**: The Cohen kappa and weighted kappa were used to calculate the interrater reliability of ordinal level data from the history and physical examination. Intraclass correlation coefficients model 2,1 (ICC(2,1)) and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine the interrater reliability for continuous variables.

The results showed that the kappa coefficients ranged from -.06 to .90 for the variables obtained from the history. Reliability values for categorical data collected during the physical examination ranged from no to substantial agreement depending on the particular test and measure. ICC(2,1) for cervical range of motion (ROM) measurements ranged between .66 and .78.

In conclusion, this study reported the interrater reliability of the history and physical examination in a group of patients with a primary report of neck pain. The reliability variables varied considerably for manual assessment techniques and were significantly higher for the examination of muscle length and cervical ROM.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^114rw8ch]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: Can history and physical examination be used to identify painful AO or AA joints or to select people for prognostic blocks?

AO and AA joint disease may be a source of both neck pain and headache. Accurate diagnosis and management of neck and head pain can be challenging. Pain may be referred from other cervical sources, including cervical intervertebral discs, cervical facet joints, ligaments, fascia, and muscles. Detailed history and physical examination can be valuable to help distinguish the etiology of the pain and to target diagnostic and therapeutic injection targets.

### Clinical practice implications of the Bone and Joint Decade 2000–2010 Task Force on neck pain and its associated disorders: From concepts and findings to recommendations [^114ogT9S]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

The study design utilized was the best evidence synthesis. The objective of the research was to provide evidence-based guidance to primary care clinicians on the optimal assessment and treatment of patients with neck pain.

There is a critical need to translate the results of clinical and epidemiologic studies into meaningful and practical information for clinicians. To address this need, methods involved best evidence syntheses of published studies on the risk, prognosis, assessment, and management of people with neck pain and its associated disorders. This included additional research projects and focused literature reviews reported in this supplement. The 12-member multidisciplinary Scientific Secretariat of the Neck Pain Task Force followed a four-step approach to develop practical guidance for clinicians.

The results indicated that the Neck Pain Task Force recommends triaging people seeking care for neck pain into four groups:

- **Grade I neck pain**: No signs of major pathology and no or little interference with daily activities.
- **Grade II neck pain**: No signs of major pathology, but interference with daily activities.
- **Grade III neck pain**: Neurologic signs of nerve compression.
- **Grade IV neck pain**: Signs of major pathology.

In the emergency room after blunt trauma to the neck, triage should be based on the NEXUS criteria or the Canadian C-spine rule. Individuals with a high risk of fracture should be further investigated with plain radiographs and/or CT-scans. In ambulatory primary care, triage should be based on history and physical examination alone, which includes screening for red flags and neurologic examination for signs of radiculopathy.

### ESR essentials: pseudolesions in head and neck-practice recommendations by the European Society of Head and Neck Radiology [^113z2LNC]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The differentiation between pathological and physiological entities constitutes a fundamental aspect of daily radiological practice. Pseudolesions manifest as a transient phenomenon within this spectrum, displaying features of pathology within the context of normal or variant anatomy. A variety of structures, including vascular components, ectopic formations, or deviations from typical developmental patterns, can mimic pathological entities. It is crucial to discern between the two: lesions warranting treatment or ongoing radiological monitoring and pseudolesions where further analysis or treatment is unnecessary. Radiology plays a key role in classifying these entities. Comprehensive knowledge and accurate assessment of head and neck pseudolesions are necessary for radiologists to avoid unnecessary further diagnostic tests, treatments, and distress for the patient.

- **Key points**: Pseudolesions are an aspect of typical anatomy. Ectopic structures will have the same intensity/density no matter the location. Pursuit of a vascular origin can be a problem solver. Incorporate pseudolesions in the report.

### Head and neck cancer surveillance: The value of computed tomography and clinical exam [^113Ec227]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). High credibility.

The recurrence of head and neck cancer (HNC) is most prevalent during the initial two years following curative treatment, underscoring the criticality of regular surveillance for HNC survivors. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) imaging and clinical physical examination (CE) in HNC surveillance, assessing whether these imaging protocols meet the treatment limitations confronting HNC specialists.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of a 9-year experience with head and neck cancer patients at a single academic tertiary care center. Demographic data were collected along with data regarding whether the recurrences were detected primarily through CE, flexible endoscopic exam (scope exam), or CT or CT/PET scan. Subsets of the data were analyzed and compared by sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values.

- **Results**: 264 HNC patients were identified. 72 total recurrences (27%) were noted. The method of initial detection spurring further investigation was imaging in 42 (58.3%) patients, CE in 24 (33.3%) patients, and scope exam in 6 (8.4%) patients. Overall, 65 (90.3%) patients had imaging that showed recurrence regardless of the method of initial detection. Sensitivity (87.1% vs. 70.5%) and specificity (93.95% vs. 96.9%) were noted for CT and CE, respectively. Combined sensitivity and specificity for CT and CE were 96.2% and 91.05%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The data suggest that imaging could provide sufficient methods of HNC surveillance despite limitations the COVID-19 pandemic presents.

### Pathologic c-spine fracture with low risk mechanism and normal physical exam [^116kNQ4r]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cervical spinal fracture is a rare but potentially disabling complication of trauma to the neck. Clinicians often rely on clinical decision rules and guidelines to decide whether imaging is necessary when a patient presents with neck pain. Validated clinical guidelines include the Canadian C-Spine Rule and the NEXUS criteria. Studies suggest that the risks of a pathologic fracture from a simple rear-end collision are negligible.

We present a case of an individual who presented to an emergency department (ED) following a low-speed motor vehicle collision, complaining of lateral neck pain, and had multiple subsequent visits for the same complaint with negative exam findings. Ultimately, he was found to have a severely pathologic cervical spine fracture with notable cord compression. Our objective is to discuss the necessity to incorporate clinical decision rules with physician gestalt and consider co-morbidities of a patient presenting following a minor motor vehicle collision.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^113HVdi8]. Pain Medicine (2021).

Use of conservative treatments, which are often advocated for non-specific symptoms, prior to prognostic blocks may be related to the absence of pathognomonic physical examination or radiological findings for facet joint pain. In the absence of any reliable means of clinically diagnosing facet joint pain, the treatment of mechanical or neuropathic neck pain often starts with less invasive treatments. The response to conservative treatments may prevent the need for further work-up and interventions. Notably, there is no evidence that conservative treatment guarantees functional improvement or pain reduction, nor does the lack of response to conservative measures predict the success or failure of procedural interventions. Confoundingly, responders and non-responders to prognostic facet blocks were found in one study to demonstrate similar presentations of sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, and psychological distress.

A Cochrane Database systematic review of physical therapy for the treatment of non-specific chronic neck pain found moderate evidence supporting cervico-scapulothoracic and upper extremity strength training, endurance training, strengthening and stretching exercises, mindfulness exercise, and stabilization exercises to improve pain and function. A meta-analysis evaluating physical therapy techniques found that therapeutic exercise had significant short-term and intermediate-term effects, but no long-term benefit on pain.

### Neck pain: Initial evaluation and management [^113WW878]. American Family Physician (2020).

Neck pain is a common presenting symptom in the primary care setting and causes significant disability. The broad differential diagnosis requires an efficient but global assessment; therefore, emphasis is typically placed on red flags that can assist in the early recognition and treatment of more concerning diagnoses, such as traumatic injuries, infection, malignancy, vascular emergencies, and other inflammatory conditions. The critical element in the appropriate diagnosis and management of these conditions is an accurate patient history.

Physical examination findings complement and refine diagnostic cues from the history but often lack the specificity to be of value independently. Diagnostic tools such as imaging and electrodiagnostic tests have variable utility, especially in chronic or degenerative conditions. Treatment of mechanical or non-neuropathic neck pain includes short-term use of medications and possibly injections; however, long-term data for these interventions are limited. Acupuncture and other complementary and alternative therapies may be helpful in some cases. Advanced imaging and surgical evaluation may be warranted for patients with worsening neurologic function or persistent pain.

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Cervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^112eoXGp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend considering cervical spine X-ray or CT, or performing a facet injection/medial branch block of the cervical spine. This should be the initial evaluation in patients with cervicogenic headache and new or increasing nontraumatic cervical or neck pain with no neurologic deficit.

### The adult neck mass [^1141gndx]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter neck masses in adult patients. A careful medical history should be obtained, and a thorough physical examination should be performed. The patient's age and the location, size, and duration of the mass are important pieces of information. Inflammatory and infectious causes of neck masses, such as cervical adenitis and cat-scratch disease, are common in young adults. Congenital masses, such as branchial anomalies and thyroglossal duct cysts, must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Neoplasms (benign and malignant) are more likely to be present in older adults. Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy, along with contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning, are the best techniques for evaluating these masses. An otolaryngology consultation for endoscopy and possible excisional biopsy should be obtained when a neck mass persists beyond four to six weeks following a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

### Exercise interventions for treating work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults [^112Z2JA6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

- **Search methods for identification of studies**: Electronic searches are crucial for identifying studies related to exercise interventions for work-related complaints of the arm, neck, or shoulder in adults. The last comprehensive Cochrane review on this topic by Verhagen in 2013 included searches up to May 31, 2013. Given modifications to our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we will utilize previously identified studies and screen new sources from inception using the updated criteria.

We will search the following databases from their inception to the date of our search:

1. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
2. MEDLINE (via Ovid, 1946 to present)
3. Embase (via Ovid, 1974 to present)
4. CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; via EBSCOhost, 1981 to present)
5. AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine; Ovid, 1985 to present)
6. PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1806 to present)

Additionally, we will separately search the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for any unpublished and ongoing studies, with no language restrictions applied.

We will employ a subject-specific search strategy, considering title, abstract, keywords, and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms where relevant. This will be combined with the sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version of the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE, adapted for use in other databases. Detailed search strategies for all databases are available in Appendix 1.

- **Searching other resources**: We will also examine the reference lists of included articles and contact experts in the field to identify additional resources.

### The classification of outcome following whiplash injury — a comparison of methods [^1119PBko]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

There are many definitions and classifications of chronic neck pain and neck pain following whiplash injury, many developed for a single study. This study compares three different outcome measures: neck disability index, Gargan and Bannister grade, and the general health questionnaire. The study involved 277 patients examined for medicolegal reporting following isolated whiplash injury.

Significant correlation exists between the physical outcome scales and also between the physical and psychological outcome scales examined (both p < 0.01). Definitions of chronic neck pain (with or without whiplash injury) and measures to assess and classify patients with chronic symptoms are reviewed. We recommend the use of a simple self-administered questionnaire that does not require physical measurement as the most useful tool in the evaluation of these patients and the most accurate method of classifying outcome.

### Physical examination of the shoulder [^116Yx81X]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the overall assessment of the shoulder joint and seeks to direct clinicians in diagnosing shoulder pathology through both standard and specific physical examinations. The history and standard examination can prompt the examiner to focus on specific tests, further evaluate the shoulder, and limit the differential diagnoses. An appropriate and directed shoulder physical examination allows the clinician to concentrate on further diagnostic strategies and treatment options for the patient.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^1174nqvw]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In summary, there are no single pathognomonic historical symptoms or physical examination signs that can reliably predict the response to facet joint blocks in individuals with chronic neck pain. However, a history of whiplash and the presence of paraspinal tenderness in the muscles overlying the facet joints appear to be associated with a positive response to facet joint interventions.

Maneuvers associated with radicular signs may be predictive of negative diagnostic cervical medial branch blocks (MBB). There does not appear to be a difference between the psychological profiles of patients who respond and those who do not respond to interventions targeting the innervation to the cervical facet joints.

When selecting targets for blocks, levels should be determined based on clinical presentation, including tenderness on palpation (preferably performed under fluoroscopy) and pain referral patterns. This is given a grade C recommendation, indicating a low level of certainty.

### Pain drawing in the assessment of neurogenic pain and dysfunction in the neck/shoulder region: Inter-examiner reliability and concordance with clinical examination [^111jKT1t]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The pain drawing (PD) has demonstrated good inter-examiner reliability and high sensitivity in assessing neurogenic pain and dysfunction (NP) originating from the lower back. However, studies on its use in the neck/shoulder region have not been found.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the inter-examiner reliability of a first impression assessment of NP in the neck/shoulder region using a simplified PD made by the patient, and to examine the concordance between the first impression assessment and a final assessment based on a complete clinical examination.

- **Design**: A clinical trial was conducted on 50 primary care patients with discomfort in the neck/shoulder region, assessed by two independent examiners. One examiner had experience in assessing the PD, while the other did not. The first impression assessment was based solely on the PD, while the final assessment included clinical examinations, history interviews, physical examinations, and possible radiological reports. NP was considered if at least two physical examination findings indicated a neurological deficit in the area of discomfort. Concordance between the first impression assessment and the final assessment was calculated as sensitivity, with the final assessment as the key.

- **Results**: The inter-examiner reliability based solely on the first impression assessment of the pain drawing reached 88% overall agreement and a sensitivity of 90%. Signs of NP were found in 92% of the patients according to the final assessment. Two-thirds of the patients added to their pain drawing during the history interview.

### There is no routine head and neck exam during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1157mQSX]. Head & Neck (2020). Low credibility.

Head and neck examinations are commonly performed by all physicians. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has a high viral load in the upper airways, these examinations and procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract must be approached with caution. Based on experience and evidence from SARS-CoV-1 and early experience with SARS-CoV-2, we provide our perspective and guidance on mitigating transmission risk during head and neck examination, upper airway endoscopy, and head and neck mucosal surgery, including tracheostomy.

### Sensorimotor function and dizziness in neck pain: Implications for assessment and management [^115xPd9v]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

The term sensorimotor describes all the afferent, efferent, and central integration and processing components involved in maintaining stability in the postural control system through intrinsic motor-control properties. The scope of this paper is to highlight the sensorimotor deficits that can arise from altered cervical afferent input. From a clinical orthopaedic perspective, the peripheral mechanoreceptors are the most important in functional joint stability; but in the cervical region, they are also important for postural stability, as well as head and eye movement control.

Consequently, conventional musculoskeletal intervention approaches may be sufficient only for patients with neck pain and minimal sensorimotor proprioceptive disturbances. Clinical experience and research indicate that significant sensorimotor cervical proprioceptive disturbances might be an important factor in the maintenance, recurrence, or progression of various symptoms in some patients with neck pain. In these cases, more specific and novel treatment methods are needed which progressively address neck position and movement sense, as well as cervicogenic oculomotor disturbances, postural stability, and cervicogenic dizziness. In this commentary, we review the most relevant theoretical and practical knowledge on this matter and implications for clinical assessment and management, and we propose future directions for research.

### Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary: A diagnostic work-up [^112qUqNF]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

The identification of the primary tumor site is a critical step in the diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with a cervical lymph node mass. This process is guided by two main objectives: determining the histology of the nodal mass and identifying the primary tumor site. Screening initiates with a comprehensive history to identify symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, otalgia, nasal obstruction, and epistaxis. It also involves documenting the history of tobacco and alcohol use, sexual history, particularly concerning multiple sexual partners and the practice of oral sex, and any previous malignancies.

For instance, a young man presenting with high-risk HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in an anterior level II/III cervical lymph node, with no history of tobacco or heavy alcohol use, is likely to have the primary squamous cell carcinoma located in the oropharynx, specifically in the palatine or lingual tonsils.

Following the history, a complete physical examination of the head and neck is conducted to identify mucosal abnormalities and skin lesions. This is complemented by a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract, known as nasopharyngolaryngoscopy.

- **Flexible endoscopy with narrow band imaging**: This procedure can enhance the in-office fiberoptic exam, as it distinguishes malignant lesions from normal mucosa by selecting wavelengths of light that improve visualization of the microvasculature. Davaris et al. demonstrated that narrow band imaging offers better sensitivity (93.3% vs. 77.0%, P < 0.05) and accuracy (96.3% vs. 92%, P = .001) in identifying laryngeal lesions.

### The role of clinical examination in excluding vascular injury in haemodynamically stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. A prospective study of 59 patients [^113qsL7w]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

To prospectively evaluate the safety and accuracy of physical examination in determining the management of stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck, a prospective study was conducted involving 59 patients with gunshot wounds to the neck.

Fifty-nine stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck were managed between December 2001 and August 2003. All patients underwent a physical examination and routine angiography according to a written protocol approved by the research ethics committee. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of physical examination were assessed and compared with angiographic findings.

- **Results**: Thirteen patients with positive findings on physical examination (history of bleeding, haematoma, minimal bleeding, thrill, bruit, and pulse deficit) and 10 patients without clinical signs of vascular injury had vascular injury. A sensitivity of 57%, specificity of 53%, positive predictive value of 43%, and negative predictive value of 67% were calculated for physical examination alone in detecting vascular injury.

- **Conclusion**: Findings on physical examination are not good predictors of vascular injury in stable patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. Our findings question the validity of physical examination alone as a safe and accurate assessment of patients with gunshot wounds to the neck. Arteriography or ultrasonography is needed to identify vascular injuries.

### International framework for examination of the cervical region for potential of vascular pathologies of the neck prior to musculoskeletal intervention: International IFOMPT cervical framework [^111gswcG]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

This position statement, stemming from the International IFOMPT (International Federation of Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapists) Cervical Framework, was developed based on the best contemporary evidence and expert opinion. It aims to assist clinicians during their clinical reasoning process when considering presentations involving the head and neck. Developed through rigorous consensus methods, the International IFOMPT Cervical Framework guides the assessment of the cervical spine region for potential vascular pathologies of the neck in advance of planned interventions.

Within the cervical spine, events and presentations of vascular pathologies of the neck are rare but are an important consideration as part of the patient examination. Vascular pathologies may be recognizable if the appropriate questions are asked during the patient history-taking process, if interpretation of elicited data enables recognition of this potential, and if the physical examination can be adapted to explore any potential vasculogenic hypothesis.

### Isolated cervical dystonia: Diagnosis and classification [^117PUwDy]. Movement Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of isolated cervical dystonia (iCD) has evolved since its original descriptions, focusing on a defined motor syndrome. The centrality of the motor syndrome remains the core feature by which cervical dystonia is clinically defined. The panel agreed on the following general definition of cervical dystonia: It is characterized by sustained or intermittent neck movements caused by involuntary muscle contractions, resulting in abnormal movements and postures of the head, neck, and/or shoulders. Movements are often patterned, and tremor may be present.

This definition recognizes that the observation of dystonic postural abnormalities, in combination with faster mobile components, is instrumental for the recognition of dystonia. A table lists a few cervical dystonia mimics considered outside this diagnostic spectrum.

iCD is a specific presentation of cervical dystonia. The diagnosis of iCD requires fulfilling phenomenological criteria based on the general definition, supported by the presence of alleviating maneuvers as well as pain. Sensitivity and specificity of these criteria have not been assessed yet. Until definitive validated diagnostic markers are available, clinical expert opinion remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of iCD.

Diagnosis of iCD further requires that dystonia is not accompanied by other movement disorders (except for tremor) or additional neurological or medical features. The diagnostic workup assesses whether there are other non-dystonic movement disorders affecting the cervical region, such as chorea or tics.

### Management of cervical stab wounds in low volume trauma centres: Systematic physical examination and low threshold for adjunctive studies, or surgical exploration [^115nzp2e]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

In Nordic countries, penetrating neck injuries (PNIs) are infrequent and management has traditionally been guided by surgeons' preferences. A selective non-operative approach is currently practiced in most urban trauma centers.

- **Objective**: To examine demographic features and treatment outcomes of non-ballistic penetrating neck injuries in southern Finland and provide management guidelines for centers with a low volume of penetrating neck trauma.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective analysis of 85 platysma penetrating neck injuries in two southern Finland hospitals (Helsinki University Central Hospital and Tampere University Hospital) was carried out using the ICD-10 based hospital databases to identify PNI patients.

- **Results**: The incidence of admitted patients with penetrating neck injuries was 1.3 per 100,000 per year. Fifty-two (61%) injuries were caused by random acts of violence, 28 (38%) were self-inflicted, and 5 (6%) were accidents. Of all 85 patients, 52 (61%) underwent operative exploration with a negative exploration rate of 65%. Hard signs for vascular or aerodigestive trauma were present in 23 (27%) patients, all of whom were operated on, with a negative exploration rate of 30%. Two patients had no hard signs on physical examination but were operatively explored, and significant injuries were found in both patients. The hospital mortality rate was 0%, and the overall complication rate for operated patients was 7.7%.

- **Conclusions**: Trauma centers managing PNIs infrequently should have an individually tailored management protocol for penetrating neck injuries.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^1134SRgp]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Physical examination of the neck is essential to diagnose atlanto-occipital (AO) and atlantoaxial (AA) pain. The AA joint complex accounts for 60% of cervical rotational movement. The pivot articulation occurs between the odontoid process of the axis and the ring formed by the transverse ligament of the atlas and the anterior arch. Common historical and physical examination findings of AA dysfunction include limited range of motion during rotation as well as flexion and extension, depending on the extent of tectorial membrane impairment. In more advanced cases, examination signs can include severely restricted rotation and lateral flexion of the cervical spine to the affected side, crepitus, prominent tenderness at the occipito–cervical junction, craniocervical kyphosis, and torticollis. The presence of gait abnormalities, radicular symptoms, and audiovisual symptoms are unlikely to be related to isolated AO or AA dysfunction.

Although the AO and AA joints can be visualized on imaging, including plain radiographs, imaging cannot confirm the origin of pain. Normal imaging does not rule out arthropathy, and radiographic joint abnormalities are incapable of identifying a painful joint. For example, in a study involving 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 45.8% had radiographic evidence of AA involvement, but only 45.4% of those individuals had neck pain. Paradoxically, greater AA joint ventral subluxation was associated with less pain. Alternative imaging, including bone window CT views of the AA joint, MRI, or cervical myelography, may be needed to rule out concomitant alternative cervical spine pathology.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112DBwri]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Use of conservative treatments, often advocated for non-specific symptoms prior to prognostic blocks, may be related to the absence of pathognomonic physical examination or radiological findings for facet joint pain. Without reliable means of clinically diagnosing facet joint pain, the treatment of mechanical or neuropathic neck pain typically begins with less invasive treatments. The response to these conservative treatments may prevent the need for further work-up and interventions. Notably, there is no evidence that such treatments guarantee functional improvement or pain reduction, nor does the lack of response predict the success or failure of procedural interventions. Further complicating matters, both responders and non-responders to prognostic facet blocks in one study demonstrated similar presentations of sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, and psychological distress.

A Cochrane Database systematic review of physical therapy for non-specific chronic neck pain found moderate evidence supporting cervico-scapulothoracic and upper extremity strength training, endurance training, strengthening and stretching exercises, mindfulness exercise, and stabilization exercises, all of which improved pain and function based on moderate-quality evidence. A meta-analysis evaluating physical therapy techniques found that therapeutic exercise had significant short-term and intermediate-term effects, but no long-term benefit on pain.

### Clinical decision making associated with an undetected odontoid fracture in an older individual referred to physical therapy for the treatment of neck pain [^112CYJ7F]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

This study involves a resident's case problem focusing on clinical decision-making. The paper examines the decision-making process for a patient referred to physical therapy for neck pain after trauma. The patient was ultimately found to have an underlying odontoid fracture, which precluded physical therapy intervention.

A 73-year-old woman experienced a sudden onset of neck and left upper extremity pain following a fall, 15 days before her initial physical therapy visit. Conventional cervical spine radiographs taken one day before her visit were negative for a fracture. However, components of the patient's history and physical examination suggested a condition unsuitable for physical therapy until more definitive cervical spine diagnostic imaging was performed. The physical therapist was particularly concerned about a potential undetected fracture. Consequently, the referring physician was contacted and an immediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested, revealing a type II odontoid fracture. Thirty-four days after the fall, the patient underwent a C1-C2 fusion.

When evaluating patients with neck pain who have a history of cervical spine trauma, it is crucial for physical therapists to recognize clinical findings associated with cervical spine fractures. These findings guide the necessity for cervical spine diagnostic imaging and medical referral before implementing physical therapy interventions.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy for patients with neck pain: an individualized approach using a clinical decision-making algorithm [^1137YKhP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an individualized physical therapy intervention in treating neck pain based on a clinical reasoning algorithm. Treatment effectiveness was examined by assessing changes in impairment, physical performance, and disability in response to intervention.

- **Design**: One treatment group of 30 patients with neck pain completed physical therapy treatment. The control group of convenience consisted of a cohort of 27 subjects who also had neck pain but did not receive treatment for various reasons. There were no significant differences between groups in demographic data and the initial test scores of the outcome measures. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent, pretest-posttest control group design was used. A physical therapist rendered an eclectic intervention to the treatment group based on a clinical decision-making algorithm. Treatment outcome measures included the following five dependent variables: cervical range of motion, numeric pain rating, timed weighted overhead endurance, the supine capital flexion endurance test, and the Patient-Specific Functional Scale. Both the treatment and control groups completed the initial and follow-up examinations, with an average duration of 4 weeks between tests.

- **Results**: Five mixed analyses of variance with follow-up tests showed a significant difference for all outcome measures in the treatment group compared with the control group. After an average of 4 weeks of physical therapy intervention, patients in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant increase.

### CT-based diagnosis in patients presenting with throat pain: A single institutional review [^117C13Nu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

To determine if patient demographic data, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests will help predict the likelihood of imaging-based diagnosis using CT of the neck performed in the ED for a chief complaint of throat pain.

- **Material and methods**: A single institutional, retrospective review of 367 CT scans of the neck was performed for the evaluation of throat pain in the ED from August 2013 to September 2019. Patients' clinical history, physical exams, lab findings, and imaging results were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 367 CT scans of the neck performed for the evaluation of throat pain included a recorded exam and clinical history. Of these cases, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy (OR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.37–5.49), tonsillar findings (OR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.4–6.57), increased white blood cell count (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.15), and temperature (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6) were associated with an increased likelihood of obtaining a diagnostic CT scan.

- **Conclusion**: Consideration of tonsillar abnormalities, lymphadenopathy, body temperature, and measured leukocyte count prior to ordering CT scans of the neck for throat pain may increase the diagnostic yield of such exams and decrease CT utilization in the ED.

### The diagnostic yield of head and neck imaging in symptomatic patients with a normal clinical examination [^112qAqiy]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

Nationally, concern has been raised about the overuse of diagnostic testing. In patients with unilateral otalgia and no history of head and neck cancer (HNC), 1% had a malignancy detected on imaging that was not detected on clinical examination.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of "MRI soft tissue neck" scans performed at our hospital from May 2020 to May 2021. Patients were excluded if their scan was not ordered for HNC symptoms. Previous HNC patients undergoing follow-up imaging were also included.

- **Results**: In total, 326 scan requests were analyzed. Of the 132 patients without clinical features of overt disease, only one received a new diagnosis of HNC. This patient had previously had an HNC and was undergoing routine follow-up imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Our data demonstrate that performing MRI scans in symptomatic patients with a normal examination, FNE, and no history of HNC does not benefit the diagnosis or management of these patients.

**Question 1: Can history and physical examination be used to identify painful AO or AA joints or to select people for prognostic blocks**: AO and AA joint disease may be a source of both neck pain and headache. Accurate diagnosis and management of neck and head pain can be challenging. Pain may be referred from other cervical sources, including cervical intervertebral discs, cervical facet joints, ligaments, fascia, and muscles. A detailed history and physical examination can be valuable to help distinguish the etiology of the pain and to target diagnostic and therapeutic injection targets.
