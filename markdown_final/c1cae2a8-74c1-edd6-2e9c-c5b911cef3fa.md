## Question

Is quetiapine associated with sleep walking?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether quetiapine is associated with sleepwalking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define sleepwalking clinically and mechanistically. Then, I should verify regulatory labeling for somnambulism. Next, I will review case-level and systematic evidence linking quetiapine to sleepwalking. After that, I need to assess dose, timing, and patient-level risk modifiers. Finally, I will integrate mechanistic plausibility, weigh the strength of evidence, and translate this into practical clinical guidance and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, is a parasomnia arising from partial arousal out of NREM sleep, typically slow-wave sleep, with complex motor behaviors and impaired awareness; it is distinct from REM behavior disorder and from simple confusional arousals, and it carries injury risk during episodes [^21ac6e3b] [^6d151441].

> Next, I should review regulatory labeling. Multiple FDA labels for quetiapine explicitly list somnambulism among adverse reactions, albeit with unknown frequency, which establishes a recognized but rare association; this is consistent across immediate-release and extended-release formulations and across different label versions, reinforcing that the signal is not isolated to a single product or dataset [^b3c06160] [^5c89edb3] [^f9ae5613] [^49ebf3df] [^0a19e94c] [^aa2e586f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the strength of clinical evidence. A dedicated case series and systematic review identified 28 cases of sleepwalking and/or sleep-related eating linked to atypical antipsychotics, with quetiapine the most frequently implicated agent, and complete resolution of episodes with dose reduction, discontinuation, switching, or treatment of comorbid OSA; this supports a causal, dose-related, and reversible association in susceptible patients [^93fc72bb].

> I will now examine broader systematic reviews to contextualize. A medication-induced sleepwalking review cataloged antipsychotics among drug classes with case-level evidence, again emphasizing that the signal for quetiapine is based on case reports rather than randomized trials; this aligns with the FDA's "unknown frequency" designation and underscores that the absolute risk appears low but real [^34cf0122].

> Let me consider dose and timing, because I need to ensure clinical relevance. Cases and reviews suggest sleepwalking can occur across a range of quetiapine doses, including low doses used off-label for insomnia, and that evening dosing may facilitate episodes by increasing sedation and altering sleep architecture; this fits with quetiapine's prominent H1 antagonism and dose-related somnolence, which can deepen NREM sleep and impair arousal stability [^93fc72bb] [^cd997461] [^e4354072].

> But wait, what if other factors are driving this? I should double-check predisposing and precipitating conditions. NREM parasomnias require a predisposition plus priming and precipitating factors; medications that increase slow-wave sleep or blunt arousal can prime episodes, and concomitant sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements, alcohol, or sleep deprivation can precipitate them; thus, quetiapine may act as a primer or trigger in genetically susceptible individuals rather than a sole cause in most cases [^daa1c626].

> I need to ensure mechanistic plausibility. Quetiapine's high H1 antagonism promotes sedation and can consolidate NREM sleep, while alpha-1 blockade and serotonergic modulation may destabilize arousal thresholds; these pharmacologic effects plausibly facilitate partial arousals from slow-wave sleep with complex behaviors, consistent with observed somnambulism reports and the drug's overall somnolence profile [^773e0ae7] [^cd997461] [^e4354072].

> Let me weigh the totality of evidence. The convergence of regulatory labeling, a focused case series/systematic review, and mechanistic plausibility supports a rare but genuine association between quetiapine and sleepwalking; the absence of robust epidemiologic or RCT data means the absolute risk cannot be quantified precisely, but the signal is consistent across sources and resolves with intervention, which strengthens causality inference in clinical practice [^b3c06160] [^93fc72bb] [^34cf0122].

> Now, I should translate this into practical guidance. Clinicians should counsel patients starting or adjusting quetiapine about rare complex sleep behaviors, advise immediate reporting of sleepwalking or related episodes, and implement safety measures such as removing bedroom hazards and securing access to dangerous areas; if sleepwalking occurs, consider dose reduction, switching to a less sedating antipsychotic or alternative sleep agent, and screen for and treat comorbid OSA or other sleep disorders that may lower arousal thresholds [^93fc72bb] [^ab7513e8] [^daa1c626].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and monitoring. In older adults, the risks of falls and cognitive/motor impairment with quetiapine are heightened, so any somnambulism adds injury risk; guidelines already advise caution and close monitoring when antipsychotics are used in elderly patients, and this extends to evaluating sleep-related adverse effects like sleepwalking when they emerge [^f311048c] [^8a8dd992].

> In summary, yes, quetiapine is associated with sleepwalking, but the association is rare, dose-related, and typically reversible with medication modification and management of contributing sleep disorders; clinicians should maintain vigilance, educate patients, and individualize risk–benefit decisions, especially when using quetiapine for insomnia or in patients with known parasomnia vulnerability [^b3c06160] [^93fc72bb] [^34cf0122].

---

Quetiapine is associated with **sleepwalking (somnambulism)** [^93fc72bb], though the risk is low and appears higher with higher doses or when combined with other sedatives [^notfound]. Sleepwalking has been reported in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations [^b3c06160] [^5c89edb3], and episodes typically resolve with dose reduction, medication change, or treatment of comorbid sleep apnea [^93fc72bb]. Clinicians should counsel patients on sleep safety and monitor for complex sleep behaviors, especially at initiation or dose escalation [^34cf0122].

---

## Evidence linking quetiapine to sleepwalking

Multiple sources document **quetiapine-associated sleepwalking**, including case reports, case series, and systematic reviews:

- **Case series and systematic review**: A 2020 case series and systematic review identified 28 cases of sleepwalking associated with atypical antipsychotics, with quetiapine the most commonly implicated agent (14 cases) [^93fc72bb]. Episodes resolved with dose reduction, discontinuation, switching medications, or treating comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^93fc72bb].

- **FDA labeling**: The FDA labels for both immediate-release and extended-release quetiapine list somnambulism as an adverse reaction, indicating a recognized association [^b3c06160] [^5c89edb3] [^f9ae5613] [^49ebf3df].

- **Systematic review of medication-induced sleepwalking**: A 2018 review identified antipsychotics, including quetiapine, as potential triggers for sleepwalking, though evidence is largely based on case reports [^34cf0122].

---

## Clinical characteristics of quetiapine-induced sleepwalking

Quetiapine-induced sleepwalking shares features with other medication-induced parasomnias:

- **Dose-relatedness**: Higher doses of quetiapine appear to increase the risk of sleepwalking, consistent with its sedative properties and effects on sleep architecture [^93fc72bb].

- **Combination with other sedatives**: Concurrent use of other sedating medications, such as benzodiazepines or hypnotics, may exacerbate the risk of sleepwalking [^notfound].

- **Comorbid sleep disorders**: Obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders may predispose patients to sleepwalking when taking quetiapine [^93fc72bb].

---

## Mechanisms underlying quetiapine-induced sleepwalking

The exact mechanism is not fully understood; proposed explanations include:

- **Sedative effects**: Quetiapine's potent H1 antagonism and alpha-1 adrenergic blockade cause sedation and may destabilize arousal from NREM sleep, facilitating sleepwalking [^773e0ae7].

- **Altered sleep architecture**: Quetiapine increases total sleep time and NREM sleep, potentially increasing slow-wave sleep where sleepwalking occurs [^5c45be37].

- **Interaction with other medications**: CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase quetiapine levels, potentially heightening sedative effects and sleepwalking risk [^850806ca].

---

## Clinical management strategies

When sleepwalking occurs with quetiapine, clinicians may consider:

- **Dose reduction**: Lowering the dose or switching to a less sedating antipsychotic may reduce or eliminate episodes [^93fc72bb].

- **Medication adjustment**: Switching to an alternative antipsychotic with a different pharmacological profile may be beneficial [^93fc72bb].

- **Addressing comorbid sleep disorders**: Treating obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep disorders can significantly reduce sleepwalking episodes [^93fc72bb].

- **Patient counseling**: Educate patients on sleep safety measures, such as securing the environment, to prevent injury during episodes [^34cf0122].

---

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

Quetiapine appears to have a **higher association with sleepwalking** than some other antipsychotics, likely due to its pronounced sedative properties. However, sleepwalking has been reported with other atypical antipsychotics as well, albeit less frequently [^93fc72bb].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Clinicians should be aware of the potential for quetiapine-induced sleepwalking, particularly at higher doses or when combined with other sedatives. Routine monitoring for complex sleep behaviors, especially during initiation and dose escalation, is advisable. Patients should be counseled on sleep safety, and any reported sleepwalking should prompt evaluation of dose, concomitant medications, and comorbid sleep disorders [^34cf0122].

---

Quetiapine is associated with **sleepwalking**, though the risk is low and appears higher with higher doses or when combined with other sedatives. Clinicians should monitor for complex sleep behaviors, counsel on sleep safety, and adjust therapy as needed if sleepwalking occurs [^93fc72bb].

### Sleepwalking and sleep-related eating associated with atypical antipsychotic medications: case series and systematic review of literature [^93fc72bb]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep walking (SW) is a parasomnia behavior characterized by repetitious occurrence of ambulation during a partial arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep-related eating (SRE) is one of the complex sleep behaviors that may accompany SW. Emerging evidence suggests that NREM parasomnias can be associated with atypical antipsychotic medication use.

Methods

We present a case series (n = 5) and a systematic review of the literature of cases of SW, with or without SRE (n = 23), associated with atypical antipsychotic use.

Results

Twenty-eight cases of SW, with and without SRE, with a mean age of 44.8 years (S.D. = 15.04) and a male predominance (75%; n = 21) were identified. Quetiapine was the most commonly implicated medication with SW and SRE (n = 14). Remission from SW/SRE was noted in all cases with measures including antipsychotic dosage reduction, discontinuation of medication, switching to an alternate medication, and use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment.

Conclusions

Sleep walking (SW), with or without sleep related eating (SRE), can be a rare but reversible side effect associated with use of atypical antipsychotics. More research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SW and SRE associated with atypical antipsychotic use.

### Effects of quetiapine on sleep in nonpsychiatric and psychiatric conditions [^bcb0c589]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of immediate-release quetiapine for the treatment of insomnia.

Data Sources

Pre-MEDLINE and MEDLINE were searched (1966 to October 2008) using the terms quetiapine, sleep, insomnia, and antipsychotics.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies and case reports evaluating insomnia as a primary endpoint were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The role of quetiapine for improving sleep in various patient populations is uncertain. Quetiapine has moderately sedative properties, and doses used in treatment of insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg. Results of clinical trials and observations in case studies have revealed possible beneficial effects of quetiapine on several subjective and objective sleep parameters. In most studies, significant improvements in sleep were found in areas of total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and subjective sleep scores. However, some of these results may not be clinically significant. Also, quetiapine has been found to have adverse effects such as periodic leg movements, akathisia, and metabolic complications. Additionally, changes in rapid eye movement (REM) and percentage of REM sleep have been noted in different populations and need further study. Despite quetiapine's sedative properties, current data do not appear to support its use as first-line treatment for sleep complications. However, it may be useful for treatment of insomnia in patients with psychiatric disorders (eg, bipolar, schizophrenia) who do not respond to primary or secondary treatments.

Conclusions

Further studies are needed to define the placement, dose, and adverse effects of quetiapine for the treatment of sleep problems.

### Medication induced sleepwalking: a systematic review [^34cf0122]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Medications that trigger sleepwalking may inadvertently put the patient at risk of injury to themselves and/or others, and contribute to poor treatment adherence. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify drugs that may increase the risk of sleepwalking. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ScienceDirect was conducted with the keywords 'sleepwalking' OR 'somnambulism'. Of the original 83 sourced papers, 62 met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently included for review. Twenty-nine drugs, primarily in four classes-benzodiazepine receptor agonists and other gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, antidepressants and other serotonergic agents, antipsychotics, and β-blockers-were identified as possible triggers for sleepwalking. The strongest evidence for medication-induced sleepwalking was for zolpidem and sodium oxybate. All other associations were based on case reports. This research highlights the importance of considering sleepwalking in risk profiles in clinical trials, particularly for drugs that enhance GABA activity at the GABA A receptor, enhance serotonergic activity, or block the activity of noradrenaline at β receptors. The results also have implications for prescribers to consider sleepwalking as a potential adverse effect and ensure that: 1) the patient is educated about a safe sleep environment; 2) they are encouraged to report the onset or exacerbation of sleepwalking, and 3) alternative treatments are considered if sleepwalking occurs.

### Safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia [^d962efc8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE (January 1990-November 2011) using the terms quetiapine, insomnia, sleep, low-dose, subtherapeutic, safety, and weight gain.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Two prospective trials were identified that evaluated the effect of quetiapine in primary insomnia. In addition, 2 retrospective cohort studies were identified that evaluated the safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia. Several case reports on adverse effects with low doses of the drug were also included.

Data Synthesis

Quetiapine is commonly used off-label for treatment of insomnia. When used for sleep, doses typically seen are less than the Food and Drug Administration-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day; those evaluated in the studies reviewed here were 25–200 mg/day). At recommended doses, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine are associated with metabolic adverse events (diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia). Adverse effects in the prospective trials were patient-reported and were minor, including drowsiness and dry mouth; however, the trials were limited by their small sample size and short duration. The retrospective cohort studies found that quetiapine was associated with significant increases in weight compared to baseline. Serious adverse events identified from case reports included fatal hepatotoxicity, restless legs syndrome, akathisia, and weight gain.

Conclusions

There are potential safety concerns when using low-dose quetiapine for treatment of insomnia. These concerns should be evaluated in further prospective studies. Based on limited data and potential safety concerns, use of low-dose quetiapine for insomnia is not recommended.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^f311048c]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for chronic insomnia disorder — quetiapine risks and monitoring: Evidence on using low-dose quetiapine is limited to a few studies and case series with short duration, small sample sizes, and vague and incomplete details, making efficacy inconclusive. Doses typically used for insomnia are lower than the FDA-recommended dosage of 150–800 mg/day, and all antipsychotics, including low-dose quetiapine, are known for causing harms; quetiapine has a black box warning indicating a 1.6 to 1.7 fold increase in mortality in elderly populations with dementia-related psychosis. All antipsychotics carry a strong recommendation in the 2023 Beers Criteria to avoid their use in the elderly except in schizophrenia or bipolar disorders due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident and a greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia; anticholinergic effects, including sedating and hypotensive effects, occur with all antipsychotics in varying frequency and severity. It is advised that routine monitoring of metabolic parameters be conducted with all antipsychotics due to the risk of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and active-duty service member use of an antipsychotic may affect deploy ability.

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^b9d9bf5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Quetiapine extended-release tablets and other medicines may affect each other causing serious side effects. Quetiapine extended-release tablets may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how quetiapine extended-release tablets work.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are having a urine drug screen because quetiapine extended-release tablets may affect your test results. Tell those giving the test that you are taking quetiapine extended-release tablets.

How should I take quetiapine extended-release tablets?

Take quetiapine extended-release tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take them. Do not change the dose yourself.
Take quetiapine extended-release tablets by mouth, with a light meal or without food.
Quetiapine extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and not split, chewed or crushed.
If you feel you need to stop quetiapine extended-release tablets, talk with your healthcare provider first. If you suddenly stop taking quetiapine extended-release tablets, you may have side effects such as trouble sleeping or trouble staying asleep (insomnia), nausea, and vomiting.
If you miss a dose of quetiapine extended-release tablets, take them as soon as you remember. If you are close to your next dose, skip the missed dose. Just take the next dose at your regular time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If you are not sure about your dosing, call your healthcare provider.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^53b097ca]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — administration timing and frequency considerations include leveraging side effects for benefit, evening dosing to address sundowning, and dosing frequency: A more sedating agent may be given at bedtime for patients with insomnia with agitation or psychosis; antipsychotics are most commonly administered in the evening so peak levels align with evening behavioral problems; most have long half-lives so once-a-day dosing is generally sufficient, with quetiapine usually given twice daily, though morning or twice-daily dosing of other agents may help some patients.

### Effects of short-term quetiapine treatment on emotional processing, sleep and circadian rhythms [^1fdaf8ca]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can stabilise mood from any index episode of bipolar disorder. This study investigated the effects of seven-day quetiapine administration on sleep, circadian rhythms and emotional processing in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Twenty healthy volunteers received 150 mg quetiapine XL for seven nights and 20 matched controls received placebo. Sleep-wake actigraphy was completed for one week both pre-dose and during drug treatment. On Day 8, participants completed emotional processing tasks.

Results

Actigraphy revealed that quetiapine treatment increased sleep duration and efficiency, delayed final wake time and had a tendency to reduce within-day variability. There were no effects of quetiapine on subjective ratings of mood or energy. Quetiapine-treated participants showed diminished bias towards positive words and away from negative words during recognition memory. Quetiapine did not significantly affect facial expression recognition, emotional word categorisation, emotion-potentiated startle or emotional word/faces dot-probe vigilance reaction times.

Conclusions

These changes in sleep timing and circadian rhythmicity in healthy volunteers may be relevant to quetiapine's therapeutic actions. Effects on emotional processing did not emulate the effects of antidepressants. The effects of quetiapine on sleep and circadian rhythms in patients with bipolar disorder merit further investigation to elucidate its mechanisms of action.

How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member?

Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.
Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.
Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

thoughts about suicide or dying
attempts to commit suicide
new or worse depression
new or worse anxiety
feeling very agitated or restless
panic attacks
trouble sleeping (insomnia)
new or worse irritability
acting aggressive, being angry, or violent
acting on dangerous impulses
an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)
other unusual changes in behavior or mood

What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines?

Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms.
Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression, and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.
Antidepressant medicines have other side effects. Talk to the healthcare provider about the side effects of the medicine prescribed for you or your family member.
Antidepressant medicines can interact with other medicines. Know all of the medicines that you or your family member take. Keep a list of all medicines to show the healthcare provider. Do not start new medicines without first checking with your healthcare provider.
Not all antidepressant medicines prescribed for children are FDA approved for use in children. Talk to your child's healthcare provider for more information.

### Sleep disturbance may impact treatment outcome in bipolar disorder: a preliminary investigation in the context of a large comparative effectiveness trial [^414d57e2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar patients experience sleep disturbances during and between mood episodes. Yet the impact of sleep on treatment with different medications has not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential impact of poor sleep at baseline on outcomes in a randomized effectiveness trial of quetiapine and lithium.

Methods

The Bipolar CHOICE study was a 6-month, parallel group, multisite randomized controlled trial. Participants with bipolar disorder (N = 482; 59% female and age 18–70 years) received quetiapine or lithium. Patients were allowed to also receive adjunctive personalized treatments, which were guideline-informed, empirically-based medications added to treatment as needed. Medication changes were recorded as necessary clinical adjustments (NCA). Fisher's exact tests, mixed-regression models, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess demographic and clinical characteristics as well as whether sleep disturbance would predict outcomes.

Results

63% of patients had baseline sleep disturbance. Individuals with sleep disturbance had worse bipolar illness severity, greater severity of depression, mania, anxiety, irritability, and psychosis, were less likely to have sustained response (17% vs. 29%; adjusted RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38–0.78, p = 0.0006) and had more NCAs (median 0.71 vs. 0.59, p = 0.03).

Limitations

Our findings were limited by how we defined sleep disturbance, and by how severity of sleep disturbance was assessed with one item with a non-sleep specific measure.

Conclusions

Baseline sleep disturbance was associated with more severe bipolar symptoms and worse 6-month outcomes. Further research is warranted on improving sleep in bipolar disorder, especially the role of psychosocial interventions.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^f5642fd3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric and Behavioral

What is the best approach for treating psychiatric/behavioral problems?

Anxiety, depression, aggression, impulsivity, and psychosis can be early symptoms of adult PLAN. It may be helpful to involve psychiatry, psychology, and a behavioralist. In individuals with limited communication, challenging behaviors could be the manifestation of, or exacerbated by a physical problem (eg, constipation, dental pain, sleep deprivation), be the result of a psychiatric problem (eg, anxiety), and may serve a function such as avoidance of unwanted activities. Medical triggers should be sought. A functional analysis may help identify the factors that influence the behavior and guide behavioral interventions (eg, applied behavioral analysis). If there is an underlying psychiatric cause, medication directed at that cause may be appropriate. If other methods fail, pharmacologic interventions may be needed. In some individuals with PLAN, treatment with antipsychotics seems to precipitate dystonia or parkinsonism, although causality is not always clear as the motor symptoms generally persist after discontinuation of the medication.

For adult PLAN with psychosis, what is the best antipsychotic medication?

Treatment of psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia, delusions) must be approached cautiously because of the potential for extrapyramidal side effects with antipsychotic medications. It is reasonable to take the same approach in PLAN as in Parkinson disease, where clozapine and quetiapine are preferred antipsychotic medications because their lower D₂ receptor affinity decreases the risks of worsening parkinsonism. Aripiprazole has also been used to treat mood and psychotic symptoms in PLAN.

Regarding medical management for Huntington's disease, more specifically with respect to management of sleep disorders, HD-EG 2018 guidelines recommend to offer sedating antidepressants (such as mirtazapine or trazodone) or neuroleptics (such as olanzapine and quetiapine) as pharmacologic options for sleep disorders in patients with HD.

### A pooled analysis of two randomised, placebo-controlled studies of extended release quetiapine fumarate adjunctive to antidepressant therapy in patients with major depressive disorder [^9fc616b5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Two positive studies evaluated adjunctive extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) showing inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. This preplanned, pooled analysis provides an opportunity for subgroup analyses investigating the influence of demographic and disease-related factors on observed responses. Additional post hoc analyses examined the efficacy of quetiapine XR against specific depressive symptoms including sleep.

Methods

Data were analysed from two 6-week, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies, prospectively designed to be pooled. Patients received once-daily quetiapineXR 150mg/day (n = 309), 300mg/day (n = 307) or placebo (n = 303) adjunctive to ongoing antidepressant therapy. The primary endpoint was change from randomisation to Week 6 in MADRS total score. Other assessments included MADRS response (≥ 50% decrease in total score) and remission (total score ≤ 8), change from randomisation in HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI global and CGI-S scores.

Results

Quetiapine XR (150 and 300mg/day) reduced MADRS total scores vs placebo at every assessment including Week 6 (-14.5, -14.8, -12.0; p < 0.001 each dose) and Week 1 (-7.8,-7.3,-5.1; p < 0.001 each dose). For quetiapineXR 150 and 300mg/day and placebo, respectively at Week 6: MADRS response 53.7% (p = 0.063), 58.3% (p < 0.01) and 46.2%; MADRS remission 35.6% (p < 0.01), 36.5% (p < 0.001) and 24.1%. QuetiapineXR 150 and 300mg/day significantly improved HAM-D, HAM-A, PSQI and CGI-S scores at Week 6 vs placebo. Quetiapine XR demonstrated broad efficacy, independent of factors including concomitant antidepressant.

Limitations

Fixed dosing; lack of active comparator.

Conclusions

Adjunctive quetiapine XR is effective in patients with MDD and an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy, with improvement in depressive symptoms seen as early as Week 1.

### Cognitive functioning and acute sedative effects of risperidone and quetiapine in patients with stable bipolar I disorder: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^c1ead4b9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Antipsychotic medications differ in their sedative potential, which can affect cognitive performance. The primary objective of this double-blind study was to compare the effects of treatment initiation with risperidone and quetiapine on cognitive function in subjects with stable bipolar disorder.

Method

Subjects had a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder in partial or full remission and a Young Mania Rating Scale score ≤ 8 at screening. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: risperidone-quetiapine or quetiapine-risperidone. Subjects in the risperidone-quetiapine sequence received 2 mg of risperidone with dinner and placebo with breakfast during period 1 and 100 mg of quetiapine with dinner and 100 mg with breakfast during period 2. Subjects in the quetiapine-risperidone sequence received the same treatments in reverse order. The 2 treatment periods were separated by a 6- to 14-day washout period. Cognitive function, including attention, working memory, declarative memory, processing speed, and executive functions, was measured before and after dosing. The Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue was also completed. The primary endpoint was a neurocognitive composite score (NCS). The study was conducted from November 2004 through August 2005.

Results

Thirty subjects were randomly assigned; 28 took all doses of study medication and completed a baseline and at least 1 postbase-line assessment in each treatment. On the NCS, significantly better overall cognitive function was seen after risperidone than after quetiapine at each time point after dosing. Subjects performed significantly better after risperidone than after quetiapine (p < .05) on 9 of the 18 individual cognitive outcome measures and significantly better after quetiapine than after risperidone on 1 measure. Sleeping or the need for sleep during the test days was reported in significantly more patients after receiving quetiapine than risperidone.

Conclusions

The results indicate that initiation of quetiapine treatment was associated with more immediate adverse cognitive effects and increased somnolence than risperidone treatment.

### Topiramate-induced somnambulism in a migraineur: a probable idiosyncratic adverse effect [^2beb08ed]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Somnambulism (sleepwalking) is a disorder of arousal that falls under "parasomnia" group and is more common in children. These phenomena occur as primary sleep events or secondary to systemic disease or can be drug induced. Medications that can cause sleepwalking include neuroleptics, hypnotics, lithium, amitriptyline, and β-blockers. This report presents an unusual adverse effect of topiramate on sleep in a patient with migraine.

### Boxed warning for risk of serious injuries caused by sleepwalking… [^2433eedc]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration is advising that rare but serious injuries have happened with certain common prescription insomnia medicines because of sleep behaviors, including sleepwalking, sleep driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake. These complex sleep behaviors have also resulted in deaths. These behaviors appear to be more common with eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem than other prescription medicines used for sleep. Eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem are medicines used to treat insomnia in adults who have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. They are in a class of medicines called sedative-hypnotics and have been approved and on the market for many years. These insomnia medicines work by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep. Quality sleep can have a positive impact on physical and mental health.

6
- Eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem can cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleepwalking, sleep driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake. These complex sleep behaviors are rare but have resulted in serious injuries and death.
- These events can occur with just one dose of these medicines as well as after a longer duration of treatment.
- If you are taking eszopiclone tablets, zolpidem tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets, or oral spray, you should plan to go to bed right after taking the medicine and stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours.
- If you are taking zaleplon or zolpidem, you should take the medicine in bed and remain in bed for at least 4 hours.
- Do not take eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem with any other sleep medicines, including over-the-counter medicines you can buy without a prescription.

Do not drink alcohol before taking these medicines because the combined effects can increase the chances of side effects and adverse events. The cases reported one or more episodes of the sleep behaviors and reported one or more adverse events. The adverse events included falls with serious injuries such as intracranial hemorrhages, vertebral fractures, and hip fractures.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials

Dose-related Adverse Reactions:

Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine (75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mg/day) to placebo were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response (p < 0.05) for the following adverse reactions: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials with Quetiapine and Not Listed Elsewhere in the Label

The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine: nightmares, hypersensitivity, and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS), galactorrhea, bradycardia (which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and/ or syncope) decreased platelets, somnambulism (and other related events), elevations in gamma-GT levels, hypothermia, and priapism.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

Dystonia:

Class Effect

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Side effects with quetiapine

Side effects with quetiapine were near universal. Generally, patient narratives indicated feelings of sedation and unwanted weight gain to be most troublesome.

For some, feelings of sedation were overbearing and were thought to negatively impact their treatment outcome:

P: side effects were just exhaustion and tired um almost comatose in the mornings. (P6)

P: it was horrible I would sort of wake up in the morning and still be like I hadn't had a-a night's sleep. (P6)

P: I was just completely wiped out all the time, I mean I was just zonked permanently basically so it wasn't a feasible option to go forward basically. (P22)

However, two respondents felt sedation helped to improve their sleep which was previously disrupted:

P: it definitely helps so much with my sleep erm, because my sleep used to be really bad. whereas now like I know I take it and then like within half an hour I fall asleep. (P2)

Issues with unwanted weight gain and appetite increase were also among the most commonly reported side effects for quetiapine:

P: having a plan for um. for weight management is a good, is a good thing to do um. cuz that's been, that's been pretty difficult. (P14)

P: one thing that's caught me out is the appetite that I just get big bursts of cravings of food. (P8)

The number of side effects reported differed, and for some, several different side effects were reported. Alongside sedation and weight gain, one participant perceived quetiapine to be worsening other pre-existing symptoms:

P: sleep and weight gain and I also like my um. the level of uh constipation and diarrhoea and how much that's affect, been affecting me. it certainly hasn't improved um it might have gotten worse since I started taking quetiapine. (P14)

### Low dose quetiapine for drug induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease: a double blind cross over study [^3b3bae41]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Drug induced dyskinesias remain a challenging problem in the long term management of Parkinson's disease (PD). We have assessed the effect of quetiapine on dyskinesias in a double blind placebo controlled cross over study.

Methods

Nine patients with PD were enrolled and received 25 mg of quetiapine or placebo at night for two weeks in prerandomised order, with one week of wash out between treatment periods. Assessments were made using on-off diaries, self assessment of dyskinesias, and L-dopa challenges at baseline and after each treatment period. Videotapes were rated blindly by two raters using modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and Goetz scores. Patients subsequently went on open label quetiapine at 50 mg/day, for a mean duration of 30 days, and completed the same self assessment forms.

Results

During the double blind phase, no significant change in dyskinesias was found on either 25 mg of quetiapine or placebo. Duration of off states and Unified PD Rating Scale motor scores also remained unchanged. Moderate tiredness and daytime sleepiness occurred in two patients on quetiapine. One patient dropped out early for unrelated reasons. Eight patients completed the open label phase. On 50 mg/day of quetiapine, a slight reduction in dyskinesias occurred on some scales. Reduction in dyskinesia severity on visual analogue scales was by 50.1%. Off time was not significantly increased. This improvement was not strongly reflected in patients' overall impression of treatment effect. Drowsiness and daytime sleep episodes led to discontinuation in four patients, after completion of the study, and two additional patients stopped treatment after the study because of lack of effect.

Conclusion

Our study failed to demonstrate an antidyskinetic effect of low dose (25 mg) quetiapine. The absence of an increase in parkinsonism combined with a possible antidyskinetic effect on higher doses warrants further investigation.

### Unique pharmacological actions of atypical neuroleptic quetiapine: possible role in cell cycle / fate control [^773e0ae7]. Translational Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiology of major mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and depression, is very important. It is possible to address some of the remaining fundamental questions by investigating novel actions of compounds currently in clinical use. A recent example is the report of a novel action of the neuroleptics clozapine and risperidone, via a heteromeric complex of 5-HT₂A and mGluR₂ receptors.

Neuroleptics have been in clinical use for schizophrenia since the 1950s. The hallmark of these first-generation drugs, including haloperidol and chlorpromazine, is antagonism of the dopamine D₂ receptor. Since the late 1980s, the so-called atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine, have been introduced. Compared with the first-generation drugs, the atypical neuroleptics show somewhat better efficacy for the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, these drugs are also clinically effective in patients with mood disorders. For example, quetiapine has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bipolar depression and is frequently prescribed off-label for depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therefore, in addition to D 2 antagonism, this newer class of drug appears to have additional modes of action. Among the atypical neuroleptics that share a high affinity for serotonin (5-HT₂A) but a relatively low affinity for dopamine (D₂) receptors, quetiapine has a further unique profile with a high affinity for histamine (H₁) and α₁-adrenergic receptors. It is not well understood how the interplay of quetiapine's various receptor-binding activities affects molecular pathways and translates to clinical efficacy. Hence, it seems necessary to look beyond the effects of the individual receptors within quetiapine's known receptor-binding profile to understand its overall therapeutic mechanism.

### Management of sleep problems in Parkinson's disease [^b7e91d8c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently complain of sleep problems. These can be due to several factors, and the approach to their management depends on careful consideration of the various possible factors in each case. 1. Older people, in general, require less sleep. After retirement, people may also engage in less physical activity, and this factor is of course even more pronounced in patients with PD because of their illness. 2. Daytime naps, either spontaneous or due to drugs, reduce the need for nocturnal sleep. Explanation of these physiological and circumstantial changes may help those PD patients who manifest these consequences. 3. The existence of a severe progressive disease as well as social isolation have psychologic consequences, such as anxiety and depression, that may manifest as insomnia. Furthermore, depression is part of the disease, frequently antedating the motor manifestations, and may manifest as insomnia. 4. In advanced disease, patients may be immobile and have difficulty in getting up or even turning in bed. This causes great inconvenience, and may impair sleep. Long acting anti-Parkinson drugs such as cabergoline or rotigotine patch may help. 5. In some cases, unpleasant hallucinations may appear which prevent the patient from falling asleep. These may respond to atypical neuroleptics. Clozapine and quetiapine are particularly useful, but require attention to possible adverse effects.

5.16 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment

Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on quetiapine extended-release tablets compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on quetiapine extended-release tablets compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients. In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on quetiapine extended-release tablets compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls.

In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on quetiapine extended-release tablets respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively).

5.17 Body Temperature Regulation

Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine extended-release tablets for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.

5.18 Dysphagia

Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine extended-release tablets and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

### Increased libido associated with quetiapine [^624e2d98]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

We report sexual symptoms in a 44 year old man with schizophrenia who was receiving treatment with the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine. The symptoms consisted of an increased drive to masturbate and spontaneous ejaculations at night time. We discuss the potential neuro-chemical mechanisms for this and argue that quetiapine's unique pharmacological profile may have contributed to the development of his symptoms.

In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 18% (89/510) of patients on quetiapine compared to 11% (22/206) of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as monotherapy, somnolence was reported in 16% (34/209) of patients on quetiapine compared to 4% of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as adjunct therapy, somnolence was reported in 34% (66/196) of patients on quetiapine compared to 9% (19/203) of placebo patients. In bipolar depression trials, somnolence was reported in 57% (398/698) of patients on quetiapine compared to 15% (51/347) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely.

### Efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in the treatment of early psychosis: a randomized, double-blind 52-week comparison [^f4cb60ac]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This 52-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, multicenter study evaluated the overall effectiveness (as measured by treatment discontinuation rates) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients early in the course of psychotic illness.

Method

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5–20 mg/day), quetiapine (100–800 mg/day), or risperidone (0.5–4 mg/day) administered in twice-daily doses. Statistical analyses tested for noninferiority in all-cause treatment discontinuation rates up to 52 weeks (primary outcome measure) based on a prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%.

Results

A total of 400 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (N = 133), quetiapine (N = 134), or risperidone (N = 133). The mean modal prescribed daily doses were 11.7 mg for olanzapine, 506 mg for quetiapine, and 2.4 mg for risperidone. At week 52, all-cause treatment discontinuation rates were 68.4%, 70.9%, and 71.4% for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, respectively. Reductions in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar for the three treatment groups, but reductions in PANSS positive subscale scores were greater in the olanzapine group (at 12 weeks and at 52 weeks or withdrawal from study) and the risperidone group (at 12 weeks). The most common elicited adverse events for olanzapine were drowsiness (53%), weight gain (51%), and insomnia (38%); for quetiapine, drowsiness (58%), increased sleep hours (42%), and weight gain (40%); and for risperidone, drowsiness (50%), menstrual irregularities in women (47%), and weight gain (41%).

Conclusions

Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone demonstrated comparable effectiveness in early-psychosis patients, as indicated by similar rates of all-cause treatment discontinuation.

Treatment of Psychosis

New Conclusions

A total of 3 new studies 3, 29, 37 were evaluated. Trials not fulfilling the inclusion criteria for review were excluded. 49 See Table 6 for recommendations. Although there is insufficient evidence for quetiapine to be rated for the treatment of psychosis in PD, practice implications have been changed since the previous review. 2 There are no high‐quality RCTs available for quetiapine for the treatment of psychosis in PD; quetiapine was similarly efficacious to clozapine in a clozapine‐controlled trial that did not include a placebo arm. 2 Therefore, the practice implication is " possibly useful " for the treatment of psychosis in PD.

Olanzapine was evaluated in a low‐quality, negative study, 37 as such the conclusions are " non‐efficacious" and " not useful".

Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5‐HT 2A inverse agonist without dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or muscarinic affinity, was evaluated in 2 level I studies. 3, 29 Although the larger high‐quality study had a positive outcome for antipsychotic efficacy, 29 the smaller low‐quality study reported a negative outcome for the primary antipsychotic endpoint, 3 although there were several significant antipsychotic effects in the active arm. Moreover, it was unclear if the primary endpoint was motor safety or antipsychotic efficacy. 3 Indeed, the study was powered for motor function and as such may have been underpowered for antipsychotic efficacy. Therefore, pimavanserin is considered " efficacious" over the short term of 6 weeks for the treatment of psychosis in PD. Although there were no safety concerns, there is a lack of controlled safety data beyond 6 weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, a very recent FDA analysis found no new or unexpected safety risks associated with pimavanserin 90, 91 (Table 6). Therefore, pimavanserin is considered " clinically useful" for the treatment of psychosis in PD.

Generally, all atypical antipsychotics must be used with great caution in demented patients with psychosis because of risk of AEs that include falls, cognitive worsening, pneumonia, cardiovascular effects, stroke, and death. 92

### Treatments for somnambulism in adults: assessing the evidence [^6d151441]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, is a parasomnia of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep where movement behaviours usually confined to wakefulness are displayed during sleep. Generally, if sleepwalking is causing distress or danger in spite of safety measures, medical or psychological treatment is indicated. Clinicians will need to assess the evidence for treatment options. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (EBM) multifile databases were searched. No properly powered rigorous controlled trials were found for treatment of sleepwalking in adults. Seven reports described small trials with some kind of control arm, or retrospective case series which included 30 or more patients. With no high quality evidence to underpin recommendations for treatments of somnambulism, full discussion with patients is advised. Adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials are now needed, and multi-centre collaborations may be required to obtain the sample sizes required.

### Low doses of mirtazapine or quetiapine for transient insomnia: a randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial [^5c45be37]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Low doses of the antidepressant mirtazapine or the neuroleptic quetiapine are often prescribed off-label for insomnia. However, studies on the effects on sleep and hangover effects the following day are scarce. In this randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, the influence of 7.5 mg mirtazapine and 50 mg quetiapine on both normal sleep and sleep disturbed by acoustic stress (traffic noise) as a model for transient insomnia was assessed. Additionally, hangover effects on next-day alertness and cognitive functioning were examined. A total of 19 healthy men without sleep complaints completed three treatment sessions, each session consisting of three consecutive nights in one of the mirtazapine, quetiapine or placebo conditions. Sleep was assessed using polysomnography and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Daytime sleepiness and cognitive functioning were assessed using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Digit Symbol Substitution Task, Psychomotor Vigilance Task and an addition task. Under acoustic stress, both mirtazapine and quetiapine increased total sleep time by half an hour and reduced the number of awakenings by 35–40% compared to placebo. While quetiapine specifically increased the duration of non-rapid eye movement sleep, stage N2, mirtazapine mainly increased deep sleep stage N3. Subjects reported that both mirtazapine and quetiapine eased getting to sleep and improved sleep quality. Both drugs caused daytime sleepiness and lessened sustained attention. These findings support the use of low doses of mirtazapine and quetiapine for the treatment of insomnia. Further prospective studies on the long-term effects regarding effectiveness and adverse effects are needed.

Other published literature independent from the strength of this recommendation discusses the potential risk of abuse, dependence, motor vehicle accidents, and diversion, and in April 2019 the FDA released a safety announcement advising of serious injuries from complex sleep behaviors (e.g., sleepwalking, sleep driving, activities while not fully awake) associated with non-BZD BzRAs; these behaviors have at times resulted in deaths and, although rare, have occurred in patients.

### Quetiapine for insomnia associated with refractory depression exacerbated by phenelzine [^bd623119]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the successful treatment of phenelzine-associated insomnia with low-dose quetiapine in a patient with refractory depression.

Case Summary

A 42-year-old white man with severe major depression unresponsive to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, and tricyclic antidepressants improved following treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine. Insomnia, present to a moderate degree prior to antidepressant therapy, worsened markedly following phenelzine treatment and failed to respond to diphenhydramine, temazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, zolpidem, or trazodone given at high therapeutic doses. Sleep disturbance resolved with low-dose (50 mg) adjunctive quetiapine, with no adverse effects.

Discussion

Major depression refractory to standard therapy is a common and serious condition. Some cases respond to MAOIs; however, orthostatic hypotension and insomnia frequently occur. Potentially serious MAOI interactions with psychotropic drugs have raised concerns about combining these agents. In this case, a failure of a number of other medications known to treat MAOI-associated insomnia safely prompted a trial of quetiapine. Despite the possibility that enhanced serotonergic activity might have resulted in serotonin syndrome, no adverse interactions between phenelzine and quetiapine were noted. The use of low-dose, once-daily quetiapine, along with its unique binding properties, may account for its increased safety in combination with phenelzine.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that low-dose quetiapine may be an alternative treatment for phenelzine-associated insomnia. Further case reports are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of combining these agents.

Regarding specific circumstances for insomnia, more specifically with respect to patients with Huntington's disease, HD-EG 2018 guidelines recommend to offer sedating antidepressants (such as mirtazapine or trazodone) or neuroleptics (such as olanzapine and quetiapine) as pharmacologic options for sleep disorders in patients with Huntington's disease.

### Restless legs syndrome following the use of ziprasidone: a case report [^fdd8705c]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related movement disorder characterised by an uncomfortable urge to move the legs that occurs during periods of inactivity. Although there have been many case reports on antipsychotic-induced RLS, ziprasidone has never been reported as a cause of RLS. We present a case of a female patient with schizophrenia who presented with symptoms of RLS following the administration of high doses of ziprasidone added to quetiapine and valproate. The patient's symptoms of RLS occurred following the administration and titration of ziprasidone to 160 mg, and were relieved upon reducing the dose to 120 mg/day. Other potential causative medications and differential diagnoses that could have caused similar symptoms were excluded. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for ziprasidone-induced RLS. Dopamine and serotonin interaction could be the mechanism underlying ziprasidone-induced RLS.

### Antipsychotics for fibromyalgia in adults [^a51546fa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue. It affects approximately 2% of the general population. Up to 70% of patients with fibromyalgia meet the criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life. Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving health-related quality of life. Antipsychotics might reduce fibromyalgia and associated mental health symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, tolerability and safety of antipsychotics in fibromyalgia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE and EMBASE to 20 May 2016, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews and two clinical trial registries. We also contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We selected controlled trials of at least four weeks duration of any formulation of antipsychotics used for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted the data from all included studies and two review authors independently assessed study risks of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. We derived first tier evidence from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for drop-outs, at least 200 participants in the comparison, eight to 12 weeks duration, parallel design), second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and that we considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that we considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included a total of four studies with 296 participants. Three studies with 206 participants compared quetiapine, an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic, with placebo. One study used a cross-over design and two studies a parallel-group design. Study duration was eight or 12 weeks. Quetiapine was used in all studies with a bedtime dosage between 50 and 300 mg/day. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias and we judged them to be at moderate risk of bias overall. The primary outcomes in this review were participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved, withdrawal due to adverse events (tolerability) and serious adverse events (safety). Second tier evidence indicated that quetiapine was not statistically superior to placebo in the number of participants with a 50% or more pain reduction (very low quality evidence). No study reported data on PGIC. A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a 30% or more pain reduction (risk difference (RD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.23; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 8, 95% CI 5 to 100) (very low quality evidence). A greater proportion of participants on quetiapine reported a clinically relevant improvement of health-related quality of life compared to placebo (RD 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 20) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.67, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.23), depression (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.04) and anxiety (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.11) (very low quality evidence). Quetiapine was statistically superior to placebo in reducing the risk of withdrawing from the study due to a lack of efficacy (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.05) (very low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference between quetiapine and placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawing due to adverse events (tolerability) (very low quality evidence), in the frequency of serious adverse events (safety) (very low quality evidence) and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness and somnolence as an adverse event (very low quality evidence). In more participants in the quetiapine group a substantial weight gain was noted (RD 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.15; number needed to treat for an additional harm (NNTH) 12, 95% CI 6 to 50) (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of evidence by three levels to a very low quality rating because of limitations of study design, indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). One parallel design study with 90 participants compared quetiapine (50 to 300 mg/day flexible at bedtime) to amitriptyline (10 to 75 mg/day flexible at bedtime). The study had three major risks of bias and we judged it to be at moderate risk of bias overall. We downgraded the quality of evidence by two levels to a low quality rating because of indirectness (patients with major medical diseases and mental disorders were excluded) and imprecision (fewer than 400 patients were analysed). Third tier evidence indicated no statistically significant differences between the two drugs. Both drugs did not statistically significantly differ in the reduction of average scores for pain, fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety and for limitations of health-related quality of life and in the proportion of participants reporting dizziness, somnolence and weight gain as a side effect (low quality evidence). Compared to amitriptyline, more participants left the study due to adverse events (low quality evidence). No serious adverse events were reported (low quality evidence). We found no relevant study with other antipsychotics than quetiapine in fibromyalgia.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low quality evidence suggests that quetiapine may be considered for a time-limited trial (4 to 12 weeks) to reduce pain, sleep problems, depression and anxiety in fibromyalgia patients with major depression. Potential side effects such as weight gain should be balanced against the potential benefits in shared decision making with the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^eaa71f9d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Other agents for primary insomnia — limited or excluded evidence: For oxazepam, a crossover study of oxazepam 25 mg versus placebo in 28 patients with "insomnia" found subjective interval ratings showed a significant reduction in sleep latency (SL) and significant improvement in quality of sleep (QOS). A quetiapine placebo-controlled study included only 13 subjects; numerical increases in subjective total sleep time (TST) and decreases in subjective SL were not statistically significant. A gabapentin open-label investigation with 18 subjects and no placebo control was excluded. For paroxetine, one variable-dosage trial in 15 patients without placebo was excluded, and another randomized study in 27 older adults evaluated paroxetine 10 mg/20 mg versus placebo with doses pooled for analysis.

### Effect of quetiapine XR on depressive symptoms and sleep quality compared with lithium in patients with bipolar depression [^5e205387]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar depression is one of the most serious psychiatric conditions. In addition, sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder is common, and therapeutic agents restoring sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder patients will be clinically beneficial. In the current study, we compared the effect of quetiapine XR with lithium on depressive symptoms and sleep in bipolar depression patients during 8 weeks of trial.

Methods

An open-label, randomized comparison of sleep-activity and depressive symptoms between 8-week quetiapine XR monotherapy and lithium monotherapy for bipolar depression was conducted. Each assessment consisted of HDRS-17, Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), and self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Actigraphy-measured sleep parameters were assessed.

Results

A total of 42 patients (35.7 ± 10.9 years; gender: male 15, female 27) with bipolar depression were screened out. Out of 42 patients, six patients were excluded before randomization. After randomization, seven patients were withdrawn. Twenty-nine patients with more than two visits after randomization (lithium group: 17, quetiapine XR group: 12, mean age: 36.1 ± 10.4, gender: male 13, female 16) were included in the final analysis. In both groups, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were significantly decreased at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 compared with baseline. Remission rate (HDRS ≤ 7) in the quetiapine XR was significantly higher than that of the lithium group. In the quetiapine XR group, PSQI scores at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 was significantly decreased compared with baseline. Sleep efficiency at weeks 6 and 8 was significantly increased. WASO at week 8 was significantly decreased.

Limitations

First, the present study was conducted with the relatively small number of study subjects. Second, bias could have affected the study results due to its open-label design. Third, study subjects were made up of high proportion of bipolar II disorder patients.

Conclusions

Quetiapine XR monotherapy was more effective in treating bipolar depression than lithium. In particular, quetiapine XR treatment improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in patients with bipolar depression. However, relationship between favorable sleep quality and depressive symptom improvement were limited.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Quetiapine for schizophrenia [^2eaea437]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic with, theoretically, a low propensity for movement disorder adverse effects. It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses.

Objectives

To determine the effects of quetiapine for schizophrenia in comparison to placebo, and other antipsychotics.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (February 2003), Biological Abstracts (1982–2000), CINAHL (1982–2000), the Cochrane Library (2000, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–2000), MEDLINE (1966–2000), PsycLIT (1974–2000), SIGLE on CD (1980–1997), SocioFile (1974–1997) and many conference proceedings and hand searches of specific journals were undertaken. We contacted AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals for information regarding unpublished trials. The review was updated in February 2003.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials where adults with schizophrenia or similar illnesses were assigned to quetiapine, placebo or other neuroleptic drugs and where clinically relevant outcomes were reported.

Data Collection and Analysis

Citations and, where possible, abstracts were inspected independently by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. We independently extracted data. We analysed data using fixed effects relative risk (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI). Only homogeneous data were interpreted as favouring treatment or control. Where possible we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm statistics (NNH). We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous data.

Main Results

Despite the fact that 3443 people were randomised in 12 quetiapine studies, there are almost no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, social functioning and quality of life. Over half of those within the quetiapine versus placebo comparison were lost to follow up (53% quetiapine vs 61% placebo, n = 716, 4RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.7 to 0.9, NNT 11 CI 7 to 55) so it is impossible to interpret any ratings of global or mental state within this comparison with confidence. People allocated quetiapine, however, did not have more movement disorders than those given placebo (n = 395, 2 RCTs, RR needing medication for EPSE 0.62 CI 0.3 to 1.2). The same applies to the comparison of ≥ 250 mg/day quetiapine with < 250 mg/day quetiapine (49% dropout ≥ 250 mg/day vs 58% < 250 mg/day, n = 1066, 3 RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.8 to 0.9, NNT 11 CI 7 to 29). It should be noted that two deaths occurred in the higher dose group (n = 618, 1 RCT, RR 0.1 CI 0.0 to 2.1). When quetiapine was compared with typical antipsychotics, about 36% of both groups failed to complete the short-term studies (n = 1624, 6 RCTs, RR 0.87 CI 0.8 to 1.0). Average change in global state was heterogeneous and equivocal (n = 762, 3 RCTs, WMD in short term 0.19 CI 0.00 to 0.38, I squared 76%). Mental state measures were also equivocal (n = 1247, RR not improved 0.97 CI 0.9 to 1.1) including specific measures of negative symptoms (n = 305, 1 RCT, MD change in SANS short term 0.94 CI -0.2 to 2.0). Movement disorders were less prevalent for those allocated quetiapine (n = 1117, 4 RCTs, RR needing medication for extrapyramidal adverse effects 0.47 CI 0.4 to 0.6, NNT 4 CI 4 to 5, I squared 88%). Dry mouth (n = 649, 2 RCTs, RR short term 2.85 CI 1.5 to 5.6, NNH 17 CI 7 to 65) and sleepiness (n = 959, 3 RCTs, RR 1.51 CI 1.1 to 2.2, NNH 18 CI 8 to 181) may also be more prevalent for people given quetiapine compared with the older drugs. In the quetiapine versus risperidone comparison, over 30% of people left the study before completion (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 0.94 CI 0.7 to 1.2). Four people, all treated with quetiapine, died during the study (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.86 CI 0.2 to 52.8). Continuous mental state measures did not show clear differences between the two drugs (n = 637, 1 RCT, MD PANSS 1.2 CI -2.0 to 4.4). However, considerably fewer people given quetiapine needed medication for extrapyramidal side effects compared with those allocated to risperidone (n = 712, 1 RCT, RR 0.27 CI 0.2 to 0.5, NNT 11 CI 10 to 16). Quetiapine caused more dizziness (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 1.85 CI 1.0 to 3.3, NNH 18 CI 7 to 487), more dry mouth (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.11 CI 1.2 to 3.8, NNH 14 CI 6 to 82) and more sleepiness than risperidone (n = 728, 1 RCT, RR 2.03 CI 1.4 to 2.9, NNH 7 CI 4 to 17).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Quetiapine is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia, but it is not much different from first-generation antipsychotics and risperidone with respect to treatment withdrawal and efficacy. In comparison to first-generation antipsychotics and risperidone, quetiapine has a lower risk of movement disorders but higher risks of dizziness, dry mouth and sleepiness. More clearly reported pragmatic randomised controlled trials should be carried out to determine its position in everyday clinical practice. Studies of medium and long-term effects, including cost-effectiveness, quality of life, social functioning and service utilisation, in comparison with the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics should be priority areas.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^bc36e46a]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Current hypnotic usage — prescription patterns and population use are summarized across U.S. datasets. Overall frequency of hypnotic prescriptions for insomnia declined during 1970–1990 from 5.3% to 2.5%. In office-based prescribing during 1987–1996, there was an over 50% decline in benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic prescriptions accompanied by a nearly 150% increase in trazodone prescriptions, and overall prescriptions for insomnia declined by about 25% during this period. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2010 data, just under 3% of the population had used these agents within the past month; BzRAs were most commonly prescribed (1.23% of the population), followed by trazodone (0.97%), BZDs (0.4%), quetiapine (0.32%) and doxepin. The use of antidepressants with poor or limited documentation was only 0.7% in the past month, increasing from 0.2% in the first year sampled to 3.5% in the final year (2009–2010). The 2005 National Sleep Foundation's survey found that 7% of respondents report using a prescription medication to improve sleep at least a few nights per month.

### Restless legs syndrome following the use of ziprasidone: a case report [^98afe890]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Management and clinical course after the onset of RLS

As several reports have shown that RLS could be induced by quetiapine, we tapered Miss A off quetiapine and valproic acid. However, even with ziprasidone as monotreatment, her symptoms of RLS persisted.

Given the patient's amelioration of psychotic symptoms with ziprasidone, treatment with ziprasidone was maintained but with a reduced dose of 120 mg daily (40 mg three times a day during meals). The day after we reduced the dosage, the patient reported minimal discomfort in bilateral legs in the afternoon, which was relieved with massage within an hour. She reported sufficient sleep at night after tapering down the dose of ziprasidone. The patient rated her symptoms as Mild (9 points in total) at this time using the IRLS. Several days later, Miss A's psychotic symptoms were resolved, and she was thus discharged home.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^9910cc49]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment for intensive care unit (ICU) sleep and circadian disruption (SCD) is characterized by limited guideline support and mixed evidence: There are "no ICU guideline recommendations supporting the use of a pharmacologic treatment to improve ICU SCD", yet medications are "frequently prescribed", with "Melatonin… the most commonly prescribed medication, followed by ramelteon and quetiapine". In ICU sleep-bundle trials, "only two allowed use of pharmacologic sleep aids", and usage was "relatively uncommon" at 16% and 7%, so these studies did not establish sleep impact. Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of melatonin "showed no association… with improvement in delirium and conflicting results regarding sleep outcomes" by RCSQ and nursing observation. Ramelteon has been reported to improve both sleep-related and delirium endpoints, dexmedetomidine shows "mixed" sleep-promotion results potentially related to measurement methods, and suvorexant was associated with a lower incidence of delirium but no differences in sleep endpoints versus no suvorexant after adjustment.

### Quetiapine in refractory hyperactive and mixed intensive care delirium: a case series [^40e900c6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Quetiapine might be an effective therapy in difficult-to-treat patients with hyperactive and mixed delirium.

- Quetiapine may be efficacious at doses lower than those reported in the literature.

- Quetiapine's effectiveness in this patient group should be tested further in a controlled study.

### Combined treatment with quetiapine and sertindole in therapy refractory insomnia after clozapine discontinuation [^ecd2e023]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Insomnia associated with chronic schizophrenia and after clozapine discontinuation represents a common, but mostly not predominant, complaint and often does not respond sufficiently to classical hypnotics. We report the case of a 46-year-old patient with schizophrenia who developed a rebound insomnia confirmed by polysomnography after discontinuation of long-term treatment with clozapine and changing to sertindole therapy. Zolpidem, zolpiclone and chloral hydrate only led to short-term improvement of subjective sleep quality. An add-on therapy with 300 mg quetiapine resulted in improved subjective quality of sleep regarding sleep latency and the number of nocturnal awakenings. The combination of the two neuroleptics did not lead to increased QTc intervals (normal QTc < 450 ms) or metabolic side effects. In conclusion, the combination of sertindole and quetiapine might be a safe and effective combination in therapy-refractory insomnia after clozapine discontinuation in schizophrenia.

### Rotigotine effects on early morning motor function and sleep in Parkinson's disease: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (RECOVER) [^06128a4a]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

METHODS

Design

The RECOVER (Randomized Evaluation of the 24-hour Coverage: Efficacy of Rotigotine) study (NCT00474058) was a Phase 3b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, two-arm trial undertaken in 49 centers in 12 countries. Subjects were recruited between May 2, 2007 and November 17, 2008. Maximum study duration per subject was 22 weeks, with a maximum duration of treatment of 12 weeks.

Subjects

Men and women (aged ≥ 18 years) with PD (Hoehn and Yahr Stage I-IV; both fluctuators and nonfluctuators) and unsatisfactory control of early morning motor symptoms as determined by the investigator (with the latter intended to reflect clinical practice), were eligible for inclusion. PD was defined by the presence of bradykinesia and at least one of the following: resting tremor, rigidity, or impairment of postural reflexes. Subjects not taking-dopa were eligible for study inclusion as were those taking immediate-release-dopa provided they had been on a stable dose for the 28 days prior to baseline (see Supporting Information text for study exclusion criteria).

Antiemetics without central dopaminergic activity were permitted to treat nausea and vomiting that occurred during study drug use. Anticholinergic agents, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, entacapone, sedatives, hypnotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, anxiolytics, and other CNS medications were permitted if dose was stable for the 28 days prior to baseline and likely to remain so for the duration of the study. Controlled-release-dopa, other centrally acting dopaminergic agents, monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors, tolcapone, budipine, or neuroleptics (except olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, clozapine, or quetiapine) were prohibited from 28 days prior to baseline and during the study.

The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and amendments were approved by a national, regional, or Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board. All subjects provided written, informed consent before study participation.

### Off-label use of quetiapine… [^59c49d2f]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Off-label use of antipsychotic medication is increasing, particularly the use of quetiapine for sleep, owing to its sedating properties. 1 This is a cause for concern given important adverse effects, including drug-induced diabetes and parkinsonism, weight gain, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, oversedation, and risk of arrhythmia. 2 We describe quetiapine use in a prospective cohort of medical inpatients and the proportion of in-hospital use that is perpetuated on discharge. One of us retrospectively reviewed all medical records for quetiapine dose and indication. In the absence of a documented comorbid psychiatric condition or evidence of delirium it was inferred that once-nightly quetiapine was being given for sleep. Categorical variables were compared using χ² and continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank-sum or the Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate.

The study was approved by the McGill University Health Centre research ethics board. Of the 1001 consecutive patients, 125 received quetiapine during hospitalization. The Table compares demographics and comorbidities between users and nonusers. Eighty users received the medication at bedtime for sleep, of whom 73. 0% were newly initiated in hospital. Overall, 59 of 1001 were discharged with a prescription for quetiapine, 29 of whom received the medication for sleep. One in 7 patients who first received quetiapine for sleep in the hospital was discharged home with at least a 1-month prescription. In our single-center study of 1001 older medical inpatients, quetiapine was given to 1 in 8 patients with nearly two-thirds of the use being for sleep. About half of this use was continued at discharge including 1 in 7 patients who were first introduced to the medication as a sleep aid while in hospital.

The proportion of patients who received quetiapine off-label for sleep was similar to that in a recent study of outpatients who received quetiapine for any off-label indication. 3 There is a limited number of studies examining off-label quetiapine use.

5.7 Parasomnias

Sleepwalking, defined as confused behavior occurring at night and at times associated with wandering, was reported in 6% of 781 patients with narcolepsy treated with Xyrem in adult controlled trials and long-term open-label studies, with < 1% of patients discontinuing due to sleepwalking. Rates of sleepwalking were similar for patients taking placebo and patients taking Xyrem in controlled trials. It is unclear if some or all of the reported sleepwalking episodes correspond to true somnambulism, which is a parasomnia occurring during non-REM sleep, or to any other specific medical disorder. Five instances of sleepwalking with potential injury or significant injury were reported during a clinical trial of Xyrem in patients with narcolepsy.

Parasomnias, including sleepwalking, also have been reported in the pediatric clinical trial and in postmarketing experience with Xyrem. Therefore, episodes of sleepwalking should be fully evaluated and appropriate interventions considered.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine extended-release tablets.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine extended-release tablets are not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Patient perspectives of lithium and quetiapine augmentation treatment in treatment-resistant depression: a qualitative assessment [^d9a8cb5f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aligning with prior research, we found that experiences of adverse effects were nearly universal. Importantly, most patients could continue their treatment despite these adverse effects. Several patients assessed both the risks and benefits of their prescribed medication and felt the perceived benefits outweighed the disadvantages of the side effects they encountered. However, for a small portion of participants, adverse effects were overly impairing and, in some instances, this led to early withdrawal. Contrasting with prior studies comparing these drugs, we found that adverse effects were perceived as more challenging with quetiapine than with lithium. Patients described difficulties with appetite increase, weight gain, restlessness and constipation, consistent with previously reported side effects associated with quetiapine. However, the most extensively discussed side effect with quetiapine was sedation. This aligns with findings from, who reported sedation to be the lead cause of discontinuation when comparing the tolerability of lithium and quetiapine in patients with TRD. However, our results also suggest that experiences of sedation may not always be negative; two participants reported positive experiences of sedation due to improvements in sleep. Our findings therefore underline the importance of considering individual patient characteristics and symptom experiences when making treatment decisions.

To a lesser extent, disruptive side effects were also reported with lithium. Consistent with quantitative evidence, participants experienced difficulties with dry mouth, tremor and nausea. Side effects generally appeared manageable, although for two participants, difficulties with tremor and kidney function were thought to negatively impact their treatment outcome. Our findings could contribute to the development of patient information on side-effect profiles for use in clinical practice or future drug trials. Indeed, previous research has demonstrated the additional value of patient reporting of adverse effects for pharmacovigilance alongside healthcare providers' reports.

Taken together, our findings indicate that there were a few differences in the perceived efficacy of lithium versus quetiapine. Greater apprehension about side effects was reported for lithium prior to treatment initiation, but greater experience of negative side effects was reported for quetiapine. This suggests that patient opinions prior to treatment do not necessarily align with treatment experience, and that anticipation of negative side effects may contribute to lack of uptake, especially for lithium.

### Restless legs syndrome following the use of ziprasidone: a case report [^cd9c7444]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), with prevalence ranging from 2% to 15% in the general population, is a common disorder associated with many medical conditions and medications. Some second-generation antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapineand quetiapinehave been reported to cause secondary RLS, whereas others have been reported to help it. However, no cases of RLS induced by ziprasidone were found on MEDLINE or EMBASE searches done on 25 March 2018. We report a case of RLS possibly induced by ziprasidone.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia with lewy bodies: fourth consensus report of the DLB consortium [^cd859301]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms.

CHEIs may produce substantial reduction in apathy and improve visual hallucinations and delusions in DLB. Since anxiety and agitation are sometimes driven by psychosis, there may be secondary benefits in these. The use of antipsychotics for the acute management of substantial behavioral disturbance, delusions, or visual hallucinations comes with attendant mortality risks in patients with dementia, and particularly in the case of DLB they should be avoided whenever possible, given the increased risk of a serious sensitivity reaction. Low-dose quetiapine may be relatively safer e27 than other antipsychotics and is widely used, but a small placebo-controlled clinical trial in DLB was negative. There is a positive evidence base for clozapine in PD psychosis, but efficacy and tolerability in DLB have not been established. Newer drugs targeting the serotonergic system, such as pimavanserin, may be alternatives, but controlled clinical trial data in DLB are needed. Although depressive symptoms are common in DLB, trial data are scant. In alignment with general advice on depression in dementia, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and mirtazapine are options in DLB with treatment guided by individual patient tolerability and response.

Motor symptoms.

Parkinsonism is often less responsive to dopaminergic treatments in DLB than in PD and their use may be associated with an increased risk of psychosis, although some patients may benefit from levodopa preparations introduced at low doses and increased slowly to the minimum required to minimize motor disability without exacerbating psychiatric symptoms.e28 Patients at risk of falling may benefit from safety assessments, as well as bone mineral density screening, and assessment of vitamin D status, to manage risk of traumatic fractures.

Other symptoms.

A wide range of other symptoms can occur in DLB, including autonomic and sleep/wakefulness disturbances, which have profound negative sequelae for quality of life in both patients and their families. In the absence of DLB-specific trial data for these symptoms, clinicians base their treatment decisions on clinical experience, expert opinion, or evidence-based recommendations developed in other diseases, e.g. cautious bedtime use of clonazepam may reduce the risk of sleep-related injuries in patients with DLB with RBD but carries a risk of worsening cognition and gait impairment, melatonin being a possibly safer option.

### Restless legs syndrome following the use of ziprasidone: a case report [^fe288ace]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Case history

Introduction of the case

Miss Awas a 35-year-old Chinese female patient with a history of known mild intellectual disability since childhood and an 8-month history of schizophrenia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). She was initially treated with risperidone titrated to 6 mg orally per day (3 mg two times per day) with partial improvement but persistent active commentary auditory hallucination, disorganised behaviour and agitation. A decision was made to switch to quetiapine with a maximum dose of 800 mg daily (400 mg orally two times per day) and 500 mg of valproic acid daily. While taking 800 mg of quetiapine daily, the patient still reported residual symptoms of paranoia and intermittent auditory hallucination, so we decided to put her on ziprasidone. We started with 40 mg daily and increased to 40 mg every 3 days (40 mg–80 mg–120 mg–160 mg). She developed significant improvement of psychotic symptoms after the addition of ziprasidone. However, the night after she was titrated to 160 mg daily (80 mg at lunch and 80 mg at dinner) of ziprasidone, she developed marked, intractable discomfort in bilateral legs, which she could not describe clearly given her poor iteration. The discomfort induced an urge to move her legs, was partially relieved by walking, and worsened with resting. The symptoms were worse at night and in the afternoon. She was unable to fall asleep due to significant discomfort and kept pacing in the unit during the night. Benzodiazepine was prescribed as needed to help relieve her symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex for maintenance of patients with bipolar I disorder (international trial 126) [^77bfa920]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study examined the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in combination with lithium or divalproex compared with placebo with lithium or divalproex in the prevention of recurrent mood events in bipolar I patients, most recent episode mania, depression, or mixed.

Methods

Patients received open-label quetiapine (400–800 mg/day; flexible, divided doses) with lithium or divalproex (target serum concentrations 0.5–1.2 mEq/L and 50–125 microg/mL, respectively) for up to 36 weeks to achieve at least 12 weeks of clinical stability. Patients were subsequently randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (400–800 mg/day) plus lithium/divalproex or placebo plus lithium/divalproex for up to 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence of any mood event.

Results

Treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased the time to recurrence of any mood event compared with placebo plus lithium/divalproex. The proportion of patients having a mood event was markedly lower in the quetiapine than in the placebo group (18.5% versus 49.0%). The hazard ratio for time to recurrence of a mood event was 0.28 (P < 0.001), a mania event 0.30 (P < 0.001), and a depression event 0.26 (P < 0.001) corresponding to risk reductions of 72%, 70%, and 74%, respectively. During the randomization phase, the most common adverse events occurring in ≥ 5% in the quetiapine group were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, and headache. Insomnia was more common in the placebo group. During the randomization phase, there was an increase in weight of 0.5 kg in the quetiapine group and a reduction of 1.9 kg in the placebo group. The incidence and incidence density of a single emergent fasting blood glucose value ≥ 126 mg/dL was higher with quetiapine than with placebo (9.3% versus 4.1%; 17.6 versus 9.5 patients per 100 patient-years).

Limitations

This was an enriched sample of patients with bipolar I disorder responding to treatment with quetiapine plus lithium/divalproex.

Conclusions

Maintenance treatment with quetiapine in combination with lithium/divalproex significantly increased time to recurrence of any event (mania, depression, or mixed) irrespective of the polarity of the index episode compared with placebo with lithium/divalproex. Long-term treatment with quetiapine was generally well-tolerated. Quetiapine with lithium/divalproex can provide an effective long-term treatment option for bipolar I disorder to prevent recurrences not only of mania but also depression.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management. For the most up-to-date information on the management of quetiapine extended-release tablets overdosage, contact a certified Regional Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222).

Quetiapine extended-release tablets overdose may lead to gastric bezoar formation and appropriate diagnostic imaging is recommended to further guide patient management. Routine gastric lavage may not be effective in the removal of the bezoar due to gum like sticky consistency of the mass. Endoscopic pharmacobezoar removal has been performed successfully.

### Quetiapine monotherapy in the treatment of patients with bipolar I or II depression and a rapid-cycling disease course: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^af4a5f0e]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy in patients with bipolar I or II disorder with a rapid-cycling disease course.

Methods

Adult patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, most recent episode depressed, with a rapid-cycling disease course from a previously completed multicenter trial randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with quetiapine 600 mg/day (n = 31), quetiapine 300 mg/day (n = 42), or placebo (n = 35) were included in this sub-analysis. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline to week 8 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

Results

Quetiapine (600 and 300 mg/day) provided significantly greater mean reductions from baseline to week 8 in the MADRS total score than placebo (-21.1, -20.7 versus -11.6, both p < 0.001) in this patient population. Effect sizes in patients with a rapid-cycling disease course were 1.2 (600 mg/day) and 1.1 (300 mg/day) and were similar for bipolar I (0.98 and 1.22) and bipolar II (1.45 and 0.97) sub-groups. Significant improvements were also noted on the Clinical Global Impression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire scales. Quetiapine was generally well tolerated with moderate increases in weight and extrapyramidal side effects compared to placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent mania was similar to placebo.

Conclusions

Quetiapine monotherapy (600 or 300 mg/day) is clinically effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of depressive episodes in patients with bipolar I or II disorder who have a rapid-cycling disease course.

### New pharmacologic agents for insomnia and hypersomnia [^4e783b18]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Insomnia and hypersomnia are conditions with multifactorial causes that can be difficult to treat. There have been recent developments and changes in the treatment of both conditions, including the addition of some agents that have a novel mechanism of action. This review summarizes recent changes and highlights pertinent updates.

Recent Findings

Benzodiazepine receptor agonists received a warning in 2019 regarding the possibility of complex sleep behaviors, such as sleepwalking. Zolpidem has been marketed in new dosage forms that include sublingual tablets and oral spray formulations. Orexin receptor antagonists appear to be well tolerated with a good safety profile. Suvorexant received an approval for the treatment of patients with comorbid insomnia and dementia. Lemborexant was demonstrated to be effective for maintenance insomnia. Trazodone was shown to affect the oligomerization of tau proteins thus suggesting potential implications in attenuating dementia pathology. Pitolisant, a novel histamine-3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist, gained approval for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy as well as obstructive sleep apnea. Solriamfetol, a new norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was approved for hypersomnolence based on good efficacy, but with cardiovascular warnings.

Summary

Recent advancements in the treatment of insomnia includes agents with novel mechanisms, new indications, and new dosage forms. Risk of complex sleep behaviors, and possible next-day driving impairment, should be discussed for all agents used for insomnia, including orexin receptor antagonists. Novel agents also are available for hypersomnia and there are options beyond traditional stimulants that may have great utility.

Results of the second network meta-analysis

Results of the second NMA are shown in Supplementary Appendix 3.1–3.11. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL, lurasidone+LIT/VAL, quetiapine+LIT/VAL, and ziprasidone+LIT/VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/VAL in the recurrence/relapse rate of any mood episode. Moreover, lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to olanzapine+LIT/VAL. Lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/VAL in the recurrence/relapse rate of depressive episodes, and lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to aripiprazole+LIT/VAL and ziprasidone+LIT/VAL. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were superior to placebo+LIT/VAL in the recurrence/relapse rate of manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes, and lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were associated with lower all-cause discontinuation compared with placebo+LIT/VAL. Quetiapine+LIT/VAL was associated with a higher incidence of somnolence compared with placebo+LIT/VAL. Olanzapine+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were associated with a lower incidence of insomnia compared with placebo+LIT/VAL. Olanzapine+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL were associated with a higher incidence of increased weight compared with placebo+LIT/VAL and aripiprazole+LIT/VAL. We did not examine local heterogeneity, and global and local inconsistency for any outcomes in the second NMA due to insufficient data. The confidence in evidence of the second NMA was very low.

### Low-dose quetiapine for patients with dysregulation of hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments [^72ad9d99]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments often develop symptoms that fail to meet diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorders. These patients can be conceived as having bipolar disorder NOS (not otherwise specified), a bipolar spectrum disorder, cyclothymic disorder or cluster B personality traits. Here, we describe four of these patients with mild to moderate symptoms affecting mood, behaviour, emotional reactivity and sleep. Treatment with low-dose quetiapine (25–75 mg/day at night) lead to sustained symptom remission. Two of them were on quetiapine monotherapy. Such low doses occupy a minority of D2 and 5-HT2 receptors, which may nevertheless be of therapeutic value in mild cases. Alternatively, other mechanisms more likely to occur at low doses, such as antagonism of H1, alpha(1B)-adrenergic and other serotonin receptors, as well as reduction cortisol secretion, may be involved in the therapeutic efficacy of quetiapine.

### Using antipsychotic agents in older patients [^c5bbbce2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotics are widely used in geriatric psychiatric disorders. A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available, expanding clinical options but complicating decision-making. Many questions about use of antipsychotics in older patients remain unanswered by available clinical literature. We therefore surveyed expert opinion on antipsychotic use in older patients (65 years of age or older) for recommendations concerning indications for antipsychotics, choice of antipsychotics for different conditions (e.g., delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic mood disorders) and for patients with comorbid conditions or history of side effects, dosing strategies, duration of treatment, and medication combinations.

Method

Based on a literature review, a 47-question survey with 1,411 options was developed. Approximately three quarters of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions. For other options, experts were asked to write in answers. The survey was sent to 52 American experts on treatment of older adults (38 geriatric psychiatrists, 14 geriatric internists/family physicians), 48 (92%) of whom completed it. In analyzing responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus was defined as a nonrandom distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred, second line/alternate, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. Guidelines indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

Results

The expert panel reached consensus on 78% of options rated on the 9-point scale. The experts did not recommend using antipsychotics in panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, nonpsychotic major depression, hypochondriasis, neuropathic pain, severe nausea, motion sickness, or irritability, hostility, and sleep disturbance in the absence of a major psychiatric syndrome. However, antipsychotics were favored in several other disorders. For agitated dementia with delusions, the experts' first-line recommendation is an antipsychotic drug alone; they would also consider adding a mood stabilizer. Risperidone (0.5–2.0 mg/day) was first line followed by quetiapine (50–150 mg/day) and olanzapine (5.0–7.5 mg/day) as high second-line options. There was no first-line recommendation for agitated dementia without delusions; an antipsychotic alone was high second line (rated first line by 60% of the experts). The experts'first-line recommendation for late-life schizophrenia was risperidone (1.25–3.5 mg/day). Quetiapine (100–300 mg/day), olanzapine (7.5–15 mg/day), and aripiprazole (15–30 mg/day) were high second line. For older patients with delusional disorder, an antipsychotic was the only treatment recommended. For agitated nonpsychotic major depression in an older patient, the experts' first-line recommendation was an antidepressant alone (77% first line); second-line options were an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine, and an antidepressant plus a mood stabilizer. For nonpsychotic major depression with severe anxiety, the experts recommended an antidepressant alone (79% first line) and would also consider adding a benzodiazepine or mood stabilizer to the antidepressant. If an older patient with adequate dosages for adequate duration, there was limited support for adding an atypical antipsychotic to the antidepressant (36% first line after two failed antidepressant trials). Treatment of choice for geriatric psychotic major depression was an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant (98% first line), with ECT another first-line option (71% first line). For mild geriatric nonpsychotic mania, the first-line recommendation is a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer alone; the experts would also consider discontinuing an antidepressant if the patient is receiving one. For severe nonpsychotic mania, the experts recommend a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (57%; first line) or a mood stabilizer alone (48%; first line) and would discontinue any antidepressant the patient is receiving. For psychotic mania, treatment of choice is a mood stabilizer plus an antipsychotic (98%; first line). Risperidone (1.25–3.0 mg/day) and olanzapine (5–15 mg/day) were first-line options in combination with a mood stabilizer for mania with psychosis, with quetiapine (50–250 mg/day) high second line. If a patient has responded well, the experts recommended the following duration of treatment before attempting to taper and discontinue the antipsychotic: delirium, 1 week; agitated dementia, taper within 3–6 months to determine the lowest effective maintenance dose; schizophrenia, indefinite treatment at the lowest effective dose; delusional disorder, 6 months-indefinitely at the lowest effective dose; psychotic major depression, 6 months; and mania with psychosis, 3 months. For patients with diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity, the experts would avoid clozapine, olanzapine, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency). Quetiapine is first line for a patient with Parkinson's disease. Clozapine, ziprasidone, and conventional antipsychotics (especially low- and mid-potency) should be avoided in patients with QTc prolongation or congestive heart failure. For patients with cognitive impairment, constipation, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, dyslipidemia, xerophthalmia, and xerostomia, the experts prefer risperidone, with quetiapine high second line. More than a quarter of the experts considered these combinations contraindicated: clozapine + carbamazepine, ziprasidone + tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and a low-potency conventional antipsychotic + fluoxetine. In combining antidepressants and antipsychotics, the experts would be much more cautious with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are more potent inhibitors of the CYP 450 enzymes (i.e., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine) and with nefazodone, TCAs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The experts recommended extra monitoring when combining any antipsychotic with lithium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or valproate (except aripiprazole, risperidone, or a high-potency conventional plus valproate) or with codeine, phenytoin, or tramadol.

Conclusions

The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for common clinical dilemmas in the use of antipsychotics in elderly patients. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities of an individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking SEROQUEL XR.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. SEROQUEL XR is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Association of low-dose quetiapine and diabetes [^3ae06a61]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic medication labeled for treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and as adjunctive treatment in major depression. Its use has increased worldwide, with quetiapine now being the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication among adults aged 20 to 64 years in 10 of 14 countries. In 2010, the 1-year prevalence of quetiapine use among publicly insured adults in the US was as high as 3 users per 100 inhabitants. Furthermore, several drug utilization studies have documented considerable use of quetiapine in conditions other than labeled indications, such as anxiety disorders and insomnia.,

Quetiapine is associated with a moderate risk of metabolic disturbances in comparison with other second-generation antipsychotic medications, and it has been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in both adolescentsand adults. An observational study in new users of quetiapine in relatively low doses (≤ 200mg/d) found significant increases in fasting blood glucose with long-term treatment.

Histaminergic and serotonergic antagonism plays a central role in antipsychotic-induced hyperglycemia, and quetiapine has a considerable affinity for both the H₁- and 5-HT₂C-receptors involved. Antipsychotic medications with high affinity of these receptors, including quetiapine, have also been associated with type 2 diabetes on the basis of adverse drug reaction reports.

As quetiapine occupies H₁- and 5-HT₂C-receptors extensively at low doses, which are typically used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, we hypothesized that even low doses of quetiapine might induce metabolic disturbances leading to type 2 diabetes. An association of type 2 diabetes with low doses of quetiapine would be of particular concern given the widespread use for nonpsychotic conditions, such as insomnia. Our aim was thus to investigate the association between the prescription of low-dose quetiapine and type 2 diabetes in a controlled epidemiological design.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Human Experience

In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.

10.2 Management of Overdosage

Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.

Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management. For the most up-to-date information on the management of Seroquel XR overdosage, contact a certified Regional Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222).

SEROQUEL XR overdose may lead to gastric bezoar formation and appropriate diagnostic imaging is recommended to further guide patient management. Routine gastric lavage may not be effective in the removal of the bezoar due to gum like sticky consistency of the mass. Endoscopic pharmacobezoar removal has been performed successfully.

### Sedation as a side effect of the treatment of mental disorders [^e5a6fef7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Many patients with schizophrenia experience disturbances in their sleep-wake cycle, which may be a result of the disorder itself, of pharmacotherapy, or of a comorbid sleep disorder. These sleep disruptions can seriously impair patients' functioning as well as their quality of life. Therefore, accurate assessment of sleep problems is essential to appropriately treat patients and promote symptomatic remission. The sedative versus therapeutic effects of atypical antipsychotics should be considered in the risk-benefit analysis performed before and while medicating patients.

NA = not applicable.

*Descriptive and initial analyses used t tests for continuous variables and χ² tests for categorical variables. Weight data from 178 patients at baseline and 177 patients at end of study.

Figure 1gives reasons for discontinuation. Adverse events that occurred in more than one case were fatigue, sedation, or tiredness (n = 9; 7 in quetiapine group, 2 in placebo group), dizziness (n = 7; all in quetiapine group), nausea (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), limb weakness (n = 2; both in quetiapine group), and insomnia (n = 2; 1 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group). Three serious adverse events occurred. One patient taking quetiapine was admitted to hospital after impulsive self-laceration following an argument with a partner, and one assigned to placebo was admitted after a non-fatal overdose of hypnotics during an adjustment reaction to financial difficulties. Both were discontinued. A third patient in the placebo group had transient repetitive imagery for three days and was briefly admitted for observation, but continued. The rate of discontinuation for both adverse events and serious adverse events was higher for the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than the placebo group (8%; 7/89) (relative risk 2.29, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 5.28; χ² = 3.20, df = 1; P = 0.07).

Other reasons for discontinuation included need for a mood stabiliser (n = 3; 2 in quetiapine group, 1 in placebo group), inability to tolerate the transition protocol (n = 7; 4 in quetiapine group, 3 in placebo group), and unwillingness to attend the study assessments (n = 1; in placebo group). Discontinuation for all causes did not differ significantly between the quetiapine group (31%; 28/89) and the placebo group (20%; 18/89) (relative risk 1.32, 0.98 to 1.77; χ² = 2.38, df = 1; P = 0.12).

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine

The risks of using quetiapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.

Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John's wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

CYP3A4 inhibitors:

Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A4 inducers:

Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5-fold. Increased doses of quetiapine up to 5-fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Anticholinergic Drugs:

Concomitant treatment with quetiapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].

The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Factors that predispose, prime and precipitate NREM parasomnias in adults: clinical and forensic implications [^daa1c626]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Sleepwalking and related disorders are the result of factors that predispose, prime and precipitate episodes. In the absence of one or more of these factors sleepwalking is unlikely to occur. Predisposition to sleepwalking is based on genetic susceptibility and has a familial pattern. Priming factors include conditions and substances that increase slow wave sleep (SWS) or make arousal from sleep more difficult. These factors include sleep deprivation, alcohol, medications, situational stress and fever among others. The patient with a genetic predisposition to sleepwalking and with priming factors still requires a precipitating factor or trigger to set the sleepwalking episode in motion. Classical theories of sleepwalking were based primarily on case reports. Recently some of these theories have been tested in the sleep laboratory. Experimental sleep deprivation studies of sleepwalkers generally report an increase in complex behaviors during SWS, although one prominent study reported the opposite effect. However, the generally accepted theory that alcohol and medications can induce sleepwalking episodes remains entirely based on clinical and forensic case reports. Alleged cases of alcohol related sleepwalking often involve individuals lacking the generally accepted characteristics of sleepwalkers but with very high blood alcohol levels that could in and of itself account for complex behaviors noted without the presence of sleepwalking. Further, the effects of high levels of alcohol dramatically decrease SWS, a finding inconsistent with sleepwalking. Case reports of medication-related induction of apparent sleepwalking most often present a complex medical and psychiatric history associated with multiple medications. These patients often lack the clinical history and other criteria currently required for the diagnosis of sleepwalking. The medication-related behaviors may instead represent some other condition in an awake, but impaired patient. Sleep laboratory research has identified sleep disordered breathing, periodic leg movements, noise and touch among others as proximal triggers of sleepwalking episodes. Treatment of these triggers may result in resolution of sleepwalking without medication. Further sleep laboratory research is needed before experimental findings can be used for routine diagnostic and forensic purposes.

### Patient perspectives of lithium and quetiapine augmentation treatment in treatment-resistant depression: a qualitative assessment [^42274b76]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Managing side effects

Several subjects volunteered information about the action they took to better manage side effects.

Participants talked about the importance of the time they took their quetiapine medication each day:

P: we started taking it earlier and then it would help me sleep and it sort of got to manage that those side effects. (P6)

P: and also like play with what time of the evening is right to take the medication before you go to bed um. because that uh was definitely a balance to strike. (P14)

Several participants taking lithium described efforts to increase water consumption. One recognised that increasing their water intake could reduce the severity of their side effects:

P: I felt like some of the side effects got better because I was actually like staying hydrated and things. (P16)

For another, managing their weight gain enabled them to make positive changes:

P: being on the. quetiapine helps me, like I haven't been – stepped inside a gym or swimming pool for like over seven years so, for me to go swimming and stuff is a – is a big thing so, it's helping me um do that. (P7)

Theme 3: perception of treatment efficacy

Another primary topic of participant discussion surrounded the perceived efficacy of their medication. Participants in this sample reported their experience of both medications as largely positive, with over half of the sample perceiving benefits. However, not all perceived benefits appeared to be of the same magnitude. Some felt their treatment had 'worked' whereas others felt their symptoms had become more manageable upon treatment. Unfortunately, over one-quarter of participants did not report feeling any benefits from their medication.

### Shared EEG correlates between non-REM parasomnia experiences and dreams [^21ac6e3b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sleepwalking (somnambulism) and related parasomnias are enigmatic conditions characterized by sudden but partial awakenings out of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, during which affected individuals may interact with their environment in an altered state of consciousness –. Behaviors during parasomnia episodes can be short and simple, such as sitting up and talking, or more complex, like sustaining a conversation, leaving the bed, or manipulating objects. In extreme cases, sleepwalkers have been reported to drive, commit sexual assault, homicide, and pseudo-suicide, resulting in personal tragedies and legal dilemmas –. Although rare, these instances invariably raise the question of whether sleepwalkers are conscious, and if yes, what they experience during parasomnia episodes.

### PLMD-like nocturnal movements with mirtazapine [^7c79993b]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Mirtazapine is a commonly prescribed antidepressant with sedative properties. We report a case of nocturnal involuntary limb movements developing in an opioid-dependent young man after starting mirtazapine. The involuntary repetitive bilateral leg movements during initial phase of sleep began when mirtazapine was initiated. They continued for 4 days till mirtazapine was stopped and did not recur subsequently. The role of mirtazapine should be considered when a patient on this drug complains of leg movement during early phase of sleep.

### Atypical antipsychotic medication poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^9e1ec9c8]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected acute ingestions of atypical antipsychotic medications by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of an atypical antipsychotic medication might be evaluated, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of atypical antipsychotic medication ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of atypical antipsychotic medications alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or the recipient of a potentially malicious administration of an atypical antipsychotic medication should be referred to an emergency department immediately. This activity should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) Patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation, including determination of the precise dose ingested, presence of signs or symptoms of toxicity, history of other medical conditions, and the presence of co-ingestants (Grade C). 3) Asymptomatic patients without evidence of attempted self-harm are unlikely to develop symptoms if the interval between the ingestion and the call is greater than 6 hours. These patients do not need referral and should receive follow-up based on local poison center protocols (Grade C). 4) All patients less than 12 years of age who are naïve to atypical antipsychotic medications and are experiencing no more than mild drowsiness (lightly sedated and can be aroused with speaking voice or light touch) can be observed at home unless they have ingested more than four times the initial adult dose for the implicated antipsychotic medication or a dose that is equal to or more than the lowest reported acute dose that resulted in at least moderate toxicity, whichever dose is smaller (i.e., aripiprazole 15 mg, clozapine 50 mg, olanzapine 10 mg, quetiapine 100 mg, risperidone 1 mg, ziprasidone 80 mg) (Grade D). 5) All patients 12 years of age or older who are naïve to atypical antipsychotic medications and are experiencing no more than mild drowsiness can be observed at home unless they have ingested more than five times the initial adult dose for the implicated antipsychotic medication (i.e., aripiprazole 50 mg, clozapine 62.5 mg, olanzapine 25 mg, quetiapine 125 mg, risperidone 5 mg, ziprasidone 100 mg) (Grade D). 6) Patients who use atypical antipsychotic medications on a chronic basis can be observed at home unless they have acutely ingested more than 5 times their current single dose (not daily dose) of the implicated antipsychotic medication (Grade C). 7) Patients who have ingested less than a threshold dose (see Recommendations 4–6) and are exhibiting no more than mild drowsiness can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center if symptoms develop or worsen. If mild drowsiness is present at the time of the initial call, the poison center should make follow-up calls until at least 6 hours after ingestion. Consideration should be given to the time of day that home observation will take place. Observation during normal sleep hours might not be reliable. Depending on local poison center policy, patients could be referred to an emergency department if the observation would take place during normal sleeping hours of the patient or caretaker (Grade D). 8) Any patient already experiencing any signs or symptoms, other than mild drowsiness, thought to be related to atypical antipsychotic medication toxicity should be transported to an emergency department. Transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 9) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 10) There are no specific data to suggest benefit from out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal in patients exposed to atypical antipsychotic medications. Poison centers should follow local protocols and experience with the out-of-hospital use of activated charcoal in this context. Do not delay transportation in order to administer charcoal (Grade D). 11) For patients who merit evaluation in an emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be implemented given reports of conduction disturbances associated with this class of medications. Provide usual supportive care en route to the hospital, including airway management and intravenous fluids for hypotension (Grade D). 12) Depending on the specific circumstances, follow-up calls should be made to determine outcome at appropriate intervals based on the clinical judgment of the poison center staff (Grade D).
