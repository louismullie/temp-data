## Question

Fish oil use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fish oil use, including its cardiovascular effects, safety, dosing, and practical recommendations across conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between prescription omega-3s and over-the-counter fish oil. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for cardiovascular outcomes, including meta-analyses and guideline positions. Next, I will examine condition-specific uses where benefits may exist, such as hypertriglyceridemia, inflammatory diseases, and perioperative or dialysis contexts. After that, I need to check safety, drug interactions, and quality concerns. Finally, I will synthesize practical, dose-specific recommendations and highlight what to avoid or monitor closely, anchoring to major guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction, because conflating prescription and supplement products leads to misinterpretation. Prescription omega-3s are FDA-approved drugs, typically ethyl esters of EPA with or without DHA, indicated for very high triglycerides and, in the case of icosapent ethyl, for cardiovascular risk reduction in selected high-risk patients, whereas over-the-counter fish oil supplements are dietary supplements with variable content and no proven cardiovascular outcome benefit at typical doses, and they are not interchangeable with prescription products [^893aeab7] [^d6899f1e] [^9230ec5d].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular outcome data for supplements before drawing conclusions. Large, contemporary randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that supplement-level EPA+DHA does not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in primary or secondary prevention, including VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND, and a 2018 JAMA Cardiology meta-analysis of 77,917 participants found no significant reduction in fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease or major vascular events, with the Cochrane review likewise concluding little to no effect on mortality or cardiovascular events at typical supplement doses [^cfde5d01] [^2076834c] [^4f61e004] [^640b4f52].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all omega-3s. I should confirm the exception. High-dose, purified EPA as icosapent ethyl in REDUCE-IT demonstrated a 25% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and established ASCVD or diabetes, supporting a class I recommendation for this specific indication, and this is a prescription-only strategy at 4 g/day, not achievable with standard supplements [^9230ec5d] [^d6899f1e].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP chronic coronary disease guideline advises against nonprescription fish oil or omega-3 supplements for ASCVD risk reduction, and the 2021 ACC expert consensus similarly states nonprescription products have not shown cardiovascular outcome benefits and are not recommended for ASCVD risk reduction, reinforcing that routine supplement use for heart health is not supported [^3a2f88bc] [^d6899f1e].

> Next, I should review condition-specific benefits where evidence is stronger. For rheumatoid arthritis, meta-analyses and systematic reviews support symptomatic improvements in joint pain and NSAID-sparing effects with fish oil, typically around 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA, though effects are modest and not disease-modifying, and clinical decisions should integrate patient preferences and concomitant therapies [^201129bf] [^03f9331f].

> Let me consider inflammatory bowel disease, because I recall mixed signals. Some reviews suggest potential anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s, but high-quality RCTs have not consistently shown robust clinical benefit for induction or maintenance in Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, so fish oil should not be considered standard therapy here, and any use would be adjunctive at best [^d17163f9].

> I should double-check perioperative and dialysis contexts where niche benefits appear. In patients with newly created arteriovenous grafts, KDOQI suggests oral fish oil may reduce thrombosis and interventions, and in post-cardiac surgery, the OPERA trial showed no reduction in postoperative atrial fibrillation but fewer transfusions with perioperative fish oil, suggesting potential hemostatic or anti-inflammatory effects without clear arrhythmia benefit, so use should be individualized and not routine [^cbf33091] [^5a188cd4].

> Now, I will examine safety and interactions, because patients often ask about bleeding. Clinical trials generally do not show increased clinically significant bleeding with fish oil alone, even with antiplatelet therapy, though theoretical antithrombotic effects exist; case reports describe INR elevation with warfarin when fish oil is added, so monitoring is prudent in anticoagulated patients, and perioperative guidelines advise holding high-dose omega-3s around procedures, even though randomized data have not shown excess surgical bleeding when fish oil is used alone [^75a32a32] [^00bac74c] [^236e5305] [^f43af636].

> But wait, what about atrial fibrillation risk. I should confirm this nuance. Some contemporary trials and meta-analyses signal a possible increase in atrial fibrillation with higher-dose omega-3s, particularly in older adults or those with established CVD, so clinicians should be cautious in patients with AF history or risk factors when considering high-dose regimens, even though the absolute risk appears low and findings are not uniform across studies [^c50022cb] [^4f61e004].

> I need to ensure we address quality and contaminants. Over-the-counter fish oils vary widely in EPA/DHA content and may contain oxidized lipids or environmental contaminants such as mercury and dioxins; selecting products with third-party testing and USP verification mitigates some risks, and patients should be counseled to avoid high-mercury fish and to refrigerate liquids to reduce oxidation and GI tolerability issues [^57b2d25d] [^75a32a32] [^d804e7b7].

> Let me think about dosing and formulation specifics, because misdosing is common. For triglyceride lowering, prescription omega-3s are dosed at 2–4 g/day of EPA+DHA, with greater triglyceride reductions at higher doses, whereas typical supplements contain 300–1,100 mg/day of combined EPA+DHA, insufficient for robust triglyceride effects; for RA symptoms, 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA is the usual range studied, and for general cardiovascular health, if patients cannot eat 1–2 servings/week of fatty fish, 1 g/day of EPA+DHA may be reasonable as a dietary replacement, though outcome benefits are unproven at supplement doses [^dd74501e] [^57b2d25d] [^7edb40eb].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and counseling points. In pregnancy, eating 1–2 servings/week of low-mercury, high-EPA/DHA fish is encouraged for neurodevelopment, but supplements are not a substitute for fish intake and should be used cautiously with attention to quality; in pediatrics, evidence for routine fish oil supplementation is limited outside specific contexts, so decisions should be individualized and guided by a clinician [^7234d81e] [^e483e044].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to avoid overstatement. The weight of evidence shows no cardiovascular outcome benefit for over-the-counter fish oil supplements in primary or secondary prevention, with the notable exception of prescription EPA at 4 g/day in high-risk, hypertriglyceridemic patients; fish oil may help RA symptoms and has a conditional role in select dialysis or perioperative settings, but routine use for heart health is not supported, and clinicians should prioritize diet, exercise, blood pressure control, diabetes management, and guideline-directed medical therapy instead [^3a2f88bc] [^d6899f1e] [^201129bf] [^cbf33091].

> Finally, I should confirm practical recommendations. I would advise patients to obtain omega-3s from fatty fish when possible, avoid high-dose supplements for cardiovascular prevention, reserve prescription EPA for eligible high-risk patients with elevated triglycerides, consider fish oil for RA symptom relief with shared decision-making, screen for drug interactions especially with warfarin, choose high-quality supplements if used, and avoid high-dose omega-3s around surgical procedures or in patients with AF risk factors, aligning with contemporary cardiology and rheumatology guidance [^3a2f88bc] [^d6899f1e] [^201129bf] [^236e5305].

Fish oil is **not recommended for routine cardiovascular prevention** because large, high-quality trials show no consistent reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events at supplement doses [^4f61e004] [^2076834c]. It remains **first-line therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia** (≥ 500 mg/dL) and is reasonable for persistent triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL despite statins, with prescription EPA/DHA preferred over OTC products due to purity and dose standardization [^d6899f1e] [^dd74501e]. For rheumatoid arthritis, fish oil can reduce joint pain and NSAID use at 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA, though effects are modest and not disease-modifying [^201129bf] [^03f9331f]. Routine use for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention, atopic dermatitis, or cognitive decline is not supported; safety is generally good, but high-dose EPA may increase atrial fibrillation risk, and patients on anticoagulants should be monitored for bleeding [^3a2f88bc] [^7303c2f1] [^9d35eaa4] [^236e5305].

## Cardiovascular health

### Primary and secondary prevention

- **Large RCTs and meta-analyses**: No consistent reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with fish oil supplements at typical doses (1–2 g/day) in primary or secondary prevention [^4f61e004] [^2076834c].
- **VITAL and ASCEND**: No significant reduction in MACE in primary prevention cohorts [^cfde5d01].
- **OMEMI**: No benefit in elderly post-MI patients [^c50022cb].
- **REDUCE-IT**: High-dose EPA (4 g/day) reduced MACE in high-risk patients with elevated triglycerides, but this is prescription-grade EPA, not standard supplements [^9230ec5d].

---

### Hypertriglyceridemia

Fish oil is **first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia** (≥ 500 mg/dL) to prevent pancreatitis, with prescription EPA/DHA preferred for purity and dose standardization [^d6899f1e] [^dd74501e]. For persistent triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL despite statins, it is reasonable, especially with ASCVD risk factors, again favoring prescription products [^d6899f1e].

---

## Inflammatory conditions

### Rheumatoid arthritis

Meta-analyses show **modest reductions in joint pain, morning stiffness, and NSAID use** at 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA, but effects are not disease-modifying [^201129bf] [^03f9331f].

---

### Inflammatory bowel disease

Evidence is mixed; **some trials suggest anti-inflammatory effects**, but clinical benefits are inconsistent and not sufficient to replace standard therapy [^d17163f9].

---

## Dermatological conditions

For psoriasis, **adjunctive fish oil may modestly improve symptoms** when combined with conventional therapy, but it is not effective as monotherapy [^ad4cf738] [^8dfa1330]. For atopic dermatitis, evidence is insufficient to recommend fish oil [^7303c2f1].

---

## Cognitive function and mental health

Evidence does not support fish oil for **cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease**; large trials show no benefit [^9d35eaa4]. For depression, data are limited and inconsistent, so routine use is not recommended.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **General safety**: Well tolerated at ≤ 3 g/day; GI upset, fishy taste, and rare rash are common.
- **Bleeding risk**: Minimal alone; monitor with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) [^75a32a32] [^236e5305].
- **Atrial fibrillation**: High-dose EPA (≥ 4 g/day) may increase risk, especially in older adults [^c50022cb].
- **Contaminants**: Choose high-quality, third-party tested products to minimize mercury/PCB exposure [^75a32a32].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Condition** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular prevention | Not recommended | High |
| Severe hypertriglyceridemia | Recommended | High |
| Rheumatoid arthritis | Considered | Moderate |
| Psoriasis | Adjunctive only | Moderate |
| Atopic dermatitis | Not recommended | Low |
| Cognitive decline | Not recommended | High |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: Use prescription EPA/DHA (2–4 g/day) for severe elevations or persistent levels despite statins [^d6899f1e] [^dd74501e].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Consider 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA as adjunctive therapy; counsel on modest benefits [^201129bf] [^03f9331f].
- **General use**: Avoid routine use for primary/secondary CVD prevention, atopic dermatitis, or cognitive decline [^3a2f88bc] [^7303c2f1] [^9d35eaa4].
- **Safety**: Monitor for bleeding with anticoagulants; use caution with high-dose EPA in patients with AF risk [^236e5305] [^c50022cb].

---

Fish oil has a **limited, condition-specific role**: it is first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia and can be considered for rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not for routine cardiovascular prevention or other broad indications. Use prescription-grade products when indicated, and monitor for bleeding and atrial fibrillation at higher doses.

### Label statements and perceived health benefits of dietary supplements [^f46e6e1d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Multiple large randomized clinical trials have found that fish oil supplements do not prevent cardiovascular events and are not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite this, nearly 20% of adults in the United States with ASCVD take a fish oil supplement, the majority of whom do so for heart health. Nearly three-quarters of fish oil supplements on the market have at least 1 health-related structure/function claim. Whether and how these statements may influence consumer perceptions regarding the supplement's impact on prevention or treatment of disease remains unclear.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate the degree to which commonly used structure/function claim language related to heart or brain health is associated with potential consumer perceptions regarding supplements using 2 different randomized surveys. In each survey, participants were randomized to see supplement labels that varied only by the presence or absence of a structure/function statement. The first survey used fish oil, as it is among the most commonly used supplements in the United States. In the second, to ensure participants had no prior or outside knowledge about the supplement, we created a hypothetical supplement that is not currently on the market.

### Omega-3 fatty acids: cardiovascular benefits, sources and sustainability [^7edb40eb]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The evidence for the cardioprotective nature of omega-3 fatty acids is abundant, and currently available data indicate that patients with known coronary heart disease should consume at least 1 g daily of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from either oily fish or fish-oil supplements, and that individuals without disease should consume at least 250–500 mg daily. However, this area of research poses two questions. Firstly, which is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids-fish or fish-oil supplements? Secondly, are recommendations for omega-3 supplementation warranted in view of the rapid depletion of world fish stocks? The argument that eating fish is better than taking fish-oil supplements stems from the fact that several important nutrients, such as vitamin D, selenium, and antioxidants, are missing from the supplements. However, three major prevention trials have clearly indicated that omega-3 fatty acid capsules confer cardiovascular benefits and, therefore, that both are cardioprotective. Sustainable sources of omega-3 fatty acids will need to be identified if long-term cardiovascular risk reduction is to be achieved at the population level.

In current practice, dietary interventions and over-the-counter dietary supplements, including fish oil, vitamins, and others, comprise a significant proportion of alternate therapy use. The aim of this article is to clarify the appropriate place for the use of fish oil in rheumatologic practice amid the complexities of modern management.

### Fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular disease: do they really work? [^cadeee80]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found abundantly in fish oil, exert pleiotropic cardiometabolic effects with a diverse range of actions. The results of previous studies raised a lot of interest in the role of fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The present review will focus on the current clinical uses of omega-3 fatty acids and provide an update on their effects. Since recently published trials in patients with coronary artery diseases or post-myocardial infarction did not show an effect of omega-3 fatty acids on major cardiovascular endpoints, this review will examine the limitations of those data and suggest recommendations for the use of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Fish oil and cardiometabolic diseases: recent updates and controversies [^9230ec5d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids derived from fish oil are long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The important polyunsaturated fatty acids of fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. For decades, there has been a debate about the use of omega-3 fatty acids and their benefits on cardiovascular health. The more recent trials including the JELIS, VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND trials, addressed the paucity of data of omega-3 fatty acids on primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and the risk-benefit balance of these supplements. Prior to these studies, many large randomized controlled trials have shown conflicting results on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with prior coronary artery disease, stroke, or major vascular events. These inconsistent results warrant a better understanding of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the subtypes of cardiovascular diseases, and their use in primary and secondary prevention. More recently, icosapent ethyl showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic events in patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The REDUCE-IT trial paved the way to further reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with high TG despite being on a maximally tolerated statin. The aim of this review is to discuss these recent updates on the use of various forms of fish oil, including prescription form and supplement in cardiometabolic diseases, and their surrounding controversies.

### Health claims and doses of fish oil supplements in the US [^57b2d25d]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

One in 5 US adults older than 60 years takes fish oil supplements often for heart health despite multiple randomized clinical trials showing no data for cardiovascular benefit for supplement-range doses. Statements on the supplement labels may influence consumer beliefs about health benefits.

Objectives

To evaluate health claims made on the labels of fish oil supplements in the US, and to examine doses of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in commonly available formulations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from labels of on-market fish oil (and nonfish ω-3 fatty acid) supplements obtained from the National Institutes of Health Dietary Supplement Label Database. The study was conducted and data analyzed from February to June 2022.

Main Outcome and Measures

The frequency and types of health claims made on fish oil labels (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-reviewed qualified health claim vs a structure/function claim) and the organ system referenced were evaluated. The total daily doses of combined EPA and DHA (EPA+DHA) were assessed for supplements from 16 leading manufacturers and retailers.

Results

Across 2819 unique fish oil supplements, 2082 (73.9%) made at least 1 health claim. Of these, only 399 (19.2%) used an FDA-approved qualified health claim; the rest (1683 [80.8%]) made only structure/function claims (eg, "promotes heart health"). Cardiovascular health claims were the most common (1747 [62.0%]). Across 16 leading brands/manufacturers, 255 fish oil supplements were identified. Among these, substantial variability was found in the daily dose of EPA (median [IQR], 340 [135–647] mg/d), DHA (median [IQR], 270 [140–500] mg/d), and total EPA+DHA (median [IQR], 600 [300–1100] mg/d). Only 24 of 255 supplements (9.4%) evaluated contained a daily dose of 2 g or more EPA+DHA.

Conclusions

Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the majority of fish oil supplement labels make health claims, usually in the form of structure/function claims, that imply a health benefit across a variety of organ systems despite a lack of trial data showing efficacy. Significant heterogeneity exists in the daily dose of EPA+DHA in available supplements, leading to potential variability in safety and efficacy between supplements. Increasing regulation of dietary supplement labeling may be needed to prevent consumer misinformation.

### Safety considerations with omega-3 fatty acid therapy [^75a32a32]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the potential antithrombotic effect of fish oils may theoretically increase the risk for bleeding, which may be a safety concern for individual patients. However, clinical trial evidence has not supported increased bleeding with omega-3 fatty acid intake, even when combined with other agents that might also increase bleeding (such as aspirin and warfarin). Another potential safety concern is the susceptibility of omega-3 fatty acid preparations to undergo oxidation, which contributes to patient intolerance and potential toxicity. Finally, large amounts of fish consumption may result in adverse experiences due to the potential presence of environmental toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and other contaminants. The risks of exposure to environmental toxins and hypervitaminosis with fish consumption are substantially reduced through purification processes used to develop selected concentrated fish oil supplements and prescription preparations. Thus, in choosing which fish oil therapies to recommend, clinicians should be aware of available information to best assess their relative safety, which includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advisory statement regarding fish consumption, the meaning of certain labeling (such as "verification" through the US Pharmacopeia) and the differences in FDA regulatory requirements between nonprescription fish oil supplements and prescription fish oil preparations, and how all of this is important to the optimal treatment of patients.

### What is the evidence for a role for diet and nutrition in osteoarthritis? [^cea863ff]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

EPA/DHA supplementation

The use of fish oils has shown clinical efficacy for pain reduction in RA, but published trials of LC n -3 fatty acid supplementation in OA are limited. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there was no statistically significant effect of marine oil supplements for OA pain (five trials; −0.17; 95% CI: −0.57, 0.24). However the quality of the trials included was graded as 'very low', and the results for the OA group were highly heterogeneous leading the authors to state that the evidence was not sufficiently robust to determine the effect of marine oil in patients with diagnoses other than RA. Hill and colleagues conducted a double-blind 2-year RCT in 202 knee-OA patients. There was no placebo group, attributed to efforts to maintain blinding and for ethical reasons. Unexpectedly, greater benefits to WOMAC pain and function scores were found from a low-dose (0.45 g LC n -3) fish oil supplement than from a high, anti-inflammatory dose (4.5 g LC n -3). The authors concluded that there was no additional benefit of high-dose over low-dose fish oil in knee OA. The low-dose supplement comparator was composed largely of Sunola oil, a monounsaturated n -9 fatty acid. Unlike olive oil, it is not rich in polyphenols with known antioxidant and potentially anti-inflammatory effects. However, there may have been benefit to pain from the high oleic acid content, which may have effectively constituted a second active intervention.

Conclusions on importance of PUFAs in OA

Adding complexity to supplementation trials, the effects of fish oil can be affected by polymorphisms that alter the expression of cytokine genes and it is difficult to find an appropriate placebo oil. Though further studies with appropriate controls are needed, there may be efficacy for pain reduction with a low-dose supplement equivalent to 1.5 standard capsules of 1 g fish oil/day. Moreover, there is evidence for fish oil being of benefit to cardiovascular health, which may be relevant to this population owing to the association of OA with MetS. Recommendations are summarized in Table 3.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^640b4f52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Whether marine or long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation has significant benefits in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the subject of intense debate. Despite consistent findings from observational studies showing inverse associations between higher fish consumption and lower risk of heart disease, 1, 2 recent evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing marine omega‐3 supplementation, usually a moderate‐dose combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid compared with placebo, have had largely null results. 3, 4 Although the American Heart Association continues to recommend marine omega‐3 supplementation for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease to reduce mortality, it found insufficient evidence for use in prevention among patients at high CVD risk but without CVD. 5 A recent meta‐analysis synthesizing study‐level data from 10 midsize‐to‐large RCTs with at least 1 year of follow‐up reported no significant favorable effects of marine omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation on fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or any major vascular events. 6 Another expanded meta‐analysis including smaller trials and dietary intervention trials reached the same conclusions. 7 Inconsistent findings between observational studies and RCTs cast doubt on a causal relationship between fish oil supplements and CVD prevention. 8

### Marine polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer therapy [^1edc404a]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from marine sources, including EPA and DHA, are widely consumed as supplements within the community, including cancer patients. The prescription of n-3 LCPUFAs in a therapeutic context is also increasing in patients receiving treatment for a range of cancer types. There is also now sufficient literature to suggest that the use of supplements containing EPA and DHA may have potential as an effective adjuvant to chemotherapy treatment and may help ameliorate some of the secondary complications associated with cancer. Although this review was not exhaustive, our investigations indicate that supplementation with fish oil (> 3 g per day) or EPA/DHA (> 1 g EPA and > 0.8 g DHA per day) is associated with positive clinical outcomes. However, other components of fish oil may be detrimental to cancer treatment, and further research is still required to determine the mechanisms by which both marine-derived n-3 PUFAs and other fish-oil derived compounds are mediating their effects.

### Marine polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer therapy [^5b68eea8]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from marine sources, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are widely consumed as supplements within the community. However, the use of marine PUFAs in a therapeutic context is also increasing in patients receiving treatment for a range of cancer types. On balance, the literature suggests that marine PUFAs have potential as an effective adjuvant to chemotherapy treatment, may have direct anticancer effects, and may help ameliorate some of the secondary complications associated with cancer. Although a range of doses have been trialled, it would appear that supplementation of fish oil (> 3 g per day) or EPA/DHA (> 1 g EPA and > 0.8 g DHA per day) is associated with positive clinical outcomes. However, further research is still required to determine the mechanisms via which marine PUFAs are mediating their effects. This review summarises our current understanding of marine PUFAs and cancer therapy.

Survey 1: Fish Oil

We created a label for a hypothetical fish oil supplement called "Nature's Fish Omega-3 Fish Oil". This supplement was chosen given its pervasive use and numerous negative randomized clinical trials indicating no cardiovascular benefit, with few exceptions. The label was designed to emulate current on-market fish oil labels. Four different versions of the same label were created that varied only in whether and what type of health claim was made. The first 2 contained different structure/function claims: (1) supports heart health (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) and (2) supports cognitive function (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1) based on prior research on types of structure/function claim for cardiovascular and neurologic systems on fish oil supplements. The third label contained actual FDA-approved qualified health claim (QHC) language for fish oil's possible positive association with coronary heart disease: (3) "may reduce risk of coronary heart disease" (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1) on the front. This label also included the FDA-mandated language qualifying the health claim in smaller font on the back: "supportive, but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease". The fourth label was a control label that had no health claim (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).

Participants were randomized to see only 1 of the 4 different labels to review and then answer questions based on the label information presented about the potential health benefits of the supplement. Participants were asked, "On a scale of 1 to 5, how likely is it that the product may help lower or reduce the risk of any of these health problems" for the following disease states: heart attack, stroke, dementia, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis/low bone density, or cancer. Osteoporosis and cancer were included as negative controls given absence of association or known benefit for prevention or treatment by fish oil. These questions were modeled on a previous supplement survey study conducted by the FDA. The order of the disease states was randomly reshuffled between respondents. A 5-point Likert scale was used for respondents to capture the degree of perceived likelihood from 1 (not at all likely) to 5 (very likely). All questions included an option of "Don't know/prefer not to answer". Among responders, the proportions of responding likely or very likely were calculated for each group and compared with those in the control arm.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation and the prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^dced81dc]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

### Diet and psoriasis, part III: role of nutritional supplements [^25c88492]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with psoriasis are increasingly turning to the use of alternative and complementary medicine to manage their psoriasis. Patients often inquire about what dietary supplements may be beneficial, including the use of oral vitamin D, vitamin B12, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids in fish oils. In this review we examine the extent to which each of these common nutritional interventions has been studied for the treatment of psoriasis. We weighed evidence from both controlled and uncontrolled prospective trials. The evidence of benefit was highest for fish oils. For other supplements, there is need for additional large, randomized clinical trials to establish evidence of efficacy.

### Essential fatty acids and their derivatives [^564b566b]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will address recent research in metabolism of essential fatty acids and their long chain derivatives. Our main focus will be the association between essential fatty acid status and various disease states, as well as the effects of supplementation with essential fatty acids or their derivatives on a number of clinical outcomes.

Recent Findings

There have been several papers over the last few years that show links between supplementation with fish oil (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) and cardiovascular disease. Recent data suggest that the use of fish oil (containing n-3 fatty acids) in a variety of disorders such as cystic fibrosis, coronary disease and in the prevention of sudden death is beneficial. Several papers show reductions in systemic markers of inflammation. More widespread use of essential fatty acid derivatives in infant formula can certainly be questioned on the basis of the recent data. Fewer benefits are seen with ingestion of the essential fatty acids themselves, likely related to limited conversion to their long chain derivatives in humans.

Summary

Derivatives of essential fatty acids have the potential to modify a number of disease states, either ingested in greater quantities in the diet, or taken as supplements in the form of fish oil.

Fish Oil Survey Results

eTable 3 in Supplement 1 shows participant responses regarding familiarity with and perceptions about fish oil prior to being shown the fish oil label. Most participants reported some familiarity with fish oil, with 956 (42.0%) reporting being somewhat familiar and 867 (38.1%) very familiar with fish oil. Among the 1823 respondents who were somewhat or very familiar with fish oil, 1456 (78.8%) reported that they were aware of a health benefit. Fish oil users had much higher rates of reporting awareness of health benefits of fish oil (747 of 941 [93.7%] vs 696 of 1296 [68.2%]; P < .001) than nonusers even before seeing the label (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^13e14f5f]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The potential for undesirable anticoagulant effects with the concurrent use of fish oil and anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications have previously been highlighted. It is speculated that older adults in particular may have an increased risk of major bleeding due to increased sensitivity to anticoagulation, multiple comorbidites and polypharmacy. However, evaluation of the evidence concerning the safety considerations associated with n-3 supplementation shows little support of an increase risk in bleeding with n-3 intake, even when concurrently administered with anticoagulant agents. Despite this Bays 2007 suggested it would be prudent to discontinue high doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation in the days prior to invasive surgical procedures or in patients at high risk for haemorrhagic stroke. Expert opinion by Harris 2007 was also in agreement suggesting that n-3 fatty acid supplementation does not increase the risk for clinically significant bleeding with the proposed cardiovascular benefits outweighing the theoretical risks for increased bleeding. In the present review only four of ten studies excluded participants at study entry medicated with oral anticoagulant or antiplatelets despite the theoretical potential for anticoagulation of n-3 fatty acids. Regardless of the previous speculation, current evidence has shown that n-3 supplementation at doses ≤ 4 g per day, even when concurrently administered with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, are safe for general consumption. However, the doses of n-3 fatty acids in the present review were considerably smaller compared with those previously reported suggesting caution may need to be applied when administering higher doses until further evidence is obtained. Although the majority of studies in the present review (8/10 studies) indicated compliance toward the n-3 intervention, a dose–response relationship between n-3 intake and the potential for AE is unclear given the uncertainty associated with the exact quantity of EPA/DHA ingested in the majority of studies.

### Use of dietary supplements among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the United States: a population-based analysis from NHANES [^21cd7e43]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The use of dietary supplements is increasing nationally in the United States. Among all US adults, dietary supplement use increased from 48.4% to 56.1% from 2007 to 2008 through 2017 to 2018. The most common supplements used in the United States are multivitamins, vitamin D, and fish oil/omega‐3 fatty acids. While supplement users most often take supplements to "improve/maintain overall health", "heart health" is a leading reason for supplement use.

Despite widespread use of supplements for "heart health", the evidence supporting dietary supplements for preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or improving cardiovascular outcomes in established ASCVD is quite limited. Large randomized clinical trials of multivitamins, vitamin D, and fish oil supplements have all failed to show benefits to prevent ASCVD. Reflecting this lack of evidence, guidelines for management of patients with ASCVD including chronic coronary heart disease or prior stroke do not include any recommendations for dietary supplements.

To date, relatively little is known about contemporary patterns of supplement use in people with ASCVD or reasons for their use. To address this, we used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to (1) describe contemporary overall use of dietary supplements in patients with ASCVD, (2) compare characteristics of supplement users and nonusers, and (3) assess the individuals' reasons for their use of supplements.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^628ee7c8]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence for benefits of long chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in pathological inflammation including rheumatoid arthritis, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular events and cancer cachexia. For this reason, various organizations around the world have established dietary recommendations and guidelines for the intake of n-3 fatty acids (in particular for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) that are focused primarily on the reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In Australia and New Zealand, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) suggest a dietary target for the reduction of chronic disease of 610 and 430 mg/day DHA + EPA for males and females respectively. For the prevention of CVD, the National Heart Foundation (NHF) of Australia recommends a dietary intake of 500 mg/day EPA + DHA, the equivalent of two to three servings (150 grams) of oily fish per week. For adults with diagnosed CVD, a combined dosage of 1000 mg EPA + DHA per day is recommended which is best achieved by fish oil supplementation.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^53c98755]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The potential for AEs related to n-3 supplementation in older adults appear mild-moderate at worst, and not of clinical importance. No reports of SAE including bleeding, stroke or bruising were observed. Non-SAE related to GI disturbances were the most commonly reported however these were infrequent and not significantly different when compared against the placebo group. However this review also highlights that well-documented data describing the potential for SAE following n-3 supplementation are limited nor adequately reported to draw definitive conclusions concerning the safety associated with n-3 supplementation. Although these results suggest that a low-moderate intake of EPA/DHA appear safe and acceptable for use in otherwise healthy older adults, caution should be applied when administering larger doses until further evidence is positioned. Our review further highlights that a more rigorous and systematic approach for monitoring and recording AE data in clinical settings that involve the use n-3 supplementation is required.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^9e67636d]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid supplementation is becoming increasingly popular. However given its antithrombotic properties the potential for severe adverse events (SAE) such as bleeding has safety implications, particularly in an older adult population. A systematic review of randomized control trials (RCT) was conducted to explore the potential for SAE and non-severe adverse events (non-SAE) associated with n-3 supplementation in older adults.

Methods

A comprehensive search strategy using Medline and a variety of other electronic sources was conducted. Studies investigating the oral administration of n-3 fish oil containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or both against a placebo were sourced. The primary outcome of interest included reported SAE associated with n-3 supplementation. Chi-square analyses were conducted on the pooled aggregate of AEs.

Results

Of the 398 citations initially retrieved, a total of 10 studies involving 994 older adults aged ≥ 60 years were included in the review. Daily fish oil doses ranged from 0.03 g to 1.86 g EPA and/or DHA with study durations ranging from 6 to 52 weeks. No SAE were reported and there were no significant differences in the total AE rate between groups (n-3 intervention group: 53/540; 9.8%; placebo group: 28/454; 6.2%; p = 0.07). Non-SAE relating to gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances were the most commonly reported however there was no significant increase in the proportion of GI disturbances reported in participants randomized to the n-3 intervention (n-3 intervention group: 42/540 (7.8%); placebo group: 24/454 (5.3%); p = 0.18).

Conclusions

The potential for AEs appear mild-moderate at worst and are unlikely to be of clinical significance. The use of n-3 fatty acids and the potential for SAE should however be further researched to investigate whether this evidence is consistent at higher doses and in other populations. These results also highlight that well-documented data outlining the potential for SAE following n-3 supplementation are limited nor adequately reported to draw definitive conclusions concerning the safety associated with n-3 supplementation. A more rigorous and systematic approach for monitoring and recording AE data in clinical settings that involve n-3 supplementation is required.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^03f9331f]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Fish oil comes from various species, including mackerel, herring, tuna, halibut, salmon, cod liver, and whale and seal blubber. Thus, these types of fish are dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids, also known as n-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential dietary ingredients and include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oil supplements contain varying amounts of EPA and DHA (18–51% and 12–32%, respectively). Although ALA is mainly found in green vegetables, canola oil, and soybeans, EPA and DHA almost exclusively come from fish oil and other seafood. ALA, EPA, and DHA are types of omega-3 fatty acids but may serve different functional roles and should subsequently not be considered interchangeable. Although proprietary prescription fish oil is FDA-approved to lower levels of triglycerides, nonprescription formulations of fish oil are also used for other conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome, cognitive function/impairment, and MSK (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, muscle strength, muscle soreness, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, migraines) issues.

The authors relied upon evidence on PUFA for chronic pain presented in Prego-Dominguez et al.'s 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis. The majority of examined studies compared various combinations of PUFA with placebo or other comparators for pain reduction in rheumatoid arthritis patients, with doses ranging from 300 to 9,600 mg for anywhere from four to 48 weeks (Table 2; Supplementary Data: Summary Report).

Conditional recommendations were made (50% weak; 50% strong, in favor) for the use of PUFA supplementation for pain and related symptoms, incorporated into the daily diet at 1,200 mg/d, and not to exceed 2 g/d. Whereas the undesirable effects appear to be small to trivial at low doses, > 3 g/d is likely to increase the potential for adverse events (e.g. inhibition of platelet aggregation, risk of bleeding, and potentially hemorrhagic stroke at very high doses) (Supplementary Data: Summary Report).

### Use of dietary supplements among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the United States: a population-based analysis from NHANES [^a3f8e18d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Supplement use is more common in adults with ASCVD than has previously been reported in the general population. While 56% of people overall use supplements, our study found that 73% of those with ASCVD used at least 1 dietary supplement. Nearly half of those on a supplement (47.3%) reported taking one under the advisement of a physician or health professional. While reasons for supplement use vary by type of supplement, nearly 1 in 5 individuals with ASCVD takes at least 1 supplement for the reported purpose of "heart health", most often fish oil followed by coenzyme Q10 and resveratrol, none of which have been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in persons with ASCVD.

Despite widespread belief of a "heart health" benefit, no large randomized trial has shown that supplement doses of fish oil lower cardiovascular events in patients with established ASCVD, and large trials of fish oil in primary prevention have shown no benefit. Some mainstream beliefs regarding fish oil and possible heart health benefit may stem from recent clinical trials on prescription‐level doses of omega‐3 fatty acids, but these also have mixed results. REDUCE‐IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) compared high‐dose eicosapentaenoic acid with mineral oil and found a significant reduction in cardiovascular events in the eicosapentaenoic acid group. In contrast, the STRENGTH (Long‐Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk With Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients With Hypertriglyceridemia) trial found no benefit to high‐dose eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid when compared with a corn oil placebo. Importantly, the dose of eicosapentaenoic acid tested in REDUCE‐IT, 4 g/d, is significantly higher than what is available for the majority of over‐the‐counter fish oil supplements. There is a guideline recommendation for fish oil supplements for people with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction based on the GISSI‐HF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico ‐ Heart failure) trial from 2008, but this is not applicable for the majority of the US population. Nevertheless, many patients with ASCVD taking fish oil supplements do so "for heart health".

### Omega-3 dietary supplements and the risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review [^e3a4b449]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil reduce cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of dietary fish oil supplementation in preventing cardiovascular events in both high and low risk patients is unclear.

Objective

To assess whether dietary supplements of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decrease cardiovascular events across a spectrum of patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Study Selection

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated clinical cardiovascular end points (cardiovascular death, sudden death, and nonfatal cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to EPA/DHA or placebo. We only included studies that used dietary supplements of EPA/DHA which were administered for at least 1 year.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study design, study size, type and dose of omega-3 supplement, cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and duration of follow-up. Studies were grouped according to the risk of cardiovascular events (high risk and moderate risk). Meta-analytic techniques were used to analyze the data.

Data Synthesis

We identified 11 studies that included a total of 39 044 patients. The studies included patients after recent myocardial infarction, those with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and patients with heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypercholesterolemia. The average dose of EPA/DHA was 1.8 ± 1.2 g/day and the mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 ± 1.2 years. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular deaths (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.95, p = 0.002), sudden cardiac death (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99, p = 0.04), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02), and nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02). The mortality benefit was largely due to the studies which enrolled high risk patients, while the reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events was noted in the moderate risk patients (secondary prevention only). Meta-regression failed to demonstrate a relationship between the daily dose of omega-3 fatty acid and clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Dietary supplements for established atopic eczema [^012caeae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many people with atopic eczema are reluctant to use the most commonly recommended treatments because they fear the long-term health effects. As a result, many turn to dietary supplements as a possible treatment approach, often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in their diet. Various supplements have been proposed, but it is unclear whether any of these interventions are effective.

Objectives

To evaluate dietary supplements for treating established atopic eczema/dermatitis. Evening primrose oil, borage oil, and probiotics are covered in other Cochrane reviews.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), ISI Web of Science, GREAT (Global Resource of EczemA Trials) database, and reference lists of articles. We searched ongoing trials registers up to April 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary supplements for the treatment of those with established atopic eczema/dermatitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, read the full text of the publications, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for clinical practice at present. Whilst some may argue that at least supplements do not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up.

### Dietary supplement and complementary and alternative medicine use among older adults in Australia and the United States [^c6f0ca8d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of multivitamins in US participants in this study was notably high at 46.9% which is similar to a rate of 57.7% reported previously based on 2013–2014 survey data in US adults 50 years and older. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated no benefit in overall mortality or for specific morbidities with use of multivitamins, and health experts have consistently highlighted the lack of proven benefit when multivitamins are taken in addition to, or in place of, a healthy diet. – Recently, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a statement concluding that current evidence is insufficient to assess the risk vs benefit of multivitamin use for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer. Multivitamin use is not promoted by any US government agency or any national health organization; however, use rates continue to be high, with an estimated one third of all Americans reporting use of a multivitamin. Fish oil, utilized by one fifth of the participants in this study cohort, has been studied for use in multiple conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer prevention, cognitive function, and ophthalmic conditions. – While evidence demonstrating the benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids in foods is strong, evidence supporting use of fish oil supplements for treatment/prevention of adverse health outcomes is conflicting. Similarly, vitamin D has been investigated in an array of conditions, and while deficiency of vitamin D is often linked to adverse outcomes, supplementation with vitamin D in many cases is not linked to improved outcomes. – Finally, calcium supplementation for prevention of facture is supported by national organizations, however, it is important to note that total calcium intake should not exceed upper limits and this total should include dietary sources. Supplementing with calcium at a level that exceeds the upper recommended intake can lead to adverse effects, such as increased risk for kidney stones. Given sparse and conflicting evidence related to risks versus benefits of supplement/CAM use in older adults, decisions related to use of specific products should ideally be tailored to an individual patient as a result of shared decision making between a patient and their healthcare team.

There is high level evidence (meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials) for symptomatic benefits from fish oil use in rheumatoid arthritis, and there is biologic plausibility for its clinical effects. Fish oil also has safety advantages in reducing cardiovascular risk via direct cardiovascular effects and via nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-sparing. This is an important aspect of fish oil use, given the increased cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis. Perceived barriers to clinical use are readily addressed.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^cfde5d01]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Do supplements protect against non-communicable diseases?

It remains controversial whether supplements are effective in reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases. In contrast to results of observational studies, the accumulated evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support benefits of supplements in reducing risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or type 2 diabetes in healthy people with no clinical nutritional deficiencies.

Cardiovascular disease

An updated systematic review of 15 randomised trials published after the 2013 US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) reviewconfirmed the lack of benefits of supplements on cardiovascular events, mostly among patients with risk factors. Although randomised trials of folic acid, alone or in combination with vitamins B 12 or B 6, found significant reductions in plasma homocysteine levels, total cardiovascular events were not reduced. Another systematic review reported a reduced risk of stroke in association with supplementation of homocysteine lowering B vitamins, but the result was largely driven by one large trial in China. Overall, there is no consistent evidence to support the use of antioxidant supplements for reducing cardiovascular risk.

The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), one of the few randomised trials of supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, found no effect of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day) on its primary endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in healthy people. Previous large scale trials such as the Women's Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation Studyand the Vitamin D Assessment Studyalso showed vitamin D supplements, alone or in combination with calcium, had no effect on cardiovascular risk.

Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day) did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events among healthy people in the VITAL trial. However, benefits were found for some secondary endpoints such as total myocardial infarctions. This result is largely consistent with findings from meta-analyses that fish oil supplementation did not have substantial effects on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, a meta-analysis including the most recent trials reported a significant reduction in risk of myocardial infarction. Further studies are needed to determine whether fish oil supplementation has a greater effect on risk of heart disease than of stroke.

Fish oil supplementation and childhood allergy — A Cochrane systematic review analyzed data from 8 randomized controlled trials of pre- and postnatal fish oil supplementation for effects on childhood allergy and found that among children born to women who consumed fish oil supplements, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy was less likely in children younger than 1 year (RR 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.95), and any IgE-mediated allergy was less likely in children 12 to 36 months of age (RR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.98); no benefit was observed for eczema, allergic rhinitis, or asthma between birth and 3 years of age, and findings did not differ based on maternal history of asthma or prenatal or postnatal supplementation of the mother. Since that review, 2 randomized trials have been published, including a trial that randomly assigned 533 women after 30 weeks' gestation to fish oil, olive oil, or no oil, in which at 24 years' follow-up adolescents born to mothers who received supplementation were less likely to need medications for asthma compared with individuals born to mothers who received olive oil supplements (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.90). Safety and implementation notes include that fish oil supplements may carry risks such as elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, studies tend to use high doses of n-3 LCPUFAs which may not be well tolerated by children, and in 75 pediatric fish oil supplement studies dropout rates were 17% and adherence rates 85%.

### Use of dietary supplements among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the United States: a population-based analysis from NHANES [^5b149161]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Fish oil was the most common supplement taken "for heart health". Characteristics of people with ASCVD taking fish oil versus those not taking fish oil are presented in Table 2. Generally, similar trends were seen for fish oil users compared with nonusers as were seen for supplements overall. Those taking fish oil were older (P = 0.001), included more White individuals (P = 0.006), had higher education (P = 0.018) and income (P < 0.001) levels, and were less likely to smoke (P = 0.001). Fish oil users were also more likely to take any form of prescription medication (97.6% versus 91.3%; P = 0.017), including statins (P = 0.014) and antihyperlipidemic therapy. No difference was seen in blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or total cholesterol levels in fish oil users versus nonusers. However, fish oil users had lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (85.1 versus 99.7 mg/dL; P = 0.020) than those not taking any fish oil supplements.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^5d9023f7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega-3 PUFA and plant oils in omega-6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA-rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed-effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate-quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) andstroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low-quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake slightly reduces total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants) and probably slightly decreases triglycerides (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably causes slight weight gain (MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on serious adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via lipid reduction, but increasing PUFA probably slightly increases weight.

### Increased plasma levels of chemoresistance-inducing fatty acid 16: 4 (n-3) after consumption of fish and fish oil [^91aeba86]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Our research group previously identified specific endogenous platinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs) that, in picomolar quantities, activate splenic macrophages leading to resistance to chemotherapy in mouse models. Fish oil was shown to contain the PIFA 16:4(n-3) (hexadeca-4,7,10,13-tetraenoic acid) and when administered to mice neutralized chemotherapy activity.

Objective

Because patients with cancer frequently use fish oil supplements, we set out to determine exposure to 16:4(n-3) after intake of fish or fish oil.

Design, Setting, and Participants

(1) In November 2011, 400 patients with cancer undergoing treatment at the University Medical Center Utrecht were surveyed to determine their use of fish oil supplements; 118 patients responded to the questionnaire (30%); (2) pharmacokinetic analysis of the 16:4(n-3) content of 6 fish oils and 4 fishes was carried out; (3) from April through November 2012, a healthy volunteer study was performed to determine 16:4(n-3) plasma levels after intake of 3 different brands of fish oil or 4 different fish species. Thirty healthy volunteers were randomly selected for the fish oil study; 20 were randomly selected for the fish study. These studies were supported by preclinical tumor experiments in mice to determine chemoresistance conducted between September 2011 and December 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

(1) Rate of use of fish oil supplements among patients undergoing cancer treatment at our institution; (2) levels of 16:4(n-3) present in 3 brands of fish oil and 4 species of fish; and (3) plasma levels of 16:4(n-3) present in healthy volunteers after consuming fish oil or fish.

Results

Eleven percent of respondents reported using omega-3 supplements. All fish oils tested contained relevant amounts of 16:4(n-3), from 0.2 to 5.7 µM. Mouse experiments showed that addition of 1 µL of fish oil to cisplatin was sufficient to induce chemoresistance, treatment having no impact on the growth rate of tumors compared with vehicle-treated controls (estimated tumor volume difference, 44.1 mm3; P > .99). When the recommended daily amount of 10 mL of fish oil was administered to healthy volunteers, rises in plasma 16:4(n-3) levels were observed, reaching up to 20 times the baseline levels. Herring and mackerel contained high levels of 16:4(n-3) in contrast to salmon and tuna. Consumption of fish with high levels of 16:4(n-3) also resulted in elevated plasma levels of 16:4(n-3).

Conclusions and Relevance

All tested fish oils and herring and mackerel fishes contained relevant levels of fatty acid 16:4(n-3), a fatty acid with chemotherapy-negating effects in preclinical models. After ingestion of these fish oils or fishes, 16:4(n-3) was rapidly taken up in the plasma of human volunteers. Until further data become available, fish oil and fish containing high levels of 16:4(n-3) may best be avoided on the days surrounding chemotherapy.

### Complementary and alternative medications in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^d17163f9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids)

Omega-3-fatty acids (n-3), which are part of a large family of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), are involved in the regulation of a number of body functions, including inflammation, blood pressure, coagulation, and neurological function. They consist of lipids with two or more double bonds and are considered essential nutrients, as they are unable to be produced endogenously by the body. They are found in a variety of food sources, including seeds, nuts, and fish, with the two most potent being eicosapentaaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-3-fatty acids are typically marketed and consumed as fish-oil supplements.

Pathophysiology

There has been increased interest in omega-3-fatty acids due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Evidence from murine models have demonstrated a relationship with omega-3 levels and modulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. Several human studies have also shown that increased consumption of omega-3-fatty acids reduces the production of the eicosanoid inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes), leading to shift to an anti-inflammatory profile. They also have been demonstrated to decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, and the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells. Several clinical trials have reported beneficial effects of increased omega-3-fatty acids in coronary artery disease, obesity, and rheumatic disorders. –

### Highlights in ASCVD primary prevention for 2021 [^c50022cb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

OMEGA‐3 FATTY ACIDS

Recent randomized trials have not supported routine fish oil supplementation to improve cardiovascular health, but the REDUCE‐IT trial reported a few years ago that intake of high dose purified EPA without DHA significantly lowered ASCVD risk. Over the past year, 2 additional studies provided insight into the relationship between omega‐3 fatty acids and ASCVD risk. While these reports included patients with established ASCVD, they were included in this review given that adults commonly use over‐the‐counter fish oil for cardiovascular prevention.

The OMEMI (Omega‐3 Fatty acids in Elderly with Myocardial Infarction) trial was a multi‐center, randomized trial of 1014 elderly men and women who had suffered an MI in the past 2 to 8 weeks. Participants were randomized to omega 3 fatty acids (1.8 g daily–930 mg EPA/660 mg DHA) versus a placebo (corn oil). The primary outcome was recurrent non‐fatal MI, unscheduled revascularization, heart failure hospitalization, stroke, and all‐cause death. Over 2 years of follow‐up there were 210 total primary events with no reduction in those randomized to omega 3 fatty acid supplementation versus placebo (HR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.82–1.41]; P ‐value 0.60). As seen in other studies in this area, there was a trend toward an increase in the secondary outcome of new atrial fibrillation (P ‐value 0.06) with omega 3 supplementation. The results of this study provide further support to the lack of benefit of routine supplementation of omega 3 fatty acids for the primary or secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Key Points

Question

Does supplementation with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids have any associations with reductions in fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease?

Findings

This meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 participants demonstrated that supplementation with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids for a mean of 4.4 years had no significant association with reductions in fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease or any major vascular events.

Meaning

The results provide no support for current recommendations to use omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of fatal coronary heart disease or any cardiovascular disease in people who have or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiovascular impact of nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids: JACC focus seminar [^3748992e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a key component of a heart-healthy diet. For patients without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 2 or more servings of fatty fish per week is recommended to obtain adequate intake of omega-3 PUFAs. If this not possible, dietary supplementation with an appropriate fish oil may be reasonable. Supplementation with omega-3 PUFA capsules serves 2 distinct but overlapping roles: treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and prevention of cardiovascular events. Marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs reduce triglycerides and have pleiotropic effects including decreasing inflammation, improving plaque composition and stability, and altering cellular membranes. Clinical trial data have shown inconsistent results with omega-3 PUFAs improving cardiovascular outcomes. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of PUFAs and a summary of key clinical trial data. Recent trial data suggest the use of prescription eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event reduction in selected populations.

### Fish oil for treatment of dyslipidemia… [^961c7b51]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How effective is fish oil in lowering lipid levels in adults with dyslipidemia. Evidence-Based Answer Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids decreases triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, it can also increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids does not decrease total mortality, cardiovascular events, or cancer incidence, and therefore should not be recommended to patients to decrease their risk of dyslipidemia. Evidence Summary IMPROVEMENTS IN LABORATORY VALUES A Cochrane review of 23 RCTs involving 1, 075 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed that supplementation with fish oil lowered triglyceride levels by 8. 1 mg per dL.

1 In treated patients, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 1. 26 mg per dL, and LDL cholesterol levels increased by

1. 98 mg per dL. There was no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. An earlier Cochrane review of 17 RCTs sought to determine the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on rates of mortality and cardiovascular events. 2 The meta-analysis of studies that included adults at risk of cardiovascular disease found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly reduced serum triglyceride levels. A systematic review of four RCTs concluded that supplementation with two omega-3 fatty acids in doses of 1. 7 g or greater reduced triglyceride levels by at least 10% compared with baseline.

3 Patients with higher baseline triglyceride levels had the greatest benefit.

### N-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease [^66057921]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The results of prospective cohort studies indicate that consuming fish or fish oil containing the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with decreased cardiovascular death, whereas consumption of the vegetable oil-derived n-3 fatty acid a-linolenic acid is not as effective. Randomized control trials (RCTs) in the context of secondary prevention also indicate that the consumption of EPA plus DHA is protective at doses < 1 g/d. The therapeutic effect appears to be due to suppression of fatal arrhythmias rather than stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. At doses > 3 g/d, EPA plus DHA can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including decreasing plasma triacylglycerols, blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and inflammation, while improving vascular reactivity. Mainly on the basis of the results of RCTs, the American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat oily fish twice per week and that those with coronary heart disease eat 1 g/d of EPA plus DHA from oily fish or supplements. Directions for future research include (1) RCTs to confirm the initial trials showing that EPA plus DHA decreases cardiovascular death and additional studies to determine whether this effect is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination; the dosage of the effective components; and whether the mechanism of action in humans is prevention of fatal arrhythmias. (2) Clinical studies to determine whether the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination and the dosage of the effective components. (3) Clinical studies to determine whether vegetable oil-derived alpha-linolenic acid added to a diet enriched in n-6 fatty acids can effectively substitute for fish oil-derived EPA plus DHA.

### Comparing patients' prescribed, self-reported, and actual intake of supplemental eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid [^23943223]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary fish oil supplements containing the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are frequently used for cardiovascular benefit. However, several factors may limit the intake of prescribed doses.

Objective

The objective of this study is to compare the prescribed, patient self-reported, and actual intake of supplemental EPA + DHA doses in a lipid-specialty clinic and identify common barriers and influences to therapy.

Methods

Seventy-six patients prescribed supplemental fish oil were randomly selected to participate in a 28-item cross-sectional survey for evaluating patient knowledge and intake of prescribed supplemental EPA + DHA doses. Self-reported data were collected during a follow-up clinic visit, whereas actual intake was determined when patients had access to their fish oil bottle. These data were compared with their chart-documented prescribed EPA + DHA dose.

Results

Many patients were well-educated and had attended the lipid-specialty clinic for approximately 2 years but only 28.9% were confident that they could accurately recall their daily EPA + DHA dose. There were statistically significant differences between the prescribed doses and patients' self-reported doses (3600 mg vs 2750 mg, P = 0.014), as well as between prescribed doses and actual intake (3600 mg vs 1575 mg, P < .001). Patients reported multiple barriers and influences to explain their use of fish oil products.

Conclusion

Most patients using supplemental fish oil in a lipid-specialty clinic were not taking the prescribed amount of EPA + DHA, with many using markedly lower than prescribed doses. This is likely because of several factors including the complexities of supplemental fish oil doses and labeling, product availability, and discount sales. These findings suggest that supplemental fish oil requires continuous education and dosing guidance.

### Commentary on "Fish oil-containing lipid emulsions in adult parenteral nutrition: a review of the evidence" [^e5c51bba]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Abbasoglu et al published a narrative review concerning the use of fish oil–containing lipid emulsions in adult parenteral nutrition (PN). 1 We wholeheartedly agree with the authors when they state that "high‐quality and adequately powered RCTs are necessary" and "well‐conducted meta‐analyses can be key to demonstrating positive or negative effects". However, we disagree with other aspects of their review, particularly assertions of a lack of evidence in favor of using fish oil–containing lipid emulsions rather than more traditional lipid formulations.

The authors mentioned that 4 meta‐analyses show a significant clinical benefit for fish oil–containing lipid emulsions. There are at least 4 additional meta‐analyses that have shown such benefits, 2, 3, 4, 5 so 8 meta‐analyses have results significantly in favor of fish oil in adult PN, but 2 show no significant differences. 6, 7 Both those showing no significant differences included few trials (6 in each case) and very few (< 400) patients. 6, 7 Moreover, when one was updated with additional studies, it found significantly fewer infectious complications and shorter length of hospital stay in patients given fish oil–containing lipid emulsions. 8

Abbasoglu et al stated that "key medical societies are challenged to provide recommendations" for lipid emulsion choice, and that ASPEN. does not recommend one lipid emulsion over another. This is disingenuous, as ASPEN. states, "When these alternative IVFEs (SMOF [soybean oil, MCT, olive oil, and fish oil emulsion], MCT [medium chain triglycerides], OO [olive oil], and FO [fish oil]) become available in the United States, based on expert opinion, we suggest that their use be considered in the critically ill patient who is an appropriate candidate for PN". 9 Moreover, after assessing the evidence base, the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) recommends fish‐oil use in many ICU, surgical, and cancer patients in 2009 and 2017 guidelines. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

### Marine polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer therapy [^f3856faf]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Limitations of marine PUFA use

Although marine PUFAs have been shown to have considerable potential to prevent and augment the treatment of cancer and complications such as cachexia, there are still a number of limitations associated with their use in cancer patients. Because of a significant number of cancer patients experiencing nausea, the consumption of therapeutic doses of fish oil (> 3 g per day) or more purified EPA/DHA (> 2 g EPA, > 1.4 g DHA per day) may be impractical, because of the commonly experienced side effect of 'fishy' reflux experienced by many patients consuming fish oil or EPA/DHA supplements. In addition, investigations byraised the question as to whether all PUFAs provide benefit, particularly in patients receiving chemotherapy. They suggest that the PUFAs 12-oxo-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (KHT (n-6)) and hexadeca-4,7,10,13-tetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)) may be involved in the induction of resistance to chemotherapy. Although these compounds may have a profound pharmacological effect, others have described their abundance to be low, with analyses of various fish oil preparations placing them between 0% and 1.56% of total lipid content.) have previously highlighted the inconsistencies presented by these claims when compared with the published literature, and the concern that recommending the reduction of essential fatty acids may have a detrimental effect in this patient population. The discovery that KHT and 16:4(n-3) may play a role in chemotherapy resistance highlights that there is a need for supplementation of marine PUFA supplements to be carefully assessed, with a focus on promoting purified n-3 LCPUFA supplements over less refined whole fish oil, rather than the broad discouragement of this often beneficial augmentation to treatment in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Fish/omega-3 oil supplementation in chronic plaque psoriasis — Fish oil/omega-3 fatty acid oral supplementation has been useful as a monotherapy for psoriasis and may augment the effects of topical, oral-systemic, and phototherapy; it can be considered as an additional supplement in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and can be useful as adjuvant therapy with acitretin, cyclosporine, and NB-UVB. A randomized 12-week open study revealed better and more rapid improvement with etretinate and eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation compared with etretinate alone in chronic stable plaque psoriasis.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^d804e7b7]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Minor intolerances to fish oil are not unusual with symptoms including eructation, nausea, aversion to odour and diarrhoea commonly reported. In keeping with this, our review showed that in an older adult population non-SAE related to GI disturbances were the most commonly reported. Despite this, we observed no significant differences in the frequency of reported GI disturbances between groups, suggesting that the fatty acid composition of fish oil (i.e. EPA and DHA) is unlikely to be the contributing factor for non-SAE. Furthermore, the main placebo(s) used in each of the reviewed studies were typically sunflower or corn oil (n-6 fatty acids) which have both previously demonstrated similar non-SAE as described in the present review. Results from a recent palatability study in older adults ≥ 60 years showed that an association between reported non-SAE and n-3 fatty acid supplementation was unlikely. Using various doses of liquid fish oil (10%, 40% and 100%; containing 5.2 g EPA and 3.6 g DHA at 100% concentrations) Yaxley et al. 2011 reported that older adults were unable to distinguish between varying doses of liquid fish oil and most would not cease consumption if non-SAE such as GI disturbances were experienced.

Fish oils are naturally highly unstable, making them susceptible to oxidation and rancidity. For this reason, many individuals are concerned about taking fish oils as they fear unwanted side effects such as eructation and diarrhoea. Episodes of GI disturbances may be minimized by avoiding aerated drinks at the time of ingestion and by consuming fish oil immediately before meals without further (excessive) fluid consumption. Moreover, tolerance can be improved by refrigerating fish oil supplements (particularly liquid fish oil) once opened. Results from the present review suggest that it is feasible that non-SAE relating to taste and smell are associated with personal taste and perception, rather than a physiological rationale. Further improvement in the development and manufacturing of fish oil supplements may improve patient tolerance and perception.

IgA nephropathy — evidence context for other treatments: Evidence on the efficacy of fish oil supplements from RCTs is conflicting, but there is little risk. For antiplatelet therapy, adherence with the 3-times-a-day regimen with dipyridamole is likely to be difficult and evidence of benefit is low quality. For tonsillectomy, a meta-analysis of 7 retrospective series showed no benefit of corticosteroids alone or tonsillectomy alone, but benefit when tonsillectomy was combined with corticosteroids.

### Use of dietary supplements among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the United States: a population-based analysis from NHANES [^98093226]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary supplement use is prevalent in the general US population, but little is known regarding the driving reasons for their use among those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods and Results

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2017 to March 2020 were used to identify adults with ASCVD. Supplement use was assessed by interviewers using label review, and surveys captured self-reported reasons for use. Demographic, clinical, medication, and laboratory characteristics were compared between supplement users and nonusers. Among individuals with ASCVD in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 965; mean age, 65years; 56.1% men; 73.7% White individuals), 73.1% reported taking ≥ 1 dietary supplements, most commonly multivitamins (35.4%), vitamin D (30.8%), and fish oil (19.8%). Of those taking supplements, 47.3% report taking them under the advisement of a health professional. Nearly one fifth (17.9%) reported taking at least 1 supplement for "heart health", most commonly fish oil (11.1%), followed by CoQ10 (4.2%) and resveratrol (1.5%). Supplement users were older (68 versus 62years; P = 0.003), included more women (45.8% versus 37.7%; P = 0.17), were less likely to smoke (11.0% versus 36.4%; P < 0.001), had higher levels of education (P = 0.005) and income (P < 0.001), and higher use of statins (69.4% versus 55.8%; P = 0.046).

Conclusions

Supplement use is common in people with ASCVD. Among the top 3 supplements, a substantial minority were being taken under the direction of health professionals. Supplement users often report taking supplements "for heart health", despite a lack of randomized trial evidence for benefit in ASCVD, indicating a need for more patient and clinician education regarding health benefits of dietary supplements in ASCVD.

### Fish oil and postoperative atrial fibrillation: the omega-3 fatty acids for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation (OPERA) randomized trial… [^5a188cd4]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Patients were randomized to receive fish oil or placebo, with preoperative loading of 10 g over 3 to 5 days followed postoperatively by 2 g/d until hospital discharge or postoperative day 10, whichever came first. The accumulated evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggests that habitual intake of fish or fish oil reduces risk of coronary death, possibly related to fewer primary ventricular arrhythmias. 8, 9 Experimental evidence supports direct and indirect antiarrhythmic effects of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, especially in the setting of acute ischemia. 8 Yet effects of n-3-PUFAs on atrial arrhythmias such as postoperative AF remain uncertain. Stratified by actual study drug loading days, phospholipid n-3-PUFA concentrations in the treatment group increased by 0. 47% of total fatty acids at day 1, by

1. 11% at day 2, by 1.

91% at day 3, by
2. 55% at day 4, and by 2. 30% at day
5. Effects of n-3-PUFA treatment on postoperative AF, however, were not significantly different by loading days. Compared with patients in the placebo group, those in the n-3-PUFA group received significantly fewer packed red blood cell transfusions, including during surgery, after surgery, and overall. Other bleeding indices did not significantly differ by treatment. Minor adverse events commonly seen with fish oil, such as gastrointestinal upset, burping, and fish oil taste, occurred more commonly in the n-3-PUFA group. Adverse events requiring discontinuation of study drug and other serious adverse events were similar between groups.

### Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids and cardio-metabolic health, alone or with statins [^646478ce]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The impact of the fish-derived omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes incidence and risk has been widely investigated. Although the balance of evidence suggests substantial benefits with respect to CVD mortality, there is little evidence for an impact of these fatty acids on insulin sensitivity and diabetes incidence, despite very promising data from animal models. The focus here will be the plasma lipid modulatory effects of EPA and DHA and will include an exploration of the potential and demonstrated complementarity between statins and EPA/DHA on overall CVD risk and the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride profile. Although there is some justification for greater general population and patient EPA+DHA intakes, an often overlooked major obstacle is that global fish stocks are limited and insufficient to meet demands. The potential of emerging 'non-fish foods' to provide affordable and sustainable sources of EPA+DHA will also be briefly discussed.

### Usefulness of omega-3 fatty acids and the prevention of coronary heart disease [^e32a2199]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trial evidence exists that supports a role for the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in coronary heart disease prevention. However, the results from these clinical trials have varied and were conducted in diverse population groups using several different types of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Thus, we systematically reviewed previously published reports assessing the different types of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid interventions and cardiovascular outcomes. Fourteen randomized clinical trials were included in the review. Six trials were included with fish oil, with 1 large trial (10,000 patients) dominating the analysis. In aggregate, the fish oil trials demonstrated a reduction in total mortality and sudden death without a clinically significant reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction. The 6 trials with ALA supplements or an ALA-enriched diet were of poorer design than the fish oil trials and had limited power. Many of the trials with ALA involved other changes in dietary components. In aggregate, the ALA trials demonstrated possible benefits in reducing sudden death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, but with wider confidence intervals than in the fish oil trials. In conclusion, the evidence suggests a role for fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid) or fish in secondary prevention because recent clinical trial data have demonstrated a significant reduction in total mortality, coronary heart disease death, and sudden death. The data on ALA have been limited by studies of smaller sample size and limited quality.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^4f61e004]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3)), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) may benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess the effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 fats for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to February 2019, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to August 2019, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake, or both, versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 86 RCTs (162,796 participants) in this review update and found that 28 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 88 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most trials assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5 g a day to more than 5 g a day (19 RCTs gave at least 3 g LCn3 daily). Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.01; 143,693 participants; 11,297 deaths in 45 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 117,837 participants; 5658 deaths in 29 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 140,482 participants; 17,619 people experienced events in 43 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), stroke (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 138,888 participants; 2850 strokes in 31 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or arrhythmia (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 77,990 participants; 4586 people experienced arrhythmia in 30 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Increasing LCn3 may slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 334, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; 127,378 participants; 3598 coronary heart disease deaths in 24 RCTs, low-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (NNTB 167, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 134,116 participants; 8791 people experienced coronary heart disease events in 32 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). Overall, effects did not differ by trial duration or LCn3 dose in pre-planned subgrouping or meta-regression. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; 19,327 participants; 459 deaths in 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25; 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths in 4 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), coronary heart disease mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26; 18,353 participants; 193 coronary heart disease deaths in 3 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 19,061 participants; 397 coronary heart disease events in 4 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular disease events (NNTB 500, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; but RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04 in RCTs at low summary risk of bias; 19,327 participants; 884 cardiovascular disease events in 5 RCTs; low-certainty evidence), and probably slightly reduces risk of arrhythmia (NNTB 91, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 4912 participants; 173 events in 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Effects on stroke are unclear. Increasing LCn3 and ALA had little or no effect on serious adverse events, adiposity, lipids and blood pressure, except increasing LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose-dependent way (high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence suggests that increasing LCn3 slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events, and reduces serum triglycerides (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Increasing ALA slightly reduces risk of cardiovascular events and arrhythmia.

### Dietary and pharmacological fatty acids and cardiovascular health [^7991b006]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

The effects of dietary intake of different fatty acids and pharmacological use of fatty acids, specifically long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs), on cardiovascular health and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention have been examined in a large number of observational studies and clinical trials. This review summarizes recent data and discusses potential mechanisms.

Evidence Acquisition

The review is based on the authors' knowledge of the field supplemented by a PubMed search using the terms seafood, fish oil, saturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and ASCVD.

Evidence Synthesis

We mainly discuss the recent clinical trials that examine the effects of different types of dietary fatty acids and pharmacological use of n-3 PUFA products on ASCVD prevention and the potential mechanisms.

Conclusions

While replacement of dietary saturated fat with unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat in particular, or intake of LC n-3 PUFA-rich seafood has generally shown benefit for ASCVD prevention and is recommended for cardiovascular benefits, data on effects of n-3 PUFA products on ASCVD health are inconsistent. However, recent clinical trials support benefits of prescription EPA in ASCVD prevention. n-3 PUFAs may contribute to ASCVD prevention through multiple mechanisms, including lowering plasma triglyceride levels, anti-inflammatory effects, antithrombotic effects, and effects on endothelial function.

### Role of fish oil in post-cardiotomy bleeding: a summary of the basic science and clinical trials [^f43af636]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-3 fatty acids are widely used. This article reviews the coagulopathic effects of fish oil.

Methods

A review was performed of all English articles that addressed the topic from 1980 to 2017.

Results

Fish oil induces an in vitro coagulopathy in humans due to inhibitory effects in platelet-to-platelet adhesion and platelet-stimulated thrombin generation. The effect from fish oil alone is weak, but it is enhanced and may become clinically noticeable in patients taking antiplatelet therapy, and, to a lesser extent, in patients on factor Xa inhibitors and warfarin. In the absence of other anticoagulants, fish oil alone is not capable of producing a clinically significant coagulopathy that would induce or contribute to surgical bleeding.

Conclusions

Patients who are taking fish oil without other anticoagulants do not have an increased risk of bleeding surgical complications. Because of the highly variable amounts of actual eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in commercially available supplements, thromboelastography with platelet mapping would allow a surgeon to know if a coagulopathic effect is present in a patient taking fish oil, especially if the patient was also taking other anticoagulants.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^36ee92e6]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Until 2005, studies consistently provided clear evidence that omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) protect against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) complications. They were thought to reduce the risk of arterial atherosclerotic and thrombotic obstruction; to increase the myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury; and to prevent malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Animal and epidemiological studies as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) all supported that n-3 are protective. This was confirmed in meta-analyses of both prospective cohort studies and RCTs leading to the conclusion that an intake of 250 mg/day of marine n-3 (EPA+DHA (eicosapentanoic acid + docosahexanoic acid)) reduced fatal CVD by 36% when compared to no EPA+DHA.

Consequently, it was proposed to use blood measurements of n-3 as a predictor of CVD complications. The omega-3 index - defined as the percentage of EPA+DHA in blood red cells - reflects the average dietary intake and the tissue levels of EPA+DHA, including those of the heart. A high omega-3 index (> 8%) is thought to be associated with a low risk of CVD complications whereas a low omega-3 index (< 4%) is associated with increased risk susceptible to be decreased by a preventive treatment with n-3 (fish oil) supplements. An omega-3 index between 4 and 8% indicates an intermediate risk. The effects of n-3 supplements are, therefore, expected to be different in patients with either high or low omega-3 index with large benefits for those with a low index (that is, high risk) and small or no benefits for those with a high index (that is, low risk). This concept is critical because it suggests that n-3 supplements might be potentially protective against CVD complications only in patients who are n-3 deficient and not in patients who are at high risk for reasons other than an n-3 deficiency. This underlines the fact that n-3 are nutrients and not a drug. So far this concept applies only for CVD, not for other nonvascular and non-cardiac clinical conditions.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^11f073b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Researchers have suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CVD) events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to September 2016, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation and/or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 79 RCTs (112,059 participants) in this review update and found that 25 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 72 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most studies assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03, 92,653 participants; 8189 deaths in 39 trials, high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, 67,772 participants; 4544 CVD deaths in 25 RCTs), cardiovascular events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04, 90,378 participants; 14,737 people experienced events in 38 trials, high-quality evidence), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, 73,491 participants; 1596 CHD deaths in 21 RCTs), stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16, 89,358 participants; 1822 strokes in 28 trials) or arrhythmia (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, 53,796 participants; 3788 people experienced arrhythmia in 28 RCTs). There was a suggestion that LCn3 reduced CHD events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97, 84,301 participants; 5469 people experienced CHD events in 28 RCTs); however, this was not maintained in sensitivity analyses - LCn3 probably makes little or no difference to CHD event risk. All evidence was of moderate GRADE quality, except as noted. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20, 19,327 participants; 459 deaths, 5 RCTs), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths, 4 RCTs), and it may make little or no difference to CHD events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, 19,061 participants, 397 CHD events, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular events (from 4.8% to 4.7%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07, 19,327 participants; 884 CVD events, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence), and probably reduces risk of CHD mortality (1.1% to 1.0%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26, 18,353 participants; 193 CHD deaths, 3 RCTs), and arrhythmia (3.3% to 2.6%, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10, 4,837 participants; 141 events, 1 RCT). Effects on stroke are unclear. Sensitivity analysis retaining only trials at low summary risk of bias moved effect sizes towards the null (RR 1.0) for all LCn3 primary outcomes except arrhythmias, but for most ALA outcomes, effect sizes moved to suggest protection. LCn3 funnel plots suggested that adding in missing studies/results would move effect sizes towards null for most primary outcomes. There were no dose or duration effects in subgrouping or meta-regression. There was no evidence that increasing LCn3 or ALA altered serious adverse events, adiposity or lipids, although LCn3 slightly reduced triglycerides and increased HDL. ALA probably reduces HDL (high- or moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and high-quality evidence suggests that increasing EPA and DHA has little or no effect on mortality or cardiovascular health (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Previous suggestions of benefits from EPA and DHA supplements appear to spring from trials with higher risk of bias. Low-quality evidence suggests ALA may slightly reduce CVD event risk, CHD mortality and arrhythmia.

### Fish oil interaction with warfarin [^00bac74c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient taking fish oil and warfarin.

Case Summary

A 67-year-old white woman had been taking warfarin for 1(1/2) years due to recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteopenia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She also experienced an inferior myocardial infarction in 1995 requiring angioplasty, surgical repair of her femoral artery in 1995, and hernia repair in 1996. This patient has her INR checked in the anticoagulation clinic and is followed monthly by the clinical pharmacist. Prior to the interaction, her INR was therapeutic for 5 months while she was taking warfarin 1.5 mg/d. The patient admitted to doubling her fish oil dose from 1000 to 2000 mg/d. Without dietary, lifestyle, or medication changes, the INR increased from 2.8 to 4.3 within 1 month. The INR decreased to 1.6 one week after subsequent fish oil reduction, necessitating a return to the original warfarin dosing regimen.

Discussion

Fish oil supplementation could have provided additional anticoagulation with warfarin therapy. Fish oil, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, consists of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. This fatty acid may affect platelet aggregation and/or vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Omega-3 fatty acids may lower thromboxane A(2) supplies within the platelet as well as decrease factor VII levels. Although controversial, this case report illustrates that fish oil can provide additive anticoagulant effects when given with warfarin.

Conclusions

This case reveals a significant rise in INR after the dose of concomitant fish oil was doubled. Patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy with warfarin should be educated about and monitored for possible drug-herb interactions. Pharmacists can play a crucial role in identifying possible drug interactions by asking patients taking warfarin about herbal and other alternative medicine product use.

### Role of arginine and omega-3 fatty acids in wound healing and infection [^5d192dbd]. Advances in Wound Care (2014). Low credibility.

Significance: Only a few decades ago, the primary focus of nutritional supplementation was to prevent deficiencies of essential nutrients. It is now recognized that, at higher than essential levels, selected nutrients can have a pharmacologic effect to prevent or treat disease. Recent Advances: Two of the most important pharmaconutrients, arginine, and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil, have been shown to have profound effects on wound healing and infections. Critical Issues: Both arginine and fish oils have independent benefits, but the combination appears to be much more effective. This combination has been shown to affect outcomes involving wound healing and infections, as reviewed here, and can also affect incidence and outcomes in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, organ transplant rejection, and other inflammatory conditions. These possibilities have not yet progressed to widespread clinical application. Future Directions: The optimal combinations of immunonutrients, timing of administration, and the doses needed for best results need to be determined in preclinical and clinical studies. Also, the mechanisms involved in the administration of pharmaconutrients need to be established.

### Fish oil supplementation in the parenteral nutrition of critically ill medical patients: a randomised controlled trial [^961070c6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether supplementation of parenteral nutrition with fish oil - aimed at increasing the n-3:n-6 ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to 1:2 - affects systemic inflammation and clinical outcome compared to standard parenteral nutrition with an n-3/n-6 ratio of 1:7 in medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Design

Single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.

Setting

Twelve-bed medical ICU of a university hospital.

Patients

A total of 166 consecutive patients anticipated to need parenteral nutrition for more than 6 days. Patients were stratified for the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline (115 SIRS, 51 non-SIRS).

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 1:1-mixture of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and long-chain triglycerides (LCT) with an n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio of 1:7, or the same MCT/LCT emulsion supplemented with fish oil (resulting in an n-3/n-6 ratio of 1:2).

Measurements and Results

Primary endpoints were changes in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte HLA-DR expression relative to baseline. Secondary endpoints were incidence of nosocomial infections, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and 28-day mortality. Bleeding complications were recorded as a possible side effect of fish oil. Between standard and intervention groups, overall as well as stratified for SIRS or non-SIRS, no significant difference was detected in any of the endpoints or frequency and severity of bleeding events.

Conclusions

In unselected critically ill medical patients, fish oil supplementation that increased the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio to 1:2 did not affect inflammation or clinical outcome, compared to parenteral lipid nutrition with an MCT/LCT emulsion.

### Fish oil supplementation in relation to the risk of chronic kidney disease among patients with diabetes [^b638e7e0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the association between fish oil supplementation and subsequent risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with diabetes, and further evaluate the mediation effect of typical glycolipid and inflammatory biomarkers.

Methods

In total, 24 497 patients with diabetes from the UK Biobank were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CKD risk, and the rate advancement period was calculated to quantify and communicate the impact of fish oil upon that risk. In addition, we also used mediation analysis to assess the mediating role of plasma biomarkers.

Results

Overall, 7122 patients reported taking fish oil supplements. During a mean of 11.3years of follow-up, 3533 CKD cases occurred. In the fully adjusted model, fish oil use was inversely associated with the incidence of CKD (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.97), which was mediated by serum levels of HbA1c (4.7%), C-reactive protein (CRP) (3.4%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (2.3%). Participants who took fish oil supplements displayed the same risk of CKD events, but that risk was delayed by approximately 2.79years compared with non-users of fish oil.

Conclusions

Our findings advocate the beneficial role of fish oil use in preventing CKD among patients with diabetes, which may be mediated by serum levels of HbA1c, CRP and HDL-C, and support public health policies aiming to promote fish oil supplementation for the prevention of diabetes complications.

2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA chronic coronary disease (CCD) guideline — antithrombotic duration, supplements, testing, and e-cigarettes notes that shorter durations of dual antiplatelet therapy are safe and effective in many circumstances, particularly when the risk of bleeding is high and the ischemic risk is low to moderate; that the use of nonprescription or dietary supplements, including fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids or vitamins, is not recommended in patients with CCD given the lack of benefit in reducing cardiovascular events; that routine periodic anatomic or ischemic testing without a change in clinical or functional status is not recommended for risk stratification or to guide therapeutic decision-making in patients with CCD; and that although e-cigarettes increase the likelihood of successful smoking cessation compared with nicotine replacement therapy, because of the lack of long-term safety data and risks of sustained use, e-cigarettes are not recommended as first-line therapy for smoking cessation.

### The FDA's new advice on fish: it's complicated [^7234d81e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency recently issued an updated draft of advice on fish consumption for pregnant and breastfeeding women, after survey data indicated that the majority of pregnant women do not eat much fish and thus may have inadequate intake of the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and ducosahexaenoic acid [DHA]. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential components of membranes in all cells of the body and are vitally important for normal development of the brain and retinal tissues (especially myelin and retinal photoreceptors) and for maintenance of normal neurotransmission and connectivity. They also serve as substrates for the synthesis of a variety of antiinflammatory and inflammation-resolving mediators, favorably alter the production of thromboxane and prostaglandin E2, and improve cardiovascular health by preventing fatal arrhythmias and reducing triglyceride and C-reactive protein levels. Maternal ingestion of adequate quantities of fish (defined in many studies as at least 340 g of oily fish each week) has been associated with better childhood IQ scores, fine motor coordination, and communication and social skills, along with other benefits. Although the FDA did not clarify which fish to eat, it specifically advised against eating fish with the highest mercury levels and implied that fish with high levels of EPA and DHA and low levels of mercury are ideal. The FDA draft did not recommend taking omega 3 fatty acid or fish oil supplements instead of eating fish, which is advice that may reflect the fact that randomized controlled trials of DHA and EPA or fish oil supplementation generally have been disappointing and that the ideal daily dose of DHA and EPA is unknown. It seems safe to conclude that pregnant and nursing women should be advised to eat fish to benefit from naturally occurring omega 3 fatty acids, to avoid fish with high levels of mercury and other contaminants, and, if possible, to choose fish with high levels of EPA and DHA.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^a32bff4e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) — trial and meta-analysis evidence: Harris et al. noted 9 large randomized trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, with 4 positive, 4 neutral, and 1 negative; positive trials (1980s to early 2000s) used EPA and DHA intakes between 0.85 and 1.8 g/day, whereas neutral trials (2010–2012) provided 376 to 840 mg/day of EPA and DHA. Evidence syntheses include five systematic reviews and meta-analyses; two published before 2010 reported benefits in existing CHD, but three published after 2010 did not report benefits. A frequently cited meta-analysis (Rizos et al.) was criticized for using a significance threshold of 0.006 instead of 0.05; without this maneuver, fish oil supplementation significantly reduced risk for cardiac death by 9% [RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98; P = 0.011].

### Seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^d7d54522]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Since the 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement "Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Disease", evidence from observational and experimental studies and from randomized controlled trials continues to emerge to further substantiate the beneficial effects of seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. A recent American Heart Association science advisory addressed the specific effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events. This American Heart Association science advisory extends that review and offers further support to include n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from seafood consumption. Several potential mechanisms have been investigated, including antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory, hematologic, and endothelial, although for most, longer-term dietary trials of seafood are warranted to substantiate the benefit of seafood as a replacement for other important sources of macronutrients. The present science advisory reviews this evidence and makes a suggestion in the context of the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and in consideration of other constituents of seafood and the impact on sustainability. We conclude that 1 to 2 seafood meals per week be included to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods.

Allergic disease treatment with fish oil or n-3 LCPUFAs — clinical trial evidence — shows mostly no benefit on allergic outcomes, with one small inpatient asthma study reporting improvements. Among 39 children 8 to 12 years of age, supplementation did not affect pulmonary or symptom outcomes at 3 or 6 months; a randomized study of 420 infants found no effect on sensitization, eczema, asthma, or food allergy and higher dropout in the fish oil arm (28.4% vs 16.8%); however, in 29 Japanese children with severe asthma, 10 months of fish oil supplementation reduced acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm and asthmatic symptoms.

3.2 Fish oil omega‐3 PUFAs: Background of clinical studies

A 2011 review analyzed randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and meta‐analyses conducted up to that time and concluded that consumption of fish or fish oil reduced coronary heart disease mortality in populations with and without established CV disease. 40 Three meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials of omega‐3 PUFA supplements supported this conclusion. 46, 74, 75 However, another meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2012 concluded that omega‐3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with significant reduction in the risk of all‐cause death, cardiac death, or myocardial infarction. 76 That meta‐analysis, however, used an unusually high threshold for statistical significance (α = 0.0063). It is remarkable, for example, that all 17 of the trials included in the analysis of all‐cause death reported a relative risk < 0.96 favoring omega‐3 PUFA, and seven of those trials reported upper confidence intervals that were < 1.0, yet the meta‐analysis failed to find a significant benefit of omega‐3 PUFAs for all‐cause death. The authors noted that there was extensive heterogeneity across trials with regard to event rates, baseline CV disease risk, treatment setting (eg, primary prevention vs secondary prevention), co‐administered therapies, baseline intake of omega‐3 PUFAs, dose, and nature of omega‐3 PUFA used for the intervention, and treatment adherence. Thus, heterogeneity was likely so high that a meaningful conclusion could not be reached. A more recent meta‐analysis revealed the importance of such heterogeneity. That study 77 also found a non‐significant reduction in coronary heart disease risk across the entire study group (summary relative risk estimate [SSRE], 0.94; 95% CI 0.85‐1.05), but it found that high‐risk populations obtained significant benefits from omega‐3 PUFA interventions. Specifically, patients with elevated baseline TG levels had an SSRE of 0.86 (95% CI 0.76‐0.98). The authors also found evidence that higher intakes of omega‐3 PUFAs were associated with significantly greater reductions in coronary heart disease risk (SSRE, 0.82; 95% CI 0.74‐0.92). These meta‐analyses reinforce the importance of trial design; patient subgroups should be carefully and prospectively defined and studied in clinical trials, and doses and compositions of omega‐3 PUFAs need to be precisely constructed and controlled.

### Pollution and respiratory disease: can diet or supplements help? A review [^221a4121]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Fats

Omega-3 oils (or n-3 polyunsaturated fats-PUFAs) have received much attention due to their ability to reduce inflammation, and for its anti-coagulant properties, thus reducing risk of cardiovascular diseases. Two randomised controlled studies have investigated early life fish oil dietary supplementation in relation to asthma outcomes in children at high risk of atopic disease (at least one parent or sibling had atopy with or without asthma). In a study, powered only to detect differences in cord blood, maternal dietary fish oil supplementation during pregnancy was associated with reduced cytokine release from allergen stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells. However, effects on clinical outcomes at one year, in relation to atopic eczema, wheeze and cough, were marginal In a second study, fish oil supplementation started in early infancy with or without additional house dust mite avoidance, was associated with a significant reduction in wheeze at 18 months of age. By five years of age fish oil supplementation was not associated with effects on asthma or other atopic diseases. In the absence of any evidence of benefit from the use of fish oil supplementation in pregnancy, the British Thoracic Society SIGN 2016 guidelines do not recommend it as a strategy for primary prevention of childhood asthma.

There are recent studies which use omega-3 oils to combat the effects of pollution. Animal models of fine particle matter pollution, demonstrated that omega-3 oils prevented and improve inflammation caused by these fine particles with a further pre-clinical study showing that omega-3 oils reduced the oxidative damage in the intestines after heavy metals ingestion.

For the early and milder forms of allergic asthma, dietary supplementation with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), predominantly fish oil-associated eicosapentaenoic (C20:5 ω-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 ω-3), and distinct crop oil-derived fatty acids have been proposed to provide a sustainable treatment strategy. C20:5 and C22:6 ω-3 fatty acids inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and decrease eicosanoid synthesis from amino acids. They also suppress immunoglobulin (Ig) E production and thereby reduce airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthma. In 2002 a Cochrane database review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend fish oil supplementation for the treatment of asthma.

### Immunotherapy of mild cognitive impairment by ω-3 supplementation: why are amyloid-β antibodies and ω-3 not working in clinical trials? [^9d35eaa4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

CONTROVERSIES REGARDING ω -3 EFFECTS: QUALITY OF THE SUPPLEMENT

Anti-inflammatory health benefits of ω -3 have been recognized since epidemiological studies showed cardiovascular benefits of traditional fish diets in natives in Greenland, Alaska, and Japan. Clinical studies have shown benefits of ω -3 supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and ulcerative colitis. However, recent epidemiological studies of aging populations have not shown that ω -3 supplementation prevents cognitive decline and brain atrophy. A study of 295 mild to moderate AD patients randomized to algal DHA or placebo did not show slowing of cognitive and functional decline by DHA. A recent study of 1,680 elderly subjects with memory complaints included multiple sites with a randomized controlled design involving multicomponent intervention with polyunsaturated fatty acids and lifestyle changes. The participants took two capsules of either placebo or 400 mg DHA and no more than 112.5 mg EPA. Despite these interventions, no significant effects on cognitive decline were observed in any arm of this study over 3 years. The report, however, did not show the quality of the ω -3 supplement. It is clear that not all ω -3 products on the market are equal. It has been reported that 50% of the products exceed the voluntary recommended levels for markers of oxidation. Furthermore, the elderly patients in the study were not diagnosed with MCI.

In our experience, high quality fish oil used in Smartfish drink protected by antioxidants has superior effects in vitro on Aβ phagocytosis in comparison to generic fish oil. Thus, the negative effects of supplementation in some clinical studies could be related to the use of fish oil without antioxidant protection. We observe that the immune and cognitive results of ω -3 supplementation are dependent on the APOE genotype, stage of the disease, and poorly understood individual factors, including immunosuppressive conditions, infections, surgeries, and lifestyle, all of which typical clinical trials do not evaluate. The immune and cognitive results do not show a linear improvement or a linear decline but include up and down turns. Therefore, the question "why are ω -3 not working in clinical trials" may be related to the quality of the supplement, selection of patients, neuropsychological testing, and medical and neurological histories. We have recently reviewed the effects of ω -3 in the AD brain and the immune system.

### Brown adipose tissue – A translational perspective [^7a59c78b]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Fish oil supplements containing DHA and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduce plasma TGs and may exert limited cardiovascular benefits, although combined DHA + EPA did not show any benefit in a recent large, randomized controlled trial. In contrast, treatment with ethyl EPA (icosapent ethyl) was shown to confer important cardiovascular benefits in high-risk participants in a large, randomized controlled trial. Despite some early reports of increased expression of iBAT UCP1 and thermogenic gene expression, increased BAT mass and induction of WAT browning with fish oil supplementation in rodents, a more recent report did not reproduce these findings under thermoneutral conditions. Another recent study showed a similar antiobesity effect and stimulation of energy expenditure with fish oil supplementation in wild-type or UCP1 KO mice, suggesting that activation of BAT thermogenesis was not responsible for the effects of this treatment. Fish oil supplements in humans increased WAT browning in one report but not in another. An association was reported between BAT 18 FDG uptake with fasting plasma DHA and EPA in humans. However, no study has thus far directly addressed the effect of fish oil, DHA, or EPA on in vivo BAT thermogenesis in humans.

Finally, 2-day treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid that activates BAT type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase via activation of the TGR5, has been shown to increase BAT 18 FDG uptake at room temperature in 12 young, healthy women, with an increase in basal energy expenditure. In that same publication, there was a significant TGR5-dependent increase in ex vivo uncoupled respiration of human brown adipocytes with chenodeoxycholic acid treatment.

To summarize, there is currently no direct in vivo evidence that BAT thermogenesis can be selectively activated by any of the tested classes of drugs, from sympathicomimetics, including the β-3 adrenergic agonist mirabegron, to PPAR-γ agonists, or other drugs known to induce some metabolic effects in humans (Table 1). Regarding mirabegron, its demonstrated stimulation of BAT glucose uptake occurs at a dose that likely stimulates the β-1/β-2 adrenergic receptors that are predominant in human BAT. Using this drug, it appears that any stimulation of BAT metabolism may be inseparable from activation of WAT TG/NEFA cycling and some cardiac chronotropic effects. The few small studies showing an increase in WAT browning markers did not provide convincing evidence for a role of this effect on any potential metabolic benefit observed.

### Fish oil supplements… [^597b62b9]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Randomized clinical trials with "hard" end points and meta-analyses of these trials should influence clinical practice because they represent the highest level of evidence. Health care behaviors based on less robust evidence are often established before such RCTs are conducted. If the results of high-quality RCTs contradict established practice, numerous barriers exist to their acceptance and implementation. 1 ω-3 Fatty acid supplements are commonly used for the management of cardiovascular, neurocognitive, ophthalmic, and inflammatory disorders. In 2002, their use in the secondary prevention of heart disease was endorsed by the American Heart Association. 2 Recently, their health effects have been studied in several RCTs and meta-analyses, many of which were reported in high-impact journals. Here, we report the relationship between these publications in influential journals and the use of ω-3 FAs.

Data on annual sales of fish oils and ω-3 FAs from 2007 through 2012 were obtained from Euromonitor International. Between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, a total of 18 RCTs and 6 meta-analyses of RCTs of ω-3 FAs were published in the high-impact journals3 -26. Between 2007 and 2012, sales of fish oils and ω-3 FA supplements in the United States increased steadily, from $425 to $1043 million. The median year-on-year increase was $124 million. Similar patterns of sales were observed in the United Kingdom and Australasia.

Since 10% of adults in the United States take an ω-3 FA or fish oil supplement, most commonly for heart health or to lower cholesterol, 27 the null results of 9 of the 10 RCTs and 5 of the 6 meta-analyses studying cardiovascular disease might have been expected to influence use. It remains to be seen whether a recently published trial sequential analysis, which reports proof of no efficacy of ω-3 FAs in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, alters use of the supplements. 28.

### Fish oil (omegaven) [^d35d6993]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no available data on Omegaven use in pregnant women to establish a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fish oil triglycerides.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

No data are available regarding the presence of fish oil triglycerides from Omegaven in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Lactating women receiving oral omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Omegaven, and any potential adverse effects of Omegaven on the breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The effectiveness of Omegaven was established in two open-label clinical trials of 82 pediatric patients, 3 to 42 weeks of age, including preterm neonates with estimated gestational age of greater than 24 weeks at birth. Patients administered Omegaven attained and maintained growth through at least 108 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety of Omegaven was established in 189 pediatric patients (19 days to 15 years of age). The most common adverse reactions in Omegaven-treated patients were vomiting, agitation, and bradycardia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, clinical decompensation with rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion in neonates and infants, sometimes fatal has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Preterm neonates and infants who receive treatment with Omegaven may be at risk of aluminum toxicity and other metabolic abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of Omegaven did not include patients 65 years of age and older.

### Omega-3, omega-6 and total dietary polyunsaturated fat on cancer incidence: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^4bfb0f64]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Some polyunsaturated fats are essential in the human diet, and UK dietary reference values suggest we need to eat at least 6.5% of our energy intake in the form of cis-polyunsaturated fats. Further increasing polyunsaturated fat intake is associated with healthy eating and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general public, but is still scientifically controversial. The use of supplements as additions or replacements to food stuff has gained traction with the general public. It has been estimated that approximately 38% of American adults use complementary medicines and fish oil, omega 3 or DHA supplements are the most commonly used non-vitamin, non-mineral natural product (37.4%) and flaxseed the 4th (15.9%).LCn3 is ingested in the form of oily fish or fish oil (often fish liver oil) capsules, however, these may contain contaminants. Heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, chromium, nickel, lead and cobalt and toxic compounds such as dioxins have been found in fish and fish oils representing a potential risk to health. – It is therefore important to assess both potential benefits and harms of increasing omega-3, omega-6 and total polyunsaturated fats on cancer risk to better inform members of the public considering dietary change or supplementation.

As previous systematic reviews of trials and observational studies have been equivocal about effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total PUFA on total, breast and prostate cancer risk,– this review assessed the risks and protective effects of increasing omega 3, omega 6 and total polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) intake on total, breast and prostate cancer incidence in adults, gathering a much larger set of randomised trials than has previously been assessed as it included trials where cancer diagnosis was not the primary outcome, but cancer diagnosis or mortality data were available. As this systematic review was conducted as part of a series of systematic reviews assessing a range of health effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total PUFA – (Ajabnoor et al. personal communication, Brainard et al. personal communication) we have been able to compare health benefits and harms across the major causes of mortality and morbidity in developed countries: cancer and cardiovascular disease.
