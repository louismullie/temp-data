## Question

A 5-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician by his parents for yellow skin for the past few days. His parents also reported that he remains quiet all day and does not even respond to sound. Further perinatal history reveals that he was born by cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation, and his birth weight was 2.8 kg (6.1 lb). This baby is the second child of this couple, who are close relatives. Their first child died as the result of an infection at an early age. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 116/min, and respirations are 29/min. On physical examination, hypotonia is present. His laboratory studies show:\\nHemoglobin 12.9 gm/dL\\nLeukocyte count 9,300/mm3\\nPlatelet count 170,000/mm3\\nUnconjugated bilirubin 33 mg/dL\\nConjugated bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL\\nCoombs test Negative\\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A. Phenobarbital
B. Phototherapy
C. Liver transplantation
D. Discontinue the breast feeding

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a 5-day-old neonate with extreme unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and signs concerning for bilirubin neurotoxicity, and which next step is most appropriate from the options provided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate neurotoxicity risk stratification. Then, I should verify how the AAP 2022 guideline directs escalation thresholds and emergency measures. Next, I will review the significance of direct versus indirect bilirubin fractions in management decisions. After that, I should evaluate the specific choices against guideline-backed therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation and rationale.

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and risk context: a 5-day-old, late-preterm infant with TSB 33 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL, and concerning neurologic signs including lethargy and lack of response to sound is in a high-risk category for acute bilirubin encephalopathy, particularly given prematurity at 36 weeks and a rapid accumulation of bilirubin, even though the Coombs test is negative, which does not exclude nonimmune hemolysis or other risk factors like G6PD deficiency or sepsis, so I need to act urgently and not wait for further testing before initiating therapy [^115ZhdYq] [^115DS4rL] [^114U751a].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold implications: the AAP 2022 guideline defines extreme hyperbilirubinemia at or above 25 mg/dL and emphasizes escalation of care when TSB reaches 2 mg/dL below the exchange transfusion threshold, with the escalation period continuing until TSB is below that escalation threshold. Here, 33 mg/dL is well beyond extreme levels, so this infant meets criteria for immediate escalation of care and close NICU-level management, with preparations for exchange transfusion as indicated by trajectory and clinical status [^115ZhdYq] [^11187kdq] [^116dB6dP].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of direct versus indirect bilirubin in decisions: the AAP explicitly instructs not to subtract direct or conjugated bilirubin from TSB when determining phototherapy or exchange thresholds. The direct fraction here is 0.9 mg/dL, which is less than 20% of TSB, so management should be driven by the total serum bilirubin, not the conjugated component, and this is not cholestatic disease in a 5-day-old with such a high TSB [^115ZhdYq] [^115d9efD] [^116YwUkq].

> I will now examine the treatment options against guideline-based therapy: phenobarbital is not first-line for acute severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and has no role in emergent stabilization, whereas the recommended first-line is immediate intensive phototherapy with simultaneous escalation of care and preparation for exchange transfusion. Phototherapy lowers TSB by photoisomerization and reduces the risk of further increases, while exchange transfusion remains indicated if TSB is at or above the exchange threshold or if signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy emerge, and phototherapy should not be delayed while arranging transfer [^112Jscfn] [^115PXwwS] [^11187kdq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered whether the low conjugated fraction meant phototherapy would be ineffective. Let me reconsider: phototherapy is effective at reducing unconjugated bilirubin and remains indicated even with small direct fractions, and in rare severe cases where direct bilirubin exceeds 50% of TSB, expert consultation is advised, but that is not this case. Therefore, the correct next step is emergent intensive phototherapy plus IV hydration and NICU transfer, with exchange transfusion readiness, rather than phenobarbital, stopping breastfeeding, or considering liver transplantation [^111ATMUT] [^111wAmpe] [^115ZhdYq].

> Let me synthesize: the most appropriate next step is B, phototherapy, but I should double-check that I'm not under-calling the urgency. Given the TSB of 33 mg/dL, the correct interpretation is to initiate intensive phototherapy immediately as part of escalation of care with NICU transfer and preparation for exchange transfusion, not simply routine phototherapy, and that is best represented among the options by selecting phototherapy with the understanding that it will be intensive and emergent, alongside IV fluids and transfer logistics, so the choice that aligns with guideline-based emergency care is B [^115PXwwS] [^112Jscfn] [^115ZhdYq].

---

The most appropriate next step is **intensive phototherapy** [^112aGL6f] because the infant has severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total 33 mg/dL, direct 0.9 mg/dL) [^116dB6dP] [^112U9JL1] at 5 days of life, with risk factors including prematurity (36 weeks), family history suggestive of genetic disease, and clinical signs of bilirubin neurotoxicity (lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia) [^114U751a] [^11534HAi]. Immediate phototherapy is indicated to rapidly lower bilirubin and prevent acute bilirubin encephalopathy; **exchange transfusion should be prepared** if bilirubin does not decline or if neurologic signs progress [^115ZhdYq]. Phenobarbital is not first-line for acute severe hyperbilirubinemia, breastfeeding should continue with supplementation as needed, and liver transplantation is not indicated for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of laboratory findings

The infant presents with **severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia** (total bilirubin 33 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL), indicating a predominantly unconjugated elevation. Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates poses a significant risk of **bilirubin neurotoxicity** (kernicterus), characterized by bilirubin deposition in the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage [^11534HAi]. The infant's clinical signs — lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia, and lack of response to sound — are concerning for **acute bilirubin encephalopathy**.

---

## Risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia

Several risk factors are present in this infant:

- **Prematurity**: Born at 36 weeks gestation, increasing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia [^114U751a].
- **Family history**: Parents are close relatives, and a sibling died from infection, suggesting possible genetic predisposition to metabolic or hematologic disorders [^114U751a].
- **Clinical instability**: Hypotonia and poor feeding indicate possible clinical instability, further increasing the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^113HDgEH].

---

## Management guidelines for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, **immediate intervention is required** for infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Recommended management includes:

- **Intensive phototherapy**: Immediate initiation of intensive phototherapy is the first-line treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^112aGL6f]. Phototherapy converts unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble isomers, facilitating excretion and rapidly reducing serum bilirubin levels [^112zWYAC].
- **Exchange transfusion**: If bilirubin levels continue to rise despite intensive phototherapy, or if signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy are present, exchange transfusion is indicated to rapidly reduce bilirubin levels and prevent neurological damage [^11187kdq].
- **Supportive care**: Intravenous hydration and close monitoring of neurological status are essential during treatment [^115PXwwS].

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Phenobarbital | Phenobarbital is used to induce hepatic enzymes in chronic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome or Gilbert syndrome. It is not indicated for acute severe hyperbilirubinemia with signs of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^113iG5vj]. | Not appropriate |
| B. Phototherapy | Intensive phototherapy is the first-line treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is indicated immediately in this case [^112aGL6f]. | Appropriate |
| C. Liver transplantation | Liver transplantation is not indicated for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is reserved for severe liver failure or specific liver diseases, not for acute bilirubin neurotoxicity risk [^notfound]. | Not appropriate |
| D. Discontinue breastfeeding | Breastfeeding should not be discontinued in **neonatal jaundice**. Continued breastfeeding is recommended, and if **supplementation** is needed, formula can be added. Discontinuing breastfeeding is not supported by **current guidelines** [^notfound]. | Not appropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **immediate initiation of intensive phototherapy** [^112aGL6f]. This intervention is critical to rapidly reduce bilirubin levels and prevent acute bilirubin encephalopathy. Exchange transfusion should be prepared if bilirubin levels fail to decline or if neurological signs progress. Phenobarbital, discontinuation of breastfeeding, and liver transplantation are not indicated in this clinical scenario.

Kernicterus is still occurring but should be largely preventable if health care personnel follow the recommendations listed in this guideline. These recommendations emphasize the importance of universal, systematic assessment of the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, lactation support, close follow-up, and prompt intervention when necessary. A systems-based approach to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be implemented at all birthing facilities and coordinated with continuing ambulatory care. Translational research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Management of neonatal jaundice in low-and lower-middle-income countries [^116dB6dP]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

More than 85% of newborns develop some degree of jaundice during the first days of life. Often a benign condition, the yellowish discolouration of the skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes in newborn infants is caused by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, which may result from increased production of bilirubin, limited ability to conjugate bilirubin, and/or slow hepatic-enteric clearance of bilirubin. A small proportion of newborns develops extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, that is, a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 25 mg/dL (428 µmol/L) or more. When it is not timely recognised or treated, extreme unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia may lead to acute bilirubin encephalopathy. This in turn carries a risk of developing a spectrum of long-term neurological sequelae known as kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSD), encompassing 'classical kernicterus' but also milder forms of permanent brain damage caused by bilirubin neurotoxicity. Worldwide, it is estimated that extreme hyperbilirubinaemia affects at least 481 000 late-preterm and term newborn infants annually, resulting in 114 000 deaths and more than 63 000 survivors with moderate or severe long-term disability. More than 75% of affected infants live in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Moreover, in South Asia severe hyperbilirubinaemia is the seventh leading cause of neonatal mortality.

### Jaundice… [^113jpgYv]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a yellowish or, less frequently, greenish pigmentation of the skin and sclera due to high bilirubin levels. Jaundice in adults typically indicates the presence of underlying diseases involving abnormal heme metabolism, liver dysfunction, or biliary-tract obstruction. The prevalence of jaundice in adults is rare, while jaundice in babies is common, with an estimated 80% affected during their first week of life. The most commonly associated symptoms of jaundice are itchiness, pale feces, and dark urine. Causes of jaundice vary from relatively benign to potentially fatal. High unconjugated bilirubin may be due to excess red blood cell breakdown, large bruises, genetic conditions such as Gilbert's syndrome, not eating for a prolonged period of time, newborn jaundice, or thyroid problems.

High conjugated bilirubin may be due to liver diseases such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, infections, medications, or blockage of the bile duct, due to factors including gallstones, cancer, or pancreatitis. Other conditions can also cause yellowish skin, but are not jaundice, including carotenemia, which can develop from eating large amounts of foods containing carotene — or medications such as rifampin. Treatment of jaundice is typically determined by the underlying cause. If a bile duct blockage is present, surgery is typically required; otherwise, management is medical. Medical management may involve treating infectious causes and stopping medication that could be contributing to the jaundice. Jaundice in newborns may be treated with phototherapy or exchanged transfusion depending on age and prematurity when the bilirubin is greater than 4–21 mg/dl.

Signs and symptoms The most common signs of jaundice in adults are a yellowish discoloration of the white area of the eye and skin, with scleral icterus presence indicating a serum bilirubin of at least 3 mg/dl. Other common signs include dark urine and pale fatty stool. Because bilirubin is a skin irritant, jaundice is commonly associated with severe itchiness.
- Choledocholithiasis. It is the most common cause of obstructive jaundice.
- Pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic head
- Biliary tract strictures
- Biliary atresia
- Primary biliary cholangitis
- Cholestasis of pregnancy
- Acute Pancreatitis. Two reactions then take place with the heme molecule. The first oxidation reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase and results in biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide.

The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow color tetrapyrrole pigment called bilirubin by cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase. Abnormalities in heme metabolism and excretion One way to understand jaundice pathophysiology is to organize it into disorders that cause increased bilirubin production or decreased bilirubin excretion. Prehepatic pathophysiology Prehepatic jaundice results from a pathological increase in bilirubin production, most often as a result of an increased rate of red blood cell hemolysis, leading to an increased deposition of bilirubin in mucosal tissues and the appearance of a yellow hue. Differential diagnosis Other etiologies of yellow discoloration of the skin not related to deposition of bilirubin include:

- Certain medications are associated with yellowing of the skin as a side effect: quinacrine, sunitinib, and sorafenib.

Regarding patient education for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to counseling before discharge, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to provide written and verbal education about neonatal jaundice to all families before discharge. Provide written information to facilitate postdischarge care, including the date, time, and place of the follow-up appointment and, when necessary, a prescription and appointment for a follow-up transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin. Transmit birth hospitalization information, including the last transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin and the age at which it was measured, and direct antiglobulin test results (if any) to the primary care provider who will see the infant at follow-up. Provide this information to families if there is uncertainty about who will provide the follow-up care.

### Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116XW4Zq]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia (IHB) is caused by an imbalance in bilirubin production and elimination. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop jaundice in the first week of age. This review seeks to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the physiology of bilirubin, etiology of IHB, and management of severe IHB. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment for severe IHB. Noninvasive screening tools, innovative treatments, and a better understanding of how prematurity and genetics contribute to severe IHB have improved our understanding of IHB and may help eliminate the hazards associated with severe IHB, including kernicterus spectrum disorder.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

Background

Approximately 60% of infants born at term and 80% of premature infants develop jaundice in the first week of life. Neonatal jaundice results from a build-up of bilirubin in the blood, culminating in a yellowish discolouration of the sclera and the skin. Bilirubin is mainly a product of the breakdown of old or damaged haemoglobin in red blood cells that are cleared from tissues by the liver. Neonatal jaundice in the absence of blood group incompatibility, haemolysis, sepsis, birth trauma and metabolic disorders usually resolves without serious complications within a week. High levels of unconjugated bilirubin, exacerbated by the inability of a premature baby's liver to clear the bilirubin, can result in long term morbidities and. These complications include kernicterus, also known as acute and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, which involves the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the brain causing irreversible brain damage and consequent developmental delay, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, visual and dental problems.

While the number of severe neonatal jaundice cases in high-income countries (HICs) has decreased significantly since the 1990s with improvements in prevention, the rate in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has not. LMICs, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, carry a disproportionate burden in both incidence of and deaths associated with severe neonatal jaundice. The incidence of severe neonatal jaundice is 244.1 per 10,000 live births in LMICs compared to 3.7 per 10,000 live births in HICs, with the Africa region having highest incidence at 667.8 per 10,000 live births. Of the 114,000 neonatal deaths associated with severe neonatal jaundice in 2010, 35% were in sub-Saharan Africa and 39% in South Asia.

Serious adverse effects of neonatal jaundice are largely preventable if severe jaundice is identified early and treated promptly with effective phototherapy and/or exchange blood transfusion for very severe cases. Along with the management of Rhesus incompatibility, phototherapy has helped to greatly reduce the need for exchange blood transfusions in HICs, which require highly skilled personnel and are associated with the risk of complications that accompany a blood transfusion. High rates of avoidable exchange blood transfusions are reported in LMICs. For example, a Nigerian study found approximately one in 20 infants admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit underwent exchange blood transfusions, 51.8% of which could have been avoided with intensive phototherapy.

KAS 22 — urgent exchange transfusion for acute bilirubin encephalopathy: An urgent exchange transfusion should be performed for infants with signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (examples include hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, high-pitched cry, or recurrent apnea), with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation. Case reports and case series suggest that an immediate exchange transfusion may prevent kernicterus in some infants already showing signs and that reducing the time the brain is exposed to high TSB concentration may also reduce the severity of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy if it develops; risks include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars. The benefit of avoiding kernicterus or reducing its severity among newborns with signs of intermediate or advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy probably exceed the risks and costs of exchange transfusion, though some parents have a strong preference to avoid blood products.

Exchange transfusion thresholds — no hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors: Thresholds are presented by gestational age for infants with no recognized hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age, and the stippled lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty. Use total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations and do not subtract direct bilirubin; in rare cases where the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin exceeds 50% of the TSB, consult an expert. Hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include albumin < 3.0 g/dL, isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or other hemolytic conditions, sepsis, or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### International guidelines regarding the role of IVIG in the management of Rh-and ABO-mediated haemolytic disease of the newborn [^115njtJL]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for management of‐mediated

In neonates at risk of ABO‐mediated HDN, routine IVIG is not recommended to reduce the need for ET (very low certainty of evidence of effects, conditional recommendation).

The recommendations developed refer to routine use of IVIG for any neonates with Rh‐ or ABO‐mediated HDN and hyperbilirubinaemia requiring PT, but not yet at the level requiring an ET. Routine use refers to prophylactic IVIG use to prevent progression to severe consequences of hyperbilirubinaemia. Recommendations could not be made for or against use of IVIG for neonates with rapidly rising bilirubin and emergent need for ET, as no studies have addressed this specific indication.

Severe hyperbilirubinaemia unresponsive to phototherapy

In neonates where hyperbilirubinaemia is severe (unresponsive to intensive PT) and requirement for ET is emergent, but not available on site within a timely manner, no evidence‐based recommendations regarding the use of IVIG can be made. While awaiting transport to a facility where ET is available, first‐line treatment is intensive PT. Various non‐evidence‐based treatment suggestions have been described, but none can be endorsed at this time.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^111ctzqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Management of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the cholestatic neonate: a review and an approach [^111wAmpe]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A review of the literature demonstrates that severe total hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL [340 µmol/L]) in some cholestatic term (≥ 37 weeks) and late-preterm (≥ 34 0/7 6/7 weeks) gestation neonates poses a risk for bilirubin-induced brain damage. When the direct bilirubin fraction is < 50% of the total serum bilirubin this risk is associated with the total serum bilirubin alone and treatment decisions should be based on the total serum bilirubin. On the other hand, there are limited data on the risk of bilirubin-induced brain damage in the neonate with severe total hyperbilirubinemia and a direct bilirubin fraction that is equal to or exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin. When this rare combination occurs, efforts to keep the indirect bilirubin fraction from reaching severe levels might, nevertheless, be prudent.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114XFTpB]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants — KAS 8 notes that if appropriate follow-up cannot be arranged for an infant recommended to have an outpatient follow-up bilirubin measure, discharge may be delayed (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade D, Option). Follow-up after discharge for some families can be challenging and potentially contribute to missing the opportunity for timely treatment of hyperbilirubinemia, whereas delay in discharge can be difficult for families and increase nursery-related expenses. The balance of benefit and harm depend on the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and the challenge of follow-up, and extending access for newborn follow-up can reduce the need to delay discharge; shared decision making can help inform the benefit-harm assessment.

Step 3: Estimation of Impairment due to Kernicterus

Global estimate of survivors with NDI following kernicterus. The estimated risk of long-term impairment among survivors, globally, is shown in Figure 5. We based the risk on a recently published systematic review and data provided by Sgro and Ebbesen, which are more specific than those previously provided by Ip et al. We assumed a constant biologic risk and applied this risk of impairment to all the survivors of kernicterus regardless of the level of care and mortality setting because the effect of bilirubin encephalopathy is not reversible (a global prevalence of 56/100,000 live births) and hence estimated the number of impaired survivors with long-term impairment according to specific global regions (Table 5 and Figure 6).

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants — KAS 7 states that if more than 1 TcB or TSB measure is available, the rate of rise may be used to identify higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia, with a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL per hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL per hour thereafter) described as exceptional and suggesting hemolysis; in this case, obtain a DAT if not previously done (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade D, Option). Identification of a rapid rate of increase could lead to the identification of unrecognized hemolysis, but insufficient evidence is available to assess the test accuracy of different thresholds for the rate of rise or to recommend routinely obtaining more than 1 TcB or TSB measure. Because this is an option, a parental preference to avoid monitoring might lead to having only 1 TcB or TSB measure available and the rate of rise cannot be calculated; however, once a rapid rate of rise is identified, a DAT should be obtained if not previously even if parents prefer to avoid additional testing.

### A novel UGT1A1 gene mutation causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia: a case report [^111djRGM]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 14-year old female patient from Bangladesh presented with serum total bilirubin levels around 250 μmol/L and conjugated bilirubin (measured as direct bilirubin using the Diazo method) of around 10 μmol/L, indicating a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. According to her parents' description, her weight at birth was around 2000 g and 4 days after birth, her skin turned yellow. Clinical assessment revealed an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of 220 μmol/L without signs of erythrocyte hemolysis (major cause: ABO or Rh incompatibility). After undergoing phototherapy for 4 h a day for 4 consecutive days the serum total bilirubin levels were reduced to 153 μmol/L. The parents were advised to keep their daughter in the sunlight, but after a few months her serum total bilirubin increased again to over 300 μmol/L. From this point onward, the patient did not receive treatment and no clinical data is available because the family lives in the country side and has limited access to medical care. Between the age of 14 and 17 years her serum total bilirubin levels have been monitored and where stable around 200–250 μmol/L. Liver damage markers in serum were low (ALT) and a hemolytic cause of the hyperbilirubinemia was excluded with normal hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels (Table 1). These serum bilirubin levels without any treatment are in line with those seen in Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CNs) type II, indicating a partial deficiency of UGT1A1. However, inducing the residual UGT1A1 activity by administrating phenobarbital (30 mg/day) did not result in a significant change in total bilirubin (Table 1). The coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the UGT1A1 gene of the patient and parents was sequenced to determine what caused UGT1A1 deficiency and the absence of a response to phenobarbital.

Table 1
Laboratory results between 2015 and 2018 show an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without signs of liver damage or hemolysis

Sequencing of the UGT1A1 gene coding and promoter region

Sanger sequencing was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of amplified fragments of UGT1A1 gene and promoter region as previously described. The purified amplicons were sequenced using the internal primers listed in Additional file 1: Table S1.

### Factors associated with neonatal jaundice among neonates admitted at referral hospitals in northeast Ethiopia: a facility-based unmatched case-control study [^112H3DZc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal jaundice

It can be operationally defined as the condition characterized by the yellowing of the newborn's skin and the whites of the eyes, resulting from the accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Diagnosis is typically made by a medical professional through a physical examination, specifically observing the presence of yellow discoloration. Laboratory investigation is performed to confirm the diagnosis, typically involving the measurement of total serum bilirubin levels. A commonly used threshold for diagnosing neonatal jaundice is a total serum bilirubin level of 5 mg/dL (85 μmol/L) or higher, although specific thresholds may vary depending on the infant's age, gestational age, and other factors.

Neonatal sepsis

Neonatal sepsis was identified using a set of established clinical features known as the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) criteria. These criteria encompass a range of indicators that healthcare providers use to evaluate newborns for sepsis. Specifically, the presence of two or more of the following signs is considered: a persistent fever (≥ 37.5 °C) or prolonged hypothermia (≤ 35.5 °C) lasting for over an hour, rapid breathing (≥ 60 breaths per minute), severe chest indrawing, grunting, insufficient feeding, minimal movement unless stimulated, a bulging fontanelle, convulsions, lethargy, or unconsciousness. Additionally, at least two hematological criteria are taken into account, including the total leukocyte count (less than < 4000 or greater than > 12,000 cells/mm3), absolute neutrophil count (less than < 1500 cells/mm3 or greater than > 7500 cells/mm3), platelet count (less than < 150 or greater than > 450 cells/mm3), and random blood sugar (less than < 40 mg/dl or greater than > 125 mg/dl). By evaluating these clinical and hematological factors, healthcare professionals can make a diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

Polycythemia

It is defined as a condition characterized by an elevated hematocrit level or hemoglobin level in a peripheral venous blood sample. Specifically, polycythemia is diagnosed when the hematocrit level is equal to or greater than 65% or when the hemoglobin level is equal to or greater than 22 g/dL. These thresholds serve as indicators of increased red blood cell mass in the bloodstream. It is important to note that the diagnosis of polycythemia should consider other clinical factors, such as symptoms and medical history, to confirm the presence of the condition and rule out other potential causes.

METHODS

An international panel of haematologists, neonatologists and transfusion specialists was convened. A systematic search for articles published (1946–2021) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, HTA and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SR was completed (Appendix S1) and the systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42019142072). Study inclusion criteria were: (1) original peer‐reviewed; (2) at least five neonates with diagnosis or at risk of HDN; (3) comparing either of the following interventions: PT or ET, with IVIG; (4) reporting one of the following outcomes: bilirubin level, anaemia, frequency of RBC transfusions, neurocognitive outcome or mortality; (5) RCT or comparative trial; (6) English. A secondary search with a focus on ABO‐mediated HDN was performed. Two reviewers (LL, NS) screened publications for eligibility, independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using criteria established for the reporting of randomized and non‐randomized studies. Meta‐analyses were conducted if not available from previously published systematic reviews.

Recommendations were formulated on the basis of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and the level of evidence was graded as high, moderate, low or very low. Recommendation strength was evaluated as strong or conditional. The panel ranked clinical outcomes relevant for the development of recommendations according to GRADE. (Appendix S2) Web conferences and electronic correspondence were used to discuss the clinical questions and formulate recommendations. Electronic surveys were sent to members to assess agreement with recommendations. Disagreements were resolved by group discussions. If disagreements could not be resolved, a recommendation was accepted if the majority (≥ 50%) agreed. Members recorded their disclosures but none were excluded from voting. The final guidance document was sent to numerous societies for feedback (Appendix S3).

The recommendations will be reviewed every two years from publication. If a study is published that may impact patients prior to that time, a comment will be added on the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) website along with the guideline and additional resources for physicians and patients.

### Understanding and managing breast milk jaundice [^114ufjpV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2011). Low credibility.

The breastfed infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia can present a vexing clinical dilemma. Although it is a frequently observed and usually benign finding, prolonged jaundice in the breastfed newborn requires a thoughtful evaluation that excludes possible pathological aetiologies. While recommendations for the treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the first 7 days of life are straightforward, the approach to the breastfeeding infant with jaundice that persists beyond the immediate neonatal period is less clearly delineated. A sound understanding of bilirubin physiology and familiarity with current literature must guide the management of the otherwise well breastfeeding infant with prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Clinical State and Outcome Definitions

EHB is defined as total plasma/serum bilirubin > 25 mg/dl (428 µmol/l) or those treated with exchange blood transfusion. Kernicterus or CBE has been used as a clinical diagnosis that relies on a history of excessive prolonged hyperbilirubinemia and classical abnormalities of muscle tone, movement disorders, and aberrant processing disorders. Acute signs of extrapyramidal dysfunction may precede CBE. Acute bilirubin encephalopathy includes progressive changes in an infant's mental (behavioral) status, muscle tone, and distinct cry patterns. Acute clinical signs, initially described in 1955 by Crosse et al. are as follows: "the first 24 to 48 hours of life are the most critical. Signs develop in a baby who is jaundiced… and include head retraction, an expressionless facies, usually with oculogyric movements, changes in muscle tone, cyanotic attacks, refusal to suck, vomiting and hemorrhage prior to death. In severe cases these signs are self-evident but in those less affected they are easily missed… unless specifically sought". "Several babies who showed minimal signs have proved to be definite cases of kernicterus". Thus, neonatal mortality is due to respiratory failure and progressive coma or intractable seizures. An increased signal on magnetic resonance imaging of the globus pallidus and other areas prone to bilirubin neurotoxicity is often evidenced in surviving infants. Posticteric clinical sequelae include irreversible, but static, classic signs of athetoid cerebral palsy, generalized dystonia, paralysis of upward gaze, "kernicteric facies", and sensorineural hearing impairment. Neuromotor impairment secondary to abnormal muscle tone includes dystonia that is characterized by excessive or sustained contraction of opposing muscles during voluntary movements, in addition to hypertonia or hypotonia. Painful muscle cramps, incoordination of sucking, swallowing, and visuomotor function may manifest during early infancy. Cerebral palsy with choreoathetosis is another classic manifestation of kernicterus, which is characterized by involuntary movements or irregular muscle contractions that manifest as writhing or twisting. Paroxysmal movement disorders are often misdiagnosed and labeled as seizures. Hearing impairment is defined by sensorineural abnormalities ascertained by objective tests. Auditory system abnormalities with hyperbilirubinemia primarily involve brainstem nuclei, leading to abnormalities in auditory brainstem responses and detected by referred hearing screens during infancy. Auditory neuropathy, also called "auditory dyssynchrony", is often subtler and associated with childhood hearing impairment. Developmental delay or cognitive impairment, ascertained by the Bayley Mental Developmental Index, provides continuous variables to define the extent of aberrations for mental and psychomotor indexes. In addition, infants' intelligence can be estimated or tested for intelligence quotients of < 70 using the Wechsler Intelligence Score for Children. Cognitive impairment has been reported and possibly related to associated hearing impairment, neuromotor impairment, or, possibly due to social neglect. Other posticteric sequelae may result from subtle signs either with exposure to TB levels that are lower than EHB or following partial treatment of EHB. These "soft" perturbations of sensory processing disorders have been described as the syndrome of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or "BIND" but are intentionally not included in this study due to the limited data and consensus in definitions found in the literature.

### Caesarean section… [^114kd4rL]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The uterus is then opened with a second incision and the baby delivered. The incisions are then stitched closed. A woman can typically begin breastfeeding as soon as she is out of the operating room and awake. Often, several days are required in the hospital to recover sufficiently to return home. C-sections result in a small overall increase in poor outcomes in low-risk pregnancies. They also typically take about six weeks to heal from, longer than vaginal birth. The increased risks include breathing problems in the baby and amniotic fluid embolism and postpartum bleeding in the mother. Established guidelines recommend that caesarean sections not be used before 39 weeks of pregnancy without a medical reason. The method of delivery does not appear to affect subsequent sexual function.
- Large baby weighing > 4, 000 grams
- Umbilical cord abnormalities Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant diseases, include: Child Non-medically indicated childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother. " Newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be up to 3 times the number at 40 weeks and is elevated compared to 38 weeks gestation. These early-term births were associated with more death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks. Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but no adverse effects in the health of the mothers or babies.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and medical policymakers review research studies and find more incidence of suspected or proven sepsis, RDS, hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, need for NICU admission, and need for hospitalization > 4–5 days. In the case of caesarean sections, rates of respiratory death were 14 times higher in pre-labor at 37 compared with 40 weeks gestation, and 8. 2 times higher for pre-labor caesarean at 38 weeks. In this review, no studies found decreased neonatal morbidity due to non-medically indicated delivery before 39 weeks. For otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks. Vaginal delivery, in this case, does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section.

There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth. When the first twin is not head down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 37 weeks, and monochorionic twins by 36 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37-week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^1175pbwe]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In sharp contrast to the practice in most high-income nations, national guidelines for the effective management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia are rare in LMICs where the disease burden is greatest. In this paper, the authors have attempted to identify a number of key considerations for the effective management of hyperbilirubinaemia in LMICs that can be considered truly resource-poor, based on their HDI status. Most of the recommendations have been adapted from existing evidence or consensus-based guidelines in the industrialised world after extensive consultations at different stages with experts from various countries. Efforts were made to ensure that the proposed framework is consistent with universally accepted requirements for quality in healthcare. It is hoped that these recommendations will assist in the development of context-specific national guidelines and mobilisation of requisite resources for the care of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery in LMICs.

Despite publication of guidelines for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late-preterm newborn infants, kernicterus, although rare, continues to occur. Guidelines written for use in one country may not always be universally appropriate. Bearing this in mind, a committee appointed by the Israel Neonatal Society has formulated a set of guidelines, based on those of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004), but adapted to the realities of the Israeli scene. The guidelines include methods of surveillance of jaundice, prediction of jaundice, assessment of risk factors, discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up, in addition to therapeutic guidelines including indications for phototherapy, exchange transfusion and the use of intravenous immune globulin. Availability of these guidelines to the international community may offer direction to physicians of other countries who may be setting up guidelines for use in their own communities.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112aGL6f]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 10 — intensive phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia: Intensive phototherapy is recommended at the total serum bilirubin thresholds in Fig 2 (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Fig 1) or Fig 3 (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 2) on the basis of gestational age, hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors, and age of the infant in hours; this is an Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X recommendation. Intensive phototherapy can reduce TSB levels and decrease the need for escalation of care, including the need for exchange transfusion, to prevent kernicterus, and the phototherapy treatment thresholds are higher than those in the 2004 guideline but still leave a wide margin of safety. Potential harms include that two observational studies found a small increased risk of epilepsy in males treated with phototherapy; if causal, for approximately each 100 to 250 males treated with phototherapy, 1 will be diagnosed with epilepsy by 10 years of age. Families may vary in approach; for infants with TSB levels at or < 2 mg/dL above thresholds, families may prefer only blanket phototherapy (in the hospital or at home) or withholding phototherapy with very close follow-up of TSB concentrations. The evidence is strong that phototherapy reduces TSB concentrations and the need for exchange transfusion, but evidence is weak regarding the specific treatment threshold at which benefits exceed harms; even at these thresholds the number needed to treat to prevent 1 exchange transfusion may be in the hundreds or thousands, and the more the TSB exceeds the phototherapy threshold, the lower the number needed to treat.

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

### From A to AB: a caucasian mother with high anti-B titer causing hemolytic disease of the newborn [^116eurUb]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We report on a term infant with clinically significant hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia. Testing revealed ABO incompatibility between maternal type A and infant type AB. The maternal alloantibody screen was negative. The infant's direct antiglobulin test was positive, and anti-B IgG was eluted off the infant's red blood cells (RBCs). Testing of the mother's plasma revealed a high anti-B titer. The infant was successfully treated with phototherapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. The bilirubin and hematocrit stabilized, and the infant was discharged home. This case was unusual because of its severity and unusual ABO constellation. Furthermore, this report is an exemplary educational case study on how effective collaboration between the clinical team and the blood bank laboratory is critical in reaching the correct diagnosis. In summary, the differential diagnosis of more unusual and atypical ABO-incompatible constellations must be considered when an infant presents with unexplained hemolysis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider using the rate of increase to identify infants at higher risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia if > 1 transcutaneous bilirubin or total serum bilirubin measure is available. Suspect hemolysis in case of a rapid rate of increase (≥ 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first 24 hours or ≥ 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter). Obtain a direct antiglobulin test in this case if not previously done.

### Bili lighten.wikipedia.org › wiki › bili_light… [^112zWYAC]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

A bili light is a light therapy tool to treat newborn jaundice. High levels of bilirubin can cause brain damage, leading to cerebral palsy, auditory neuropathy, gaze abnormalities and dental enamel hypoplasia. The therapy uses a blue light that converts bilirubin into an -isomer that can be excreted in the urine and feces. Neonatal jaundice Jaundice is common in newborn babies and presents itself as yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes. About 50 percent of term and 80 percent of preterm infants develop jaundice in the first week of life. This condition also causes babies to appear sick, experience difficulty waking up, make high-pitch cries, or not be able to be fed or gain weight. Bilirubin is an orange yellow bile pigment that is produced as a byproduct of hemoglobin as red blood cells break down.

Bilirubin is then metabolized in the liver, recycled, and excreted in the bowel movements. When a baby has jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia, this can indicate that the baby's body is producing excess bilirubin or that the liver is too immature to be able to eliminate bilirubin fast enough. Feeding, in particular breastfeeding, the baby often in the first few days of birth can help lower the chances of developing jaundice, since the baby will pass more stool and the milk provides energy to the liver to allow metabolism of bilirubin. Uncontrolled levels of bilirubin can be harmful to the baby. Most neonatal jaundice shows during the first week after birth. In rare situations, a baby may experience seizures, deafness, cerebral palsy or mental retardation. Jaundice can be prevented and treated in the majority of cases.

Jaundice is more dangerous in certain cases such as babies who are born prematurely, babies who are underweight, babies who are going through an infection, babies who experienced a difficult delivery or have bruises and babies who have a blood group that is not compatible with their mothers. Phototherapy mechanism Jaundice in some babies can disappear within one to two weeks without treatment; however for babies with more severe jaundice, treatment is required. Traditional phototherapy devices include blue LEDs, halogen white light, and fluorescent tubes. A biliblanket is a phototherapy home treatment that consists of a portable illuminator and fiber-optic pad. It uses a pad of woven fibers to transfer light to a baby in order to treat neonatal jaundice.

It uses visible light to transform bilirubin into a more water-soluble form that allows it to dissolve easily in water and be eliminated. This therapy lowers the serum bilirubin level. The baby is placed on the fiber-optic pad, which has a disposable cover in direct contact with the baby's skin. This fiber-optic pad exposes the skin to light, and bilirubin is eliminated when light is absorbed. The biliblanket releases waves of blue or white light, when these are absorbed in the skin, bilirubin breaks down and is eliminated from the baby's blood stream. This lowers the yellowing effect in the baby's eyes and skin. Afterwards, blood needs to be tested to observe bilirubin levels and decide whether the biliblanket is still needed. The majority of babies that need a biliblanket use it for several days, but it depends on each baby's condition. Even though a biliblanket may cause loose stools and skin rashes, it is considered safe for the most part.

Case presentation

The patient was a 3-month-old girl born at 40 weeks of gestational age with a birth weight of 2600 g. She was the first child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. She had no history of phototherapy for jaundice. Newborn Screening and regular 1-month checkup were unremarkable. At 2 months of age, the patient's mother noticed jaundice and discolored stool and visited a local clinic. The infant's weight gain had been insufficient during the last month. Her body weight remained around 4500 g despite the fact that she had been fully breastfed 8 to 10 times/day. She had icteric sclera and her skin was yellowish brown. Laboratory examinations showed a total bilirubin concentration of 9.74 mg/dl, direct bilirubin concentration of 5.64 mg/dl, and prothrombin time–international normalized ratio of 1.2. The patient was referred to our hospital after intravenous vitamin K infusion.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children [^115Vx4qz]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of anatomic, infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases can lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, both in the newborn period and later in childhood. The pediatric practitioner is most likely to encounter conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period. It is crucial to maintain a high degree of suspicion for cholestasis in the persistently jaundiced newborn. The goal is recognition of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia between 2 and 4 weeks after birth, allowing for the prompt identification and management of infants who have biliary atresia, which remains the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis.

Hyperbilirubinemia — escalation-of-care threshold and KAS 17: Care should be escalated when an infant's total serum bilirubin (TSB) reaches or exceeds the escalation-of-care threshold, defined as 2 mg/dL below the exchange transfusion threshold; the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin value should not be subtracted from the total bilirubin value when determining management. Initiating escalation of care is a medical emergency, the escalation-of-care period starts from the time the infant's TSB result first mandates starting escalation of care and ends when the TSB is below the escalation of care threshold, and these infants are optimally managed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with consultation for urgent transfer to a NICU that can perform an exchange transfusion when needed. If possible, intensive phototherapy and intravenous hydration should be initiated and continued during hospital transfer, and whenever possible, the infant should be admitted directly to the NICU rather than through the emergency department to avoid delaying care.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^11558j4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^115xcXFD]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia is a ubiquitous transitional morbidity in the vast majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, inappropriate or ineffective treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (≥ 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of hyperbilirubinaemia through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on newborn jaundice from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G6PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. The need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels.

Exchange transfusion product and hematocrit targets, and bilirubin to albumin ratio: Cross-matched washed packed red blood cells mixed with thawed adult fresh-frozen plasma to a hematocrit approximating 40% is preferred for exchange transfusions, and keeping the hematocrit close to 40% will augment bilirubin removal. The bilirubin to albumin ratio can be used in conjunction with the TSB level to determine need for exchange transfusion; the treatment threshold, measured as TSB (measured in mg/ dL) divided by serum albumin (measured in g/dL), varies by gestational age and risk.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^1141nTa8]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Breast milk jaundice (prolonged jaundice associated with breast milk feeding) — duration and evaluation: Many breastfed infants have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that extends into the second and third week, but can continue for as long as 2–3 months; at 28 days, 21% of predominantly breastfed infants were still visibly jaundiced and 34% had a TcB ≥ 85 μmol/L (≥ 5 mg/dL). Prolonged jaundice beyond the second to third week in healthy breastfeeding newborns has been called breast milk jaundice to distinguish it from suboptimal intake jaundice, which should resolve by 1–2 weeks. Whenever jaundice in a breastfed newborn is prolonged beyond the third week, it is important to rule out cholestasis by measuring the direct or conjugated bilirubin level and to evaluate for other causes of prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If breast milk hyperbilirubinemia extends beyond 2 months, conditions such as ongoing undiagnosed hemolysis, Gilbert's syndrome, or the very rare Crigler–Najjar syndrome (with an incidence of 1 per million births) should be considered.

Hyperbilirubinemia — visual assessment, estimation accuracy, and early testing (KAS 4): KAS 4 states, "All infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at least every 12 hours following delivery until discharge. TSB or TcB should be measured as soon as possible for infants noted to be jaundiced < 24 hours after birth. (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation)". Visual estimation studies show differences as great as 13 to 15 mg/dL between the actual TSB or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and estimated values; however, if the infant is not jaundiced at all or the clinician's visual bilirubin estimate is < 5 mg/dL, a TSB ≥ 12 mg/dL is highly unlikely. Visual estimation is routinely used to guide decisions about obtaining TcB or TSB in term-born outpatients 3 or more days old, but all infants should have at least 1 TcB or TSB measured.

Phototherapy — treatment principles and thresholds: Intensive phototherapy requires a narrow-spectrum LED blue light with an irradiance of at least 30 μW/cm2 per nm at a wavelength around 475 nm, and light outside the 460 to 490 nm range provides unnecessary heat and potentially harmful wavelengths. The advantage of intensive phototherapy is that it can quickly lower the TSB and should shorten the duration of treatment, and the primary goal of phototherapy is to decrease the likelihood of further increases in the TSB concentration that would lead to a need for escalation of care, including exchange transfusion. The recommended phototherapy thresholds are far below those at which overt acute bilirubin neurotoxicity or kernicterus occurs, and the committee determined that new evidence justified raising the phototherapy treatment thresholds by a narrow range. Phototherapy should not be used solely with a goal of preventing subtle adverse neurodevelopmental findings, and there is some evidence that phototherapy may lead to a small increase in the risk of subsequent childhood epilepsy; however, the committee believes that the benefit of phototherapy exceeds the small potential risk of epilepsy when the TSB is at or above the phototherapy threshold. Although direct exposure to sunlight can decrease TSB, practical limitations mean it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common cause for newborn hospital admission. Although the cause of hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and self-limited, there is always a large differential diagnosis. Atypical presenting signs and symptoms, such as significant anemia or bleeding, should encourage further evaluation for underlying disorders, such as inherited coagulation defects. This article describes the case of a 5-day-old infant who presented to the emergency department with hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and ecchymoses from birth trauma.

### Direct bilirubin levels observed in prolonged neonatal jaundice: a retrospective cohort study [^117GESt2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged neonatal jaundice is yellowing of the skin and sclerae, secondary to hyperbilirubinaemia, persisting beyond 14 days after birth. It is very common — 20–30% of breastfed neonates are still jaundiced at 1 month — and is usually transient and benign; however, it can be an important indicator of serious underlying pathology. The most common cause is physiological jaundice (especially in breastfed neonates), but a number of disease processes must be excluded, including haemolysis, sepsis, hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, metabolic disease and liver disease (mainly congenital hepatitis B/C or biliary atresia). It is particularly important to diagnose biliary atresia as, although rare, it is the only cause that is usually asymptomatic but in which early specialist assessment and surgery (Kasai portoenterostomy; ideally within 6–8 weeks of age) are crucial for prognosis. The abnormality of the biliary tree causes an obstructive jaundice with conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas physiological jaundice and almost all other pathological causes result in a predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence — the primary publisher of UK clinical guidelines (NICE) — guidance is that the cause of prolonged jaundice requires investigation and referral for any neonate with a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia > 25 µmol/L, but this is based on no referenced data. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHN) recently released an updated guideline in collaboration with their European Society (ESPGHN) recommending further investigation under the definition of an abnormal direct bilirubin (a slight overestimate of conjugated bilirubin — see the Methods section) as > 1.0 mg/dL (17.2 µmol/L). Their previous guideline, which also incorporated the direct–total bilirubin ratio, acknowledged that their thresholds are based on 'lower quality studies'. And they now state that the move away from using the ratio is for simplicity rather than any novel evidence.

Treatment at these levels may prevent kernicterus, and risks of exchange transfusion include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the care of newborns with hyperbilirubinaemia in LMICs.

The objective tests for estimating and monitoring the degree of jaundice are transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and/or TSB. TcB is a non-invasive, portable screening tool ideally used to determine the need for the more accurate TSB which requires a venous or capillary blood sample. TcB values above 12 mg/dl (205 μmol/L) should be checked where possible with TSB measurement. TcB becomes unreliable after commencement of phototherapy unless measurements are taken from an area of skin that has been shielded from phototherapy with a photo-opaque patch. However, currently these devices, especially TSB, may not be readily affordable in many resource-limited settings. Low-cost and minimally invasive point-of-care tools for plasma/serum bilirubin measurements are currently being piloted and hold promise for LMICs. The interpretation of TSB/TcB and the recommended actions are provided in Table 3. Besides TSB estimation, access to laboratory facilities for real-time clinical investigations should at a minimum include evaluation of blood group incompatibilities and G6PD status.

Notes:

- → The above levels are primarily adapted from the high/medium risk categories of AAP guidelines. Generally, levels of 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L) below AAP recommendations are proposed due to multiple confounding factors such as the high risk status of many infants in LMICs, the limited facilities for clinical investigations, quality variability of phototherapy devices and the high incidence of ABE/kernicterus in many LMICs [e.g. see Guidelines #15 & 17 in Additional file 1: Table S1]. Phototherapy and especially exchange transfusion levels at or near those recommended by the AAP or NICE exchange guidelines should be strongly considered in tertiary care settings with intensive phototherapy.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^114SbPka]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

Hyperbilirubinemia of the newborn — prevalence and thresholds indicate that "Virtually all newborns have some elevation of their total serum bilirubin (TSB) (> 90% of which is unconjugated or indirect reacting) relative to normal adult values, which are < 17 μmol/L (≤ 1.0 mg/dL)". In the first week, "more than 80% of newborns appear jaundiced" and, depending on population mix, "about 75% have a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) of > 100–150 μmol/L (> 6–9 mg/dL) by 96 hours". The protocol notes that "The term physiologic jaundice is often used to describe newborns with a TSB well above normal adult levels, but not attributable to a specific cause such as hemolytic disease; however, such terminology may be inappropriate because having an unknown etiology does not necessarily mean that a condition is physiologic".

### Neonatal cholestasis [^116G6aU4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Any infant who is jaundiced beyond two to three weeks of life should be evaluated for neonatal cholestasis. Neonatal cholestasis is defined as accumulation of bile substances in blood due to impaired excretion. These infants should always have fractionated serum bilirubin levels checked to differentiate the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia of cholestasis from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is usually benign and spontaneously resolves. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, pale stools and dark urine are the cardinal features of neonatal cholestasis. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive and a systematic approach is helpful to quickly establish the diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis and affected infants need surgery before 60 days of life for better prognosis. Premature infants have multifactorial cholestasis and need a modified approach to the evaluation of cholestasis. Management of cholestasis is mostly supportive, consisting of medical management of complications of chronic cholestasis like pruritus and nutritional support for malabsorption and vitamin deficiency.

Neonatal jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby due to high bilirubin levels. Other symptoms may include excess sleepiness or poor feeding. Complications may include seizures, cerebral palsy, or bilirubin encephalopathy. In most cases, there is no specific underlying physiologic disorder. In other cases it results from red blood cell breakdown, liver disease, infection, hypothyroidism, or metabolic disorders. A bilirubin level more than 34 μmol/L may be visible. Concerns, in otherwise healthy babies, occur when levels are greater than 308 μmol/L, jaundice is noticed in the first day of life, there is a rapid rise in levels, jaundice lasts more than two weeks, or the baby appears unwell. In those with concerning findings further investigations to determine the underlying cause are recommended. The need for treatment depends on bilirubin levels, the age of the child, and the underlying cause.

Treatments may include more frequent feeding, phototherapy, or exchange transfusions. In those who are born early more aggressive treatment tends to be required. Physiologic jaundice generally lasts less than seven days. The condition affects over half of babies in the first week of life. Of babies that are born early about 80% are affected. Globally over 100, 000 late-preterm and term babies die each year as a result of jaundice. Sign and symptoms The primary symptom is yellowish discoloration of the white part of the eyes and skin in a newborn baby. Other symptoms may include excess sleepiness or poor feeding. A bilirubin level more than 34 μmol/L may result in visible discoloration of the skin. For the feet to be affected with a visual pigment, the level generally must be over 255 μmol/L.

Non-organic causes Breastfeeding jaundice "Breastfeeding jaundice" is caused by insufficient breast milk intake, resulting in inadequate quantities of bowel movements to remove bilirubin from the body. This leads to increased enterohepatic circulation, resulting in increased reabsorption of bilirubin from the intestines. Usually occurring in the first week of life, most cases can be ameliorated by frequent breastfeeding sessions of sufficient duration to stimulate adequate milk production. Breast milk jaundice Whereas breastfeeding jaundice is a mechanical problem, breast milk jaundice is a biochemical occurrence and the higher bilirubin possibly acts as an antioxidant. Breast milk jaundice occurs later in the newborn period, with the bilirubin level usually peaking in the sixth to 14th days of life. This late-onset jaundice may develop in up to one third of healthy breastfed infants.

The gut is sterile at birth and normal gut flora takes time to establish. The bacteria in the adult gut convert conjugated bilirubin to stercobilinogen which is then oxidized to stercobilin and excreted in the stool. In the absence of sufficient bacteria, the bilirubin is de-conjugated by brush border β-glucuronidase and reabsorbed. In the newborn liver, activity of glucuronyl transferase is only at 0. 1–1% of adult levels, so conjugation of bilirubin is already reduced. Further inhibition of bilirubin conjugation leads to increased levels of bilirubin in the blood. However, these results have not been supported by subsequent studies.
3. An enzyme in breast milk called lipoprotein lipase produces increased concentration of nonesterified free fatty acids that inhibit hepatic glucuronyl transferase, which again leads to decreased conjugation and subsequent excretion of bilirubin.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113HDgEH]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia exchange transfusion thresholds with neurotoxicity risk factors — thresholds are based on expert opinion and uncertainty is noted in the first 24 hours; Use total serum bilirubin concentrations; do not subtract direct bilirubin from the total serum bilirubin. In rare severe cases when the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin (TSB), consult an expert. Hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include albumin < 3.0 g/dL, isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or other hemolytic conditions, sepsis, or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

KAS 17 — escalation of care should occur when an infant's TSB reaches or exceeds the escalation-of-care threshold, defined as 2 mg/dL below the exchange transfusion threshold, with the recommendation graded as Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation; escalation may prevent the need for an exchange transfusion or allow for a timelier exchange transfusion if it is necessary, which could help prevent kernicterus.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^115K5C5A]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

Exchange transfusion thresholds — scope and measurement guidance: Thresholds are given for infants with no recognized hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age and are based on expert opinion; use total serum bilirubin and do not subtract direct/conjugated bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include gestational age < 38 weeks, albumin < 3.0 g/dL, isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or other hemolytic conditions, sepsis, or significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### Anti-M antibodies as a cause of intrauterine fetal death and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia [^112cXT1a]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A preterm male infant (35 weeks), appropriate for gestational age with birth weight of 2.20 kg was born to a 28-year G2 P0 mother. The mother's blood group was A positive and the father's was B positive. Her first pregnancy was an intrauterine fetal death due to immune hydrops. The mother's blood was positive for indirect Coomb's test with 1:32 dilution and anti-M antibodies. This pregnancy was induced at 35 weeks of gestation. Investigations from the cord blood revealed A positive blood group, positive direct Coomb's test, haematocrit of 41.4%, cord reticulocyte count of 5.3% and total serum bilirubin (TSB) of 2.7 mg/dL. Phototherapy was started at 27 h of life for visible jaundice. In view of progressive pallor and a sudden rise of bilirubin, the infant was subjected to exchange transfusion on day 5 of life. The transfusion was given with O negative and anti-M antibodies negative donor blood. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) prior to exchange transfusion was 28 mg/dL and packed cell volume (PCV) was 21%. Phototherapy was continued for a total duration of 8 days.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to direct antiglobulin test, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a direct antiglobulin test in infants requiring phototherapy if the maternal antibody screen is positive, the mother's blood group is O regardless of Rh(D) status, or if the mother is Rh(D) negative.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.
