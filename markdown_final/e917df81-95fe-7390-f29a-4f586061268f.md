## Question

How do the dosing frequencies of metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate compare?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the dosing frequencies of metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate compare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinction between immediate-release tartrate and extended-release succinate. Then, I should verify labeled dosing frequencies across common indications. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data that explain the once-daily versus divided-dose patterns. After that, I should check guideline recommendations that operationalize frequency choices. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like perioperative protocols and summarize practical implications for adherence and clinical outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacologic difference, because that drives dosing frequency. Metoprolol tartrate is an immediate-release formulation with a short half-life around 3–4 hours, which necessitates divided dosing to maintain 24-hour beta-blockade, whereas metoprolol succinate is an extended-release formulation designed for once-daily administration with more stable plasma concentrations over 24 hours, supporting once-daily dosing in most indications [^28765a9d] [^553e43f3] [^79801ceb].

> I will now examine labeled dosing frequencies for metoprolol tartrate across indications to ensure I'm precise. For hypertension, the usual initial dose is 100 mg daily, but it is often given in two divided doses, and the effective range is 100–450 mg/day; importantly, lower once-daily doses may not sustain full 24-hour effect, prompting more frequent dosing in some patients [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a]. For angina, the usual initial dose is 100 mg/day given in two divided doses, with a typical range of 100–400 mg/day [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a]. For myocardial infarction, after IV loading, oral metoprolol tartrate is given 50 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours, then transitioned to 100 mg twice daily for maintenance, reinforcing the need for divided dosing in acute settings [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a] [^cc27c10a]. For atrial fibrillation or flutter rate control, oral dosing is typically 25–200 mg twice daily, again reflecting the short half-life and need for divided dosing to blunt adrenergic surges [^28765a9d] [^a994d76b] [^cc793c46].

> Next, I should review metoprolol succinate frequencies to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. For hypertension, the usual dose is 25–100 mg once daily, titrated to 100–400 mg once daily, with 24-hour blood pressure control supported by the ER formulation [^ec4fed04] [^9814ada0] [^a5937a89]. For angina, 100–400 mg once daily is standard, aligning with sustained beta-blockade over 24 hours [^a5937a89]. For heart failure, start low at 12.5–25 mg once daily and titrate every 2 weeks to a target of 200 mg once daily, which is the evidence-based regimen from MERIT-HF and contemporary guidelines [^e9d4fe58] [^f38575d0] [^13c310dd]. For atrial fibrillation rate control, 50–400 mg once daily or divided every 12 hours is acceptable, though many patients are managed with once-daily dosing when adequate rate control is achieved [^a0baa385].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about equivalence of total daily doses across formulations. I should double-check pharmacodynamic data. Controlled studies show that once-daily metoprolol succinate provides comparable or greater total 24-hour beta1-blockade than the same total dose of immediate-release metoprolol given in divided doses, with more stable heart rate suppression across the dosing interval, which explains why succinate is generally dosed once daily while tartrate requires divided dosing to avoid end-of-dose wearing [^553e43f3] [^79801ceb] [^03624608].

> Next, I should review guideline syntheses to ensure my interpretation matches best practice. Contemporary ACC/AHA guidance lists metoprolol tartrate dosing as 100–200 mg/day in two divided doses for hypertension, whereas metoprolol succinate is dosed 50–200 mg/day once daily, reflecting both pharmacokinetics and trial-based dosing strategies; in heart failure, only metoprolol succinate is recommended among beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit, titrated to 200 mg once daily when tolerated [^1074b914] [^786570aa] [^13c310dd]. The VA/DoD hypertension guideline similarly notes metoprolol tartrate 50–300 mg/day in divided doses versus metoprolol succinate 25–200 mg/day once daily, reinforcing the frequency distinction in routine care [^6240930a].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is perioperative or acute care where protocols differ. I need to check that. In the POISE perioperative trial, extended-release metoprolol succinate was initiated at 100 mg 2–4 hours pre-op and continued at 200 mg daily for 30 days, a protocol that highlighted both feasibility of once-daily ER dosing and safety concerns in high-risk surgical populations, which is why routine perioperative initiation of high-dose beta-blockade is discouraged outside specific protocols [^ccf8c1c7] [^5ffc452e]. For acute MI, immediate-release tartrate is used every 6 hours initially to rapidly achieve steady-state beta-blockade, again reflecting the short half-life and need for divided dosing in the acute phase [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a].

> I should confirm special populations and practical counseling points that affect frequency choice. In hepatic impairment, both formulations require lower starting doses and slower titration because metoprolol is hepatically metabolized, but this does not change the fundamental frequency principle of divided dosing for tartrate versus once-daily for succinate [^ff102c64] [^b953f298]. For adherence, once-daily succinate is often preferred when clinically appropriate, though tartrate can be used once daily at higher total doses if blood pressure near the end of the interval remains acceptable; if not, splitting the dose improves 24-hour control, which is why clinicians should check BP near the end of the dosing interval when using tartrate [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Metoprolol tartrate, as immediate-release, generally requires divided dosing, commonly twice daily and sometimes more frequently in acute settings, to maintain continuous beta-blockade over 24 hours, whereas metoprolol succinate, as extended-release, is designed for once-daily dosing across hypertension, angina, and heart failure, with guideline-endorsed targets of 200 mg once daily in HFrEF and 50–200 mg once daily for hypertension, aligning frequency with pharmacokinetics and outcome data [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a] [^553e43f3] [^13c310dd] [^1074b914].

---

Metoprolol tartrate is dosed **2–4 times daily** due to its short half-life, whereas metoprolol succinate is dosed **once daily** because of its extended-release formulation that maintains stable beta-blockade over 24 hours [^553e43f3]. Once-daily succinate improves adherence and provides smoother blood pressure control, while tartrate may be preferred when rapid titration or flexible dosing is needed. Both formulations require dose adjustment in hepatic impairment and should be tapered gradually to avoid rebound effects [^ff102c64] [^61209495].

---

## Pharmacokinetic differences influencing dosing frequency

| **Parameter** | **Metoprolol tartrate (immediate-release)** | **Metoprolol succinate (extended-release)** |
|-|-|-|
| Half-life | 3–7 hours | 12–24 hours |
| Peak plasma concentration | 1–2 hours | 6–8 hours |
| Duration of action | 6–12 hours | 24 hours |
| Dosing frequency | 2–4 times daily | Once daily |

---

Metoprolol tartrate's short half-life necessitates **multiple daily doses** to sustain therapeutic effect, whereas metoprolol succinate's extended-release design provides consistent beta-blockade with **once-daily dosing** [^553e43f3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing frequencies

- **Metoprolol tartrate**: Clinical trials show that 100–400 mg/day in divided doses effectively controls hypertension and angina, but lower once-daily doses may wane by 24 hours, requiring divided dosing for full-day control [^01419ed7] [^bfd3e84a].

- **Metoprolol succinate**: Once-daily dosing (50–400 mg) provides 24-hour beta-blockade comparable to divided tartrate dosing, with smoother heart rate and blood pressure control and better adherence [^553e43f3] [^79801ceb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines align with pharmacokinetics: tartrate is dosed **2–4 times daily**, and succinate is dosed **once daily**. For heart failure, succinate is preferred and titrated to 200 mg once daily [^13c310dd] [^1074b914].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Once-daily succinate improves adherence and quality of life versus divided tartrate dosing, and fewer daily doses reduce missed doses and simplify regimens, which is especially beneficial in polypharmacy.

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing formulation choice

- **Metoprolol tartrate**: Useful when rapid titration or flexible dosing is needed (e.g. acute settings, inpatient titration, or when adjusting for side effects).

- **Metoprolol succinate**: Preferred for chronic therapy, maintenance treatment, and patients with adherence challenges.

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

Both formulations require **cautious dosing in hepatic impairment** because metabolism is reduced; start low and titrate slowly [^ff102c64] [^b953f298]. No routine renal dose adjustment is needed, but monitor closely in significant renal dysfunction [^ff102c64] [^12112c8c].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Both formulations can cause bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue; monitor heart rate and blood pressure during titration. To reduce rebound hypertension or ischemia, **taper gradually over 1–2 weeks** when discontinuing [^61209495].

---

Metoprolol tartrate is dosed **2–4 times daily**, whereas metoprolol succinate is dosed **once daily**. Succinate's once-daily regimen supports better adherence and smoother control, while tartrate offers flexibility for rapid titration; choose based on clinical context and patient factors.

2.1 Hypertension

Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day.

2.2 Angina Pectoris

The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Myocardial Infarction

See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Hypertension

Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100–450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. Beta1selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol tartrate is increased.

Angina Pectoris

The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals.

Late Treatment:

Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1–3 years.

Special populations

Pediatric patients: No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate in pediatric patients have not been established.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate is required in patients with renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment: Metoprolol tartrate blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate should be initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response.

Geriatric patients (> 65 years): In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Method of administration:

For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate either before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol tartrate with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of metoprolol tartrate have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of metoprolol tartrate in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol tartrate in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol tartrate in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol tartrate is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

8.7 Renal Impairment

The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. No reduction in dosage is needed in patients with chronic renal failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100–400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1–2 weeks (see WARNINGS).

Myocardial Infarction

Early Treatment:

During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized.

Begin treatment in this early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous administration of metoprolol tartrate, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.

In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late Treatment below).

Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate (see WARNINGS).

### Metoprolol succinate er tablets (metoprolol succinate) [^b953f298]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets (0.2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

- Dose-response for reduction in DBP,

- 1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and

- 2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients. Safety and effectiveness of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

### Antihypertensive medication regimens used by US adults with hypertension and the potential for fixed-dose combination products: the national health and nutrition examination surveys 2015 to 2020 [^7d827243]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg recommended by the US guidelines for most US adults with hypertension will not be achieved without improvements in how antihypertensive medications are prescribed and used. In the current study, only 52.6% of US adults with hypertension taking ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications had a measured BP below this threshold. Improving the rate of medication intensification (ie, avoiding therapeutic inertia) may be the most important factor to improve BP control rates.FDC products are one method to prevent therapeutic inertia and improve medication adherence, yet no qualitative studies have explored why FDC use is low in current practice, which is surely related to reasons beyond simple availability (eg, cost and titration difficulties). Such qualitative research may isolate if any clinician‐specific hesitations exist to using FDCs and investigate how clinicians choose to prescribe class combinations or specific medications. Further research on longitudinal treatment patterns in patients with hypertension may shed light on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of regimens and how to encourage the use of evidence‐based therapy across the treatment continuum.

The current study's strengths include robust medication data collection among participants representative of the US population. NHANES is payer agnostic, reflecting real‐world medication use and practice patterns irrespective of care delivery model. Results may differ among specific populations by age or insurance type (eg, integrated care delivery systems). The study is limited in that medication dose is unavailable in NHANES, and we could not differentiate between use of FDCs with metoprolol tartrate versus succinate. Furthermore, as the current study is cross‐sectional, we cannot determine the regimen appropriateness for each participant. This study's results are dependent on the assumption that the entire regimen had to be available as 1 FDC. It is possible that results would differ if the regimen could be achieved through ≥ 2 FDCs, although based on the infrequent use (< 0.5%) of 1 of the commercially available FDCs in the current analysis and lack of comprehensive FDCs with β‐blockers and CCB classes, we do not anticipate materially different results if this assumption were relaxed. Finally, some regimens and FDC products are favorable over others because of preferred class combinations or formulation as once‐daily dosing frequencies, but this was beyond the scope of our current analysis.

### Meta-analysis of the effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol on all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure [^0e6de128]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term treatment with appropriate doses of carvedilol or metoprolol is currently recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to decrease the risk of death, hospitalizations, and patients' symptoms. It remains unclear if the β blockers used in patients with HFrEF are equal or carvedilol is superior to metoprolol types. We performed a meta-analysis of the comparative effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate and succinate on all-cause mortality and/or hospitalization. We conducted an Embase and MEDLINE search for prospective controlled trials and cohort studies of patients with HFrEF who were received to treatment with carvedilol versus metoprolol. We identified 4 prospective controlled and 6 cohort studies with 30,943 patients who received carvedilol and 69,925 patients on metoprolol types (tartrate and succinate) with an average follow-up duration of 36.4 months. All-cause mortality was reduced in prospective studies with carvedilol versus metoprolol tartrate. Neither all-cause mortality nor hospitalizations were significantly different between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in the cohort studies. In conclusion, in patients with HFrEF, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate have similar effects in reducing all-cause mortality.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets.

Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

2.4 Administration

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are scored and can be divided; however, do not crush or chew the whole or half tablet.

8.4 Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of metoprolol succinate (0.2, 1 or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

- Dose-response for reduction in DBP,

- 1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and

- 2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients.

Safety and effectiveness of metoprolol succinate have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of metoprolol succinate in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to metoprolol succinate in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with metoprolol succinate in patients with hepatic impairment. Because metoprolol succinate is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n = 1,990) to placebo (n = 2,001), 10.3% of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Adverse Reactions Occurring in the MERIT-HF Study at an Incidence ≥ 1% in the Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets Group and Greater Than Placebo by More Than 0.5%

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta1-blocking effects in the range of 30 to 80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta1-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.

In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, extended-release metoprolol succinate administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta1-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta1-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. In another controlled study, 50 mg once daily for each product, extended-release metoprolol succinate produced significantly higher total beta1-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. For extended-release metoprolol succinate, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta1-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of extended release metoprolol succinate are reduced by 50 to 75% on average compared to a corresponding dose of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate, both when administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was reduced by 25% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate. The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose. The exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule are similar to that of TOPROL-XL®tablet.

Absorption

Plasma levels following oral administration of metoprolol tablet approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration of metoprolol is attained at 10 hours following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release capsule.

Effect of food

Compared to fasted state administration, high-fat, high-calorie meal (54.3% fat, 15.6% proteins and 30.1% carbohydrates) did not have a significant effect on the absorption of KAPSPARGO Sprinkle.

### Atenolol is associated with lower day-of-surgery heart rate compared to long-and short-acting metoprolol [^56ee692b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The authors analyzed the association between outpatient β-blocker type and day-of-surgery (DOS) heart rate in ambulatory surgical patients. They further investigated whether differences in DOS heart rate between atenolol and metoprolol could be explained by once-daily versus twice-daily dosing regimens.

Design

Retrospective observational study.

Setting

Veterans Administration hospital.

Participants

Ambulatory surgical patients on long-term atenolol or metoprolol.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Using a propensity-score-matched cohort, DOS heart rates were compared in patients prescribed atenolol versus metoprolol. Then, once-daily and twice-daily metoprolol formulations were differentiated and DOS heart rates were compared within a general linear model. DOS heart rates in patients prescribed atenolol versus any metoprolol formulation were slower by a mean of 5.1 beats/min (66.6 v 71.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] of difference, 1.9–8.3; p = 0.002), a difference that was not observed in preoperative primary care visits. The general linear model showed that patients prescribed atenolol (typically once-daily dosing) had a mean DOS heart rate 5.6 beats/min lower compared with patients prescribed once-daily metoprolol succinate (68.9 v 74.5; 95% CI of difference, -8.6 to -2.6; p < 0.001) and 3.8 beats/min lower compared with patients prescribed twice-daily metoprolol tartrate (68.9 v 72.7; 95% CI of difference, -6.1 to -1.6; p < 0.001). DOS heart rates were similar between different formulations of metoprolol (95% CI of difference, -1.0 to +4.6; p = 0.22).

Conclusions

Atenolol is associated with a lower DOS heart rate versus metoprolol. The heart rate difference is specific to the day of surgery and is not explained by once-daily versus twice-daily dosing regimens.

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8 mmHg /4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate with PLENDIL®has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta- blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, Metoprolol Tartrate Injection was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction.

Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol Tartrate Injection or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with Metoprolol Tartrate Injection or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given Metoprolol Tartrate Injection and followed up to 1 year.

The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the Metoprolol Tartrate Injection-and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with Metoprolol Tartrate Injection, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with Metoprolol Tartrate Injection and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.

In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta blockers.

### Extended-release metoprolol succinate in chronic heart failure [^d0ae44a1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of extended-release (ER) metoprolol succinate and its role in the management of chronic heart failure.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1990-October 2002) was conducted using congestive heart failure and metoprolol CR/XL or metoprolol CR/ZOK as search terms to identify pertinent studies.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, with priority given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Data Synthesis

ER metoprolol succinate is a controlled-release tablet designed to produce even and consistent beta(1)-blockade throughout the 24-hour dosing interval, with less fluctuation in metoprolol plasma concentrations compared with immediate-release metoprolol. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of ER metoprolol succinate in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus. ER metoprolol succinate was generally well tolerated, with a similar proportion of patients discontinuing therapy due to adverse events relative to placebo (9.8% and 11.7%, respectively).

Conclusions

ER metoprolol succinate therapy provides substantial mortality and morbidity benefits in patients with New York Heart Association class II and III heart failure who are stabilized on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics. ER metoprolol succinate is administered once daily, is well tolerated, and provides consistent beta(1)-blockade over the 24-hour dosing interval.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

### Long-term mortality associated with use of carvedilol versus metoprolol in heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^186f46d8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The pharmacologic mechanism behind a theorized difference in outcome between carvedilol and metoprolol in the T2D population partly relates to impaired distribution of glucose to peripheral muscles and increased insulin resistance associated with the HF state. By blockage of the alpha receptors, carvedilol is thought to improve glucose distribution to peripheral tissue, theoretically thereby having the potential to improve glycemic control and possibly outcomes in patients with T2D and HF. Consistent with this proposed pharmacologic mechanism, there was a lower rate of incident T2D in patients free from T2D at the start of follow up for carvedilol versus metoprolol users in both COMET and our study (HR, 0.78 [95% CI 0.61–0.997] in the COMET study versus 0.83 [0.75–0.91] in our study). Further, to our knowledge, a subgroup analysis of COMET is the one study to date that examined mortality differences in carvedilol versus metoprolol in patients with T2D and HF. Ultimately, COMET suggested a small but insignificant reduction in mortality for carvedilol over metoprolol in patients with T2D (HR, 0.85 [0.69–1.06], P = 0.147), but with the limitation that the target dose of carvedilol (25 mg BID) was relatively higher than the target dose of metoprolol (50 mg BID, respectively). While there was no marginal mortality benefit for carvedilol in our study, our findings are overall consistent with other observational studies in the general HF population to date. Further, our study was based on a real‐world Danish sample where titration to maximally tolerated dosing of carvedilol (50 mg BID) and metoprolol (200 mg daily) was recommended, consistent with HF guidelines. A second possible explanation for the difference between our study and the COMET trial was that the patients included in the COMET study used only metoprolol tartrate, while metoprolol succinate is the standard practice in the long‐term HF treatment in Denmark.

### Impact of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on clinical efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate [^ba6f9a6e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Metoprolol is a selective β-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that undergoes extensive metabolism by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Our objective was to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol tartrate. Two hundred and eighty-one participants with uncomplicated hypertension received 50mg of metoprolol twice daily followed by response-guided titration to 100mg twice daily. Phenotypes were assigned based on results of CYP2D6 genotyping and copy number variation assays. Clinical response to metoprolol and adverse effect rates were analyzed in relation to CYP2D6 phenotypes using appropriate statistical tests. Heart rate response differed significantly by CYP2D6 phenotype (P < 0.0001), with poor and intermediate metabolizers showing greater reduction. However, blood pressure response and adverse effect rates were not significantly different by CYP2D6 phenotype. Other than a significant difference in heart rate response, CYP2D6 polymorphisms were not determinants of variability in metoprolol response or tolerability.

14.1	Hypertension

In a double-blind study, 1092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily TOPROL-XL (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL®(felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, TOPROL-XL alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6–8/4–7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of TOPROL-XL with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.

In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100–450 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β1-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, TOPROL-XL administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.

14.2 Angina Pectoris

In controlled clinical trials, an immediate-release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. TOPROL-XL, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta- blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.

8.4	Pediatric Use

One hundred forty-four hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years were randomized to placebo or to one of three dose levels of TOPROL-XL (0.2, 1or 2 mg/kg once daily) and followed for 4 weeks. The study did not meet its primary endpoint (dose response for reduction in SBP). Some pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated effectiveness including:

Dose-response for reduction in DBP,
1 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP, and
2 mg/kg vs. placebo for change in SBP and DBP.

The mean placebo corrected reductions in SBP ranged from 3 to 6 mmHg, and DBP from 1 to 5 mmHg. Mean reduction in heart rate ranged from 5 to 7 bpm but considerably greater reductions were seen in some individuals [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

No clinically relevant differences in the adverse event profile were observed for pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years as compared with adult patients.

Safety and effectiveness of TOPROL-XL have not been established in patients < 6 years of age.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of TOPROL-XL in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience in hypertensive patients has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.

Of the 1,990 patients with heart failure randomized to TOPROL-XL in the MERIT-HF trial, 50% (990) were 65 years of age and older and 12% (238) were 75 years of age and older. There were no notable differences in efficacy or the rate of adverse reactions between older and younger patients.

In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6	Hepatic Impairment

No studies have been performed with TOPROL-XL in patients with hepatic impairment. Because TOPROL-XL is metabolized by the liver, metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially with poor hepatic function. Therefore, initiate therapy at doses lower than those recommended for a given indication; and increase doses gradually in patients with impaired hepatic function.

8.7	Renal Impairment

The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects. No reduction in dosage is needed in patients with chronic renal failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^66ef8261]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Both men and women were included in the study and they were at the age 46 to 80 years old at the time the study took place. Three patients were excluded from the study after randomization, one in each treatment group. Two patients were excluded due to difficulties in cannulation at the second examination day and one patient was excluded because of an episode of unstable angina during the treatment period. Therefore nine patients in each treatment group completed the study.

The carvedilol doses achieved at baseline were similar in the three groups: 37.2 ± 5.3 mg a day in the group that was randomized to continue on carvedilol, 36.8 ± 5.6 mg a day in the group that was switched to metoprolol succinate treatment and 34.0 ± 6.5 mg a day in the group that was switched to metoprolol tartrate. After randomization and through the two-month treatment period, the doses of the respective treatments were as follows: 37.2 ± 5.3 mg a day of carvedilol, 147.2 ± 22.2 mg of metoprolol succinate and 130.6 ± 24.9 mg a day of metoprolol tartrate.

Baseline data and changes after the two-month treatment period are shown in table 1 for all three treatment groups as well as baseline data for the healthy control group. Nine, seven and four patients in the carvedilol, metoprolol succinate and metoprolol tartrate group respectively, received either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AT II antagonist). The use of statins as well as aspirin was equal in all three treatment groups. After initial screening, patients who were using other beta blockers than carvedilol were changed to carvedilol and those who where not using any, were initiated to treatment with carvedilol and titrated to the highest tolerable dose.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol tartrate. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol tartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Heart Failure

Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart-failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^aff550a5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Beta blocker treatment is a well-established therapy for heart failure (HF), but the drugs tested have different profiles of possible clinical consequence. In the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) treatment with carvedilol was found superior in patients with chronic heart failure when compared to metoprolol tartrate.

Patients with heart failure are characterized by having an impaired endothelial function regardless of the etiology of heart failure. An impaired endothelial function in patients with heart failure is associated with a poor prognosis and the severity of endothelial function in HF is proportional to the New York Heart Association heart failure classification (NYHA) in HF. We therefore designed this study to investigate whether metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate and carvedilol respectively affect vascular endothelial function and vascular insulin resistance differently in patients with chronic heart failure.

Patients with HF are at increased risk of developing diabetes and frequently demonstrate insulin resistance. In the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (Comet) study it was observed that metoprolol deteriorates metabolic glucose control whereas carvedilol does not and, accordingly, there was a larger number of new-onset diabetes in patients treated with metoprolol. We have observed that vascular insulin sensitivity was deteriorated after treatment with metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas no change was found after treatment with carvedilol. We hypothesized that changes in endothelial insulin sensitivity might be involved in the processes by which survival is different during treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol.

The beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocking effect of metoprolol tartrate has been doubted to be as effective as the beta-1 adrenergic blocking effect of both carvedilol and metoprolol succinate. We therefore performed a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as well as heart rate measurements in patients receiving either carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate to evaluate potential differences in the adrenergic effects among three treatment groups. We aimed to find potential differences among beta blockers, when used in recommended doses, to obtain what is thought to be equivalent treatment doses.

Conclusion

In our study we found no changes in vascular reactivity in patients with mild HF by changing treatment from carvedilol to metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate. Previous studies with metabolic advantages of carvedilol compared to metoprolol were not reflected in our study of forearm glucose uptake; no changes were seen between carvedilol or metoprolol treatment. Diurnal blood pressure and heart rate measurement indicate that treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol, both succinate and tartrate formulation is comparable regarding the beta1-adrenergic blocking effect.

### A comparison of anti-arrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^ade1d484]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The anti‐arrhythmic superiority of carvedilol to metoprolol has been demonstrated in some clinical situations. In a meta‐analysis, carvedilol was superior to metoprolol (tartrate) in reducing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery 14; however, little data exists to support the use of one medication over the other in prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction. The efficacy of carvedilol in reducing appropriate ICD therapies was previously demonstrated in a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. 15 In this post hoc analysis, carvedilol was associated with a reduction in incidence of ventricular arrhythmias which barely reached statistical significance (0.80 [95% CI: 0.63 to 1.00], P = 0.05) compared with metoprolol. However, 12% in the metoprolol arm used the tartrate preparation which is known to be inferior to carvedilol. 16 In addition, there were significant baseline differences (lesser number of ischemic CM in carvedilol group) which may have affected the outcome. In the current study, there was no significant difference in baseline parameters between carvedilol and metoprolol succinate and patients on metoprolol tartrate were excluded.

In the present study, carvedilol was not associated with a reduction in inappropriate ICD therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias compared to metoprolol succinate. This can be explained by the fact that in clinically used doses, the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on the atrioventricular node are similar which may result in reduced ventricular rate response in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. 17, 18, 19 The results of this study differ from a prior post hoc analysis of the MADIT CRT study which showed that carvedilol was superior to metoprolol in reducing inappropriate ICD therapies. 20 The present study included patients with both CRT and non‐CRT devices and may have been underpowered to detect a significant difference.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^ccf8c1c7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

POISE trial — extended-release metoprolol succinate protocol and eligibility are summarized as follows: Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to extended-release metoprolol succinate or placebo starting 2 to 4 hours before surgery and continued for 30 days, with a primary end point of a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest, and eligibility included an expected hospital stay of at least 24 hours with specified cardiovascular risk criteria. The first dose was 100 mg given 2 to 4 hours preoperatively; drug administration required a heart rate of 50 bpm or higher and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater; and if during the first 6 postoperative hours heart rate was 80 bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or higher the first postoperative 100 mg dose was given orally, otherwise it was given at 6 hours after surgery. Twelve hours after the first postoperative dose, patients took extended-release metoprolol 200 mg or placebo every day for 30 days; if heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 mm Hg the study drug was withheld and then restarted at 100 mg once daily, and if heart rate was consistently 45 to 49 bpm with systolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg the study drug was delayed for 12 hours. Patients unable to take oral medications received intravenous infusion options of a slow infusion of 15 mg over 60 minutes or a rapid infusion of 5 mg over 2 minutes every 5 minutes up to a total of 15 mg, and the final analysis included 8351 patients from 190 hospitals in 23 countries.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^8cb7c138]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

To complicate matters further, it is not possible to state with confidence that differences in dosing within the subtarget range lead to different benefits. Can we claim that 10 mg of enalapril daily is superior to 5 mg daily? Do we know that metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily is superior to 50 mg daily? Because physicians cannot answer these questions, it is not possible to make evidence‐based comparative judgments. One can only ask if the patient was treated using the forced‐titration strategies that were deployed in the landmark clinical trials. We cannot assume that subtarget strategies are ineffective or inferior, but we do know that they are untested and unproven.

Therefore, we can ask physicians to describe (i) whether patients are receiving each of the recommended neurohormonal antagonists; (ii) whether patients are being treated with target doses of each of these drugs; and (iii) if they are receiving the drug at subtarget doses, whether the patient had been tried on higher doses that could not be tolerated, despite reasonable efforts at rechallenge or adjustment of concomitant medications. Accordingly, three strata are proposed. Stratum I represents the deployment of the specific trial‐based strategies that have been shown to prolong survival, i.e. the use of target doses or the use of the highest tolerated doses using the forced‐titration regimens shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Stratum II represents the use of the drug at a subtarget dose for reasons that are unrelated to demonstrable and clinically important intolerance (e.g. patient or physician preferences, overemphasis of clinical stability, fears of the possibility of adverse effects, lack of knowledge of target doses); all of these reasons are grouped together in a non‐hierarchical manner. This stratum is intended to encompass the prescribing of drugs in all ways that do not specifically replicate the strategies that were utilized in the landmark clinical trials. Stratum III indicates that the patient is not receiving the critical drug at any dose.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of metoprolol tartrate. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol tartrate [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

### Carvedilol compared with metoprolol succinate in the treatment and prognosis of patients with stable chronic heart failure: carvedilol or metoprolol evaluation study [^27ee51fb]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

β-Blockers exert a prognostic benefit in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Their pharmacological properties vary. The only substantial comparative trial to date-the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial-has compared carvedilol with short-acting metoprolol tartrate at different dose equivalents. We therefore addressed the relative efficacy of equal doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate on survival in multicenter hospital outpatients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

Four thousand sixteen patients with stable systolic chronic heart failure who were using either carvedilol or metoprolol succinate were identified in the Norwegian Heart Failure Registry and The Heart Failure Registry of the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Patients were individually matched on both the dose equivalents and the respective propensity scores for β-blocker treatment. During a follow-up for 17 672 patient-years, it was found that 304 (27.2%) patients died in the carvedilol group and 1066 (36.8%) in the metoprolol group. In a univariable analysis of the general sample, metoprolol therapy was associated with higher mortality compared with carvedilol therapy (hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.69; P < 0.001). This difference was not seen after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–1.50; P = 0.75) and adjustment for propensity score and dose equivalents (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1.20; P = 0.36) or in the propensity and dose equivalent-matched sample (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.23; P = 0.99). These results were essentially unchanged for all prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions

In outpatients with chronic heart failure, no conclusive association between all-cause mortality and treatment with carvedilol or metoprolol succinate was observed after either multivariable adjustment or multilevel propensity score matching.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^488663a7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Design

Before randomization all patients were treated with carvedilol for at period of at least two months to ensure equal use of beta blockers at baseline. Patients receiving beta blocker treatment at the time they were included in the study, had their beta blocker treatment changed to carvedilol. If the patients were beta blocker naïve at the time of inclusion, they started treatment with carvedilol and titrated to the highest tolerable dose. The patients were then randomized to receive treatment with carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate for a period of two months. The group of patients who continued on carvedilol treatment served as time-control. Patients were otherwise kept on their usual medication throughout the whole study period.

Ten patients were randomized to receive carvedilol with a target dose of 50 mg a day; ten patients were randomized to receive metoprolol succinate with a target dose of 200 mg a day and ten patients were randomized to receive metoprolol tartrate with a target dose of 200 mg a day.

The study was designed as an open parallel group study. Before and after the two months randomization period an examination of endothelial function as well as insulin stimulated endothelial function was performed by venous occlusion plethysmography as described in the following section. Forearm glucose uptake was measured during intra-arterial insulin infusion both before and after the treatment period. 24 hour blood pressure and heart rate measurements were also done before and after the two months randomization period.

### Do metoprolol and carvedilol have equivalent effects on diurnal heart rate in patients with chronic heart failure? [^4a30c9cb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol exerted a greater reduction in mortality than metoprolol tartrate in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET). However, it is unclear if the degree and time course of beta1-blockade during a 24-h period was similar with each agent at the doses used. Therefore we analyzed 24-h ECG Holter recordings from a study which compared the long-term clinical efficacy of metoprolol tartrate to carvedilol in chronic heart failure patients using the same dosing regimen as in COMET.

Methods and Results

Fifty-one patients with chronic heart failure with a mean LVEF 26 ± 1.8% were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid or carvedilol 25 mg bid. 24-h ECG monitoring (Holter) was performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year. Adequate quality recordings for analysis were obtained from 43 subjects at baseline, 42 at 12 weeks and 29 subjects at 1 year. Both drugs produced a fall in average 24-h heart rate from baseline at 12 weeks and at 1 year: metoprolol 88 ± 3 to 71 ± 2 and 69 ± 3 bpm; carvedilol 83 ± 3 to 70 ± 2 and 70 ± 3 bpm respectively (all p < 0.001). The pattern of suppression of heart rate during the 24-h period was similar for both drugs.

Conclusion

Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg bid and carvedilol 25 mg bid had similar effects on 24-h heart rate. This result suggests that the degree of beta1-blockade produced by these two drugs in these doses is comparable and the superior survival effect of carvedilol compared to metoprolol seen in COMET is likely to be due to actions of carvedilol other than beta1-blockade.

### Endothelial function is unaffected by changing between carvedilol and metoprolol in patients with heart failure – a randomized study [^d32dee6d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Different groups of beta blockers might have different effects on blood pressure and heart rate. We therefore did a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate measurement in a subgroup of patients from all three treatment groups. When testing the patients on first carvedilol treatment, since treatment with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, we found no difference between the beta blocker treatment groups. In a study by Sanderson a 24-hour heart rate evaluation was done in patients with HF; they compared treatment with carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate and found no difference in diurnal heart rate. In our study we examined groups treated with either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at comparable doses and found no changes in either diurnal blood pressure or heart rate. This indicates that metoprolol tartrate instead of metoprolol succinate did not cause a different effect of beta1-adrenergic blockade at doses chosen in our study. In a direct comparison among patients with HF, no differences in hemodynamic parameters were found either between treatments with metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate at equal doses.

Study Limitation

Our patients were already treated with carvedilol at the first examination of endothelial function. Methodologically, it would have been an advantage to the study if patients were beta blocker naïve at entering the study. We found it unethical to withdraw beta blocker treatment in patients with a proven benefit of treatment and risk of worsening of heart failure symptoms in the situation of withdrawal of beta blocker treatment.

A limitation to the study could be the relative small number of patients included. With 9 patients in each group we were not able to show any difference in endothelial function between different beta blocker treatments. The fact that we did not find any difference in endothelial function could be explained by the short treatment period and a risk of a carry over effect.

### Association of treatment with carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate and mortality in patients with heart failure [^d0268343]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

The β-blockers carvedilol and metoprolol succinate both reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), but the comparative clinical effectiveness of these drugs is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether carvedilol is associated with improved survival compared with metoprolol succinate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study of patients with incident HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (≤ 40%) who received carvedilol (n = 6026) or metoprolol succinate (n = 5638) using data from a Danish national HF registry linked with health care and administrative databases.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality (primary outcome) and cardiovascular mortality (secondary outcome) were analyzed using Cox regression with adjustment for a propensity score, derived from a range of clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the patients was 69.3 (9.1) years, 71% were men, and 51% were hospitalized at index HF diagnosis. During a median (interquartile range) 2.4 (1.0–3.0) years of follow-up, 875 carvedilol users and 754 metoprolol users died; the cumulative incidence of mortality was 18.3% and 18.8%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for carvedilol users vs metoprolol users was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.11), corresponding to an absolute risk difference of -0.07 (95% CI, -0.84 to 0.77) deaths per 100 person-years. Estimates were consistent across subgroup analyses by sex, age, levels of LVEF, New York Heart Association classification, and history of ischemic heart disease. A higher proportion of carvedilol users achieved the recommended daily target dose (50 mg; 3124 [52%]) than did metoprolol users (200 mg; 689 [12%]); among patients who reached the target dose, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72–1.30). A robustness analysis with 1:1 propensity score matching confirmed the primary findings (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.84–1.13]). The adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.88–1.26).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings from real-world clinical practice indicate that the effectiveness of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate in patients with HF is similar.

### Long-term mortality associated with use of carvedilol versus metoprolol in heart failure patients with and without type 2 diabetes: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^ff0a4f51]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of β‐blockers have been shown to significantly reduce the mortality risk in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Specifically, the use of bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol have proven mortality benefit (versus placebo) in several large clinical trials over the years. Furthermore, while these 3 agents have generally been shown to be equivalent in observational studies, a randomized clinical trial (COMET [Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial]) comparing metoprolol tartrate 50 mg BID to carvedilol 25 mg BID suggested superiority of carvedilol. However, target dosages have been criticized for not being equipotent and differ from normal clinical practice (where metoprolol succinate is used at a target dose of 200 mg daily).

Carvedilol has been shown to have a better glycemic profile than metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, but it is not known if this difference is clinically important in patients with HFrEF. A secondary analysis of the COMET trial suggested that patients with HFrEF randomized to carvedilol had lower incidence of new‐onset diabetes compared with patients randomized to metoprolol. However, those with T2D had similar reductions in mortality with carvedilol treatment versus metoprolol treatment as non‐diabetic patients, suggesting that the metabolic advantages of carvedilol may not translate into additional mortality benefit in T2D.

Given the high prevalence of T2D among patients with HFrEF, the adverse outcomes associated with T2D in HFrEF, and the potential of carvedilol to mitigate some of the metabolic abnormalities in T2D, studies addressing the mortality associated with carvedilol versus metoprolol in people with T2D and HFrEF are warranted. We sought to compare mortality in patients with HFrEF and T2D taking carvedilol with those taking metoprolol (the 2 most commonly used β‐blockers in HF treatment), and to investigate potential differences in treatment effects associated with carvedilol between patients with and without T2D in a real‐world cohort of patients with new‐onset HFrEF. Additionally, we analyzed the risk of developing new‐onset T2D during follow‐up according to carvedilol versus metoprolol use in the sample free from T2D at baseline to investigate if carvedilol may have clinically beneficial effects on glucose‐metabolism in real life.

### Titration to target dose of bisoprolol vs. carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure: the CIBIS-ELD trial [^09fec571]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic heart failure is a growing epidemic associated with high mortality, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) impairment and is a substantial burden on health systems. Three key trials have randomized nearly 9000 patients with systolic heart failure to beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate controlled release) or placebo and demonstrated a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations. – Nevertheless, recent large international surveys have shown that only 20–40% of heart failure patients are taking beta-blockers and the mean dose is half the recommended target.

The underuse and underdosing of beta-blockers may reflect a reluctance to change practice stemming from their long-standing contraindication in heart failure. Conversely, it may reflect a true lack of tolerability of beta-blockers in patients who are typically relatively old, have co-morbidities, and are taking a range of other drugs. It is noteworthy that many previous beta-blocker trials included heart failure patients who were younger (mean age 61–64) than those encountered in routine practice (mean age 71–75). –,

Class effects may not be uniform and tolerability may differ between the commonly used beta-blockers, reflecting their distinct pharmacological profiles such as selectivity for the β 1 -adrenoceptor subtype (bisoprolol) or vasodilatory activity (carvedilol). However, differences in tolerability have not been systematically studied. If one proven beta-blocker were better tolerated than another it could be of considerable public health importance. Results of the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET), suggested that overall tolerability of carvedilol vs. metoprolol tartrate does not differ, but it has been suggested that this interpretation is problematic because doses were not equivalent. The second Carvedilol Open-Label Assessment found good tolerability for carvedilol in older heart failure patients, but no previous double-blind randomized trial had tolerability as the primary endpoint.

Exacerbation of Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should, in general, not receive beta blockers, including metoprolol tartrate. Because of its relative beta1selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1selectivity is not absolute use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and consider administering metoprolol tartrate in smaller doses three times daily, instead of larger doses two times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Bronchodilators, including beta2agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.

Diabetes and Hypoglycemia

Beta blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected.

Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

Thyrotoxicosis

Metoprolol tartrate may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade, which might precipitate a thyroid storm.

Adults: The usual initial dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily in a single dose. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied.

Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of age: The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 1 mg/kg once daily, but the maximum initial dose should not exceed 50 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response. Doses above 2 mg/kg (or in excess of 200 mg) once daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

TOPROL-XL has not been studied in pediatric patients < 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2.2 Angina Pectoris

Individualize the dosage of TOPROL-XL. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in a single dose. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1–2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.3 Heart Failure

Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of TOPROL-XL, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of TOPROL-XL is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of TOPROL-XL. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce TOPROL-XL. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of TOPROL-XL. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of TOPROL-XL, or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of TOPROL-XL should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.

### A comparison of anti-arrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol vs metoprolol succinate in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^25c82c7a]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

A total of 225 patients were included in the analysis (Figure 1). Table 1 depicts baseline characteristics of the cohort. There was no significant difference in age at implantation, gender distribution, race, or baseline comorbidities. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was similar at time of implantation and there was no significant difference in ischemic CM or history of ventricular arrhythmias (secondary prevention ICD). Mean dose of metoprolol succinate was 126 ± 86 mg/day(median 100 mg, IQR 50‐200) and for carvedilol was 37 ± 19 mg /day (median 50 mg, IQR 25‐50). When compared based on dose equivalency, significantly more patients in carvedilol group received higher doses (50 carvedilol vs 200 mg metoprolol, 57.8% vs 37.8%, P = 0.04; 25 carvedilol vs 100 mg metoprolol 18.4% vs 20.1%, p = NS; 12.5 carvedilol vs 50 mg metoprolol 17.1% vs 19.3%, p = NS; 6.25 carvedilol vs 25 mg metoprolol 6.6% vs 15.9%, P = 0.0007). CRT accounted for one third of the devices. Less than 10% of the cohorts were on anti‐arrhythmic agents at the time of implantation and use was equally distributed between the two groups.
