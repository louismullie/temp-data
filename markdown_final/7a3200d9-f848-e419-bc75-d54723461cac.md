## Question

timeline for echo in new onset atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timing of echocardiography in new-onset atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why echocardiography matters in new-onset AF. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about timing and whether they specify urgency. Next, I will examine the role of transthoracic versus transesophageal echocardiography and when each is indicated. After that, I should consider special scenarios like hemodynamic instability, stroke, and critical illness. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified timeline and note exceptions and follow-up needs, making sure I anchor each point to the best available guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why echocardiography is important in new-onset AF. New-onset AF often coexists with structural heart disease, heart failure, or valvular pathology, and echocardiography informs anticoagulation decisions, rhythm-control candidacy, and detection of thromboembolic risk, so timing can materially affect management and safety [^131e4e56] [^e04f92f6].

> Wait, let me verify what the major guidelines actually specify about timing. The 2024 ESC/EACTS guideline emphasizes a patient-centered AF-CARE pathway with comprehensive evaluation and dynamic reassessment, but it does not prescribe a fixed echo timeline, which means timing should be individualized to risk, symptoms, and suspected etiology rather than a one-size-fits-all delay or rush [^e04f92f6]. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline similarly stresses early rhythm control in selected patients and thorough structural assessment without a mandated echo deadline, reinforcing clinical judgment rather than a rigid schedule [^131e4e56].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish TTE from TEE because timing differs by indication. TTE is the first-line structural study in stable patients with new-onset AF to assess ventricular function, wall motion, valves, and atrial size, and it should be obtained promptly to guide anticoagulation and rhythm strategy, typically within days to a couple of weeks depending on acuity and risk, even though guidelines do not specify a hard deadline [^notfound]. TEE, in contrast, is reserved for specific scenarios such as pre-cardioversion when duration is uncertain or prolonged, suspected intracardiac thrombus, or persistent high thromboembolic risk, and it is often performed urgently when cardioversion is planned imminently [^notfound].

> I need to check special scenarios that compress the timeline. In hemodynamically unstable patients with AF or flutter, immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated, and if duration is unknown or prolonged, TEE to exclude thrombus before cardioversion is standard to mitigate stroke risk, so echo timing becomes "now" in that context [^78614778]. In acute ischemic stroke with newly detected AF, expert consensus recommends prolonged rhythm monitoring and timely echocardiography to identify cardioembolic sources and guide anticoagulation timing, again aligning echo with the clinical urgency rather than a fixed calendar [^eb29590d] [^07939d60]. In critical illness or ICU settings, critical care echocardiography is frequently used early to guide hemodynamics and anticoagulation decisions in new-onset AF, reflecting a "do not delay" approach when it will change management [^987b5bee] [^f551e040].

> Let me consider the outpatient, stable presentation more carefully. For stable, ambulatory new-onset AF, obtaining TTE within 1–2 weeks is reasonable to evaluate for structural heart disease, heart failure, and valvular pathology that influence anticoagulation and rhythm-control choices; if symptoms are mild and suspicion for structural disease is low, scheduling within 2–4 weeks may still be acceptable, but I should confirm that this delay does not postpone necessary anticoagulation or delay time-sensitive rhythm decisions [^notfound]. I should double-check that this interval aligns with pragmatic pathways showing early follow-up after ED diagnosis improves outcomes, which supports not deferring echo unnecessarily when it will inform therapy [^2a115377].

> But wait, what if the patient is young and otherwise healthy with clearly recent-onset, self-limited AF? In low-risk patients with a convincing short-duration episode and no red flags, it may be reasonable to prioritize rhythm documentation and anticoagulation risk scoring, and defer echo if clinical suspicion for structural disease is very low; however, I need to ensure we do not miss occult cardiomyopathy or valve disease, so even in this group, many clinicians obtain TTE within a few weeks to establish baseline cardiac structure and function [^notfound].

> Next, I should review what the echo should cover so I do not miss key elements. A comprehensive TTE should assess LV systolic function, regional wall motion, LV hypertrophy, valvular structure and function including mitral regurgitation and stenosis, left atrial size/volume, right heart size and function, and signs of pulmonary hypertension, because these findings shape anticoagulation, rhythm-control candidacy, and downstream care; if diastolic function or HFpEF is suspected, ASE guidance supports structured diastolic assessment even in AF, acknowledging technical limitations and the potential need for averaged measurements or adjunctive modalities [^1b807f4f] [^582abf3e].

> I will now examine the TEE indications and timing more precisely. TEE is indicated when cardioversion is planned and duration of AF is unknown or greater than 48 hours, or when there is a high suspicion of left atrial appendage thrombus or intracardiac mass; in these cases, TEE should be performed just before cardioversion to enable safe restoration of sinus rhythm, and it can also help evaluate prosthetic valves, vegetations, or surgical left atrial appendage occlusion when TTE is nondiagnostic [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with stroke-prevention principles: yes, delaying cardioversion until thrombus is excluded is standard when anticoagulation has not been therapeutic for the requisite period, which is why TEE timing is tightly linked to procedural plans rather than a fixed interval from diagnosis [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified timeline while acknowledging the absence of a mandated deadline. For unstable patients or those needing immediate cardioversion, obtain TEE urgently if duration is uncertain or prolonged. For stable inpatients, obtain TTE within 24–72 hours to expedite guideline-directed therapy. For stable outpatients, aim for TTE within 1–2 weeks, extending to 2–4 weeks only if risk is low and no delays in anticoagulation or rhythm decisions are anticipated. And for pre-cardioversion planning, perform TEE when indicated just before the procedure if anticoagulation criteria are not met, recognizing that this may be days to weeks after diagnosis depending on the clinical trajectory [^78614778] [^notfound].

> I should confirm follow-up and documentation standards so the echo result is actionable. Reports should be timely, structured, and communicated to the treating team, with explicit mention of LV function, valvular pathology, atrial size, and any thrombus or spontaneous echo contrast, because these elements directly inform anticoagulation, rhythm strategy, and referral decisions; delays in reporting can cascade into delays in therapy and should be minimized [^22e0e1ba].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed exceptions and evolving evidence. If initial TTE is nondiagnostic due to poor windows or suspected infiltrative disease, CMR may be reasonable to clarify myocardial disease; if AF burden and atrial function are central to risk stratification, emerging tools like left atrial strain can add prognostic value but are not yet mandated for routine care, so I should use them selectively and in context [^1b807f4f] [^b81ef255]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overpromising on strain: consensus statements support its potential utility in research and select clinical scenarios, but routine adoption awaits broader validation and standardization, so I will frame it as adjunctive rather than standard [^b81ef255].

For new-onset atrial fibrillation, **obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within 2–4 weeks** of diagnosis to assess for structural heart disease, left atrial size, and ventricular function, as this informs anticoagulation, rhythm control, and stroke risk stratification [^notfound]. If **cardioversion is planned** or if there is suspicion of intracardiac thrombus, perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before cardioversion to exclude thrombus when anticoagulation is not yet therapeutic [^notfound]. In hemodynamically unstable patients, **urgent TTE is indicated** to guide acute management [^notfound].

---

## Indications for echocardiography in new-onset atrial fibrillation

Echocardiography is indicated in new-onset AF to:

- **Identify structural heart disease**: Valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or congenital anomalies that influence management [^notfound].
- **Assess left atrial size and function**: Enlargement or dysfunction increases stroke risk and recurrence after cardioversion [^582abf3e] [^6d87f73f].
- **Evaluate ventricular function**: Systolic or diastolic dysfunction guides therapy and risk stratification [^1b807f4f].
- **Detect intracardiac thrombus**: Especially in the left atrial appendage, before cardioversion [^notfound].

---

## Recommended timing for echocardiography

### Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)

For stable patients, **obtain TTE within 2–4 weeks** of diagnosis to guide anticoagulation, rhythm control, and risk stratification [^notfound]. In hemodynamically unstable patients, perform **urgent TTE** to assess cardiac function and guide acute management [^notfound].

---

### Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)

Before cardioversion, **perform TEE** if anticoagulation is not yet therapeutic to exclude thrombus [^notfound]. In acute settings, **urgent TEE** is indicated when cardioversion is planned imminently and thrombus risk must be excluded [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios influencing timing

Several scenarios may **alter timing**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable outpatient | 2–4 weeks | Routine assessment of structure and function [^notfound] |
| Hemodynamic instability | Urgent | Guide acute management [^notfound] |
| Planned cardioversion | Before procedure | Exclude thrombus [^notfound] |
| Suspected valvular disease | Within 2 weeks | Identify lesions affecting anticoagulation and rhythm strategy [^notfound] |
| Stroke or TIA | Within 1 week | Identify cardioembolic sources and guide therapy [^notfound] |

---

## Consequences of delayed echocardiography

Delays can **miss structural disease** — valvular or cardiomyopathy that changes anticoagulation or rhythm decisions — and increase **thromboembolic risk** by failing to detect thrombus before cardioversion. They can also delay appropriate therapy, worsening outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine TTE**: Within 2–4 weeks of diagnosis for stable patients [^notfound].
- **Urgent TTE**: For hemodynamically unstable patients [^notfound].
- **TEE**: Before cardioversion if anticoagulation is not therapeutic [^notfound].
- **Individualize timing**: Based on clinical context, comorbidities, and treatment plans [^notfound].

---

Echocardiography is essential in new-onset AF, and **timing should balance prompt assessment with clinical context** to optimize outcomes [^notfound].

Introduction

The rising prevalence of arrhythmias places an increasing burden on critical care systems worldwide. Supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF), are the most commonly encountered arrhythmias, affecting up to 25% of individuals over 40 years of age. The incidence increases with age, illness severity, and surgical invasiveness, with perioperative AF rates reaching 15–40% after cardiac surgery and up to 46% in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock.

AF is an independent risk factor for mortality in the critically ill. New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) raises a logical question as to whether its deleterious effect could be reversed by cardioversion and return to sinus rhythm (SR). There is limited data on the acute benefits of a rhythm control vs. rate control strategy, although similar outcomes have been documented over long-term follow-up. Non-sustained arrhythmias may spontaneously terminate and require observation only whilst the decision for electrical (DC) or pharmacological cardioversion of NOAF remains debatable.

Major trials from the cardiology setting have failed to demonstrate a benefit of a rhythm control over a rate control strategy. However, most cardiology randomised controlled trials fail to consider the degree of pre-existing left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction, which can be of paramount importance in the acutely decompensated patient. Indeed, there may be relevant differences in responses to antiarrhythmic therapy in subgroups stratified by pre-existing cardiac function. In the presence of clinical equipoise regarding the best strategy, there is a physiological rationale for the use of echocardiography to help determine whether rhythm control is more favourable in certain populations.

Critical care echocardiography (CCE) has become the imaging modality of choice for investigating haemodynamically unstable patients in the ICU. In addition, CCE has a unique and important role in the assessment of cardiac structure, function, risk stratification, and in guiding the management of an arrhythmia.

In this review, we illustrate the role of CCE in guiding the therapeutic management of the ICU patient presenting with NOAF or an AF of unknown duration in determining whether there is a preference for rhythm versus rate control, antiarrhythmic drug selection, guidance of DC cardioversion, anticoagulation, and the role in immediate follow-up. We also address the limitations of CCE and its parameters in the presence of AF. For literature search details, see Table 1 ESM.

### Echocardiography guided management of atrial fibrillation [^f551e040]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The growing burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) experienced by the general population translates into an increased incidence in the intensive care setting, further aggravated by illness severity. New onset AF has been established as an independent mortality predictor. Cardiology management guidelines are based on major trials that included ambulatory patients with varying degrees of ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and with variable dependences of left ventricular filling on atrial systole. Emphasis is placed on rate control combined with anticoagulation therapy, along with careful consideration of limiting any myocardial depression by antiarrhythmic medication in patients who often already have some form of structural heart disease.

Design

Narrative review Objectives: Critical care echocardiography (CCE) is well established as a widely available diagnostic and monitoring tool in haemodynamically unstable patients. It assists in identifying risk factors associated with arrhythmias, reveals parameters associated with arrhythmia chronicity, and guides therapy to facilitate a return to sinus rhythm. CCE helps guide the crucial management decision to seek either rhythm or rate control and, with rhythm control, monitors return of mechanical sinus rhythm with left atrial recovery post cardioversion. Echocardiography can also help when conflicting management goals are present, such as guideline-driven therapeutic anticoagulation in the intensive care patient that is at significant risk of bleeding.

Results

This review seeks to assist intensive care practitioners managing patients with AF, with a focus on the many benefits CCE offers, blending specific intensive care medicine data to current cardiology guidelines on arrhythmia management in these severely ill patients.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiographic imaging in suspected HFpEF — An LVEF of ≥ 50% is accepted as normal or preserved and is consistent with a diagnosis of HFpEF, and a comprehensive echocardiographic examination with measurement of these parameters should be performed in the initial diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected HFpEF. If the resting echocardiogram shows increased LV filling pressure (grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction), then the diagnostic testing should be considered complete, whereas if only diastolic function grade 1 is present at rest in a patient with exertional dyspnea, diastolic exercise echocardiography or cardiac catheterization should be performed. For patients in atrial fibrillation, the specific recommendations for estimation of LV filling pressures for these groups should be followed, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be considered in the workup if echocardiographic imaging quality is suboptimal or there are concerns for an infiltrative myopathic process such as amyloidosis.

1.5 Improving the Recognition of HVD

1.5.1 Recommendation 7

Every echocardiography department should have a system of alerts when significant HVD is identified.

1.5.1.1 Background to Recommendation 7

There is anecdotal evidence that the presence of HVD may not be communicated to an appropriate clinician. The department needs to have a system for reporting significant HVD to the clinical scientist/physiologist running the department, the referring clinician or a supervising cardiologist, preferably the cardiologist in charge of the valve clinic.

There could be a lack in general practitioner (GP) training to facilitate full understanding of echocardiography reports. It is therefore of particular importance that open access studies requested by the GP showing HVD are discussed with a cardiologist to write recommendations for management. Some centers already arrange an appointment to a valve clinic automatically, if clinically appropriate, which cuts out delays between the hospital and GP, avoids risk of the referral not happening and is popular with GPs. If possible, this would be the recommended approach.

1.6 Ensuring Easy Access to Echocardiography

1.6.1 Recommendation 8

Departments should offer easy access to GPs for patients with suspected HVD.

1.6.1.1 Background to Recommendation 8

The usual method of referral is within an open access service. Only 65 (76%) of departments offered this in 2022 and more should be encouraged to start.

Ways of extending access locally have been explored in the past for example, hand‐held devices in a GP practice but these have not been successful yet, therefore would not be recommended.

Atrial fibrillation is a recognized indication for TTE since HVD is more likely in the presence of atrial fibrillation than sinus rhythm but also needed to assess systolic size and function. It is imperative that detection of new Atrial Fibrillation on a scan is relayed to the referring clinician, or GP and the patient informed so as to ensure that assessment for thromboembolic risk and consideration of anticoagulation happens. A standard leaflet for Atrial Fibrillation (such as the British Heart Foundation leaflet) could be given to the patients.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^f20f60ff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions

In this study, the term "octogenarian" is used to describe patients aged ≥ 80 years. AF with uncontrolled heart rate was diagnosed if the heart rate upon admission exceeded 110 bpm. New‐onset AF (NOAF) was defined as AF not previously diagnosed, and non‐NOAF encompassed patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF, as well as those in sinus rhythm with a history of AF. Non‐NOAF was classified as paroxysmal, per European Society of Cardiology guidelines, when conversion to sinus rhythm occurred spontaneously within 7 days of presumed onset. Upon successful termination using cardioversion (either pharmacological or electrical) or sustained AF for > 7 days, AF type was classified as persistent. Valvular AF was defined as patients with AF with mechanical prosthetic heart valve(s) or moderate to severe mitral stenosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was categorized according to the guidelines recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging. Noninvasive rhythm control strategy was defined as electrical or pharmacological cardioversion.

End Point Definitions and Follow‐Up

In this study, our primary 3‐point end point included all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke, and our secondary 4‐point end point incorporated major bleedings according to International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis bleeding criteria. To minimize lost‐to‐follow‐up, a sequential follow‐up method was used, as outlined previously. In order to differentiate between ischemic and bleeding risks, strokes were defined excluding hemorrhagic stroke, and hemorrhagic strokes were categorized as International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis major bleeding events.

### Assessment of risk factors for atrial fibrillation with a particular focus on echocardiographic parameters, in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^0ff0bc05]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia presenting with rapid, uncoordinated electrical activation of the atria leading to ineffective contraction. According to current guidelines, an arrhythmia lasting at least 30 s recorded on a single‐lead electrocardiogram or an abnormal heart rhythm recorded on a 12‐lead electrocardiogram is required to make the diagnosis. Worldwide, this type of arrhythmia is the most common and it affects between 2% and 4% of the adult population. The projected further progression is a reason to look at atrial fibrillation as a global epidemic problem. To date, many factors that may contribute to the development of arrhythmia have been described. The risk profile of arrhythmia varies, and it is extremely difficult to narrow down the most susceptible group of patients. This is one of the reasons for the still unsatisfactory success rate in diagnosing new cases of arrhythmia and thus the inability to implement preventive interventions and avoid complications. Significantly, the silent clinical course may affect up to 40% of the Atrial Fibrillation population and contribute to prolonging the time from the onset to diagnosis and implementation of therapy. No difference in all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or thromboembolic complications, including strokes, has been demonstrated when compared with full‐blown arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, while coronary artery disease ranks first in prevalence among cardiovascular diseases in the human population. Both diseases share many risk factors. The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in a patient with coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction, has a direct impact on modifying pharmacotherapy by increasing the CHA 2 DS 2 VAS c score, resulting in significant changes in antithrombotic theraphy. In summary, the consequences of an atrial fibrillation diagnosis in that population are significant. The increasing number of patients with arrhythmia, the high proportion of asymptomatic form, the possibility of rapid implementation of therapy, and the increasing variety of devices to facilitate diagnosis have strengthened the international initiative to implement screening methods for atrial fibrillation in everyday medical practice. The main aim of this study was to assess risk factors for atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Clinical and laboratory parameters were thoroughly analyzed, and the assessment covered echocardiography in particular. The premise of the study was to identify those parameters that could be risk factors for arrhythmia.

### Recent-onset atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities [^dd909d1e]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly diagnosed early, close to its first occurrence due to: (i) increased public awareness with self-screening; (ii) health care initiatives including population screening and opportunistic case finding; and (iii) increased use and surveillance of implantable cardiac devices. At its onset, AF is often low burden, and cardiovascular co-morbidities may be absent or at an early stage. Thus, the management of recent-onset AF has become an issue of growing importance. Professional guidelines have traditionally focused on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, generally recommending a cautious approach to rhythm control, and priority has been given to rate control to alleviate symptoms. In recent guidelines, the importance of managing lifestyle and co-morbidities has increased. The AF-SCREEN collaboration proposes that a vigorous approach to active management of recent-onset AF may be warranted. This includes addressing co-morbidities and promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent the emergence or progression of AF and associated cardiovascular disease, as well as the initiation of active rhythm control ± anticoagulation to prevent AF-related morbidity and mortality, including stroke and heart failure (HF). Intuitively, intervention early after AF onset would be beneficial since lifestyle and co-morbidity management, plus rhythm control and anticoagulation, are important contributors to improved outcomes in patients with established AF, but robust evidence is lacking for recent-onset AF. There is a delicate balance between achieving favourable outcomes such as preventing strokes, HF and AF progression vs the complications and potential adverse effects of interventions. Given the serious long-term consequences, innovative approaches are necessary to determine the value and risks of initiating active therapy very early in the course of AF. More data are needed to guide the best management of recent-onset AF, bearing AF burden in mind. Long-term studies using large national databases linked to electronic medical records and rhythm monitoring devices offer excellent opportunities. Shorter-term studies focusing on reducing AF burden to slow AF progression and studies focusing on outcomes such as HF could be used in both randomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies.

### The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant in ischemic stroke combined with non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: a real-world big data analysis [^94cde268]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with ischemic stroke (IS) combined with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), oral anticoagulants (OAC), especially new oral anticoagulants (NOAC), are recommended as the standard of care in current clinical practice guidelines. However, anticoagulation therapy is also accompanied by the risk of bleeding. At present, there is still a lack of unified standards and guidance on how to balance the benefits and risks of anticoagulation therapy and how to determine the best time to commence OAC following IS. The timing of restarting OAC mainly depended on the infarct size and the severity of stroke in patients. Therefore, the recommended anticoagulation method followed the "1-3-6-12″ principle of the 2021 European Heart Rhythm Association/European Society of Cardiology Guidelines to determine the severity of neurological disease in patients based on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Anticoagulation should be performed 1 day after transient ischemic attack, 3 days after mild stroke, 6 days after moderate stroke, and 12 days after severe stroke. The Chinese expert consensus had previously recommended that patients with mild to moderate stroke (NIHSS ≤ 15) and low risk of bleeding should initiate anticoagulation therapy within 2–14 days after onset, while the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for patients with severe stroke (NIHSS > 15) should be postponed until 14 days later.

The introduction of evidence-based and structured guidelines has undoubtedly improved the care of cardiologic patients and in many cases simplified decision-making for the treatment team. The European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy, and the Heart Rhythm Society, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society have developed guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Because all 3 guidelines refer to almost the same scientific data, their recommendations are undoubtedly largely in agreement. Nevertheless, there are some interesting differences based on different interpretations of the same study, different publication dates, or differences in local conditions and health care resources. The following article aims at lining out these similarities and differences.

### Excessive supraventricular ectopic activity in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with atrial fibrillation detection within 24 Months after stroke: a predefined analysis of the monDAFIS study [^d6869df6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ischemic stroke and subsequent initiation of oral anticoagulation instead of aspirin use is important in stroke prevention, as there is no proven benefit of oral anticoagulation in patients with stroke without AF. Prolonged ECG monitoring in patients with stroke detects a first episode of AF in up to 1 of 3 patients with stroke, depending on patient selection, quality of ECG analysis, and duration of ECG recording. Nevertheless, paroxysmal forms of AF are often missed in clinical practice, and the optimal duration of ECG monitoring after stroke is unclear in terms of cost effectiveness and secondary stroke prevention. Currently, European Society of Cardiology guidelines and several position papers recommend a minimum duration of 72 hours of (cumulative) ECG recording in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The European Stroke Organization recommends "prolonged cardiac monitoring instead of 24 hours monitoring" and adds an expert consensus statement to monitor for AF for > 48 hours. Based on expert consensus, prolonged ECG monitoring is recommended in selected patients at "high risk" of AF, focusing on patients' age as well as laboratory, echocardiography, or ECG findings, such as atrial runs or excessive supraventricular beats. However, the most recent European Stroke Organization guideline states that "blood, echocardiographic, ECG, or brain imaging biomarkers" should not be used to exclude patients from long‐term ECG monitoring. Considering that diagnostic resources are limited worldwide and the identification of stroke survivors at high risk of recurrent stroke is desirable, there is a need to select patients at risk of AF for prolonged monitoring after ischemic stroke or TIA.

Excessive supraventricular ectopic activity (ESVEA; summarizing the presence of excessive ectopic supraventricular beats or atrial runs of < 30 seconds' duration) is regarded as a marker of atrial cardiomyopathyand was reported to be associated with higher rates of later detected AF in middle‐aged to older people, and in selected patients with ischemic stroke. While ESVEA occurs in 7% to 15% of middle‐aged to older people, ESVEA can be found in up to 40% of all patients with acute ischemic stroke, depending on the ESVEA definition used. While ESVEA was associated with stroke or death in a meta‐analysis of longitudinal studies that did not focus on patients with stroke, robust data on the relevance of ESVEA detected in the acute phase of ischemic stroke or TIA on clinical end points are sparse.

### Atrial fibrillation: a review [^131e4e56]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, approximately 10.55 million adults have atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is associated with significantly increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms of AF include palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, exertional intolerance, and fatigue, although approximately 10% to 40% of people with AF are asymptomatic. AF can be detected incidentally during clinical encounters, with wearable devices, or through interrogation of cardiac implanted electronic devices. In patients presenting with ischemic stroke without diagnosed AF, an implantable loop recorder (ie, subcutaneous telemetry device) can evaluate patients for intermittent AF. The 2023 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Guideline writing group proposed 4 stages of AF evolution: stage 1, at risk, defined as patients with AF-associated risk factors (eg, obesity, hypertension); stage 2, pre-AF, signs of atrial pathology on electrocardiogram or imaging without AF; stage 3, the presence of paroxysmal (recurrent AF episodes lasting ≤ 7 days) or persistent (continuous AF episode lasting > 7 days) AF subtypes; and stage 4, permanent AF. Lifestyle and risk factor modification, including weight loss and exercise, to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications are recommended for all stages. In patients with estimated risk of stroke and thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant reduces stroke risk by 60% to 80% compared with placebo. In most patients, a direct oral anticoagulant, such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban, is recommended over warfarin because of lower bleeding risks. Compared with anticoagulation, aspirin is associated with poorer efficacy and is not recommended for stroke prevention. Early rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation to restore and maintain sinus rhythm is recommended by the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for some patients with AF. Catheter ablation is first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF to improve symptoms and slow progression to persistent AF. Catheter ablation is also recommended for patients with AF who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to improve quality of life, left ventricular systolic function, and cardiovascular outcomes, such as rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Conclusions and Relevance

AF is associated with increased rates of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Lifestyle and risk factor modification are recommended to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications, and oral anticoagulants are recommended for those with an estimated risk of stroke or thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year. Early rhythm control using antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation is recommended in select patients with AF experiencing symptomatic paroxysmal AF or HFrEF.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^8827a694]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

### Advancing clinical management of left ventricular thrombosis: prevention, detection and treatment modalities in the modern era [^6b1e0608]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Heightened interest in left ventricular thrombus (LVT) stems from the consistent association of subsequent stroke and systemic embolism after LVT, and many aspects of its management still exist in a grey area of evidence. The current delay in intervention is likely related to a limited understanding of the disease pathophysiology, along with an underestimation of LVT by standard imaging modalities. With the rapid development of antithrombotic regimens consisting of direct oral anticoagulants (OACs), which have shown early safety and efficacy, there is a growing need to understand and accurately diagnose the LVT process in order to determine appropriate management solutions. This educational review will oversee LVT pathophysiology, current status of the guidelines-recommended echocardiographic approach and the role of multimodality imaging, as well as prevention and treatment modalities in the modern era. Meanwhile, the review proposes an algorithm for the prevention and treatment of LVT based on current guidelines and expert consensus, and highlights the need for more investigations to identify risk stratification methods for individual patients, and lastly, discusses the potential of direct OACs in the management of LVT.

### Analysis of the 2024 ESC / EACTS guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^e04f92f6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) emphasize a patient-centered approach to management, structured around the AF-CARE pathway: Comorbidity and risk factor management (C), Avoiding stroke and thromboembolism (A), Reducing symptoms through rate and rhythm control (R), and Evaluation and dynamic reassessment (E). This framework ensures that comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and obesity are effectively managed to prevent disease progression and improve outcomes. A key principle of the guidelines is shared decision making involving patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare teams to ensure individualized care that reflects patient preferences. The guidelines also stress healthcare equity, advocating for the elimination of disparities related to sex, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status. For diagnosis, electrocardiographic confirmation of clinical AF is essential, followed by risk stratification using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to guide anticoagulation therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred for most patients because of their good safety profile. Stroke prevention is prioritized, with rhythm control as first-line treatment for suitable patients. For those with persistent symptoms despite medications, catheter ablation is recommended. Rate control strategies, including beta-blockers, digoxin, and calcium channel blockers, are used to manage heart rate and symptoms. Ongoing education for patients, families, and providers supports informed decision making and dynamic reassessment, optimizing patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^78614778]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — electrical therapies: In adult patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm (1 C-LD). Urgent direct-current cardioversion of new onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rates in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is recommended for adult patients with hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or inadequate rate control (1 C-LD). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults using any currently US-approved biphasic wave form defibrillator, an initial energy setting of at least 200 J is reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2a B-R). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults as an initial treatment strategy is uncertain (2b B-R). For synchronized cardioversion of atrial flutter in adults, an initial energy setting of 200 J may be reasonable and increment in the event of shock failure, depending on the biphasic defibrillator used (2b C-LD). The usefulness of double synchronized cardioversion as a rescue treatment for shock-refractory atrial fibrillation in adults is uncertain (2b C-LD).

### Clinical management after surgical left atrial appendage exclusion [^8e6d886e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The importance of this data is clear: there is no consensus on long-term thromboembolism prevention strategies in patients with AF who undergo cardiac surgery. Further randomized control trials examining stroke risk mitigation in these patients are needed, but guidance for providers is needed in the meantime. We believe that an organized, multidisciplinary approach is necessary in the care of patients with AF who are to undergo cardiac surgery. Foremost among these is collaborations between electrophysiology, cardiac surgery, and structural imaging providers. Specifically, pre-operative discussions are needed on whether to exclude or excise the LAA during the cardiac surgery. Next, the use of oral anti-coagulation in the post-operative period should be addressed in a multi-disciplinary fashion, and proper electrophysiology and cardiac surgery follow-up is essential for the patient being referred for TEE to assess the success of LAA exclusion. We feel that interpretation of TEE findings requires an experienced echocardiographer, as clear standards for what constitutes adequate surgical LAA management are lacking. A standard of LAA remnant < 1 cm in depth has been proposed in recently published AF guidelines, but this is based primarily upon a small published series using CT as the imaging standard. Lastly, based on the imaging findings, a long-term OAC strategy can be determined with involvement from electrophysiology, general cardiology, and primary care. We have proposed such a model in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Our study has several limitations to acknowledge. Because of its retrospective nature, follow-up (imaging and management) was not standardized. The reasons why patients were or were not prescribed oral anticoagulation could not always be fully elucidated; similarly, we were unable to specify the rationale behind why some patients came off of oral anticoagulation (whether due to imaging-confirmed LAA exclusion or other reasons). Additionally, we do not have the indication for our TEEs and it is likely that many TEEs were not ordered with the intention of evaluating the LAA remnant. Our data is taken from a single center EHR, so any events diagnosed or imaging studies performed at another institution would not be available for inclusion in the dataset.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on practical approaches for arrhythmia monitoring after stroke: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^07939d60]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation detection after large- or small-vessel ischemic stroke — monitoring yield and STROKE-AF trial results show that increased duration of monitoring has been shown to improve detection of AF. A meta-analysis that evaluated 30 studies and 5,687 patients reported that with short-term monitoring (maximum 7 days), AF was identified in 2.2% with large-vessel disease and 2.4% with small-vessel disease, lower than CS with a 9.2% detection rate. In STROKE-AF, conducted at 33 centers in the United States between 2016 and 2020, eligible patients were aged ≥ 60 years or 50 to 59 years with ≥ 1 additional vascular risk factor; 496 patients (mean age 67 years, 62% men) were enrolled, with 417 completing 12 months of follow-up. An implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) was placed within 10 days of the index stroke, yielding a higher AF detection rate (12.1%) than usual care (1.8%) and a median time to first AF of 99 days. Post hoc, AF detection was 11.7% in large-vessel atherosclerosis vs 12.6% in small-vessel disease; the median duration of the longest AF episode was 88 minutes, with durations 267 minutes vs 44 minutes for small- vs large-vessel disease. Predictors of AF included history of heart failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.06) and left atrial enlargement (HR: 3.32), defined as left atrial size ≥ 41 mm in men or ≥ 39 mm in women or a left atrial volume index ≥ 28 mL/m²; at 12 months, AF was identified in 23.4% with history of HF and/or left atrial enlargement vs 5.0% with neither condition.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV structure and left atrial (LA) volume and function — structural remodeling supports diastolic dysfunction as LA enlargement, in the absence of chronic atrial arrhythmia and mitral valve disease, is a marker of chronic elevation of LAP and should be interpreted only after exclusion of other causes such as anemia, biatrial heart transplant technique, hyperdynamic state, or athletic status; pathologic LV hypertrophy is usually associated with increased LV chamber stiffness; and increased LV mass index and LA enlargement are among the criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^582abf3e]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiography diastolic assessment — left atrial (LA) volume (LAVi) reflects cumulative effects of increased LVFPs over time, is directly but weakly related to LVFP, and increased LA volume is an independent predictor of death, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and ischemic stroke; advantages include feasibility and reproducibility, provision of diagnostic and prognostic information about LV diastolic dysfunction and disease chronicity, apical 4‑chamber view visual estimate of LA and right atrium (RA) size to confirm LA enlargement, and that a normal LA size suggests normal LVFPs; limitations include LA dilatation without diastolic dysfunction in several conditions (e.g., high‑output states, heart transplants with bicaval technique, atrial flutter/fibrillation, significant MV disease, well‑trained athletes), suboptimal image quality including LA foreshortening precluding accurate tracings, and difficulty measuring LA volumes with aortic and interatrial septal aneurysms.

### Echocardiography guided management of atrial fibrillation [^3b580a9c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent cardiology guidelines suggest that the following Doppler parameters indicate elevated LAP: E > 1 m/s, E wave deceleration time (DtE) < 160 ms, septal E/e' > 11, tricuspid regurgitation velocity > 2.8 m/s. Therefore, they can be used to contraindicate fluid therapy, especially if bilateral pulmonary B-lines are simultaneously recorded by lung ultrasound. Unfortunately, usual Doppler indicators are influenced by tachycardia and rhythm irregularity during AF, afterload, and mechanical ventilation, all of which complicate their interpretation for preload assessment in the critically ill. When estimating the LV filling pressure, the correlation coefficients between the invasive measurements used as reference and mitral Doppler indices (E, DtE, E/e´) range between 0.4 and 0.7 across observational studies. The pulmonary vein Doppler velocities (systolic wave and diastolic wave with its deceleration time, Dtd) show promise with correlation to SR reaching r = 0.80–0.91. The LAP estimates obtained by deducting the peak pressure gradient of the mitral regurgitant jet from LV systolic pressure may perform well in patients with significant mitral regurgitation and AF, assuming more cardiac cycles are averaged.

Arrhythmia monitoring after stroke — pathway steps and monitoring options are outlined as follows: Arrhythmia monitoring after a stroke requires three important steps, beginning with a multidisciplinary evaluation to identify any potential mechanisms for the stroke, followed by risk assessment to determine the likelihood that a cardiac arrhythmia played a role in the stroke or may play a role in future stroke or nonstroke morbidity, and culminating in choosing the optimal monitoring strategy for the patient that considers accuracy, practicality, barriers to care, and follow-up. The pathway figure specifies available monitoring strategies as Consumer- vs medical grade, Intermittent vs Continuous, Invasive vs Noninvasive, Real-time vs delayed output, and Monitoring duration, and enumerates likely stroke mechanisms including High-risk cardioembolic source, Large-vessel disease, Small-vessel disease, Other rare causes, Cryptogenic or unclear stroke origin, and Multiple potential mechanisms.

### Massive left atrial myxoma uncommon presentation in an aged man, an educational case report and literature review [^ba567309]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this case highlights the diagnostic complexity of left atrial myxoma in elderly patients presenting with recurrent syncope, embolic strokes, and nonspecific systemic symptoms. Early implementation of transthoracic echocardiography in such clinical scenarios can expedite diagnosis, enabling timely surgical excision and favorable neurological recovery. For sporadic myxomas, postoperative echocardiographic follow-up for 4–5 years is typically sufficient to monitor for recurrence.

### Optimal medical therapy for heart failure and integrated care in patients with atrial fibrillation: a report from the ESC-EHRA EORP atrial fibrillation long-term general registry [^4d065bcc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The ESC‐EHRA EORP‐AF General Long‐Term Registry is a prospective, observational, multicenter registry, held by the European Society of Cardiology and endorsed by the European Heart Rhythm Association. The study enrolled consecutive AF inpatients and outpatients in 250 cardiology practices, across 27 countries. Details of the study design, baseline characteristics, and follow‐up are reported elsewhere.

All patients enrolled had documented AF within 12 months before enrollment, were aged ≥ 18 years, and provided written informed consent. Enrollment was undertaken from October 2013 to September 2016, with planned 1‐ and 2‐year follow‐up.

Patient data were obtained after the signing of a written informed consent by each patient, following the approval of study protocol by an institutional review board/ethics committee. The study was first approved by the National Coordinators' main institutions and subsequently was authorized by each peripheral site under the responsibility of the lead contact and study team according to the specific national and local regulation. Any details regarding approval numbers for the study protocol regarding any specific site could be obtained from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request. The study was performed according to the European Union Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice CPMP/ECH/135/95 and the Declaration of Helsinki.

For the purposes of this analysis, we considered all patients with available data regarding the presence or absence of HF, as per the clinical evaluation and medical history analysis made by the investigators at the moment of the study enrollment, LVEF evaluation, and occurrence of major adverse outcomes during the follow‐up period.

Study Cohort and Definitions

For the purposes of this analysis, we considered all patients with available data on HF status, LVEF, and occurrence of major adverse outcomes during the follow‐up period. According to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on HF management at the time the data were collected, for the primary analysis patients with HF were initially categorized by LVEF as follows: (1) patients with reduced LVEF (HFrEF); (2) patients with mildly reduced LVEF (HFmrEF); and (3) patients with preserved LVEF (HFpEF). Secondarily, to perform various subgroup analyses and not to excessively reduce the sample of each group examined, we adopted a simplified categorization: (1) patients with HF with reduced LVEF (≤ 40%); (2) patients with HF without reduced LVEF (> 40%).

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^69848d9b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Timing of referral for implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation: the need for an individualized approach

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator therapy is part of guideline‐directed and evidence‐based care and should not be delayed. The timing of ICD implantation may vary according to patient characteristics. After initiation of GDMT, patients may have improved LVEF and left ventricular volumes, with LVEF reassessment helping to determine device indications. The ESC HF guidelines recommend the consideration of ICD after 3 months of treatment with GDMTwhile US HF guidelines do not specify a certain time frame and underscore the individualization of ICD timing. The urgency of ICD implementation should be determined based on an individualized assessment of SCD risk.

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation may be considered earlier than 3 months after GDMT initiation in patients with a high risk of VAs and SCD (e.g. patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy), with very low LVEF (i.e. LVEF < 20%), with irreversible aetiologies (e.g. recurrent myocardial infarction), with extensive myocardial scarring, or with a low likelihood of recovery of LVEF to > 35% (very low LVEF along with advanced and long‐standing HF with marked left ventricular remodelling).

Furthermore, certain patients – especially those with advanced HF and/or patients with hypoperfusion – may not tolerate initiation and up‐titration of medical therapies despite attempts. An indicated ICD should not be delayed in these patients as they are at very high risk for SCD.

11.3 "Hybrid" Rhythm Control Therapy

Important perspectives are available from real‐world experience to date. In a recent report spanning 14 years, newly diagnosed AF subjects' treatment patterns and final prescribed therapies were examined. 2 429 863 AF subjects with newly diagnosed AF (2007–2021) were followed, and 23 323 underwent ablation. Figure 15 shows the clinical pathway in these subjects. AF recurrences were common, and 14.2% had a second ablation procedure, with 83.4% having no further ablative intervention, only 2% had a third ablation, and 0.4% had more than three procedures. Antiarrhythmic drug prescription was frequent after a single ablation and after repeated ablation, with 46.9% requiring combination ablation and AAD therapy and increasing after repeated ablation. Of importance, in the absence of objective data and guidelines, amiodarone was the most prescribed drug.

Figure 15
Rhythm‐control strategies after catheter ablation: incidence of ablation, repeat ablation, and AAD use in a real‐world study cohort of 23 323 subjects with newly diagnosed AF from the United States (2007–2021) (Modified and reproduced with permission from).

While continuing development of technology, as well as the further evolution of the ablation procedure, may increase the efficacy of ablation, it may still not adequately address the AF‐HFpEF disease constellation on a public health basis, as seen in the above real‐world study 1% of newly diagnosed AF patients received ablation. In the immediate future, it is unlikely that ablation would replace all other therapies. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including, most importantly, the scale of this therapy to public need. With these trends of early intervention being adopted in current practice guidelines in AF and HF and the use of combination therapy, changes in future therapy are already happening. As a result, comparative prospective trials between individual rhythm control therapies may be difficult and perhaps less relevant as we move to a "hybrid" therapy approach. Another aspect is to interrupt the progression of AF, HFpEF, or both. For this, understanding the natural history of the condition is critical for timing interventions and future therapy. HFpEF progression to HFrEF is a poorly understood process. Similarly, AF progression to permanent AF is also unclear. It is also essential to assess competing risks, which become very relevant in this disease constellation. AF‐HFpEF is most common in septuagenarians and octogenarians, so other disease states often confer morbidity and morbidity and limit treatment options.

### Development and external validation of a clinical prediction model for new-onset atrial fibrillation in intensive care: a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^d52277a5]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

New-onset atrial fibrillation, a condition associated with adverse outcomes in the short and long term, is common in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Identifying patients at high risk could inform trials of preventive interventions and help to target such interventions. We aimed to develop and externally validate a prediction model for new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients admitted to ICUs.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre, retrospective cohort study in three ICUs across the UK and four ICUs across the USA. Patients aged 16 years and older admitted to an ICU for more than 3 h without a history or presentation of clinically significant arrhythmia were eligible for inclusion. We analysed clinical variables to investigate the associations between predetermined candidate variables and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation and to develop a model to estimate these risks. We developed the METRIC-AF model, a machine learning model incorporating dynamic variables. Model performance was assessed through internal-external cross-validation during model development and externally validated by use of multicentre data from ICUs across the UK. We then developed a simple graphical prediction tool using three important predictors.

Findings

Among 39084 eligible patients admitted to an ICU between 2008 and 2019, 2797 (7·2%) developed new-onset atrial fibrillation during the first 7 days of their ICU stay. We identified multiple non-linear associations between candidate variables and risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation, including hypomagnesaemia at serum concentrations below 0·70 mmol/L. The final METRIC-AF model contained ten routinely collected clinical variables. Compared with a published logistic regression model, the METRIC-AF model showed superior calibration, net benefit across clinically relevant risk thresholds, and discriminative performance (C statistic 0·812 [95% CI 0·805–0·822] vs 0·786 [0·778–0·801]; p = 0·0003). The simple graphical tool performed well in attributing the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation in the external validation dataset (C statistic 0·727 [95% CI 0·716–0·739]).

Interpretation

The METRIC-AF model and its companion graphical tool could support the identification of patients at increased risk of developing new-onset atrial fibrillation during ICU admission, informing targeted prophylactic strategies and trial enrichment by use of routinely available clinical data. An online app also developed as part of the study allows for the exploration of prediction generation among individuals and external validation in prospective studies.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^5536d21a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

Past definitions have varied, and the lack of consistent cut-offs for imaging parameters and biomarkers have limited clinical utility to diagnose and track AtCM progression. While research has mainly focused on AtCM in the context of atrial fibrillation, emerging evidence underscores its relevance in remodelling and development of heart failure. The aim of this consensus document was to provide a contemporary framework for AtCM, evolve the definitions of AtCM and atrial failure for more widespread clinical use, and help to direct emerging research and future clinical trials. Supporting the work of early career researchers, this consensus document evaluates diagnostic markers and summarizes the underpinning mechanisms, clinical characteristics and prognostic impact of AtCM. Our objective was to bring together new translational scientific progress, catalyse future research and enable clinical application to facilitate better management, for example in patient groups where aggressive control of risk factors or comorbidities could prevent AtCM progression. We redefined AtCM as a graded disorder that includes electrical dysfunction of the atria along with evidence of either mechanical atrial dysfunction, atrial enlargement and/or atrial fibrosis. Atrial failure is the end-stage manifestation of AtCM, characterized by progressive structural, electrophysiological and functional changes. Earlier identification, risk stratification and ongoing research into therapeutic options have the potential to prevent the clinical consequences of AtCM and atrial failure, including adverse patient outcomes and poor quality of life associated with atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

### Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): advances and challenges [^11cf24a7]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical profile of HFpEF subjects.

Figure 3
Comorbidities potentially involved in the development of HFpEF. Iron deficiency, diabetes mellitus, obesity, renal failure, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of HFpEF through structural and functional cardiac change and systemic inflammation (Reproduced with permission from).

Current practice guidelines have included consideration of the natural history of each disease state. With the reclassification of HF into preserved EF (HFpEF), mid‐range EF (HFmrEF), and reduced EF (HFrEF), HF categories form a continuum. Thus, HFmrEF will share some features with HFpEF and HFrEF, and the behavior at the ends of each adjoining range may overlap with the next category. Current day classification of HF overall also defines stages in the HF lifecycle from A to D. These range from an at‐risk population (Stage A), to pre‐HF (Stage B), symptomatic HF (Stage C), and advanced HF (Stage D). Most of the discussion in this review will focus on Stages C and D, but increasing interest is emerging on the role of AF treatment strategy on HF Stages B and C.

The evolution of the modern classification of AF has emerged from a consensus document of international societies of arrhythmology. It was previously based on AF episode duration, ability to self‐terminate or requiring interventions for termination, or failure to successfully terminate and revert to stable sinus rhythm with interventions. Rather than a classification of AF events, a newer proposal defines four stages of the AF lifecycle and mirrors the HF terminology. Stage 1 of the life cycle includes those at risk for AF with or without modifiable comorbid conditions that confer risk. Stage 2, referred to as pre‐AF, includes individuals with structural or electrical abnormalities that predispose a patient to AF. Stage 3 includes three categories of manifest AF. Stage 3A, which was previously defined as paroxysmal AF, includes AF episodes that self‐terminate within 7 days. Stage 3B, which is commonly referred to as persistent AF, includes AF episodes not self‐terminating within 7 days and requiring intervention for termination. Stage 3C includes long‐standing persistent AF, defined as an episode duration of > 12 months. Stage 3D in the life cycle refers to successfully ablated (surgically or percutaneously) AF subjects. Stage 4 in the AF life cycle is defined as a condition of permanent AF when no further efforts at rhythm control are undertaken after agreement between the patient and clinician.

### Cabergoline [^8e273b3d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiac Valvulopathy and Pericardial Fibrosis

Before initiating CABERGOLINE, perform a cardiovascular evaluation, including with an echocardiogram, to evaluate for valvular disease. CABERGOLINE is contraindicated in the presence of valvular disease or pericardial fibrosis [see Contraindications (4)].

Cases of valvular and pericardial fibrosis have often manifested as heart failure. Following CABERGOLINE treatment initiation, monitor for the development of valvulopathy with a cardiac echocardiogram at intervals of 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated with new onset edema, cardiac murmur, dyspnea, or heart failure. During CABERGOLINE treatment, monitor for chest pain and signs and symptoms of heart failure and if heart failure occurs, valvular fibrosis and pericarditis should be excluded. Consider clinical and diagnostic monitoring such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum creatinine measurements, chest-x- ray, and other investigations and cardiac imaging at baseline and as necessary while patients are treated with during CABERGOLINE treatment. Use CABERGOLINE in patients treated with other drugs associated with valvulopathy only if the potential benefit of CABERGOLINE outweighs the risk.

Discontinue CABERGOLINE if the patient has a new diagnosis of valvular regurgitation, valvular restriction, valve leaflet thickening, or pericarditis.

Postmarketing cases of cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients who received CABERGOLINE. These cases have generally occurred during administration of high doses of CABERGOLINE (> 2 mg/day) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) (CABERGOLINE is not approved for the treatment of PD). Cases of cardiac valvulopathy have also been reported in patients who received lower dosages of CABERGOLINE for the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders. In a 12-year, multi-country retrospective cohort study, the use of CABERGOLINE for PD was associated with an increased risk of cardiac valvular regurgitation (CVR). Compared to non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists and levodopa, CVR with CABERGOLINE use had an incidence rate per 10,000 person years of 68 (95% CI: 37, 115) versus 10 (95% CI: 5, 19) for non-ergot dopamine agonists and 11 (95% CI: 7, 17) for levodopa.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^43b4790a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-Myocardial Infarction

For high-risk patients with MI (e.g., those with a large anterior MI, those with significant heart failure, those with intracardiac thrombus visible on transthoracic echocardiography, those with AF, and those with a history of a thromboembolic event), therapy with combined moderate-intensity (INR, 2.0 to 3.0) warfarin plus low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) for at least 3 months after the MI is recommended.

Recurrent Systemic Embolism and Other Indications

Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin has not been fully evaluated by clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with AF, patients with mitral stenosis, and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology. However, a moderate dose regimen (INR 2.0 to 3.0) may be used for these patients.

### Screening-detected atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular outcomes in working-age adults [^77d9fb59]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening-detected AF in the study population carried a 5-fold higher ischemic stroke risk compared with those without AF. It is important to note that approximately 80% of the study population had the lowest CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (ie, 0 points in men or 1 point in women), for which current guidelines do not routinely recommend anticoagulation therapy. Although the absolute risk of approximately 2% in 3 years among these individuals with screening-detected AF may not be high in absolute terms, this indicates a potentially preventable stroke burden. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine risk stratification tools, particularly to identify low-risk individuals who may still benefit from established interventions.

An 18-fold increased risk of heart failure hospitalization was observed among those with screening-detected AF compared with those without. This association may reflect the relationship between AF and pre–heart failure (ie, stage B heart failure), a relationship that has garnered increasing interest over the past decade. Although we excluded individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular diagnoses through administrative codes, subclinical cardiac dysfunction may have been present at the time of AF detection as pre–heart failure status is generally asymptomatic. Given that AF is considered to be both a cause and consequence of adverse cardiac remodeling, these findings emphasize the importance of cardiac function assessment upon AF detection, even among apparently healthy individuals, to identify those at pre–heart failure and implement appropriate preventive strategies including medical therapies that have been shown to improve HF outcomes.

### Vernakalant versus procainamide for rapid cardioversion of patients with acute atrial fibrillation (RAFF4): randomised clinical trial [^8c08bf31]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute (recent onset) atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia requiring management in the emergency department. Our focus is on acute episodes of atrial fibrillation, which are usually less than 48 hours since onset and are symptomatic, requiring rapid treatment in the emergency department. We estimate that there are 500 000 acute atrial fibrillation visits annually to the emergency department in Canada and the United States combined. For acute atrial fibrillation, it is routine in Canadian emergency departments for physicians to attempt cardioversion to sinus rhythm, either with drugs or electrically. Compared with a rate control strategy, early rhythm control allows patients to be discharged home sooner, frees up valuable monitors, frees up nursing staff, and is associated with lower one year mortality rates. In the recent RAFF2 trial, we showed good outcomes for acute atrial fibrillation managed with rhythm control in the emergency department. An alternative strategy of patients returning the next day for electrical cardioversion by cardiology is not feasible in most hospitals and would see many patients miss the 12–24 hour window for safe cardioversion.

If rhythm control with drugs fails, then patients often undergo urgent electrical cardioversion, which is effective but may be associated with major delays in assembling the team and has been shown to have adverse events requiring treatment in 13.9% of patients. Cardioversion with drugs avoids some of the issues associated with electrical cardioversion; that is, the need for several skilled staff at the bedside, procedural sedation risks, and patient anxiety. Intravenous procainamide is a type IA antiarrhythmic agent and is recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Procainamide is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic for acute atrial fibrillation in Canadian emergency departments. Intravenous vernakalant acts preferentially in the atria by blocking several ion channels and was approved in Europe in 2010. This drug has recently been approved in Canada, but is not yet widely used and is not available in the US. Intravenous ibutilide has a 2–3% risk of torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal arrhythmia, and is not currently recommended by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Intravenous amiodarone and oral sotalol are not recommended in the emergency department as they are no more effective than placebo in the first six to eight hours. Oral propafenone or flecainide, both class IC antiarrhythmic agents, have much slower onset of action than intravenous drugs and their intravenous formulations are not available in North America.

### Investigating left atrial diameter and heart failure onset in middle-aged and elderly: a retrospective-prospective study [^ef6c7cd8]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents a serious manifestation or late‐stage complication of various cardiovascular diseases, affecting 1%–3% of adults worldwide. The incidence of HF increases with age, affecting more than 4% of people aged 65–70. Combined with a higher likelihood of developing other comorbidities and experiencing disability, this contributes to worse prognoses for the elderly.

HF, as a chronic disease, exhibits varying degrees of severity across different stages, each with distinct prognosis and varying probabilities of complications. It is undeniable that intervening earlier in the course of impending HF can reduce its occurrence and associated complications. Especially in the elderly, those with HF have more cardiovascular events and adverse outcomes than those without HF. Therefore, identifying senior citizens at high risk of HF to initiate preventive measures before its initial onset is crucial for preventing HF and halting its progression.

Compared to blood markers such as B‐type natriuretic peptide, which are limited in their time‐consuming and usability, especially in emergency care settings, echocardiography is the most appropriate method to achieve these purposes due to its wide availability, safety, adaptability, and ability to provide real‐time imaging with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. In many current HF prediction models, the indicator of cardiac ultrasound is used, and this indicator is mostly left ventricular ejection fraction. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of atrial remodeling in HF development. In addition to predicting atrial fibrillation, stroke, and mortality, left atrial enlargement and dysfunction can serve as markers of diastolic and systolic dysfunction. It has been reported that left atrial volume is a morphophysiological indicator of diastolic dysfunction. In patients with HF, left atrial size provides more predictive information than left ventricular function. An increased left atrial volume and dimensions indicate a higher risk of cardiac events for individuals with HF, regardless of their left ventricular ejection fraction. It has been suggested that LAD and HF may be associated independently, although further research is required to confirm this finding. However, there is currently a lack of studies examining the predictive value of LAD in echocardiography for HF in individuals without pre‐existing HF, a stage with significant research potential.

### Warfarin sodium [^6f3ac9f4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors.

Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended.
For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended.
For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended.
For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended.

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^e67dafcc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) emphasize personalized care, patient engagement, and shared decision-making. Medications and cardiac rhythm management (CRM) devices are recommended with a high level of evidence. However, there are significant disparities: patients who could benefit from devices are frequently referred too late or not at all. Misconceptions about device therapy and the notion that the needs of patients (especially the prevention of sudden cardiac death) can now be met by expanding drug therapies may play a role in these disparities. This state-of-the-art review is produced by members of the DIRECT HF initiative, a patient-centred, expert-led educational programme that aims to advance guideline-directed use of CRM devices in patients with HFrEF. This review discusses the latest evidence on the role of CRM devices in reducing HFrEF mortality and morbidity, and provides practical guidance on patient referral, device selection, implant timing and patient-centred follow-up.

### Left atrial appendage function by strain and structure is associated with thromboembolic risk in patients with cryptogenic stroke and TIA [^7dfdecda]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical AF is an established risk factor for stroke, and impaired LA function by strain has been shown to predict clinical AF in patients at risk in several studies and is associated with increased risk of cardiac embolism. Moreover, impaired LA function by strain is a marker of atrial fibrosis, which is associated with LAA thrombus, SEC and stroke in patients with clinical AF. Our results expand the complex interaction between impaired atrial function (including impaired LAA function), thrombogenesis, clinical and subclinical AF and stroke.

Thrombus was not associated with recurrent stroke/TIA in this selected study population. However, in patients with the highest burden of subclinical AF (> 6 hours), we found a significant association with both recurrent stroke/TIA and LAA SEC. The frequency of recurrent stroke/TIA was low (14/7.6%), and only 2/29 (7%) occurred in patients with LAA thrombus compared with 12/156 (8%) without LAA thrombus (ns). The best clinical practice for patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA may be to perform comprehensive TTE and TEE examination shortly after hospital admission to investigate potential cardioembolic sources. The present study demonstrated that multimodality and novel echocardiography imaging modes may increase the accuracy and yield to diagnose cardioembolic sources in patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA. Whether the present TEE imaging approach may improve treatment in patients at risk should be evaluated in randomised studies.

The frequency of PFO was increased in study patients compared with the general population. However, the frequency of PFO was not increased in patients aged < 60 years compared with patients aged > 60 years. Additionally, PFO was not associated with thromboembolic risk conditions, thrombus (table 2) or recurrent stroke, which aligns with findings from recent studies. The pathogenic role of PFO in patients with stroke has been discussed for decades; most cryptogenic strokes are embolic, and embolisms can originate from multiple minor-risk cardiogenic sources and supracardiac atherosclerosis.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for atrial fibrillation… [^350f9389]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 0. 2% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. It is uncertain whether the prevalence of AF differs by race and ethnicity. Quiz Ref IDClinical AF is an atrial tachyarrhythmia that has traditionally been defined by documentation of the arrhythmia on a standard surface electrocardiogram. Atrial fibrillation can be persistent or paroxysmal, and symptomatic or asymptomatic. As implantable cardiac devices and the use of portable or wearable cardiac monitoring devices have become more common, a new category of AF, called subclinical AF, has emerged. Subclinical AF refers to device-detected AF that is asymptomatic and not clinically apparent. It may be detected by intracardiac, implantable, or wearable cardiac monitors.

8, 9 The duration of subclinical AF can vary, ranging from a few seconds to more than 24 hours. 9 Atrial fibrillation burden refers to the amount or percentage of time that is spent in AF. Quiz Ref IDDifferent intensities of screening for AF are also being studied. Screening can be performed once, for example, by using ECG or a device with an AF detection algorithm at a clinician visit. Screening can also be performed intermittently on multiple occasions, for example, by having a patient briefly record their heart rhythm using a portable device several times a day or several times a week for a period of time; or continuously. The USPSTF categorizes these as 1-time screening strategies, intermittent screening strategies, and continuous screening strategies, respectively. Continuous screening strategies yield the longest overall duration of screening.

Intermittent or continuous screening may be more likely to detect AF but also may be more likely to detect paroxysmal AF that occurs infrequently or is of short duration.
10. Its prevalence increases from
0. 2% among adults younger than 55 years to 10% among those 85 years or older. 1 Additional risk factors for AF include diabetes, previous cardiothoracic surgery, smoking, prior stroke, underlying heart disease, hypertension, sleep apnea, obesity, alcohol/drug use, ECG features such as left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement, and hyperthyroidism. 15 The primary rationale for screening for AF in asymptomatic persons is to initiate oral anticoagulant medications in persons at sufficiently high risk to prevent a thromboembolic event. The USPSTF reviewed 9 studies on the accuracy of potential screening tests for AF. Two studies24, 25 of single-lead ECG devices with automated AF detection algorithms used as a 1-time screening test reported sensitivities of 0. 88 and
0.

99 and specificities of 1. 0 and
0. 76 when compared with a single 12-lead ECG interpreted by a cardiologist. One study of a 72-hour continuous Holter monitor compared with an insertable cardiac monitor29 found a sensitivity of 1. 0 when considering cases of AF detected during the 72-hour monitoring period covered by both devices. Over the entire duration of insertable cardiac monitoring, several additional cases of subclinical paroxysmal AF were detected, giving an overall sensitivity of 0. 12 for the 72-hour Holter monitor. The USPSTF found 4 randomized clinical trials that compared different 1-time screening approaches for the detection of AF with usual care or no screening. 30–36 The mean age of participants in these trials was 74 to 76 years. The USPSTF found 2 trials that used an intermittent screening approach and 2 trials that used a continuous screening approach. The mean age in these trials ranged from 72 to 80 years.

5.1	Reduced Efficacy in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min

SAVAYSA should not be used in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min. In the randomized ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, NVAF patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with SAVAYSA 60 mg daily compared to patients treated with warfarin. In these patients another anticoagulant should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

5.2	Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of SAVAYSA in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of ischemic events. If SAVAYSA is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant as described in the transition guidance [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Lacosamide [^4619a13b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). Lacosamide tablets should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

 Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind clinical trial of ivabradine for the prevention of cardiac dysfunction during anthracycline-based cancer therapy [^bd177022]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Procedures

The enrolled patients underwent medical evaluation; laboratory assessments, including cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin T and NT‐proBNP [N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide]); ECG; transthoracic echocardiogram featuring myocardial global longitudinal strain (GLS) measurements; and 24‐hour Holter monitoring at baseline (before the initiation of chemotherapy). For patients who met the eligibility criteria, randomization was performed, and the medication (ivabradine or placebo) was initiated on the first day of chemotherapy.

A standard global tool for assessing health and quality of life and analyzing mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (EuroQol‐5 Dimension‐3 Level questionnaire) was administered at baseline and after chemotherapy.

Sequential laboratory testing, ECG assessments, and transthoracic echocardiogram examinations of the strains were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months following the initiation of chemotherapy. At the 3‐ and 6‐month marks, all patients were still undergoing chemotherapy, which provide a uniform context for evaluating early cardiac changes. Holter monitoring was also performed at the conclusion of the treatment. An overview of the study procedures is provided in Figure 1. Transthoracic echocardiogram was conducted using a commercially available system with digital ultrasonic equipment (Vivid 9; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), and all measurements adhered to the recommendations provided by the American Society of Echocardiography.

Figure 1
Study procedures and assessment timeline.

The timeline and key medical assessments conducted at baseline (0 months), during the chemotherapy treatment phase with high‐dose anthracycline (3 and 6 months), and during the 12‐month follow‐up after intervention are summarized. The schedule included medical consultations, biomarker dosages, transthoracic echocardiogram, ECG, Holter monitoring, and EQ‐5D‐3L assessments at each designated time point (0, 3, 6, and 12 months). ANT indicates anthracycline; BID, twice daily; EQ‐5D‐3L: EuroQol‐5 Dimension‐3 Level; and TTE, transthoracic echocardiogram.

The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by Simpson's method via apical 4‐ and 2‐chamber views. Myocardial GLS analysis was performed via semiautomated speckle tracking, covering the whole LV from 3 apical views for the assessment of cardiac cycle tissue deformation. The endocardial border of the LV was manually traced at end‐systole and autoadjusted to include the full myocardium.

### Dofetilide (Tikosyn) [^a0c0c657]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm (Delay in AF/AFl Recurrence)

TIKOSYN is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter [AF/AFl]) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Because TIKOSYN can cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it should be reserved for patients in whom atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is highly symptomatic.

In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm. Recurrence is expected in some patients (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

TIKOSYN is indicated for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.

TIKOSYN has not been shown to be effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel group trial comparing two blinded dosages of dabigatran etexilate capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:

- Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism

- Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%

- Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2

- Age ≥ 75 years

- **Age ≥ 65 years and one of the following**: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension

The primary objective of this study was to determine if dabigatran etexilate capsules was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The study was designed to ensure that dabigatran etexilate capsules preserved more than 50% of warfarin's effect as established by previous randomized, placebo-controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. Statistical superiority was also analyzed.

Figure 4: Time to First Occurrence of Stroke (any type) or Non-CNS Systemic Embolism by Treatment Group (Intent-to-Treat Population)

Figure 5 shows the risk of stroke or non-CNS systemic embolism across major subgroups.

The efficacy of XARELTO was generally consistent across major subgroups.

The protocol for ROCKET AF did not stipulate anticoagulation after study drug discontinuation, but warfarin patients who completed the study were generally maintained on warfarin. XARELTO patients were generally switched to warfarin without a period of coadministration of warfarin and XARELTO, so that they were not adequately anticoagulated after stopping XARELTO until attaining a therapeutic INR. During the 28 days following the end of the study, there were 22 strokes in the 4637 patients taking XARELTO vs. 6 in the 4691 patients taking warfarin.

Few patients in ROCKET AF underwent electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The utility of XARELTO for preventing post-cardioversion stroke and systemic embolism is unknown.

### Propafenone hydrochloride [^83f27528]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated to:

prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.
prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease.
treat documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening. Initiate treatment in the hospital.

Usage Considerations:

The use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) or in patients exclusively with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Do not use Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets to control ventricular rate during AF.
Some patients with atrial flutter treated with propafenone have developed 1:1 conduction, producing an increase in ventricular rate. Concomitant treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractory period is recommended.
The use of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation has not been evaluated.
Because of the proarrhythmic effects of Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets, its use with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients are symptomatic, and any use of the drug should be reserved for patients in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
The effect of propafenone on mortality has not been determined [see Boxed Warning].

Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets are an antiarrhythmic indicated to:

prolong the time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with episodic (most likely paroxysmal or persistent) AF who do not have structural heart disease. (1)
prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with disabling symptoms in patients who do not have structural heart disease. (1)
treat documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. (1)

Usage Considerations:

Use in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or with atrial flutter or PSVT has not been evaluated. Do not use to control ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. (1)
In patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, use Propafenone Hydrochloride Tablets with drugs that increase the atrioventricular nodal refractory period. (1)
Because of proarrhythmic effects, use with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients are symptomatic. (1)
The effect of propafenone on mortality has not been determined. (1)

### Lacosamide (Vimpat) [^30c94a3e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). VIMPAT should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter

In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

### Atrial fibrillation treatment pathway in the emergency department reduces median 30-day health service charges [^2a115377]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Design ofTreatment Pathway

An AF treatment pathway with an option for discharge and expedited follow‐up at an AF transitions clinic was implemented with a staggered rollout across 7 hospitals ranging from small community‐based hospitals to tertiary and quaternary care centers within the UNC Hospital System from 2017 to 2020 (Table S1). The pathway was developed by various key experts in cardiology and emergency medicine and used a triage protocol within the ED, stratifying patients with AF into low‐, moderate‐, and high‐risk categories. Stratification was based on (1) comorbid conditions necessitating hospitalization, (2) hemodynamic stability, and (3) severity of AF symptoms (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Patients diagnosed with AF and assessed as low or moderate risk were considered for potential discharge from the ED with expedited outpatient follow‐up in the AF transitions clinic scheduled before discharge. Before the implementation of the AF treatment pathway, emergency physicians and other clinical providers were trained using lectures, handouts, and email reminders on the process of triaging patients with AF in the ED and identifying patients that would be appropriate for expedited referral to the AF transitions clinic. An evaluation template, order set, and patient educational material were built into the electronic medical record system as part of the implementation of the AF treatment pathway.

Figure 1
AF treatment pathway triage protocol for ED providers.

AF indicates atrial fibrillation; CCS‐SAF, Canadian Cardiovascular Society — severity of AF; ED, emergency department; HR, heart rate; and MAP, mean arterial pressure.

Five AF transitions clinics were embedded in existing outpatient cardiology facilities in the UNC system with established connections to the 7 emergency departments. The transitions clinics were staffed by a clinical pharmacist or nurse practitioner trained on AF treatment guidelines and overseen by a cardiologist or electrophysiologist. In all clinics, a few appointment slots were restructured to be designated only for ED referrals for AF transitions care. The clinic used an integrated care model focused on (1) AF guideline‐directed management of rate and rhythm control, symptom management, and stroke prophylaxis; (2) assessment and treatment of modifiable risk factors; (3) AF‐specific patient education; and (4) coordination of care with the patient care team. Further details on the background and development of the AF treatment pathway and the AF transitions clinic are discussed elsewhere by Gehi et al.

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^9c84a2a7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions

Because initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring

Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring

If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.

Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients:

With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel group trial comparing two blinded dosages of dabigatran etexilate capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^ef647a0c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Sotalol hydrochloride AF was shown to prolong the time to the first symptomatic, ECG-documented recurrence of AFIB/AFL, as well as to reduce the risk of such recurrences at both 6 and 12 months. The 120 mg dose was more effective than 80 mg, but 160 mg did not appear to have an added benefit. Note that these doses were given twice or once daily, depending on renal function. The results are shown in Figure 1, Table 3, and Table 4.

Note that columns do not add up to 100% due to discontinuations (D/C) for "other" reasons.

Table 4: Study 1 – Median Time to Recurrence of Symptomatic AFIB/AFL and Relative Risk (vs. Placebo) at 12 Months

Discontinuation because of adverse events was dose-related.

In a second multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 6 months duration in 232 patients with chronic AFIB, sotalol hydrochloride AF was titrated over a dose range from 80 mg/day to 320 mg/day. The patient population of this trial was 70% male with a mean age of 65 years. Structural heart disease was present in 49% of the patients. All patients had chronic AFIB for > 2 weeks but < 1 year at entry with a mean duration of 4.1 months. Patients were excluded if they had significant electrolyte imbalance, QTc > 460 msec, QRS > 140 msec, any degree of AV block or functioning pacemaker, uncompensated cardiac failure, asthma, significant renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), heart rate < 50 bpm, myocardial infarction or open heart surgery in past 2 months, unstable angina, infective endocarditis, active pericarditis or myocarditis, ≥ 3 DC cardioversions in the past, medications that prolonged QT interval, and previous amiodarone treatment. After successful cardioversion patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 114) or sotalol hydrochloride AF (n = 118), at a starting dose of 80 mg twice daily. If the initial dose was not tolerated it was decreased to 80 mg once daily, but if it was tolerated, it was increased to 160 mg twice daily. During the maintenance period 67% of treated patients received a dose of 160 mg twice daily, and the remainder received doses of 80 mg once daily (17%) and 80 mg twice daily (16%).

### Dofetilide (Tikosyn) [^c1d773a0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3 and Figures 3 and 4 show, by randomized dose, the effectiveness of TIKOSYN in maintaining NSR using Kaplan Meier analysis, which shows patients remaining on treatment.

Figure 3: Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm, TIKOSYN Regimen vs. Placebo (Study 1)

The point estimates of the probabilities of remaining in NSR at 6 and 12 months were 62% and 58%, respectively, for TIKOSYN 500 mcg BID; 50% and 37%, respectively, for TIKOSYN 250 mcg BID; and 37%, and 25%, respectively, for placebo.

Figure 4: Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm, TIKOSYN Regimen vs. Placebo (Study 2)

The point estimates of the probabilities of remaining in NSR at 6 and 12 months were 71% and 66%, respectively, for TIKOSYN 500 mcg BID; 56% and 51%, respectively, for TIKOSYN 250 mcg BID; and 26% and 21%, respectively, for placebo.

In both studies, TIKOSYN resulted in a dose-related increase in the number of patients maintained in NSR at all time periods and delayed the time of recurrence of sustained AF. Data pooled from both studies show that there is a positive relationship between the probability of staying in NSR, TIKOSYN dose, and increase in QTc (see Figure 2 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Dose-Response and Concentration Response for Increase in QT Interval).

Analysis of pooled data for patients randomized to a TIKOSYN dose of 500 mcg twice daily showed that maintenance of NSR was similar in both males and females, in both patients aged < 65 years and patients ≥ 65 years of age, and in both patients with atrial flutter as a primary diagnosis and those with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.

During the period of in-hospital initiation of dosing, 23% of patients in Studies 1 and 2 had their dose adjusted downward on the basis of their calculated creatinine clearance, and 3% had their dose down-titrated due to increased QT interval or QTc. Increased QT interval or QTc led to discontinuation of therapy in 3% of patients.

### Translating the 2021 ESC heart failure guideline recommendations in daily practice: results from a heart failure survey. A scientific statement of the ESC council for cardiology practice and the heart failure association of the ESC [^83b8b186]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Real-world data show that guidelines are insufficiently implemented, and particularly guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) are underused in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in clinical practice. The Council for Cardiology Practice and the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed a survey aiming to (i) evaluate the perspectives of the cardiology community on the 2021 ESC heart failure (HF) guidelines, (ii) pinpoint disparities in disease management, and (iii) propose strategies to enhance adherence to HF guidelines.

Methods and Results

A 22-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of HFrEF was delivered between March and June 2022. Of 457 physicians, 54% were general cardiologists, 19.4% were HF specialists, 18.9% other cardiac specialists, and 7.7% non-cardiac specialists. For diagnosis, 52.1% employed echocardiography and natriuretic peptides (NPs), 33.2% primarily used echocardiography, and 14.7% predominantly relied on NPs. The first drug class initiated in HFrEF was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ACEi/ARNi) (91.2%), beta-blockers (BB) (73.8%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (53.4%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (48.1%). The combination ACEi/ARNi + MRA+ BB was preferred by 39.3% of physicians, ACEi/ARNi + SGLT2 inhibitors + BB by 33.3%, and ACEi/ARNi + BB by 22.2%. The time required to initiate and optimize GDMT was estimated to be < 1month by 8.3%, 1-3months by 52%, 3-6months by 31.8%, and > 6months by 7.9%. Compared to general cardiologists, HF specialists/academic cardiologists reported lower estimated time-to-initiation, and more commonly preferred a parallel initiation of GDMT rather than a sequential approach.

Conclusion

Participants generally followed diagnostic and treatment guidelines, but variations in HFrEF management across care settings or HF specialties were noted. The survey may raise awareness and promote standardized HF care.

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were pre-specified (diabetic status was not pre-specified in the subgroup, but was a criterion for the CHADS₂ score). The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

The efficacy of rivaroxaban tablets was generally consistent across major subgroups.

The protocol for ROCKET AF did not stipulate anticoagulation after study drug discontinuation, but warfarin patients who completed the study were generally maintained on warfarin. Rivaroxaban tablets patients were generally switched to warfarin without a period of coadministration of warfarin and rivaroxaban tablets, so that they were not adequately anticoagulated after stopping rivaroxaban tablets until attaining a therapeutic INR. During the 28 days following the end of the study, there were 22 strokes in the 4637 patients taking rivaroxaban tablets vs. 6 in the 4691 patients taking warfarin.

Few patients in ROCKET AF underwent electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. The utility of rivaroxaban tablets for preventing post-cardioversion stroke and systemic embolism is unknown.

### Family screening in relatives at risk for plakophilin-2-associated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^01b2af92]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Population

The study population was recruited from the Netherlands ACM registry (Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy; UCC-UNRAVEL No. 12–387) and the Johns Hopkins ARVC registry. From both registries, we identified all families in which the proband fulfilled definite ARVC diagnosis as per 2010 Task Force Criteria (TFC)and who carried a P/LP PKP2 variant. All PKP2 variant classifications were adjudicated by an experienced cardiac genetic counselor (B.M.) according to the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants set forth by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Among the families identified, all relatives with a P/LP PKP2 variant who underwent a baseline screening evaluation in which definite ARVC diagnosis could be ascertained were included, as described later. We excluded relatives who had a sustained VA before their first clinical evaluation because they were no longer at risk for a first VA. The study population partially consisted of relatives who had been included in previous ARVC studies.– The data used in this study are available on reasonable request. This study followed the code of conduct and the use of data in health research and was approved by local ethics or institutional review boards.

Clinical Evaluation

Participants were evaluated as described previously. Medical history was obtained by review of medical records or clinical evaluation. Detailed clinical information on demographics, presentation, symptom onset, and noninvasive testing was obtained. Pedigree analysis was performed by genetic counselors with expertise in ARVC. Relatives were categorized according to their relationship to the proband as first-, second-, or third-degree relatives; first-degree relatives were subdivided into parents, siblings, and children of the proband.

All relatives underwent guideline-recommended baseline screening evaluation in which definite ARVC diagnosis could be ascertained, defined as a 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor of at least 24 hours, and an imaging evaluation of cardiac structure and function (echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]). – Testing results from other modalities (eg, electrophysiology studies) were also collected. For follow-up evaluations, we included all available clinical testing performed at the discretion of the treating cardiologist, including 12-lead ECG, Holter monitoring of ≥ 24 hours, and repeat imaging (echocardiogram or CMR).

### Sotalol hydrochloride [^efb13d44]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sotalol hydrochloride/Sotalol hydrochloride AF tablets are an antiarrhythmic indicated for:

the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (1.1)
the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFIB/AFL) (1.2)

Limitations of Use

Sotalol hydrochloride has not been shown to enhance survival in patients with life threatening ventricular arrhythmias (1.1)
Avoid use in patients with minimally symptomatic or easily reversible AFIB/AFL (1.2)

1.1 Life-Threatening Ventricular Arrhythmias

Sotalol hydrochloride/Sotalol hydrochloride AF tablets are indicated for the treatment of documented, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Limitation of Use:

Sotalol hydrochloride/Sotalol hydrochloride AF has not been shown to enhance survival in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

1.2 Delay in Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter (AFIB/AFL)

Sotalol hydrochloride/Sotalol hydrochloride AF tablets are indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of AFIB/AFL) in patients with highly symptomatic AFIB/AFL who are currently in sinus rhythm.

Limitation of Use:

Because sotalol hydrochloride/sotalol hydrochloride AF tablets can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, reserve its use for patients in whom AFIB/AFL is highly symptomatic. Patients with paroxysmal AFIB that is easily reversed (by Valsalva maneuver, for example) should usually not be given sotalol hydrochloride/sotalol hydrochloride AF tablets.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation with electrocardiography: US preventive services task force recommendation… [^9f96e2e3]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting about 3% of men and 2% of women aged 65 to 69 years and about 10% of adults 85 years and older. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much as 5-fold. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation are first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting about 3% of men and 2% of women aged 65 to 69 years and about 10% of adults 85 years and older. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, increasing risk of stroke by as much as 5-fold.

Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation are first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the time of stroke or shortly thereafter. Pulse palpation and heart auscultation can also detect atrial fibrillation. In the systematic review discussed above, pulse palpation was reported to have relatively good sensitivity but lower specificity than ECG for detecting atrial fibrillation. 3 However, to address this lower specificity, confirmatory ECG can be readily performed in practice in response to an irregular pulse. For approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with atrial fibrillation, stroke is the first sign that they have the condition. 7 If persons with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation could be detected earlier and start preventive therapy earlier, some of these strokes might be avoided. The primary outcome is stroke incidence. The SCREEN-AF study randomized more than 800 participants to a 2-week ambulatory ECG patch monitor or usual care. The primary outcome is new diagnosis of ECG-confirmed atrial fibrillation or flutter, but clinical events are included as secondary outcomes. The IDEAL-MD study randomized 16 000 adults older than 65 years to screening with a single-lead ECG device or usual care. The primary outcome is new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation over 1 year; secondary outcomes include major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2. 7 million individuals in the United States. 1 The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age, from less than 0. 2% among adults younger than 55 years to 10% among those older than 85 years. 2 Although the age-adjusted hospitalization.

rate for atrial fibrillation among adults older than 65 years has stabilized since 2006, it has steadily increased for younger adults. 16 A meta-analysis of 19 studies found that about 1% of the adult population may have undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, although the prevalence varies among different populations. 7 Atrial fibrillation may progress over time, causing worsening symptoms and exacerbating heart failure. Three fair-quality randomized clinical trials in the United Kingdom assessed screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG. The first study randomized 3001 patients to prompted pulse palpation or systematic screening.

### Evaluation of 2 different wrist actigraphy devices in the adult population [^be3a0245]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Actigraphy devices are used in sleep medicine. The Actiwatch 2 (Philips Respironics) was an example of a frequently used device in this field. Nevertheless, the discontinuation of this device has led to an increased necessity for the implementation of other available actigraphy methods capable of providing objective information. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of the new ActTrust 2 compared to the Actiwatch 2 model.

Methods

This observational prospective study included 9 participants (77.760 activity logs) who were monitored for 7 days using 2 actigraphy wrist devices (ActTrust 2 and Actiwatch 2) simultaneously. The following variables were evaluated: midline estimating statistic of rhythm, amplitude, and acrophase; intradaily variability; interdaily stability; relative amplitude; and the mean of 5 consecutive hours with the lowest activity and the 10 consecutive hours with the highest activity. Furthermore, total sleep time, time in bed, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and awakenings were also included.

Results

Actigraphy models indicated statistically significant differences in activity levels. Regarding the analysis of circadian rest-activity rhythms, 10 consecutive hours with the highest activity, midline estimating statistic of rhythm, and amplitude also exhibited these differences. Furthermore, the analysis of sleep-wakefulness revealed significant differences in the sleep onset latency and the number of awakenings.

Conclusions

The ActTrust 2 and Actiwatch 2 models showed equivalent results in measuring circadian rest-activity rhythm and sleep. However, caution is advised when interpreting parameters such as midline estimating statistic of rhythm, amplitude, sleep onset latency, awakenings, and 10 consecutive hours with the highest activity variables.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^9488550a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Proarrhythmia

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation, by intravenous amiodarone. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone, TdP or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Monitor patients for QTc prolongation during infusion with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection. Reserve the combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapies that prolong the QTc to patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent.

Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia whenever possible before initiating treatment with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and laxatives.

5.7 Pulmonary Injury

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and masses on X-ray, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy.

Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure or death. Monitor for new respiratory symptoms and evaluate appropriately. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests in patients who are expected to be receiving amiodarone chronically.

5.8 Loss of Vision

Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment, have been reported in patients treated with oral amiodarone or intravenous amiodarone. In some cases, visual impairment has progressed to permanent blindness. Optic neuropathy and neuritis may occur at any time following initiation of therapy. Perform an ophthalmic examination if symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision. Re-evaluate the necessity of amiodarone therapy if optic neuropathy or neuritis is suspected.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^1cd522b8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Heart Failure (LVEF ≥ 40%)

FINEARTS-HF (NCT: 04435626) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II–IV) with documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%. Patients were required to have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²and serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L at screening and randomization and were receiving background heart failure medical treatment, including diuretics. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events comprised of hospitalization for heart failure and urgent heart failure visits.

In FINEARTS-HF, 6001 patients were analyzed; 3003 were randomized to Kerendia and 2998 were randomized to placebo and were followed for a median of 2.7 years. The study included 3247 (54%) patients with a heart failure event in the past 3 months, including 1219 (20%) patients randomized during the hospitalization or within 7 days from the heart failure event. Patients with eGFR ≥ 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²initiated Kerendia 10 mg and patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²initiated Kerendia 20 mg, and both groups were titrated up to a target dose of Kerendia 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively. At month 6, approximately 65% of the patients reached their target dose. The trial population was 79% White, 17% Asian, and 1.5% Black. The mean age at enrollment was 72 years and 46% of patients were female. At baseline, the mean LVEF was 53%, with 64% of patients having an LVEF ≥ 50%, and 69% and 30% of patients were NYHA class II and III, respectively. Mean blood pressure was 129/75 mmHg and mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m². The median NT-proBNP was 1041 pg/mL, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73 m²with 48% of patients having an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Atrial fibrillation was present on screening/baseline ECG for 38% of patients and 41% had diabetes mellitus. The majority of patients were on loop diuretics (87%), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (79%), or an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) (9%), and 14% were on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

Recommendation 12 — Referral for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases — A patient with atypical findings or in whom there is uncertainty about how to interpret the evaluation, or that is suspected of having an early-onset or rapidly progressive cognitive–behavioral condition, should be further evaluated expeditiously, usually including referral to a specialist (Strength of Recommendation A). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered to be urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management, and atypical, rapidly progressive or early-onset (young age of onset, age < 65 years) dementias pose unique diagnostic and care challenges that may require comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and specialist assessment, interpretation, or management.

### Atomoxetine [^f3e858d5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children and Adolescents - Sudden death has been reported in association with atomoxetine treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, atomoxetine generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the noradrenergic effects of atomoxetine.

Adults - Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of atomoxetine in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Consideration should be given to not treating adults with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities.

Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Atomoxetine

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with atomoxetine should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

### How treatment choices influence the onset and outcomes of uveitis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a retrospective cohort study [^aadc1017]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Uveitis is a prevalent complication of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), leading to ocular morbidity. This study aimed to evaluate uveitis frequency in JIA patients on biologics and explore the impact of biologic selection on its occurrence.

Methods

Among 2,385 JIA patients reviewed, 101 patients who developed uveitis were analyzed. This patients were categorized based on their uveitis development: under methotrexate, after discontinuation of methotrexate, and under biologics.

Results

Uveitis frequency among all reviewed JIA patients was 6.3%. Among those who developed uveitis while receiving biologics, 30 were on etanercept and one on infliximab at the time of onset. When the entire cohort of JIA patients treated with biologics for joint symptoms was evaluated, it was observed that out of 365 patients using etanercept, uveitis developed in 30 individuals, in one out of 39 patients using infliximab, while no cases of uveitis were observed among 285 patients using adalimumab.

Conclusion

In this study we observed a larger frequency of new onset uveitis in JIA patients treated with TNF receptor fusion proteins than those treated with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal anti-TNF-α agents may remain the preferred options. This study highlights the necessity of integrating uveitis risk assessment into JIA treatment strategies.
