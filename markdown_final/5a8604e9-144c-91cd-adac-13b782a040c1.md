## Question

Treatment plan for someone with dyspnea on exertion and small right basilar effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a treatment plan for someone with dyspnea on exertion and a small right basilar pleural effusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of a "small" effusion and whether it is likely to explain exertional dyspnea. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis for unilateral effusions and prioritize malignant, infectious, and cardiac etiologies. Next, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to pursue thoracentesis and what labs to send. After that, I need to consider management pathways for malignant versus non-malignant effusions, including when to use indwelling pleural catheters versus pleurodesis. Finally, I should integrate symptom control for dyspnea and specify follow-up and red flags that would change management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of a "small" right basilar effusion. Small effusions are often incidental and may not independently cause exertional dyspnea, so I should be cautious not to anchor on the effusion as the sole driver of symptoms without corroborating data, especially since dyspnea is multifactorial in many patients [^68a42b58] [^3f69e6fb]. Wait, let me verify the physiology: even modest effusions can impair exercise capacity via mechanical constraints and increased work of breathing, and therapeutic drainage can improve dyspnea and exercise tolerance independent of oxygenation changes, so I shouldn't dismiss a contributory role without testing response [^cfabe9a3].

> Next, I should review the differential for a unilateral right basilar effusion. Malignancy, infection, and heart failure are the leading causes, with pulmonary embolism also on the list, so I need to ensure I don't miss these entities while I proceed stepwise [^68a42b58]. Hold on, I should verify that unilateral effusions are less likely to be purely cardiogenic; yes, bilateral effusions are more typical of heart failure, though unilateral effusions can still occur, so I should interpret any HF biomarker in the right clinical context and not overcall it [^68a42c58] [^0d4402cd].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic workup. I need to check vitals, oxygen saturation, and a focused exam for signs of heart failure, infection, or malignancy, and I should obtain a chest radiograph to confirm size and laterality, while also ordering CBC, BMP, and considering NT-proBNP if heart failure is suspected, recognizing that serum NT-proBNP alone won't diagnose a unilateral effusion and must be interpreted with the clinical picture [^68a42c58] [^1469ff45]. Let me consider imaging adjuncts: point-of-care chest ultrasound improves detection and characterization of small effusions and should guide any thoracentesis to reduce complications, so I should prioritize ultrasound if available [^14096770] [^53d48f60].

> Now, I should confirm when to perform diagnostic thoracentesis. For a new, unilateral effusion that is more than minimal, and in the absence of clear decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure responsive to therapy, diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated to distinguish exudate from transudate and to evaluate for infection or malignancy, and I should use ultrasound guidance to mitigate pneumothorax risk [^e5255fe6] [^37609452]. Hold on, I should verify what to send: standard tests include cell count with differential, protein, LDH, pH, Gram stain, culture, and cytology, with additional tests such as ADA and TB studies if epidemiologically indicated, and pleural fluid NT-proBNP can be considered when heart failure is suspected but is not routinely superior to serum testing [^68a42c58] [^559e223e].

> Let me think about malignant pleural effusion pathways if cytology is positive or strongly suspected. I should confirm lung expansion with a large-volume therapeutic thoracentesis if pleurodesis is contemplated, because nonexpandable lung changes management toward an indwelling pleural catheter rather than talc pleurodesis, and I should discuss IPC versus pleurodesis with shared decision-making given similar efficacy but different logistics and risks [^e01aa130] [^e2aaf1f0]. Wait, I should double-check the nonexpandable lung prevalence; it occurs in roughly 30% of MPEs, which is why assessing re-expansion is a pivotal step before committing to pleurodesis [^348dba44].

> For malignant effusions with expandable lung, I should confirm that either talc pleurodesis or an indwelling pleural catheter are acceptable first-line definitive options, with talc poudrage and talc slurry having comparable success in randomized data, and the choice individualized to patient preferences, support at home, and desire to avoid hospitalization [^e3883d3c] [^dfbf0d4c]. Hold on, I should verify infection risks and practicalities: IPCs carry about an 8% infection risk but most are manageable with antibiotics without catheter removal, and patients do not require daily drainage, which can be tailored to symptoms, so counseling on home care and expectations is essential [^ab542dc7] [^e4879599].

> For malignant effusions with nonexpandable lung, I need to ensure I avoid talc pleurodesis and favor an IPC for symptom control, reserving repeat thoracentesis for those with very limited prognosis or when IPC is not feasible, and I should involve palliative care early for symptom management and goals-of-care discussions [^53931da9] [^aa6419a1]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline supports pleurodesis in nonexpandable lung; the ATS advises against talc pleurodesis in this setting due to low likelihood of success, reinforcing the IPC-first approach here [^53931da9].

> If the effusion is not malignant, I should tailor therapy to the underlying cause. For parapneumonic effusions, I need to check for complicated features and a low pH, which would prompt prompt drainage and possible intrapleural fibrinolytics, whereas simple effusions may resolve with antibiotics alone, and I should use image guidance for drain placement in septated or loculated collections [^68a42c58] [^e5272c4f]. For heart failure–related effusions, I should optimize guideline-directed medical therapy and reassess; if dyspnea persists despite optimal therapy and a large, recurrent effusion develops, options include repeated thoracentesis or, rarely, pleurodesis in select cases, balancing risks and benefits [^0d2c7cf5]. For pulmonary embolism, I should confirm with appropriate imaging and initiate anticoagulation, as effusions in PE are typically exudative and resolve with treatment of the embolism [^notfound].

> I need to ensure robust symptom control for dyspnea regardless of etiology. Let me verify nonpharmacologic options: fans directed at the face, breathing retraining, and activity pacing can reduce breathlessness, and in selected nonhypoxemic patients, a time-limited trial of low-flow oxygen or medical air may be reasonable, though routine oxygen is not recommended for nonhypoxemic dyspnea [^5bac1576] [^e242bc24]. But wait, what if anxiety or deconditioning contribute? I should screen for these and offer pulmonary rehabilitation or behavioral strategies as appropriate, and consider early palliative care input for refractory symptoms or advanced disease [^3f69e6fb].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. I will reassess dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and imaging within 2 to 4 weeks to document trajectory, and if an IPC is placed, I will provide written instructions on drainage frequency and volume, signs of infection, and when to seek care, with scheduled nursing support for home drainage training [^e412946a]. Hold on, I should verify red flags that warrant urgent reassessment: new fever, pleuritic pain, rapid effusion recurrence, or worsening hypoxemia, which could signal infection, empyema, or disease progression requiring prompt intervention [^notfound].

> In summary, I should confirm that a small right basilar effusion may contribute to but not fully explain exertional dyspnea, pursue a staged diagnostic evaluation with ultrasound and selective thoracentesis, treat based on the underlying cause with MPE-specific pathways if malignant, and prioritize symptom control and shared decision-making throughout, adjusting the plan as new data emerge [^68a42c58] [^3f69e6fb].

For a patient with dyspnea on exertion and a small right basilar pleural effusion, the priority is to **identify and treat the underlying cause** [^e5255fe6] while providing **symptom relief**. Start with a **focused evaluation** — history, exam, chest ultrasound [^14096770], and basic labs — to distinguish transudate from exudate and guide next steps [^68a42c58]. If the effusion is transudative, optimize management of heart failure, cirrhosis, or renal disease; if exudative, pursue diagnostic thoracentesis [^e5255fe6] with cytology, cultures, and biomarkers to evaluate for infection or malignancy [^68a42c58]. Small effusions often respond to medical therapy, but if dyspnea persists, consider therapeutic thoracentesis [^e5255fe6] or an indwelling pleural catheter [^9d948497]. Address dyspnea with oxygen, bronchodilators, and pulmonary rehabilitation as indicated [^e242bc24], and escalate to pleural interventions if symptoms persist despite optimal medical management [^9d948497].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial assessment

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for heart failure, liver disease, renal disease, malignancy, or infection; look for signs of pleural effusion (dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds) [^e242bc24].

- **Chest radiography**: Confirm effusion size and location; small basilar effusions may be subtle on CXR [^notfound].

- **Chest ultrasound**: Essential to characterize effusion, guide procedures, and detect loculations or septations [^14096770] [^53d48f60].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, renal function, liver function, thyroid function, and NT-proBNP if heart failure is suspected [^5df0349e].

---

### Pleural fluid analysis

Perform **diagnostic thoracentesis** [^e5255fe6] if the effusion is new, unexplained, or larger than minimal, using ultrasound guidance to reduce complications [^37609452]. Apply **Light's criteria** to distinguish exudate from transudate [^68a42c58]. Send fluid for cytology, Gram stain, culture, LDH, protein, pH, glucose, ADA, and triglycerides as indicated [^68a42c58]. Consider pleural fluid NT-proBNP if heart failure is suspected [^559e223e].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Transudative effusions** | **Exudative effusions** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure | Malignancy (lung, breast, lymphoma) |
| Cirrhosis (hepatic hydrothorax) | Infection (pneumonia, tuberculosis) |
| Nephrotic syndrome | Pulmonary embolism |
| Hypoalbuminemia | Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE |
| Peritoneal dialysis | Mesothelioma |

---

## Management strategies

### Transudative effusions

For transudative effusions, **medical management** focuses on optimizing therapy for the underlying condition (e.g. diuretics and afterload reduction for heart failure, salt restriction and diuretics for cirrhosis, or dialysis for renal disease). Therapeutic thoracentesis is reserved for persistent, symptomatic effusions despite optimal medical therapy [^0d2c7cf5].

---

### Exudative effusions

- **Malignant effusions**: Consider pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) for symptom control and to prevent recurrence [^9d948497] [^8819b145].

- **Infectious effusions**: Treat underlying infection; consider chest tube drainage for empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions [^e5272c4f].

- **Inflammatory effusions**: Manage underlying autoimmune disease; consider corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy.

---

## Symptomatic management of dyspnea

- **Oxygen therapy**: Use if SpO2 < 90% or if the patient reports relief with oxygen [^e242bc24].

- **Bronchodilators**: Consider if airflow limitation is present (COPD, asthma) [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity and reduces dyspnea [^notfound].

- **Fan therapy**: Non-pharmacologic relief of breathlessness [^5bac1576].

---

## Indications for pleural interventions

Intervention is indicated for **persistent dyspnea** despite optimal medical management or for **recurrent effusions** that require repeated drainage. Options include therapeutic thoracentesis for short-term relief, pleurodesis for durable control in expandable lung [^e3883d3c], and an indwelling pleural catheter for recurrent effusions or nonexpandable lung [^53931da9].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular clinical assessment** of dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and signs of recurrence. Repeat imaging with chest radiography or ultrasound is warranted if symptoms recur or worsen. Patient education should cover recognizing recurrence and when to seek medical attention.

---

## Conclusion

A patient with dyspnea on exertion and a small right basilar pleural effusion requires a **structured approach**: confirm the effusion and characterize it, identify and treat the cause, and provide symptom relief. Most small effusions resolve with medical therapy, but persistent symptoms may necessitate pleural interventions.

REVIEW OF GUIDELINES

Asymptomatic MPE

In asymptomatic patients with known or suspected MPE, the general consensus is that therapeutic pleural interventions should not be performed.

Symptomatic MPE With Nonexpandable Lung

Approximately 30% of patients with symptomatic MPE exhibit nonexpandable lungs, which is defined as an inability to occupy over 75% of the chest cavity after drainage. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) advises against chemical (talc) pleurodesis in the setting of known nonexpandable lungs, highlighting its rare effectiveness, and instead recommends IPCs as the treatment of choice. For nonexpandable lung cases with a predicted very short survival, ATS recommends palliative care for dyspnea, involving repeat thoracentesis, oxygen, and morphine. Similarly, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS), and Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SECT) advocate for IPCs in MPE cases with nonexpandable lung.

In contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2023 guidelines propose stratified treatment on the basis of the extent of lung re-expansion. For patients with radiologically significant (> 25%) nonexpandable lungs, IPCs are favored over talc pleurodesis, whereas those with < 25% nonexpandable lungs may obtain QOL benefits from talc slurry pleurodesis or IPC. Surgical intervention is generally not recommended, although in highly selected patients with trapped lungs, where expandable lungs are a key priority, decortication can be considered. Although BTS acknowledges thoracentesis as an option, it recommends discussing alternatives with the patient due to the need for multiple procedures.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in theJournal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published inJournal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 78-year-old woman with a 40-pack-year smoking history has been referred for treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. She presented with a persistent cough and worsening dyspnea on exertion. A chest x-ray followed by a chest computed tomography scan revealed a 3-cm right upper lobe mass along with a moderate-size pleural effusion. Pleural fluid cytology was positive for adenocarcinoma. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was negative. A reflex molecular profile, includingKRAS, EGFR, ALK, BRAF, HER2, RET, MET, andROS, did not reveal an actionable abnormality. Her past medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, and osteopenia. Her medications include a β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, oral antidiabetic agent, calcium, and vitamin D. The laboratory evaluation is notable for a hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL and a creatinine clearance of 36 mL/min. The other laboratories are within normal limits. She is somewhat limited by the shortness of breath but maintains an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. She is independent in all of her instrumental and basic activities of daily living and denies falls. She has been referred to discuss treatment options.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^53931da9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — the algorithm branches to "Asymptomatic", where "Pleural intervention not needed (unless for diagnostic purposes)", and to "Symptomatic", where "Ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis (i.e., large-volume tap*)" is performed "With goals of assessing lung expansion and relief of dyspnea" and "may not be necessary if the patient's dyspnea is known to be attributable to the MPE". Subsequent decision-making includes "Lung re-expansion"; if "Predicted very short survival", then "Palliate dyspnea with: repeat thoracentesis if needed, oxygen, morphine", whereas if not, "Consider placement of IPC (IPC should also be considered in patients with failed pleurodesis or symptomatic loculated effusion)". When lung re-expansion is achieved, proceed to "Discussion of relative risks / benefits of IPC vs. pleurodesis vs. combination approaches" and consider "Talc poudrage or talc slurry ± IPC". For "Evidence of IPC-related infection", the pathway directs "Initiation of oral antibiotics based on local sensitivities. Attempt to keep catheter in place"; the footnote notes "there is a low likelihood (2–4%) of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)–related infection" and that escalation of care "should be made on a case-by-case basis and is recommended if there are any signs/symptoms of worsening infection". A prognostic caution states "Physicians are not great predictors of prognosis" and the "Predicted very short survival" recommendation "should be used as a rough guideline and individualized on a case-by-case basis".

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^3f69e6fb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — underlying conditions and comorbidities in dyspnea management states that patients with potentially reversible etiologies of dyspnea "should be given goal-concordant treatment(s)" and that patients with dyspnea because of underlying malignancy "may benefit from cancer-directed treatments", with patients who have comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure having management of these conditions optimized. In patients with advanced cancer, "dyspnea is often multifactorial in nature with a combination of acute and chronic causes", and selected condition-directed approaches "may improve significantly" or "may be effective", including drainage for malignant pleural or pericardial effusions and ascites, bronchoscopic interventions for malignant central airway obstruction, and systemic therapy or radiation in appropriate cases, while "the risks and benefits should always be carefully balanced". Patients with advanced cancer often have multiple comorbidities, and "more than 50% of patients with lung cancer have a diagnosis of COPD", underscoring that "optimal treatment of comorbid diagnoses is essential to alleviating dyspnea" and that "primary care clinicians and/or other specialists such as pulmonologists should be actively engaged in the optimization of these comorbidities if not already".

Practical Considerations

For some patients, the initial diagnosis of ILD or ILA may occur at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. Given that ILD and ILA increase the risks associated with lung cancer treatment, providers should pay particular attention to CT findings that may suggest an ILD (Figs. 2 and 3). These CT findings include the presence of ground-glass opacities, reticular markings, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing. For patients with a suspected diagnosis of ILD, we recommend pulmonary evaluation as knowledge of the type of ILD may help with balancing risks and benefits of lung cancer treatments with prognosis of the underlying lung disease.

Left. Coronal CT image demonstrates the lung cancer (arrow) and lower lung predominant fibrosis marked by volume loss, ground-glass opacities, and traction bronchiectasis. Right. Axial CT image of the lung bases demonstrates peripheral predominant ground glass, reticular markings, and traction bronchiectasis (arrows) most consistent with a non-specific interstitial pneumonitis pattern.

Figure 3.

Left: Sagittal CT image demonstrates the nodule (arrow) and honeycombing with an apical basilar gradient consistent with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern. Right: Axial CT image of the lung bases demonstrates stacked cystic structures (arrows) consistent with honeycombing.

For a patient with ILD we recommend that multi-disciplinary discussions include a pulmonologist prior to starting lung cancer treatment and throughout therapy. This multidisciplinary approach encourages frequent discussion between providers which makes adjusting and implementing changes to patient treatment plans more efficient especially if pneumonitis develops. Where possible we recommend that patients with ILD undergo pulmonary function tests (PFTs) prior to treatment initiation, including spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO. This allows for the grading of the severity of lung function impairment which may inform what treatment options may be available (for example, surgical candidacy). PFTs should be measured periodically throughout treatment to assess for interval changes to signify ILD progression. We also recommend interval monitoring of oxygen levels at rest and with exertion to assess the need for supplemental oxygen or adjustment to existing supplemental oxygen flow rates, especially in the setting of worsening dyspnea. Lastly, as lung cancer treatment may exacerbate pre-existing respiratory symptoms early referral to palliative care may be beneficial.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^46cf0c2a]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Installation of an IPC is usually an ambulatory procedure and involves the insertion of a tube attached to a one-way valve into the pleural space, allowing fluid to be drained from the pleural cavity as needed. Community nurses and caregivers are typically assigned to undertake regular fluid drainage at the patient's home. Approximately 50% of patients achieve autopleurodesis after 3 months of treatment with daily drainage using an IPC.

Surgical interventions have similar efficacy to talc pleurodesis but are much more invasive. Therefore, surgery is typically reserved for unusual cases in which talc pleurodesis or IPC placement is not possible.

The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life (QOL), prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. There are no differences in the mean efficacy between talc pleurodesis and IPCs in reducing breathlessness. In the TIME2 trial, Davies et alrandomly assigned patients to receive IPC or inpatient talc slurry pleurodesis, and found no significant difference in the primary outcome of dyspnea scores at 6 weeks. Similarly, the AMPLE randomized controlled trial found that IPC or talc slurry resulted in sustained improvements in breathlessness and QOL scores, with no difference between the two treatment arms. Furthermore, the OPTIMUM trial found no significant differences in patient-reported global health status (measured by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30) at 1 month between IPC and talc slurry pleurodesis. Since neither talc pleurodesis nor IPCs are clearly more efficacious for symptom control, treatment choices are made on a patient-by-patient basis based on the preferences, characteristics, and specific clinical challenges of each patient.

This review aims to support clinicians in making individual treatment decisions for MPE. We summarize the current treatment guidelines, provide guidance on specific difficult treatment scenarios, outline key clinical considerations for treatment choice, and recommend best practices to support optimal referral and coordination of care.

### Symptom relief after large-volume thoracentesis in the absence of lung perfusion [^11d6afc0]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The physiologic basis for relief from dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the case of a 46-year-old man with large recurrent pleural effusion with absent perfusion to the affected lung who experienced dramatic dyspnea relief after large-volume thoracentesis. This patient's improvement in breathlessness cannot be attributed to improved gas exchange and suggests the primary physiologic basis for the relief in dyspnea is a change in respiratory system mechanics or work of breathing.

Patients with dyspnea because of underlying malignancy (eg, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, atelectasis because of large pulmonary mass, malignant pleural effusion) may benefit from cancer-directed treatment if consistent with their wishes, prognosis, and overall health status (good practice statement). Patients with underlying comorbidities such as COPD or heart failure should have the management of these conditions optimized (good practice statement).

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^206b55fd]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain having a severe effect on the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions. Common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstay of treatment but represent very different treatment strategies: talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by other factors, such as the patient's clinical characteristics, individual treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care. We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from the major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment. We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients. There are barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefits from their interventions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: mesothelioma: pleural, version 1.2024 [^ca9fa41f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Pleural mesothelioma (PM) initial management — treatment selection by stage, performance status (PS), and operability is as follows: Surgical resection is recommended for certain patients with clinical stage I to IIIA PM who are medically operable and can tolerate the surgery. Systemic therapy alone is recommended for patients with PS 0 to 2 and medically inoperable PM, and definitive RT alone is not recommended in any setting for patients with PM. Observation for progression may be considered for patients with PS 0 to 2 who are not eligible for surgery and are asymptomatic with minimal burden of disease if systemic therapy is planned and when progression occurs. Best supportive care is recommended for patients with PS 3 to 4. Pleural effusion can be managed using thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis or placement of a drainage catheter, and therapeutic/palliative thoracentesis can be used to remove pleural fluid and thus decrease dyspnea either before treatment or for patients who are not candidates for more aggressive treatment.

### To drain or not to drain: an evidence-based approach to palliative procedures for the management of malignant pleural effusions [^84e5e0ea]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and diagnosed late in the course of cancer. The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and to palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients who may have limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits. We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform decision making of patients and families in collaboration with their health care practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions.

Technitium-99m sulfur bone marrow scan in anteroposterior orientation demonstrates diffuse moderate uptake in both lungs, marked uptake in the liver, and diffuse bone marrow expansion.

A course of palliative radiation therapy was recommended; 100 cGy in 1 fraction was prescribed to the lungs and areas of epidural and paraspinal involvement (Fig 3). During and immediately after the delivery of radiation, the patient did well with no adverse effects. Her hydroxyurea was held prior to treatment and then was restarted after verification that her blood counts were at baseline. Three weeks after treatment, the patient reported that her breathing was better and fluid drainage from her pleural catheter had decreased from 250 to 150 mL per session. Five weeks after treatment, the patient reported that her dyspnea had resolved, her oxygen saturation on room air had improved from 91% to 96%, and she had no further drainage from the catheter. Subsequently, her pleural catheter was removed 8 weeks after radiation therapy.

What Does Optimal Communication Look Like?

Optimal communication involves a clear, written referral from the oncology team to the pleural services/pulmonology team. Referral should encourage two-way communication by including an invitation to contact the referrer if the receiving department has any queries. Proactive collaboration and communication between referring and recipient services is crucial for ensuring that guidelines are followed, and any deviations from the guidelines are appropriate. Subsequent interactions can be via phone, e-mail, or in-person and should focus on addressing treatment issues. The referring clinician must also ensure that the recipient team is adequately trained. Identification of knowledge gaps should prompt clinicians to organize training initiatives that should be led by health care professionals experienced in the treatment of MPE.

The pulmonologist placing the IPC should report the details of the procedure, including the amount of fluid drained, followed by specific recommendations on drainage frequency and volume at home.

Unanswered Questions

Treatments for MPE have seen little evolution for decades. Talc pleurodesis was first described in 1935 and IPCs were released onto the market in 1997. In the coming decade, we hope for progress on several key unanswered research questions, which could be transformative for the management of MPE and patient outcomes.

Unanswered questions:

1. Are there biomarkers that may help predict which treatment a patient will benefit the most from?
2. Are there drugs that may suppress pleural fluid production, thus avoiding interventions on the pleural space?
3. Are there any novel oncologic treatments that might be effective for managing MPE?
4. What are patients' and carers' key priorities concerning future MPE management?

In conclusion, the benefits and drawbacks of various treatment options may result in certain patients deriving greater advantages from one particular treatment than from another. It is possible that some patients are not offered optimal treatment, at times due to a reliance on specific local procedures, personal preferences of clinicians, lack of awareness, or misconceptions about specific treatment options. One size does not fit all; treatment choice needs to be made on the basis of the suitability, benefits, and risk profile for each particular patient. A detailed consideration of the patient's clinical characteristics at each step of the treatment pathway will help clinicians and patients to identify the optimal treatment. This can be supported by providing patients with balanced information regarding the benefits and risks of all treatment options. Following treatment choice, effective coordination of care between different teams will help maximize the benefits that each person can obtain from their chosen intervention.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^a84cd62f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society — Symptomatic MPE evaluation with large-volume thoracentesis and pleural manometry — Nonexpandable lung occurs in at least 30% of patients with MPEs and may be a contraindication for pleurodesis; recent data also suggest that up to 60% of patients will require another procedure within 9 days after initial drainage. Only one study has examined the use of manometry in predicting "longer-term" outcomes: in 55 patients with MPE undergoing temporary pleurodesis, an elastance of less than 19 cm H2O measured after draining 500 mL predicted a 98% chance of success at 1 month, while all 11 patients with an elastance of 19 cm H2O or greater did not achieve pleurodesis. In patients with symptomatic MPE, we suggest large-volume thoracentesis if it is uncertain whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion and/or if the lung is expandable (the latter if pleurodesis is contemplated) to assess lung expansion (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4E and E5C). If the plan is to manage the MPE with an IPC, a large-volume thoracentesis to assess lung expansion, regardless of whether the lung expands and an additional procedure (therapeutic thoracentesis), may not be required.

### Malignant pleural effusion: presentation, diagnosis, and management [^8a2986a4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained; this is typically done via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^9e59e288]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in patients with acute dyspnea — guidance states that we do not have direct evidence about the health outcome effect of false-negative or false-positive testing in POCUS. In patients who are clinically unstable, the use of POCUS should not delay management actions derived from results of other diagnostic tests in the pathway. Because the extent of organs and anatomical sites imaged varied across included studies, with some confined to the lungs and others including more comprehensive assessment of the inferior vena cava, deep veins, and heart, clinicians should focus POCUS on anatomical sites consistent with their diagnostic and treatment uncertainties. The guideline also notes that Table 4 of Supplement 1 provides clinical descriptions of potential consequences according to specific conditions and that it may be more "serious" to miss a diagnosis of pneumonia or pulmonary embolism than to miss a diagnosis of heart failure or pleural effusion.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^16a2b6e9]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Loculated MPE

Loculated MPE involves multiple fluid collections in separate pockets, often requiring a chest tube in each pocket to obtain successful drainage. Loculations can prevent complete drainage of the pleural space and limit lung re-expansion, often contraindicating talc pleurodesis or resulting in insufficient symptomatic relief from IPCs. Loculations and septations may coexist. Up to 14% of patients with MPE develop symptomatic loculations, and septated effusions may progress to loculated forms.

The guidelines differ in terms of loculated MPE treatment recommendations. ATS recommends IPC over talc pleurodesis because IPC may enable further drainage of fluid, alleviation of symptoms, avoidance of admission, and fewer subsequent procedures. The guideline also emphasizes the heterogeneity within the loculated effusion group, such that patients with few loculations may still benefit from talc pleurodesis. Minimally invasive decortication may be considered in patients with a good performance status and low LENT score.

The ERS/EATC and SECT guidelines lack strong recommendations, noting that a nonexpandable lung contraindicates pleurodesis and that IPCs may fail to completely drain the pleural space, limiting symptom improvement. Both guidelines suggest intrapleural fibrinolytics, acknowledging their limited effects on dyspnea or pleurodesis success. The ERS/EATC guideline adds that thoracic surgery may be needed for multiple loculations, particularly near the mediastinum, with limited options for surgically ineligible patients.BTS guidelines provide no specific recommendations for loculated MPE, except for referral to the pleural team.

In our experience, therapeutic thoracentesis can be initially performed in loculated cases, as in nonloculated effusions, to observe the effect on dyspnea and pulmonary expansibility. This procedure can aid in differentiating loculated effusions from atelectasis or consolidation, and facilitates pleural fluid analysis if not previously conducted. An exception to this would be if the decision had been taken to treat the loculated MPE with an IPC, in which case the IPC could be inserted without previous therapeutic thoracentesis.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^e2aaf1f0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — IPCs or chemical pleurodesis can be used for patients with MPE and expandable lung, the specific risks and benefits of each procedure should be discussed in detail with the patient/caregiver, and a decision should be made on an individual basis; factors influencing the specific decision can include the availability of a support network to help with IPC drainage, and the patient's desire to avoid hospitalization. Likewise, small studies have suggested that we may be able to achieve the "best of both worlds" in the future, with approaches combining IPCs with pleurodesis agents. Patient-reported outcome measures should be prioritized over secondary endpoints, such as radiographic improvement, and the role of gene therapy and immunotherapy may significantly alter our approach to these patients.

Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — The search revealed two studies pertinent to the clinical question, both in lung cancer populations. Tremblay and colleagues undertook a retrospective review of 113 patients; of 14 who were asymptomatic or did not require intervention, 13 were followed for a median of 98 days and none required intervention during this period. Porcel and colleagues published a retrospective study of 556 patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer; 40% developed pleural effusion and half were too small for sampling or intervention, and among these 112 (20%) with small/minimal pleural effusions, none required any interventional procedure during follow up (mean ± SD = 10 ± 11 mo). Although these small effusions usually did not go on to become symptomatic, they did confer a survival disadvantage compared with those without a pleural effusion, and limitations included the small number of patients, retrospective design, restriction to lung cancer, and relatively short follow-up.

Adverse Events

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis entail adverse events. A meta-analysis found no significant overall differences in the frequency of adverse events between treatments; however, distinct adverse event profiles exist for each. IPCs pose a higher risk of infection due to prolonged foreign body insertion, with skin or pleural fluid infections occurring in approximately 8% of cases. Although IPC-related infections have attracted attention, they typically respond to treatment without IPC removal. Antibiotics, guided by local sensitivities, can be used to manage infections with case-specific escalation (intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and IPC removal) if the infection worsens. Pleural infections can sometimes result in autopleurodesis. Other minor IPC-related complications include catheter obstruction (approximately 5%) and septa development (< 15%).

Adverse events associated with graded talc pleurodesis include pain, dyspnea, infection, postprocedural fever, tube blockage, and tube displacement. These adverse events occur in < 10% of patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a feared complication due to small talc particles. This complication is avoided by using graded talc.

Both IPCs and talc pleurodesis necessitate close monitoring and management of adverse events to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation… [^e242bc24]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with cardiac disease, a history of symptoms consistent with heart failure should be elicited. A musculoskeletal examination looking for indications of chest wall disease, such as severe kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, or ankylosing spondylitis, can identify restrictive elements causing dyspnea. Diminished chest wall excursion, dullness to percussion, decreased tactile fremitus, egophony, and a pleural friction rub are signs of pleural effusion; pallor of the skin and fingernails can be seen in chronic anemia. Treatment After the underlying cause of dyspnea has been identified, the goals are to initiate appropriate treatment, to optimize recovery, and to improve subjective and measurable symptoms of dyspnea.

Chronic dyspnea is a set of symptoms rather than a specific disease; therefore, appropriate treatments should be directed at the underlying cause. Certain treatments directly addressing symptoms should also be considered. 2). 37, 38 A recent meta-analysis suggests that supplemental oxygen may relieve dyspnea in mildly hypoxic or nonhypoxic patients but that further evidence was needed. 39 A recent study of the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with stable COPD and moderate desaturation, with or without exertion, did not show prolongation in time to death or hospitalization. Nor were there any measurable benefits in quality of life, lung function, or improvements in walking distances.
40. In palliative care settings, oral or nebulized opioids for dyspnea are an option; they should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. In cases of severe lung or heart disease, response to medical intervention for dyspnea can be monitored using the six-minute walk test.

Studies have shown that acupuncture in COPD has some promise in improving sensations of breathlessness. 45 A recent Cochrane review shows inclusive evidence for the effects of active mind-body therapy, such as yoga, tai-chi, and Qigong, as an adjunct to or independent of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD. 46 An ongoing open dialogue with patients considering adding complementary medicine to their conventional treatment plan should occur to ensure patient safety, especially regarding drug-drug interactions, known detriment to ongoing treatment plans, or the effect on the underlying disease process.

### Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea… [^5df0349e]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Immobility, prolonged travel, or malignancy may suggest thromboembolic disease, which can result in progressive pulmonary hypertension. Response to treatments such as afterload reduction, diuretics, or bronchodilators can provide clues to the underlying disease process. Jugular venous distention in a setting of dyspnea suggests congestive heart failure. 16 Accessory muscle use, decreased diaphragmatic excursions, unilateral dullness, hyperresonance, and abnormal breath sounds, including wheezes and crackles, should be noted. The dominant examination finding in patients with bronchiectasis is pulmonary crackles or rales, generally bibasilar. 17 Decreased breath sounds and wheezing support the presence of COPD.
18. Initial Diagnostic Studies Following the history and physical examination, initial testing should include pulse oximetry, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, chest radiography, electrocardiography and, commonly, spirometry.

If the diagnosis remains unclear after these tests, anxiety or hyperventilation, deconditioning, or neuromuscular disease should be considered. 7 An algorithm for evaluating patients with chronic dyspnea is available at https: //www. aafp. org/afp/2005/0415/p1529. html.

CHALLENGING SCENARIOS

Septated MPE

Septated MPE describes the presence of fibrinous strands within the effusion, often due to inflammatory-mediated changes in procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity. Septations are common. In a retrospective analysis of 540 consecutive patients undergoing medical thoracoscopy, septations were observed in 60% of the cases and obstructed two thirds or more of the view in 15% of the cases, correlating with a greater pleural tumor burden and shorter median survival. Septations do not necessarily prevent drainage of the effusion, and usual care can be applied. However, nondraining septated fluids are more challenging owing to a lack of treatment options in this group and require a personalized approach on the basis of the patient's clinical characteristics.

Treatment strategies for symptomatic septated MPE vary among guidelines, reflecting the limited evidence for any single intervention. The ATS guidelines offer no specific recommendations, whereas the ERS guidelines suggest breaking septations during thoracoscopy. The British guidelines propose intrapleural fibrinolytics such as urokinase through an IPC for draining septated MPE if initially flushing the IPC with normal or heparinized saline does not improve drainage. Fibrinolytics may be considered in nondraining cases, reserving surgery for very select patients with significantly septated symptomatic MPE with a favorable prognosis and performance status. In contrast, the Spanish guidelines and ERS/EACTS task force highlight that, although intrapleural fibrinolytics may improve radiological appearance and shorten hospital stay, they have limited effect on dyspnea or pleurodesis success.

### Treatment options for patients with recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to heart failure [^0d2c7cf5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are a common finding in the nearly six million Americans diagnosed with heart failure. This review focuses on the historical, present and potential future trends in the management of such benign pleural effusions.

Recent Findings

The management of symptomatic pleural effusions, in general, and in heart failure, specifically, has evolved in the last two decades. With more options, the treatment is often individualized for patients. Newer forms of therapy are also less invasive, resulting in less procedural morbidity, recuperation and cost.

Summary

The majority of patients with a pleural effusion resulting from heart failure will resolve their symptoms with medical therapy. Patients who experience symptoms from reaccumulation of their effusion have a selection of treatment options that can be individualized based on the patient's prognosis, functional status, need for future intervention and desires.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 57-year-old man presented to the ED with altered mental status and severe shortness of breath. He was found to be in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and required admission to the ICU. He reported the following: a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath; left-sided chest pain; cough productive of brown, foul-smelling sputum; and weight loss. He had an extensive smoking history but had quit 1 year prior. The patient was born in Ethiopia but had been living in the United States for the last 20 years. His last visit to Ethiopia was in 2009, and he denied any other recent travel or exposure to TB. There was no history to suggest immune compromise. He had not seen a physician in many years and never established medical care in the United States.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^81375d44]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Management of malignant pleural effusions (MPE) — epidemiology, symptom burden, and palliative options is summarized as follows: MPE accounts for 22% of all pleural effusions with > 150,000 new cases annually in the United States, and median survival after diagnosis is 4 to 6 months. During the course of disease, 25% of patients with lung cancer and > 90% with mesothelioma develop symptomatic MPE. Although therapeutic thoracentesis provides symptom relief, most MPEs recur within a month and simple thoracentesis should not be the treatment of choice for those with a good performance status (Karnofsky score > 30 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≥ 1); repeated thoracentesis carries risks including pneumothorax and empyema. Dyspnea presents in 21% to 78.6% of patients with advanced lung cancer, and 10% to 63% grade their dyspnea as moderate-severe. Dyspnea attributable to recurrent malignant effusions may be effectively palliated by eradication of the pleural space or minimizing the fluid recumulation into the hemithorax, using strategies such as drainage followed by instillation of a sclerosant or insertion of a semipermanent tunneled pleural catheter, with drainage performed via thoracoscopy or a bedside chest tube and both techniques used as conduits for sclerosant; despite multiple strategies, their efficacy and safety have yet to be compared in a well-designed RCT.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^68a42a58]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^6c3ed969]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Spanish guidelines systematically consider the ECOG performance status in treatment decisions. For patients with severe impairment (ECOG 3–4), IPCs are recommended as a first-line option with or without talc slurry pleurodesis. If IPC placement is not feasible, therapeutic thoracentesis is recommended. For patients with mild to moderate impairment (ECOG 0–2), talc slurry pleurodesis (provided that the lung is expandable) or IPC is recommended as the first-line treatment. If talc slurry pleurodesis fails, IPC is advised instead of repeated pleurodesis. When IPC placement is not feasible, talc poudrage pleurodesis is recommended.

All four guidelines mention that performance status can be helpful in planning treatment. Although Spanish guidelines systematically apply performance status to guide decisions, in other regions it is considered as additional information to assess patient prognosis. Under all four guidelines, if a patient has a very poor performance status and therefore poor prognosis, they will likely not benefit from definitive treatments (chemical pleurodesis, IPC, or surgery) and will be offered best supportive care, including thoracentesis.-

Shared Decision Making

Patient involvement in the decision-making process is crucial to ensure the best treatment option for a particular person. Patients should be provided with clear information in their preferred format (eg, spoken, written, via a translator, website links) about each treatment so that they can make informed choices on the basis of their own preferences, treatment goals, and the risk-benefit profile of the treatments.

Having regular conversations with patients and their caregivers about their treatment thoughts and concerns will help identify and rectify any treatment issues early, enabling patients to obtain maximum benefit from their treatment.

### Abstract… [^999a5217]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Immobility, prolonged travel, or malignancy may suggest thromboembolic disease, which can result in progressive pulmonary hypertension. Response to treatments such as afterload reduction, diuretics, or bronchodilators can provide clues to the underlying disease process. Jugular venous distention in a setting of dyspnea suggests congestive heart failure. 16 Accessory muscle use, decreased diaphragmatic excursions, unilateral dullness, hyperresonance, and abnormal breath sounds, including wheezes and crackles, should be noted. The dominant examination finding in patients with bronchiectasis is pulmonary crackles or rales, generally bibasilar. 17 Decreased breath sounds and wheezing support the presence of COPD.
18. Initial Diagnostic Studies Following the history and physical examination, initial testing should include pulse oximetry, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, chest radiography, electrocardiography and, commonly, spirometry.

If the diagnosis remains unclear after these tests, anxiety or hyperventilation, deconditioning, or neuromuscular disease should be considered. 7 An algorithm for evaluating patients with chronic dyspnea is available at https: //www. aafp. org/afp/2005/0415/p1529. html.

### Critical analysis of the utility of initial pleural aspiration in the diagnosis and management of suspected malignant pleural effusion [^293e2ae3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

One month after lung IMRT the patient was found to have a single brain metastasis in her right temporal lobe for which she had a craniotomy and mass resection followed by WBRT to 30 Gy. She was then started on Taxotere chemotherapy. Nine weeks later, or 14 weeks after her lung IMRT, she was admitted with dry cough, pain in the lower chest, shortness of breath with SpO2 of 96%, tachycardia, and hypotension. She was neutropenic and developed fevers of 38.6°C. She also was found to have a pulmonary embolism associated with right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and was started on anticoagulation, with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. During her admission, her respiratory status worsened and she was transferred to the ICU. CT chest imaging showed diffuse ground glass opacities in the LLL and lingual and small bilateral pleural effusions. She was started on methylprednisolone for suspected RP and subsequently improved. A chest CT obtained 5 days after starting steroid treatment showed significant reduction of ground glass changes consistent with her clinical improvement. After briefly being discharged, she returned to the hospital 2 days later with increased difficulty breathing, cough, and a low fever. She had a chest tube placed for an enlarged left-sided pleural effusion and started broad-spectrum antibiotics. In addition to her effusions, imaging showed basilar consolidative airspace disease on the right and diffusely scattered ground glass opacities, as well as progression of pulmonary metastases. The patient failed to respond to intensive care treatment and ultimately died 5 months from the end of her lung radiation therapy. The ultimate cause of death in this patient was not identified with certainty. Although other conditions, such as status post pembrolizumab application, pneumonia, pleural effusion, disease progression, and pulmonary embolism, might have also played a role, RP was thought to be the likely major cause of the patient's symptoms.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^732541ea]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for POCUS in acute dyspnea — applicability, exclusions, device scope, training, and diagnostic uncertainty: The included studies enrolled adult patients presenting in EDs and inpatient settings with dyspnea as a primary symptom (unspecified acute dyspnea) and who were later confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest (congestive heart failure [including pulmonary edema], pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax). The systematic review excluded studies that included patients with other medical conditions that can cause dyspnea (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute coronary symptoms, and trauma) if the patients were not also confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest. This recommendation does not apply to handheld devices; evidence from 1 high risk of bias study is very uncertain (insufficient) about the effect of handheld POCUS devices in addition to the standard pathway on health, diagnostic, and treatment outcomes. Clinicians who use POCUS should be trained in the use and interpretation of findings and ongoing care quality assessment. As with any diagnostic test, this recommendation applies to clinical scenarios where there is diagnostic uncertainty, and clinicians should understand and consider that the test accuracy of POCUS varies according to the likelihood of underlying diseases. Figure 2 shows that, using the prevalence estimates of various conditions reported in the studies, the rate of false-positive test results for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism may be higher than what many clinicians and patients are comfortable with, and clinicians can also review Figure 2 and consider that the severity of consequences of false-negative or false-positive test results may differ according to disease.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — talc poudrage versus talc slurry pleurodesis shows similar effectiveness across trials and supports a conditional recommendation for either approach. The largest randomized trial "compared surgical thoracoscopic talc poudrage to talc slurry pleurodesis in 482 patients, assessing only those with greater than 90% expansion of the lung on chest radiograph", with "No difference… at 1 month (78% for poudrage vs. 72% for slurry)", and other randomized studies included "57 patients" and "60 patients", the latter showing higher immediate expansion "(> 90% on CT)… but no difference in any other outcome over 6 months". Pooled findings reported mortality in randomized trials "RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.33–1.12" and in observational studies "RR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.06–0.80" favoring poudrage; no significant differences were seen for respiratory failure "RR = 1.74, 95% CI = 0.81–3.74" or treatment failure in randomized trials "RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.31–3.31" and observational studies "RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.51–1.06". Complications were similar except increased pneumothorax with slurry "RR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.02–4.64". A post hoc subgroup in the largest study favored poudrage "82% vs. 67% pleurodesis success at 1 mo in those alive to be assessed; P = 0.022". "There were no extractable data for important outcomes, such as breathlessness and time in hospital". A network meta-analysis "included 62 randomized studies… " and "both talc poudrage and slurry were ranked highly, but one method was not significantly better than the other". Recommendation: "In patients with symptomatic MPE and expandable lung undergoing talc pleurodesis, we suggest use of either talc poudrage or talc slurry (conditional recommendation, low confidence in estimate of effects)", and "the panel could not recommend one approach over the other".

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS / STS / STR clinical practice guideline [^29d863ef]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This Guideline, a collaborative effort from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide contemporary management of patients with a malignant pleural effusion (MPE).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel developed seven questions using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes) format. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach and the Evidence to Decision framework was applied to each question. Recommendations were formulated, discussed, and approved by the entire panel.

Results

The panel made weak recommendations in favor of: 1) using ultrasound to guide pleural interventions; 2) not performing pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with MPE; 3) using either an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE and suspected expandable lung; 4) performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion; 5) using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for chemical pleurodesis; 6) using IPC instead of chemical pleurodesis in patients with nonexpandable lung or failed pleurodesis; and 7) treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics and not removing the catheter.

Conclusions

These recommendations, based on the best available evidence, can guide management of patients with MPE and improve patient outcomes.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^cfabe9a3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular function

Small or moderate effusions, and their drainage, generally do not cause major hemodynamic changes. Even in mechanically ventilated patients fluid evacuation does not significantly alter blood pressure, cardiac output (CO) or catecholamine dose requirements. Detailed description of the effects of pleural effusion on cardiovascular function is beyond the scope of this article.

Large effusions do not usually reduce CO at rest but can limit its rise during exercise. When saline up to 40 ml/kg was infused into both hemithoraces of dogs, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure increased in proportion to the pleural fluid added. The CO did not change until a larger volume (40–80 ml/kg) was instilled when the CO dropped significantly and caused death in many animals. The hemodynamic changes of large bilateral effusions in dogs mimic those of pericardial tamponade: elevated intrapericardial pressure, impaired cardiac filling and stroke volume and right ventricular diastolic collapse. Ventricular diastolic collapse can also be seen with large, unilateral effusions and resolves quickly postthoracentesis.

Exercise

Breathlessness in patients with pleural effusions is most prominent during exertion. Only two studies have examined the effect of pleural effusion and thoracentesis on exercise capacity. Both studies showed impairment of baseline exercise capacity in patients with effusions and benefits from thoracentesis.

One study (n = 25) employed the 6MWT and found an average baseline distance of 432 ± 78 m (73% predicted). The other (n = 15) used incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test which revealed a mean maximum oxygen consumption per minute (VO 2max) of only 37% of the predicted values.

The 6MWT distance improved by 15% (63 m) after thoracentesis (1.56 ± 0.70 l). This improvement correlated with increases in ventilatory capacity, but neither correlated with the volume of fluid removed. Breathlessness improved significantly at rest (Borg scores from 2.7 to 1.5) and after exercise (from 5.1 to 2.4), even though oxygenation did not improve.

In the study using cardiopulmonary exercise test, improvements in exercise tolerance, maximum workload and VO 2max following therapeutic thoracentesis (mean 1.6 l removed) were variable. Change in VO 2max postthoracentesis correlated with changes in FEV 1 (r = 0.58), forced vital capacity (r = 0.61) and maximum O 2 pulse (r = 0.78). Again, no correlation with the amount of fluid removed was found.

### American Thoracic Society issues consensus statement… [^24cc3841]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The statement points out that the physiologic bases for the treatment of dyspnea lie in the discussion of the mechanisms underlying shortness of breath. The ATS categorizes treatments for dyspnea as related to pathophysiologic mechanisms rather than specific diseases. These categories of mechnisms are listed in the table. The ATS acknowledges that questions remain, and research is needed in this area but believes that an approach to treatment that links mechanisms and treatments will help minimize the impact of dyspnea on the patient. REDUCE VENTILATORY DEMAND Exercise Training. Exertional dyspnea decreases and exercise tolerance improves in response to exercise training in patients with COPD, even in patients with advanced disease. Studies have established that for patients with COPD who remain breathless despite optimal pharmacologic therapy, exercise training can provide significant symptomatic benefits. Fans.

The movement of cool air with a fan has been noted to reduce dyspnea in pulmonary patients. Altered Breathing Patterns. Breathing retraining including diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip breathing has been advocated to relieve dyspnea in COPD patients. The effectiveness of this method is highly variable. REDUCE VENTILATORY IMPEDANCE Continuous Positive Airway Pressure. Continuous positive airway pressure has been demonstrated in some studies to relieve dyspnea during asthma attacks, when patients are being weaned from ventilators and during exercise sessions for patients with advanced COPD. Positioning. Body positions that increase abdominal pressure may improve overall inspiratory muscle strength and the function of the respiratory muscles. Steroids. Use of steroids in pulmonary patients helps reduce inflammation and increases vital lung capacity in interstitial lung disease.

The use of steroids for the purpose of reducing dyspnea must be weighed against the adverse effects of steroids on muscles. ALTERED CENTRAL PERCEPTION Cognitive-Behavioral Approaches. In patients with pain syndromes, distraction, relaxation and education about the symptom have been shown to modify the intensity of the symptom, increase tolerance and decrease distress. Relaxation training may improve symptoms in the short term. Monitoring symptoms helps patients and physicians understand the patterns of symptom intensity. Other treatments reviewed in the statement include oxygen therapy, supplemental oxygen during exercise, vibration, ventilator settings, surgical volume reduction, desensitization, inspiratory muscle training and education.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^3abfdb3d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Appendix table — Outcome ratings for the appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings identify critical and important outcomes. Critical outcomes include false-positive results for suspected pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism; false-negative results for suspected congestive heart failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism; in-hospital mortality; time to treatment; and time to diagnosis. Important outcomes include correctness of diagnosis; hospital admission/readmission; hospital length of stay; false-positive results for suspected congestive heart failure; false-negative and false-positive results for suspected pleural effusion; intensive care unit admission; need to use breathing support; proportion of patients to receive lung computed tomography; quality of life; time to referral; and unnecessary use of antibiotics.

Recommendation 4.
8. Literature review and analysis. 20-48Based on three RCTs and 115 patients, 32, 43, 46airflow interventions such as fans improved breathlessness compared with usual care or sham control, with moderate strength of evidence. Interventions that were associated with improvements in breathlessness with low strength of evidence were bilevel ventilation, acupressure or reflexology, and multicomponent interventions that combined behavioral or psychoeducational interventions, activity or rehabilitation, and integrative medicine interventions. 11, 12), the only intervention associated with improvement was activity or rehabilitation, which improved exercise capacity with low strength of evidence. Clinical interpretation.

107-109A hand-held, battery-operated fan is portable, inexpensive, and can be used at any time. 110A tabletop fan directed at the face may suffice if the patient cannot hold the device. In addition, medical air delivered by nasal cannula was also found to be beneficial. 2is > 88%. 113 20, 22, 40, 114, 115Although we do not recommend routine use of standard supplemental oxygen in nonhypoxemic patients with dyspnea, a time-limited trial of low-flow oxygen or air may still be reasonable for select patients, given the low risk of this intervention; however, fan therapy should be considered first. See Table 2 for a suggested approach to initiating standard supplemental oxygen. 120However, given these self-administered strategies are relatively simple, inexpensive, low risk, and have some preliminary supportive evidence, patients with dyspnea may be counseled on adopting these interventions.

121A Cochrane systematic review reported that exercise capacity improved with breathing exercises; however, their effects on dyspnea were inconsistent. 120Various postures such as relaxed sitting, high-side lying, and standing against a wall have been proposed to improve breathing dynamics. 122 36, 123Many programs promote optimizing physical function through exercise training 124and activity pacing; others incorporate mindfulness techniques such as guided imagery and meditation. These programs are often led by nurses and/or physical or occupational or respiratory therapists. Although the evidence is mixed regarding these programs, the panel considered these minimal-risk strategies to have potential benefits and a trial may be considered.
