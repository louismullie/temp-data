## Question

What is a mahurkar

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a Mahurkar catheter is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the device and clarifying whether Mahurkar refers to a brand, a specific model, or a generic catheter type. Then, I should verify its technical specifications and common variants. Next, I will examine the clinical indications and typical insertion sites. After that, I need to check known complications, including mechanical, infectious, and thrombotic issues, and consider device recalls. Finally, I should review guideline-based best practices for placement, maintenance, and dysfunction management to synthesize a concise, grounded answer.

> Let me first confirm the definition and terminology so I don't conflate brand with function. Mahurkar (often "Quinton-Mahurkar") is a trade name for a dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter designed for acute, short-term vascular access during renal replacement therapy, with Mahurkar MAXID as a specific variant and the generic category being a non-tunneled, acute dialysis catheter, which aligns with descriptions in infection-prevention and dialysis-access literature and with device nomenclature in regulatory databases [^1164Mo5M] [^114JiDeJ] [^116gTMWY] [^1113TetX].

> Wait, let me verify the key technical specifications across common models. Multiple sources consistently describe Mahurkar acute catheters as dual-lumen devices around 11.5–13.5 French with lengths commonly 13–24 cm depending on insertion site and patient size, with "MAXID" denoting larger-bore configurations; one trauma report even repurposed a modified Mahurkar MAXID as a bifurcated shunt, underscoring its large-caliber, high-flow capability and material flexibility in emergencies [^114JiDeJ] [^115bKMyT] [^111U7Gfd] [^113kqUkT].

> I should confirm the clinical purpose and context of use before proceeding. These are temporary catheters intended for immediate initiation of intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, frequently used when a fistula or graft is unavailable or immature, and often employed in critical care settings for acute kidney injury; contemporary practice also includes high-dose extracorporeal therapies such as hemodiafiltration for myeloma cast nephropathy, where a Mahurkar provided vascular access for serial sessions [^114JiDeJ] [^11532wuX] [^115bKMyT].

> Hold on, I should verify the typical insertion sites and confirm the tip-positioning recommendations. Preferred placement is the right internal jugular vein to minimize recirculation and kinking, with femoral veins as alternatives; for jugular approaches, guidelines favor tip position at the cavoatrial junction, while for femoral catheters, the tip should sit in the inferior vena cava, and image guidance (ultrasound with chest radiograph or fluoroscopy) is advised to verify placement and avoid malposition complications [^115EhBRY] [^1118zYvV] [^116QQ9EC].

> Let me consider the materials and design features because these influence function and compatibility. These catheters are typically polyurethane and may incorporate side holes and staggered or split-tip designs to optimize laminar flow and reduce recirculation; although newer designs include heparin or antimicrobial coatings, many Mahurkar acute models are uncoated and non-tunneled, necessitating meticulous aseptic technique and infection-prevention protocols during use [^1164Mo5M] [^117VZLUX] [^114szUvR].

> I will now examine complications so I don't overlook important risks. Infectious complications include catheter-related bloodstream infection with reported rates around 6–14 per 1000 catheter-days for temporary catheters and higher with femoral sites and non-tunneled devices; thrombotic complications include catheter-related thrombosis and fibrin sheath formation that can cause poor flow; mechanical issues include malposition and recirculation, with a notable case where an anomalously draining pulmonary vein produced arterialized blood gases and prompted definitive imaging to confirm venous but ectopic placement; finally, I should confirm recall history: a Class I FDA recall occurred for Mahurkar Acute Dual Lumen High Flow catheters due to a hub defect with potential for mixing of arterial and venous blood, recirculation, and clotting, highlighting the need for vigilance during use [^111BDe7m] [^115NCdQX] [^114JiDeJ] [^116gTMWY].

> Next, I should review guideline-based best practices to ensure my summary aligns with standards. Insertion should use real-time ultrasound, with tip confirmation by chest radiograph or fluoroscopy when appropriate; subclavian veins are generally discouraged for dialysis catheters due to stenosis risk; catheters should be reserved for dialysis use only to reduce manipulation; maintenance includes strict aseptic access and regular assessment of exit site and function; and for dysfunction, first-line therapy is thrombolytic lock, escalating to catheter exchange if needed; for infection, systemic antibiotics are indicated, with catheter exchange favored in S. aureus bacteremia or persistent infection; finally, to reduce infection risk, antimicrobial locking solutions are recommended in adults [^115EhBRY] [^116QQ9EC] [^112LakCx] [^114QwtkM] [^115jXLok].

> Let me synthesize a precise, clinically oriented definition so nothing critical is missed. A Mahurkar catheter is a temporary, non-tunneled, dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter typically 11.5–13.5 French and 13–24 cm in length, made of polyurethane, designed for short-term extracorporeal blood access in acute kidney injury or urgent dialysis, commonly placed in the right internal jugular or femoral veins with image guidance to achieve cavoatrial positioning, and associated with risks of infection, thrombosis, and mechanical malposition; a Class I recall underscores rare but serious hub defects, and guideline-directed insertion, maintenance, and dysfunction management are essential to safe use [^114JiDeJ] [^115bKMyT] [^111U7Gfd] [^115EhBRY] [^1118zYvV] [^116gTMWY] [^112LakCx].

---

A Mahurkar catheter is a **dual-lumen, non-tunneled central venous catheter** designed for acute hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). It provides **immediate vascular access** with high blood flow rates (typically 300–400 mL/min) and is intended for short-term use (≤ 3 weeks). Common insertion sites include the internal jugular, femoral, or subclavian veins, with the right internal jugular preferred to minimize complications [^1118zYvV]. Mahurkar catheters carry risks of infection, thrombosis, and mechanical complications; strict aseptic technique, ultrasound guidance, and regular monitoring are essential to reduce these risks [^1118zYvV] [^111zm6EK].

---

## Design and structure

Mahurkar catheters are **dual-lumen catheters** made of biocompatible materials such as polyurethane, designed to withstand high pressures and provide reliable blood flow during dialysis sessions. The dual-lumen design allows simultaneous withdrawal and return of blood, minimizing recirculation and maximizing dialysis efficiency. Available in various lengths and diameters, they are selected based on patient anatomy and clinical needs.

---

## Clinical indications

Mahurkar catheters are **indicated for short-term vascular access** in acute settings, including:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Immediate dialysis access in critically ill patients [^115692HG].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Temporary access while permanent access (AVF or AVG) matures.
- **Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)**: Used in ICU settings for hemodynamically unstable patients [^114JiDeJ].

---

## Insertion sites and techniques

Mahurkar catheters can be inserted into several central veins, with the right internal jugular vein preferred due to its direct path to the superior vena cava and right atrium, which minimizes the risk of malposition and maximizes blood flow [^1118zYvV]. Alternative sites include the femoral and subclavian veins, though subclavian access is generally avoided due to higher risks of stenosis and thrombosis. Ultrasound guidance is **strongly recommended** during insertion to reduce complications such as arterial puncture, hematoma, and malposition [^115EhBRY] [^111zm6EK].

---

## Advantages of Mahurkar catheters

Mahurkar catheters offer several **clinical advantages**:

- **Immediate use**: No maturation time required, providing immediate vascular access [^1176774P].
- **High blood flow**: Capable of delivering blood flow rates of 300–400 mL/min, ensuring efficient dialysis [^114Dddfr].
- **Versatility**: Suitable for both hemodialysis and CRRT, accommodating various clinical scenarios [^111NxiUp] [^11532wuX].
- **Ease of insertion**: Relatively straightforward insertion process, often performed at the bedside under local anesthesia [^111BDe7m].

---

## Complications associated with Mahurkar catheters

Despite their advantages, Mahurkar catheters are associated with **significant complications**, including:

- **Infection**: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are common, with reported rates ranging from 6.91 to 13.58 per 1,000 catheter days [^111BDe7m] [^115NCdQX].
- **Thrombosis**: Catheter-related thrombosis can occur, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism and long-term venous stenosis [^1119i7oT].
- **Mechanical complications**: Malposition, kinking, and catheter dislodgement are reported, potentially compromising dialysis efficiency [^114JiDeJ].
- **Bleeding and hematoma**: Particularly associated with femoral and subclavian insertions.

---

## Clinical guidelines and best practices

To minimize complications, several **clinical guidelines and best practices** are recommended:

- **Aseptic technique**: Strict adherence to aseptic technique during insertion and maintenance [^116KAjwA].
- **Ultrasound guidance**: Routine use of ultrasound during insertion to reduce complications [^111zm6EK].
- **Regular monitoring**: Frequent assessment of catheter function, exit site, and signs of infection [^115EhBRY].
- **Antimicrobial lock solutions**: Use of antimicrobial lock solutions to reduce infection risk [^112LakCx].
- **Prompt removal**: Catheters should be removed as soon as they are no longer clinically indicated [^115692HG].

---

## Comparison with other dialysis catheters

Mahurkar catheters are **non-tunneled, temporary devices** intended for short-term use, whereas tunneled cuffed catheters are designed for longer-term access with lower infection rates but require surgical insertion. Non-tunneled catheters like the Mahurkar are preferred for acute settings due to their ease of insertion and immediate usability, despite higher infection rates compared to tunneled catheters [^1118zYvV] [^1115uS68].

---

## Recent advancements and modifications

Recent advancements include the development of **antimicrobial-coated catheters** and improved catheter materials designed to reduce infection and thrombosis rates. However, evidence supporting these modifications remains limited, and further research is needed to validate their clinical effectiveness [^117VZLUX].

---

Mahurkar catheters are **dual-lumen, non-tunneled central venous catheters** used for short-term hemodialysis and CRRT. They provide immediate vascular access with high blood flow rates but carry risks of infection, thrombosis, and mechanical complications. Adherence to clinical guidelines, including aseptic technique, ultrasound guidance, and regular monitoring, is essential to minimize these risks and ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Hemodialysis catheter insertion: is increased PO2 a sign of arterial cannulation? A case report [^115oWvjE]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasound-guided Central Venous Catheterization (CVC) for temporary vascular access, preferably using the right internal jugular vein, is widely accepted by nephrologists. However CVC is associated with numerous potential complications, including death. We describe the finding of a rare left-sided partial anomalous pulmonary vein connection during central venous catheterization for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Case Presentation

Ultrasound-guided cannulation of a large bore temporary dual-lumen Quinton-Mahurkar catheter into the left internal jugular vein was performed for CRRT initiation in a 66 year old African-American with sepsis-related oliguric acute kidney injury. The post-procedure chest X-ray suggested inadvertent left carotid artery cannulation. Blood gases obtained from the catheter showed high partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 140 mmHg and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 22 mmHg, suggestive of arterial cannulation. However, the pressure-transduced wave forms appeared venous and Computed Tomography Angiography located the catheter in the left internal jugular vein, but demonstrated that the tip of the catheter was lying over a left pulmonary vein which was abnormally draining into the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein rather than into the left atrium.

Conclusion

Although several mechanical complications of dialysis catheters have been described, ours is one of the few cases of malposition into an anomalous pulmonary vein, and highlights a sequential approach to properly identify the catheter location in this uncommon clinical scenario.

Case presentation

A 66 year old man with underlying chronic kidney disease, presumed secondary to hypertension, presented to the emergency room with one-week history of weakness, fatigue and poor oral intake. The patient was hypotensive (systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg) and had severe azotemia (serum creatinine of 4.9 mg/dl form baseline of 1.7 mg/dl). Septic shock, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and oliguric acute kidney injury were diagnosed. The patient was adequately resuscitated with intravenous fluids, vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, later narrowed to cefazolin. The source of infection was unclear after broad investigation of body fluids and imaging studies. Despite an initial transient clinical improvement, the patient remained in shock with high vasopressor requirements, became anuric and developed acute mental status changes. As a consequence, the decision to start the patient on CRRT was made. We inserted a 13.5 French diameter temporary dual-lumen Quinton-Mahurkar catheter (Covidien, Inc.) into the left IJV under US guidance. Although the right IJ is preferred, the intensive care unit team had already inserted a triple-lumen central venous catheter in this site for hemodynamic monitoring and fluid and medication administration. The initial puncture with an 18-gauge needle into the left IJV using real-time US guidance was successful with non-pulsatile back-flow and venous (dark red) blood appearance. Subsequently, after removal of the ultrasound transducer, the rest of the procedure was performed without any resistance to advancing the guidewire and catheter by the Seldinger technique. Good flow of dark red blood was obtained from both catheter lumens. However, the routine post-cannulation chest X-ray (Figure 1) showed that the tip of the catheter was not crossing the midline to the right side and the tip appeared to be lying over the aortic arch suggesting inadvertent carotid artery cannulation. We then obtained blood gas analysis from the catheter which showed: pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) of 140 mmHg and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) of 22 mmHg, also suggestive of arterial cannulation. The vascular surgery team was emergently consulted. A pressure transducer was attached to the catheter and showed venous wave forms. To definitively determine the location of the catheter, a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of the head and neck was obtained. The CTA showed the Quinton-Mahurkar catheter extending into the left IJV and subsequently descending to terminate in an anomalous left upper lobe pulmonary vein, just inferior to its anomalous insertion in the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein (Figures 2 A and B). Interestingly, manipulation of the catheter under fluoroscopy by interventional radiology showed that the left brachiocephalic (innominate) vein failed to cross the midline to empty into the right atrium, confirming the venous anomaly. The catheter was therefore removed and a new similar catheter was placed in the right IJV. CRRT was then initiated and continued uneventfully until the patient's critical condition improved.

### Temporary femoral artery bifurcation shunting following penetrating trauma [^113kqUkT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Penetrating common femoral artery injuries are life-threatening, especially when the femoral bifurcation has been destroyed. In the presence of other associated injuries which preclude immediate definitive vascular reconstruction, temporary arterial shunting may be useful. Presently available shunts, however, are tubular and allow for distal perfusion to only one vessel. We have utilized a modified bifurcated hemodialysis catheter (Mahurkar MAXID; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass) to successfully provide simultaneous perfusion from the proximal common femoral artery to both the superficial and deep femoral vessels. Such catheters are readily available in most institutions, can be quickly modified, and are easy use in urgent trauma situations.

### Sodium bicarbonate catheter lock solution reduces hemodialysis catheter loss due to catheter-related thrombosis and blood stream infection: an open-label clinical trial [^1164Mo5M]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CVCs used in the study varied according to the patient's needs and consisted of either Mahurkar acute dual lumen catheters, made of polyurethane, or Palindrome chronic catheters, made of urethane. The exposure of polyurethane and urethane catheters to NaHCO3 is considered extremely safe based on the chemical compatibility data and regular clinical use.

Mahurkar catheters were not tunneled and Palindrome catheters were tunneled beneath the skin. All CVCs were inserted by an expert operator under strict aseptic protocol. Catheter care was performed by trained dialysis staff according to our hospital's Administrative Policy and Procedure Manual. At the end of dialysis, all catheters were flushed and locked with one of the two solutions. SBCLS contained 7.5 or 8.4% NaHCO3 at a pH of 7.0–8.5 and was used to lock SBCLS group catheters. An 8.4% SBCLS was used primarily, except for 1 week when our hospital had a shortage of 8.4% SBCLS. During that single week we used 7.5% SBCLS to lock SBCLS group catheters. The NSCLS contained 0.9% sodium chloride at a pH of 4.5–7.0 and was used to lock NSCLS group catheters. All solutions used were sterile nonpyrogenic solutions. Dialysis was performed only on Fresenius model 4008K2 dialysis machines using Advanced Fresenius Polysulfone Optiflux F180NR dialyzers (Fresenius, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany).

### Lancisi's sign and central venous catheter tip position: a case report [^111U7Gfd]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Valvular disease and pulmonary hypertension are common conditions in haemodialysis patients. In presence of tricuspid regurgitation, an increased retrograde blood flow into the right atrium during ventricle systole results in a typical modification of the normal venous waveform, creating a giant c-v wave. This condition clinically appears as a venous palpable pulsation within the internal jugular vein, also known as Lancisi's sign.

Case Report

An 83-year-old woman underwent haemodialysis for 9 years. After arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, a right internal jugular vein non-tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC) was placed. About one month later, the patient was referred to our facility for the placement of a tunnelled CVC. Neck examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pulse, the Lancisi's sign. Surprisingly, chest x-ray posteroanterior view showed the non-tunnelled catheter tip in correspondence with the right ventricle. She underwent surgery for temporary to tunnelled CVC conversion using the same venous insertion site (Bellcath®10Fr-length 25 cm to Mahurkar®13.5Fr-length 19 cm). In the postoperative period, we observed a significant reduction of the jugular venous pulse.

Discussion

The inappropriate placement of a 25-cm temporary CVC in the right internal jugular vein worsened the tricuspid valve regurgitation, which became evident by the Lancisi's sign. Removal of the temporary CVC from the right ventricle resulted in improved right cardiac function. Safe approaches recommended by guidelines for the CVC insertion technique and for checking the tip position should be applied in order to avoid complications.

### Central venous catheter-related infection in severe trauma patients [^117SER7e]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

We reviewed the patients' general information from their medical charts, including sex, age, ISS, length of ICU stay, duration of catheter insertion, catheter insertion sites, catheter types, reasons for catheter removal, CVC-related infection, and related microorganism. Catheter types were classified as single-lumen, double-lumen, and triple-lumen catheters according to the number of lumens. Single-lumen catheters included the ARROW ® CVC (Arrow, Reading, PA, USA) and the IntroFlex™ (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA); double-lumen catheters included the ARROW ® CVC, the ARROW ® MAC, and the MAHURKAR™ (11.5-Fr dual-lumen catheters for acute dialysis; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA); and the triple-lumen catheters were the ARROW ® CVCs. CVC-related infections were divided into catheter-related local infections (CRLI) and bloodstream infections (CRBSI). We defined CRLI as local signs of infection at the insertion site, including erythema, local pain, inflammation, or purulent discharge, with microorganism colonization of the catheter tip. CRBSI was defined as the presence of signs of systemic infection with positive culture results from the peripheral venous blood and catheter tip. We diagnosed CRBSI based on the presence of > 15 colony-forming units in the catheter tip culture and after excluding other non-catheter sources of infection.

SPSS software (version 21.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used for all statistical analyses. Poisson regression distribution with general log-linear analysis was used to compare the infection rates and determine the risk of infection according to the catheter insertion sites. Variables were reported as median (range) or number (percentage), and the χ 2, Fisher's exact, or Mann–Whitney U test was used, as appropriate. To identify the variables confounding the risk factors for catheter-related infection, univariate analysis was used to compare the groups with and without infection. Multivariate modeling was performed using conditional logistic regression with a backward stepwise elimination procedure, and variables were selected for inclusion in the model based on the results of the univariate analysis (P value < 0.1). For all other tests, a P value of < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

### Continuous on-line glucose measurement by microdialysis in a central vein. A pilot study [^1158qvgp]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Continuous microdialysis proceeded for 20 hours in all patients included in the study. The patients had major upper abdominal surgery; pancreas resection (n = 3), liver resection (n = 6) or gastric resection (n = 1). Ten patients were studied per protocol, eight females and two men, mean age 59.7 yrs (range 27 to 81). Six patients received a BD Careflow ™ and four a Mahurkar ™ central vein catheter. All patients, at some point during the study, received noradrenalin and five of the patients received insulin. No adverse events were observed that were associated with the central vein catheter or with the microdialysis membrane. The mean distance between the tips of the two catheters was 59mm (range 39 to 82 mm), with the microdialysis catheter as the most proximal. X-ray images were used for documentation of the individual placement.

The time plots of comparisons between all the microdialysis recordings and the hourly blood measurements of all the individual patients can be found in the Additional files. Online microdialysis measurements were presented every minute but only the results from the same time as the hourly blood samples are used for further comparison. A total of 195 individual values were collected and analyzed. The recorded glucose values ranged from 4.2 to 17.1 mmol/l.

Mean microdialysis-glucose using a single calibration (MD1) was 9.6 ± 2.5mmol/l (SD) and eight-hour calibration (MD8) 9.8 ± 2.4 mmol/l (SD). Both calibration methods showed close agreement between the continuous reading and the reference plasma glucose valuesin 8 of the 10 patients(see Additional file 1). MD1 calibration showed a mean absolute glucose difference of 0.85 ± 0.82 mmol/l (SD) or 8.8 ± 8.4% (SD) and MD8 calibration 0.61 ± 0.76 mmol/l (SD), or 6.8 ± 9.3% to the reference plasma value.

### Continuous on-line glucose measurement by microdialysis in a central vein. A pilot study [^112V2UUE]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Patients (n = 10) scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery between October 2009 and December 2010 at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, were enrolled in this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were patients scheduled for surgery involving a central venous access as clinical routine. Exclusion criteria were: 1). Any coagulation abnormality; 2). Planned placement of central vein catheter anywhere else but in the right internal jugular vein; 3). A central vein catheterposition deviating from protocol; 4). No informed consent; 5). Patient under 18 years of age. The study design was reviewed and approved by the regional ethics committee, EPN, in Stockholm. The subjects were informed about the purpose and the nature of the study and the risks involved before giving written informed consent. This study was observational and, consequently, no change in the perioperative care of the patient was made except for the insertion of an extra central vein catheter with the microdialysis membrane. The patients were studied during surgery and at the postoperative ward for a total of 20 hours. None of the patients needed the ICU ward during the study.

Before surgery, the patients received a standard two-lumen central venous catheter and, in addition, a second one-lumen central venous catheter with a microdialysis membrane. Both were placed in the right jugular vein. As a clinical routine, an intravenous glucose infusion was given (25 mg/kg/h; 5% solution) during the whole study period through the distal lumen of the standard central venous catheter. The tip of the central venous catheter with the microdialysis membrane was placed proximal to the glucose infusion lumen to minimize a high false glucose value. A distance more than 3.5 cm between the tips was the target. The catheter placement was documented postoperatively by chest X-ray. The microdialysis catheter had a dialysis membrane length of 40 mm and a diameter of 4 Fr (Eirus SLC, Dipylon Medical AB, Solna, Sweden). The standard central venous catheter was either a two-lumen catheter with a length of 15cm and a diameter of 5 Fr (BD Careflow ™, Becton Dickinson Medical Surgical Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), or a three-lumen catheter with a length of 16 cm and a diameter of 12 F (Mahurkar ™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). Patients routinely received insulin when glucose levels were higher than 11mM.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) program initiation in PICU of a resource limited setting: a retrospective analysis of challenges and outcomes [^11532wuX]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

CRRT unit protocol

The CRRT team developed a written protocol in consultation with other members of the PICU. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents or guardians prior to initiating CRRT. Vascular access was established using a double-lumen dialysis catheter (Covidien MAHURKAR™ or medCOMP). Catheters were percutaneously placed under ultrasound guidance, preferably in the internal jugular vein or, alternatively, in the femoral vein. CRRT was performed using either the Fresenius MultiFiltrate or Prismaflex (Baxter) machines. Hemofilter selection was based on the make of the machine and weight of the child: AV Paed or HF20 were used for children weighing < 10 kg, AV 400 S or M60 for those weighing 10–30 kg, and AV 600 S or M100 for those > 30 kg. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) was preferred during the initial years for its simpler setup and ease of management, which suited our early program goals and available expertise. As the team gained experience and with the availability of Prismaflex machine, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) became the preferred modality. Choosing CVVHDF on the Prismaflex machine also allowed flexible transitions to CVVH or continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD), if required. Commercially prepared potassium-free bicarbonate-buffered replacement fluid (MultiBic or Prismasol B0) was used as both dialysate and replacement fluid. Blood flow rates were set between 3 and 10 ml/kg/min, with the CRRT dose maintained at 35–40 ml/kg/hr to compensate for frequent interruptions and circuit downtime during the early phase of the program. This strategy was adapted from similar experiences where the delivered dose was substantially lower than prescribed. Further adjustments were made based on the child's diagnosis and clinical indication for therapy, hemodynamic status, and fluid overload.

### Anti-PF4 / heparin antibodies associated with repeated hemofiltration-filter clotting: a retrospective study [^115TEFZU]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

Between 1 November 2004 and 1 May 2006, 87 patients underwent CVVH. Twenty-eight of these patients experienced repeated (≥ 2) hemofiltration-filter clotting before the scheduled end of the CVVH session (24 to 48 hours) with no obvious cause and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies were assayed. We reviewed the charts of these 28 patients. In accordance with French law, because of the retrospective nature of the study, no written consent was requested. The study was approved by our institutional review board. For each patient, general characteristics, platelet counts at various time points (admission, nadir [lowest reported concentration], day of anti-PF4/heparin antibody assay, and maximal count), and CVVH session duration and efficiency (assessed by the urea reduction ratio before/after each session) were recorded. The duration of CVVH sessions was obtained from the CVVH surveillance sheet, on which nurses routinely recorded data on an hourly basis. For each patient, an objective clinical probability scoring system was used to calculate the likelihood of HIT according to the Four T-score. For this purpose, we attributed 1 point for the third item, 'Thrombosis', considering that the hemofiltration-filter clotting was equivalent to a 'recurrent thrombosis'.

Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration settings

CVVH was performed using the Aquarius system (Aquarius; Edwards Lifesciences, Maurepas, France). Blood flow was set at 250 to 300 mL/minute, ultrafiltrate flow at 35 mL/kg per hour, and substitution solutions (Hemosol ® or Prismasol ®; Hospal, Lyon, France) were delivered 1/3 pre-filter and 2/3 post-filter. A dual-lumen 11.5-French catheter (Mahurkar™; Tyco Healthcare, Wollerau, Switzerland) was inserted into either the femoral or right internal jugular vein. To exclude catheter dysfunction, catheters were changed in all patients at least once before anti-PF4/heparin antibody assay.

### Early veno-venous haemodiafiltration for sepsis-related multiple organ failure [^116x7NSp]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Veno-venous haemodiafiltration

CVVHDF was considered at the end of the observational period if a growing metabolic acidosis was observed, as defined above. Each CVVHDF session was performed using a Prisma pump (Hospal, Lyon, France). For vascular access, a double lumen catheter (Mahurkar, 11.5 Fr; Tyco Healthcare Group, Mansfield, MA, USA) was inserted percutaneously into either the right internal jugular vein or the femoral vein using the Seldinger technique. Blood flow was driven at 150 ml/minute through the polyacrylonitrile haemofilter (AN 69; Hospal). Ultrafiltration was maintained at 2,000 ml/hour. The ultrafiltrate was replaced by bicarbonate-buffered haemofiltration fluid (Hemosol B0; Hospal). Dialysate (bicarbonate 32 mEq/l; Hemosol B0; Hospal) flow rate was maintained at 1,000 ml/hour. The anticoagulant was intravenous heparin, with an initial bolus of 2,000–3,000 IU, followed by 300 IU/kg per day to maintain the patient's activated clotting time at 60–70 s.

Blood glucose checks were performed regularly during the procedure, and both hyperglycaemia (sometimes present in septic patients) and hypoglycaemia (related to the procedure) were immediately corrected.

Each session of CVVHDF lasted 3 days, with the same filter, and was followed by 2 or 3 days without CVVHDF. In five cases, however, early clotting after 12–24 hours required an immediate change in filter in order to follow the 3-day protocol. CVVHDF was then repeated for 3 days if necessary, until renal recovery. During the first session of CVVHDF a strictly neutral fluid balance was maintained, using the digital balance included in the Prisma pump. During the following sessions, a negative fluid balance was instituted if necessary.

Statistical analysis

Statistical calculations were performed using the Statgraphics plus package (Manugistics, Rockville, MD, USA). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or (in figures) as box and whisker plot analyses. Between group comparisons were performed using the χ 2 test with Yates' correction for categorical variables, and with the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare paired variables. Cumulative survival curves were compared using the log rank test. Linear regression analysis was also performed when required.

### A prescription-based model for predicting post-hemodialysis urea and electrolytes: a real-world validation study in acute hemodialysis [^113c6s3C]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Validation cohort

The validation cohort was prospectively conducted in a real-world setting at the Centro Médico ISSEMYM in Ecatepec, Mexico. The study included 30 adult patients admitted to the emergency department with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) who required urgent HD treatment (either their first or second HD) and were at risk for developing DDS or experiencing severe electrolyte derangements. Patients with CKD, a BUN greater than 150 mg/dL, and at least one neurological symptom of uremia were considered at risk of DDS. A pre-HD sodium concentration of < 120 meq/L was considered severe hyponatremia, and a pre-HD potassium concentration of at least 6.5 meq/L was considered severe hyperkalemia.

HD prescriptions, namely, Qb, Qd, Qf, membrane type, T and dialysate concentrations (Cd), were planned and executed using the proposed method to target RRs less than 40% for patients at risk of DDS, sodium correction of less than 6 meq/L for those with severe hyponatremia, and potassium reduction to safe levels for patients with severe hyperkalemia. Blood samples were taken before and after each treatment using the same method used for the development cohort, single pool KtV and equilibrated KtV were calculated using validated formulas. Anthropometric measurements were obtained from medical records. Patients were treated with high-flux polyarylethersulfone and polyvinylpyrrolidone blend membranes (Revaclear 400 or Polyflux 6 H; Vantive US Healthcare), Gambro AK98 HD machines (Vantive US Healthcare) and a temporal 11.5 fr. central venous catheter (Mahurkar TM; Mozarc Medical). HD parameters were monitored during treatment to remain as prescribed. Post-HD values for BUN, sodium, and potassium were obtained.

Prediction model

The proposed method for estimating post-HD values (C2) relies on calculations from pre-HD levels (C1), T, estimated V Eqs. (5 and 6, estimated Kd Eqs. (1–4), and the established logarithmic relationship between Kt/V and the urea RR (Eq. 7). For predicting post-HD values, the method applies the principle that ionic dialysance approximates urea clearance, therefore equilibration ratio, equals RR, which was used to solve Eq. (8).

### Non-tunneled haemodialysis catheter-related blood stream infections and associated factors among first time haemodialysis patients: a prospective study from a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka [^111BDe7m]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Temporary catheters (uncuffed, non-tunneled) can be inserted with relative ease through a bedside procedure under local anesthesia, guided by ultrasound without the need for a fluoroscopic facility. In Sri Lanka it is the preferred vascular access for initiating emergency dialysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Sri Lanka investigating the rate and risk factors of blood stream infections associated with temporary vascular catheters. We identified 16 CRBSIs, with 9 cases occurring in jugular and 7 cases in femoral catheters. The overall incidence rate of CRBSI was 13.58 per 1000 catheter days (jugular 9.4/1000 catheter days and femoral 31.3 per 1000 catheter days). This was higher than that in other studies involving temporary catheters, which ranged from 0.34–11.4 per 1000 catheter days (Table 5). This highlights a significant risk of CRBSI in our population. Factors such as the lack of a dedicated nephrology ward in CSTH, varying patient characteristics, catheter management protocols, and hygiene standards may have contributed to these observations.

### Outcomes of tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters: an experience from a tertiary care center in karachi, Pakistan [^117RzjPu]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCC) are generally used as a temporary means to provide hemodialysis (HD) until permanent arteriovenous access is established. However, certain complications are associated with use of TCCs such as infections, catheter malfunction/malposition or venous stenosis. Limited data is available on outcomes and long term complications associated with TCCs in our country. The aim of this study was to study the outcomes of TCCs and associated long term complications during the course of its usage.

Methods

We retrospectively studied case records of patients who had TCCs placed for HD at our institution, from January 2016 to June 2018.

Results

A total of 116 TCCs were placed during the study period. The mean age of the population was 57.09years; 58.6% were males. The right internal jugular vein (52.6%) was the most common site of TCC insertion followed by the left internal jugular vein (29.3%). Functioning TCCs were successfully removed in almost two-thirds of cases (65.7%) once their permanent access was mature. Development of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was seen in 22 patients (19.8%) requiring catheter removal in 14 (12.6%) patients. Mechanical complications leading to catheter removal were seen in seven patients (6.3%). The median catheter duration was 62.5days ranging from 1 to 343days.

Conclusion

TCCs, though associated with complications particularly CRBSI, are a viable option for short- to intermediate-term use for HD till the maturation of permanent arteriovenous access in a limited-resource setting.

Why were these guidelines developed?

Since the publication of the 2016 guidelines, there have been significant developments in the field of vascular access. These developments include the availability of an increasing variety of vascular access devices, such as midlines and long peripheral cannulas; an increasing emphasis on the concept of long‐term vein health; and changes to the processes, pathways and services affecting vascular access. These guidelines cover these areas and provide wide ranging recommendations that we hope will ensure expert, consistent and standardised care across different healthcare settings and providers. The guidelines also highlight areas of fundamental importance to vascular access safety, such as optimal device choice; insertion technique; positioning and care of vascular access devices; and recommendations that aim to reduce complications and improve safety.

### The current state of interventional nephrology in India [^111qJcCd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Nephrologists in India have embraced providing complete care to their patients and recognize the benefits of coordinated care. This review describes the practice of interventional nephrology in India. Even though the benefits of using tunneled catheters over nontunneled catheters are well recognized, the use of nontunneled catheters is preferred, primarily because of financial constraints and the lack of training facilities. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the most common form of dialysis vascular access, often created by nephrologists. Upper arm AVF and arteriovenous grafts are uncommon. The implementation of surveillance tests and elective endovascular interventions on arteriovenous accesses is limited in India, compared to being a routine practice in the United States. The clinical experience from a center in Southern India is described here to show the current state of procedural nephrology practice in India.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^117VKTaG]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

What strategies may reduce unnecessary catheter use?

Strategies to avoid unnecessary placement of indwelling urinary catheters

Simply put, patients without urinary catheters do not develop CAUTI. Yet, multiple studies show that between 21% and 55.7%of urinary catheters are placed in patients who do not have an appropriate indication and, therefore, may not even need a catheter. Over the past decade, several studies have employed interventions to decrease unnecessary catheter placement (described in the onlinetable). Although educational interventions are a common and important first step to decrease inappropriate catheter use, more effective and potentially more sustainable interventions go a step further by instituting restrictions on catheter placement. Protocols that restrict catheter placement can serve as a constant reminder for providers about the appropriate use of catheters, can suggest alternatives to indwelling catheter use (such as condom catheters or intermittent straight catheterisation), but perhaps most importantly, can generate accountability for placement of each individual urinary catheter. A fairly typical approach for developing a catheter restriction protocol is to begin with a basic list of appropriate catheter uses (such as the list provided in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) guideline); this list (see box 1) can then be tailored to include other indications based on local opinion and specialised patient populations.

Box 1
Indications for indwelling urethral catheter use (from 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline)

A. Examples of appropriate indications for indwelling urethral catheter use
Patient has acute urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction
Need for accurate measurements of urinary output in critically ill patients
Perioperative use for selected surgical procedures: Patients undergoing urologic or other surgery on contiguous structures of genitourinary tract Anticipated prolonged surgery duration; catheters inserted for this reason should be removed in postanesthesia care unit Patients anticipated to receive large-volume infusions or diuretics during surgery Need for intraoperative monitoring of urinary output
To assist in healing of open sacral or perineal wounds in incontinent patients
Patient requires prolonged immobilisation (eg, potentially unstable thoracic or lumbar spine, multiple traumatic injuries such as pelvic fractures)
To improve comfort for end-of-life care if needed

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^113cZvQ5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters was published by Simon L Thomsen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Sepsis and septic shock, Catheter-related thrombosis, Maintenance fluid therapy and Parenteral nutrition. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the trial question was: what is the role of midline catheters in patients receiving intravenous therapy? In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the population was: 304 patients (130 female, 174 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; infection or burns at both upper extremities; existing central venous catheter; informed consent not obtainable. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the interventions were: n = 152 MC (midline catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days) n = 152 PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection (100% vs. 99.3%; ARD 0.7, 95% CI -98.17 to 99.57). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 1.3%; ARD -1.3, 95% CI -4.99 to 2.39) Significant increase in premature catheter removal (13.2% vs. 6.6%; IRR 2.61, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.64) Significant increase in accidental catheter removal (2.6% vs. 0.7%; AD 1.9%, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.76). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in any complications (13.2% vs. 7.2%), minor complications (13.2% vs. 5.3%). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days, MC was not superior to PICC with respect to patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection.

### The epidemiology and microbiology of central venous catheter related bloodstream infections among hemodialysis patients in the Philippines: a retrospective cohort study [^1115uS68]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several factors in our cohort contributed to CRBSI formation in our cohort, including frequent use of dialysis access outside of hemodialysis, extensive non-tunneled catheter usage, and prolonged catheter placement (median duration = 21 days), all of which have been noted in the literature to promote CRBSI formation. Notably, specific catheter characteristics such as left-sided (21.88 episodes per 1000 catheter days), non-tunneled (6.91 episodes per 1000 catheter days), and femoral access (15.04 episodes per 1000 catheter days) correlate with higher infection rates, consistent with existing literature.

The reasons why left-sided catheter placements pose a greater infection risk compared to right-sided catheters are not fully understood, but anatomical and procedural factors are believed to play significant roles. The longer and more tortuous path of a left-sided catheter can increase the risk of blood flow stasis and thrombus formation, which can serve as a nidus for infection. Additionally, the technical challenges associated with inserting a left-sided catheter often lead to more manipulation and adjustments, increasing the risk of pathogen introduction.

On the other hand, non-tunneled catheters lack the protective tunneling under the skin that tunneled catheters have. This absence exposes the catheter directly to skin flora and environmental pathogens during insertion and while in place. Non-tunneled catheters typically have shorter dwell times, contributing to their higher infection rates as they are more frequently replaced, creating repeated opportunities for contamination and infection.

Using the femoral vein as an access site for catheter placement is relatively common in clinical practice, especially in situations where immediate vascular access is required, such as in critically ill patients or those with difficult peripheral venous access. However, this approach is associated with a higher risk of CRBSI than other access sites like the subclavian vein. This is because the femoral region is anatomically closer to the groin, which harbors a higher density of skin flora bacteria. This proximity increases the likelihood of contamination during catheter insertion and maintenance if strict aseptic techniques are not adhered to.

Further laboratory tests were remarkable for 24-h proteinuria of 1,700 mg /day. Serum protein electrophoresis was positive for a monoclonal spike in the beta region. Urine protein electrophoresis detected kappa light chains. Serum free light chains (sFLC) were kappa light chains of 2894.7 mg/L and lambda light chains of 16.4 mg/L with kappa: lambda ratio of 176.5.

On day 8 renal biopsy was carried out (delay in execution of the biopsy was caused by initial alteration of coagulation parameters after immediate discontinuation of apixaban): the immunofluorescence staining showed polyclonal free light chain deposition in the tubular cells. Congo red staining did not detect the presence of amyloid. In the light of strong suspicion of cast nephropathy, the immunofluorescence analysis with the use of pronase enzyme was performed. Pronase digestion of the paraffin tissue by denaturized cell membranes demonstrated the presence of intracytoplasmic monoclonal kappa light chains in the tubular cells (Fig. 1 A). It allowed to confirm the diagnosis of cast nephropathy (CN) which is the most common renal complication of MM (Fig. 1 B). Positron emission tomography (PET) did not show extramedullary sites of MM. Given the age of the patient, COVID-19 pandemic emergency as well as laboratory and renal biopsy results haematologist concluded that bone marrow biopsy was not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of MM. The patient started therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone on day 10. To improve the reduction of free light chains concurrently she received extracorporeal treatment with hemodiafiltration (HDF) using poly ester polymer alloy (PEPA) high-flux filter (Nikkiso FDY 210 GW, surface area 2.1 m 2, cut off 32,600 daltons) (Fig. 2). To enhance sFLC removal by adsorption, two filters were used in series during each 4-h length HDF session. Vascular access was a temporary central jugular venous catheter (16 cm long, diameter 11.5 French, Mahurkar®, Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA). The patient received 11 extracorporeal treatments by means of online HDF. All treatments were well tolerated. Mean blood flow was 260 ± 20 ml/min, while median convective volume was 18 (15–20) L/session. The mean ultrafiltration rate was 330 ± 30 ml/h. Low molecular weight heparin 4000 IU (enoxaparin sodium Inhixa™, Techdow Pharma, Milan, Italy) was started as anticoagulation during dialysis and as prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis every other day. Enoxaparin was administered in a single bolus on starting dialysis in the arterial line before the filter. No clotting of the circuit was observed during all the HDF sessions carried out, also owing to the filter change at the second hour.

KDOQI guideline 21 — catheter dysfunction — considers it reasonable to assess for CVC dysfunction during each hemodialysis (HD) session using the updated definition of CVC dysfunction as failure to maintain the prescribed extracorporeal blood flow required for adequate hemodialysis without lengthening the prescribed HD treatment (Expert Opinion). The rationale notes that cuffed, tunneled, dual-lumen CVCs are an acceptable HD access when an arteriovenous (AV) access is not suitable or available despite high complication rates and mortality risk, and that CVC dysfunction is associated with reduced dialysis adequacy, increased risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and mortality.

### Foley catheter management: a review [^113VqXuN]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

About 100 million urinary catheters are used globally each year. Urinary catheters are effective to establish bladder drainage, but they are associated with risks, including infection and encrustation. To mitigate the associated risks, an understanding of urinary catheter indications, placement and removal techniques, and maintenance is necessary.

Observations

This review describes catheter management and complications. Specifically, catheter indications and alternatives, catheter types, insertion and removal techniques, and catheter maintenance are reviewed. Catheter-associated complications and strategies to minimize risk are described.

Conclusions and Relevance

Using best practices related to catheter management optimizes bladder drainage while minimizing the associated risks, including catheter-associated urinary tract infection, catheter encrustations, bladder spasms, and catheter-associated pain.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^1113TetX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Catheter device classification and terminology — Catheter devices can be defined according to design, intent, and duration of use; for this discussion, catheters are referred to as acute short-term noncuffed catheters (NCCs) or long-term TCCs intended as access for dialysis over weeks to months, and the term right arterial catheter should be avoided; NCCs are placed predominantly for acute use (3 to 5 dialyses within 1 week) versus TCCs when dialysis is believed to be needed longer than 1 week; long-term catheters usually are tunneled, usually are dual lumen, can be coaxial or "double D", and are either stepped with arterial and venous tips staggered by 1 to 2 cm or split so tips are not next to each other; newer designs incorporate a spiral separator allowing either lumen to be used as the arterial port catheter system; port catheter systems connect tubing to a subcutaneously placed device, and in the only port device currently in use for HD, access occurs percutaneously by using a buttonhole technique through the previously formed skin exit site to open valves accessing the catheter lumens.

### Straight versus coiled peritoneal dialysis catheters: a randomized controlled trial [^114wSuBV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Despite a recent meta-analysis favoring straight catheters, the clinical benefits of straight versus coiled peritoneal dialysis catheters remain uncertain. We conducted a randomized controlled study to compare the complication rates associated with these 2 types of double-cuffed peritoneal dialysis catheters.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

308 adult continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either straight or coiled catheters.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter dysfunction requiring surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes included time to catheter dysfunction requiring intervention, catheter migration with dysfunction, infusion pain measured using a visual analogue scale, peritonitis, technique failure, and peritoneal catheter survival.

Results

153 patients were randomly assigned to straight catheters; and 155, to coiled catheters. Among randomly assigned patients who underwent peritoneal dialysis, during a mean follow-up of 21 months, the primary outcome of catheter dysfunction or drainage failure occurred in 9 (5.8%) patients who received a coiled catheter and 1 (0.7%) patient who received a straight catheter. Straight catheters had 5.1% lower risk for catheter dysfunction (95% CI, 1.2%-9.1%; P = 0.02). The HR of the primary outcome for coiled versus straight catheters was 8.69 (95% CI, 1.10–68.6; P = 0.04). Patients who received a coiled catheter had similar risk for peritonitis but reported higher infusion pain scores than those who received straight catheters.

Limitations

Generalizability to other peritoneal dialysis centers with lower volumes and other races and nationalities.

Conclusions

Use of straight Tenckhoff catheters compared with coiled catheters reduced the rate of catheter dysfunction requiring surgical intervention.

### Vascular access for hemodialysis: current practice in Vietnam [^111yaXB1]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Medium credibility.

A well-functioning vascular access is a mainstay to perform an efficient hemodialysis procedure, which directly affects the quality of life in hemodialysis patients. We use three main types of access: native arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, and central venous catheter. Arteriovenous fistula remains the first and best choice for chronic hemodialysis. It is the best access for longevity, the lowest related complications, and for this reason, arteriovenous fistula use is strongly recommended by guidelines from different countries, including Vietnam. In practice, well-functioning arteriovenous fistula creation is not always simple. In this case, arteriovenous fistula creation with vein transposition or translocation is certainly useful. When native vein options have been exhausted, prosthetic can be used as the second option of maintenance hemodialysis access alternatives. Central venous catheters are very common and have become an important adjunct in maintaining patients on hemodialysis. In Bach Mai hospital, we certainly create about 1000 new arteriovenous fistulas every year (among these, about 84.98% new hemodialysis patients start hemodialysis without permanent accesses and depend on temporary central venous catheters) and successfully matured arteriovenous fistula rate is 92.6%. Among hemodialysis population in Bach Mai, 2.29% have arteriovenous grafts and 2.81% of patients still depend on cuffed tunneled catheters. The preferable locations for catheter insertions are the internal jugular and femoral veins. Proper vascular access maintenance requires integration of different professionals to create a vascular access team. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is not available. In our circumstance, we have achieved some advantages for hemodialysis patients but still a big gap to an advanced country.

### Diagnosis of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the setting of acute changes in loading conditions [^111NxiUp]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Haemodialysis

In ambulatory patients, haemodialysis was performed over four hours following a standard prescription that was unchanged for at least two months. In ICU patients, the haemodialysis regimen was adapted to both clinical status and metabolic perturbation. In all patients, the volume of ultrafiltration was determined by the attending physician.

A Fresenius 4008 H system with biocompatible membranes (Polyflux™; Gambro, Hechingen, Germany) and bicarbonate-buffered dialysate (Fresenius Medical Care SK-F213, Bad Homburg, Germany) at 37°C was used for haemodialysis. Arteriovenous fistulae were used in ambulatory patients, whereas Mahurkar ® catheters (Tyco Healthcare Group LP, Mansfield, MA, USA) were used in ICU patients.

Perdialytic hypotension was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of greater than 30% or to below 100 mmHg. When hypotension occurred, a bolus of 20 mL hypertonic glucose solution (30%) was injected through the venous line of the haemodialysis circuit, and the ultrafiltration rate was reduced when necessary. Attention was paid to avoid fluid challenges and changes in vasopressor infusion rate throughout the study period.

Echocardiography Doppler

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed in ambulatory patients, whereas transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used in ventilated ICU patients. The echocardiographic study was performed before (baseline) and at least one hour after haemodialysis using a SONOS 5500 upper-end platform (Philips Ultrasound, Andover, MA, USA) equipped with a 2.5 to 4 MHz broadband transducer or a 5 MHz multiplane TEE probe. Respiratory tracing in spontaneously breathing patients or airway pressure curve in ventilated patients were displayed continuously. The same experienced operator performed all TTE and TEE studies and took offline measurements from digitally recorded images. All measurements were performed in triplicate at end-expiration identified on respiratory tracings, and were averaged. Measurements were performed in random order and not consecutively for the same patient, with the investigator being blinded to both body weight and study phase (before or after haemodialysis).

Arteriovenous graft (AVG) maturation and temporary catheter use for hemodialysis: The Work Group's consensus is that maturation of an AVG access site usually requires about 3 weeks; thus, ideally, AVGs should be placed 3 to 6 weeks before use. For temporary access of longer than 1 week duration, long-term catheters are the method of choice; catheters are suitable for immediate use, should not be inserted until needed, and the Work Group recommends that a catheter be used for dialysis access for as brief a period as necessary.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^115EJKHu]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

What strategies may prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections?

Similar to other HAIs — such as central line-associated blood stream infection — many CAUTI prevention strategies have been 'bundled' into a composite of multimodal sets of interventions known as 'bladder bundles'. hese bundles consist of educational interventions to improve appropriate use and clinical skill in catheter placement, behavioural interventions such as catheter restriction and removal protocols, and use of specific technologies such as the bladder ultrasound. Despite some early success in implementing a bladder bundleto reduce urinary catheterisation rates, CAUTI prevention has proven challenging for several important reasons. For example, monitoring urinary catheter use and CAUTI rates to inform and sustain urinary catheter-related interventions is very resource intensive. Perhaps more importantly, improving practice regarding urinary catheter placement and removal also requires interventions to change the expectations and habits of nurses, physicians and patients about the need for urinary catheters.

To help organise and prioritise the many potential interventions to prevent CAUTI, we use the conceptual model of the 'lifecycle of the urinary catheter'to highlight that the highest yield interventions to prevent CAUTI will target at least one of the four 'stages' of the catheter's 'life'. As illustrated in figure 1, the 'lifecycle' of the catheter (1) begins with its initial placement, (2) continues when it remains in place, day after day, (3) ceases when it is removed and (4) may start over if another catheter is inserted after removal of the first one.

Figure 1
Lifecycle of the urinary catheter. This conceptual model illustrates four stages of the urinary catheter lifecycle as targets for interventions to decrease catheter use and catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

Because avoiding unnecessary urinary catheter use is the most important strategy in prevention of CAUTI, we review the evidence on two types of interventions that target unnecessary urinary catheter use: (1) protocols and interventions to decrease unnecessary placement of urinary catheters (catheter lifecycle stage 1), and (2) interventions that prompt removal of unnecessary urinary catheters (catheter lifecycle stage 3).

### Fluid mechanics and clinical success of central venous catheters for dialysis – answers to simple but persisting problems [^114Dddfr]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Over 60% of patients initiating chronic hemodialysis in the United States have a chronic central venous catheter (CVC) as their first blood access device. Although it would be better if these patients started dialysis with fistulas, the CVC is used because it is a reliable and relatively safe method for obtaining blood access over a period of months. Drawing blood from a vein at 300–400 ml/minute is a relatively delicate and somewhat unpredictable process, and there is always a tendency for the vein wall to draw over the arterial tip and obstruct flow. Several methods have been employed to minimize this problem and maximize blood flow, and differing catheter designs have resulted. With all of the different catheter designs now on the market, it is natural to ask what is the logic of different designs. Moreover, in the absence of many direct comparative studies it is natural to ask whether one design is really better than another. There is some misinformation regarding catheter design and function. The following is a list of 10 frequently asked questions In this review, the hydraulic features of CVC are discussed and explained, and logical answers are provided for the following questions: 1. Why do "D" catheters flow better than concentric or side by side catheters? 2. Why are all catheters about the same diameter? Does making them bigger really decrease the resistance to flow? 3. Why might a split tip catheter flow better than a solid body catheter? 4. What happens to injections of lock solution at catheter volume? 5. What's better-numerous side holes or none? 6. Why does blood rise into some internal jugular catheters over time, displacing the lock solution? 7. How can a little kink (or stenosis) decrease flow so much? 8. Where should the tips be placed-superior vena cava or right atrium? 9. Which is really better, splitsheath or over-the-wire placement? 10. Which dialysis access has a lower complication rate — CVC or arteriovenous (AV) graft? There remain important problems with CVC for dialysis. With a few more improvements, chronic CVC for dialysis could become a painless, effective and safe long-term access for the majority of dialysis patients and acceptable as an alternative to AV grafts.

### Catheter-related thrombosis: a practical approach [^1119i7oT]. Journal of the Intensive Care Society (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-related thrombosis:

- **Definition**: Central venous catheter thrombosis is a common complication of central venous catheter insertion characterized by thrombus formation around the site of the catheter.
- **Pathophysiology**: Central venous catheter thrombosis is caused by activation of the coagulation cascade and formation of thrombin and clot associated with an indwelling catheter. Circulatory stasis, vascular endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable states predispose to the development of thrombus.
- **Disease course**: Central venous catheter thrombosis may be asymptomatic or cause pain, swelling in the arm, shortness of breath, vena cava obstruction. Disease progression may lead to PE. Long-term sequelae may include postphlebitic syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 28-day mortality rate in critically ill patients with central venous catheter thrombosis is estimated at 14.1%.

### Geographic and facility variation in initial use of non-tunneled catheters for incident maintenance hemodialysis patients [^113Spebx]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a significant proportion of the variation in initial NTHC use in chronic hemodialysis patients is explained at the facility and regional level. Given that starting dialysis with a NTHC is even less optimal than starting with a tunneled CVC, future studies are needed to determine what underpins facility-level and regional-level variation: an improved understanding of this variation could lead the way to a reduction in the frequency of 'least-optimal' dialysis starts using NTHCs.

---

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^117FQi8m]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

A proportion of catheters may develop complications over time, of which the most common are dysfunction (poor flow) and infection. As with AV access, much of the literature on catheter complications is limited by small study populations and short term outcomes, leaving many knowledge gaps, so that an evidence-based consensus is not possible for all aspects of management. Since the optimal approach is not always clear, pragmatic shared decisions should be made, taking into account clinical risk, likely treatment outcome and patient preference.

Catheter dysfunction

Tunnelled dialysis catheter dysfunction is a common problem, usually defined as inability of the catheter to deliver a blood flow of at least 300 ml/min in adult patients. Dysfunction from the time of insertion is generally due to poor positioning or kinking (rare following fluoroscopic guided insertion) and usually identified and corrected soon after insertion, through manipulation or repositioning. A catheter which previously functioned well but then delivers poor flow is considered to have late dysfunction, and this is may be caused by thrombus or fibrin, either within the catheter lumen or around the tip, though the distinction is in most cases not important, and imaging is not necessary. Fibrin forms around the external surface of most catheters, like a sheath, sometimes extending beyond the catheter tip.

If flows become problematic during haemodialysis, then repositioning, saline flushes or reversing the catheter lumens may provide a temporary solution, allowing completion of the session. However, these solutions do not address the cause of poor flow and are rarely durable - further treatment options include thrombolytic agents and mechanical measures (removing fibrin, usually at the same time as replacing the catheter). Thrombolytic therapy is immediately available in the dialysis unit, and is usually attempted initially, as it is often able to restore function quickly allowing dialysis to continue without too much interruption.

### Catheter access for hemodialysis: an overview [^112oZHcd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

The provision of hemodialysis requires repeated, reliable access to the central circulatory system. Long-term hemodialysis has best been provided by arteriovenous fistulae and arteriovenous grafts. In recent years, more and more patients have been chronically dialyzed with tunneled dialysis catheters. These catheters, which were originally developed as a short-term bridge to permanent vascular access, have made up an increasing percentage of maintenance vascular access. While these catheters have the advantage of ease of placement and are immediately ready for use, they substantially increase the risk of bacteremia, stenosis of central veins, and even mortality.

### "I had a knot in my heart": unusual complication after implantation of a swan-ganz catheter [^113tfv6o]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early detection of intracardiac knot formation through imaging (chest X-ray, vascular ultrasound) is critical for timely intervention. While non-surgical retrieval techniques exist, our case demonstrates that surgical removal via vascular access may represent the safest approach in select scenarios, particularly when catheter integrity is compromised. This complication highlights three fundamental principles of management: minimizing catheter manipulation remains paramount for prevention, interdisciplinary collaboration proves essential for optimal approach selection, and vigilant monitoring is necessary to identify these rare but serious complications. Ultimately, the decision between interventional and surgical management must be individualized, carefully weighing procedural risks against patient-specific factors.

### The epidemiology and microbiology of central venous catheter related bloodstream infections among hemodialysis patients in the Philippines: a retrospective cohort study [^115NCdQX]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Incidence rates and outcomes of CRBSI

One hundred ninety-seven episodes of CRBSI were recorded during the observation period. A total of forty-one patients experienced multiple CRBSI events, ten of whom experienced a relapse, while thirty-one had a reinfection episode. The median duration of catheter placement was 21 days among patients who developed CRBSI, compared to 17 days among those who did not develop CRBSI.

Overall, the CRBSI incidence rate was documented at 6.72 episodes per 1000 catheter days, with a relapse rate of 5.08%, reinfection rate of 15.74%, and mortality rate of 6.09%. By location, femoral catheters showed significantly higher incidence rates, with 15.04 episodes. This was followed by internal jugular catheters (6.5 CRBSI), while subclavian catheter use had the lowest infection rate, at 3.52 cases per 10,000 person-catheter days. This finding is consistent with previous research that indicated fewer complications using the subclavian site compared to other sites. In particular, there were significantly lower incidences of major catheter-related complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infections and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis for subclavian as compared to jugular and femoral sites. Wherein, the reported incidence rate of 1.5 per 1000 catheter days for subclavian catheters were lower compared to jugular and femoral sites.

The non-tunneled catheter had a higher incidence rate of 6.91 than the tunneled catheter of 3.52 CRBSI per 1000 person-catheter days. Meanwhile, based on laterality, CRBSI was found to be more frequent with a left-sided placement (21.88 episodes) than a right-sided placement (6.56 episodes per thousand catheter days). The high incidence of left-sided placement may be driven by the fact that right sided placement was not always feasible. In some cases, anatomical or pathological factors such as thrombosis, vascular stenosis or prior surgical interventions could have prevented placing the catheter on the right side of the body. For example, in situations with cannulation difficulties or reduced vascular access, it may be necessary to use the left internal jugular vein. The high risk of infection from left-sided placements could probably also be linked to these root issues which could compromise sterility and efficacy of catheter insertion altogether.

What is the best access?

Once deciding a patient requires RRT, the next step is choosing the best access. The goal is to maximize blood flow rates and minimize complications such as infection and line thrombosis. The KDIGO guidelines recommend preferential placement in the right internal jugular vein, followed by either femoral vein, and lastly the left internal jugular vein. When placing a jugular catheter, the tip of the catheter should ideally be placed in the right atrium, while a femoral catheter should terminate in the inferior vena cava. Subclavian access is discouraged due to the risk of vein stenosis, potentially limiting long-term fistula options if needed. While femoral catheters have been associated with increased infection in the past, recent studies have shown similar rates of catheter infection regardless of site, except in morbidly obese patients. It is critical to use sterile techniques and maximal protective barriers when placing these catheters.

Two major types of catheters are available for RRTs distinguished by the presence of a cuff, if they require tunneling during placement, and optimal duration of use. Most commonly used for RRT initiation is a non-tunneled, non-cuffed dialysis catheter. These are easily placed at the beside under ultrasound guidance by an intensivist. These are considered temporary and should be removed prior to hospital discharge. The alternative, tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheters are placed under fluoroscopic guidance usually by an interventional radiologist or surgeon. Tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheters are associated with decreased risk of infection, greater dialysis efficiency, less treatment interruptions, and overall, less complications. If it is thought that the patient will require dialysis for greater than 2 weeks, has no active bloodstream infections, and no significant coagulopathy, one may consider initial placement of a tunneled catheter.

Cardiac catheterization access in cancer patients — route selection and hemostasis considerations are as follows: For cancer patients who are excellent candidates for both access types, the radial artery is preferred. Femoral access is the preferred approach for cancer patients on hemodialysis. The use of smaller sheath sizes, prompt removal of sheaths and early ambulation is recommended. A femoral angiogram is recommended after transfemoral access to promptly identify and address potential access complications. Meticulous hemostasis as well as frequent catheter and sheath flushing are required, as cancer patients face the challenge of concomitant increased risk of both bleeding and thrombosis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115fkJhj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — dialysis catheter selection, insertion, and infection prevention in acute kidney injury (AKI) states that there was insufficient evidence to support the recommendation for use of nontunneled dialysis catheters for initiation of RRT in patients with AKI, and in a small, single-center, randomized, controlled trial, tunneled femoral catheters were found to give better flow characteristics, fewer postinsertion complications, greater longevity, and less likelihood of inadequate prescription as compared to nontunneled femoral catheters. Patients with AKI in the setting of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) may benefit from placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter rather than a nontunneled catheter, and given the high prevalence of CKD, the selection of a tunneled versus nontunneled dialysis catheter should take into account the likelihood of end-stage renal disease. For procedure safety and infection control, ultrasound should be used for dialysis catheter insertion to minimize the risk of complications and internal jugular catheter placement should be confirmed with a chest radiograph, no high-quality data currently exist to support the routine use of topical antibiotics or antibiotic locks for short-term dialysis catheters, and the KDOQI Work Group suggests reserving the catheter exclusively for extracorporeal treatment only to prevent unnecessary manipulation and risk of infection of the catheter.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^114QwtkM]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline 6. Dialysis catheter problems

6.1 We suggest a shared decision in the management of dialysis catheter complications, taking into account clinical severity, treatability, alternative access options and patient priorities [2D]
6.2 We recommend locking each lumen of the catheter with a thrombolytic agent (such as urokinase or alteplase) as the initial treatment for catheter dysfunction [1C]
6.3 We recommend catheter replacement when thrombolytics are ineffective, usually by exchange over a guidewire, in a setting where fibrin sheath disruption is also available [1C]
6.4 We recommend systemic antibiotics without catheter replacement for exit site infections without bacteraemia [1D]
6.5 We suggest systemic antibiotics without catheter replacement as the initial strategy for uncomplicated bacteraemia due to coagulase-negative Staphylococci [2C]
6.6 We suggest routinely favouring catheter replacement, either by exchange over a guidewire or by removal with interval replacement, in the context of bacteraemia which is recurrent, associated with severe clinical features, or due to Staphylococcus aureus [2C]

### The burden of prolonged indwelling catheter after acute urinary retention in ikeja-lagos, Nigeria [^115oo1mh]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary retention (AUR) is a common urological emergency characterized by a sudden and painful inability to pass urine. It is estimated that 10% of men in their seventies and a third in their eighties will have AUR within the next five years. AUR is an important public health issue. It has a significant impact on the patient's health-related QoL and is associated with a substantial economic burden.

AUR may be caused by: a greater resistance to the flow of urine due to mechanical or dynamic obstruction, bladder over-distension or neuropathic disease. The immediate treatment of AUR consists of bladder decompression, either by a urethral catheter or a suprapubic catheter. In our practice, suprapubic cystostomy is usually reserved for patients in whom urethral catheterization is contraindicated or has failed. The subsequent management depends on the cause of the AUR. The patients often have to remain on a long waiting list for the definitive surgical procedure.

The aim of the study was to describe the problems associated with the prolonged use of indwelling catheter as well as the cost implication of changing these catheters among patients who previously had AUR while awaiting definitive surgical treatment in our institution.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^116KAjwA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Vascular access — aseptic technique and general principles are emphasized: The use of aseptic technique and appropriate cannulation methods, the timing of fistula and graft cannulation, and early evaluation of immature fistulae are all factors that may prevent morbidity and may prolong the survival of permanent dialysis accesses. For all vascular accesses, aseptic technique should be used for all cannulation and catheter accession procedures. (A)

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^111Qm1iN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI vascular access research priorities — catheter dysfunction and patency call for standardization, earlier intervention assessment, surveillance of embedded catheters, and pharmacologic dose comparison. The document proposes to develop and validate a standard definition of CVC dysfunction with estimation of time, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of markers; to assess the impact of earlier intervention and the types of interventions; to track the frequency of dysfunctional and embedded CVC and management methods; and to confirm the benefit of 1 mg versus 2 mg tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in maintenance of CVC patency over short and long term.

### A novel use of a split sheath to maintain vessel access when guidewire exchange is not possible [^112wY5A9]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

After inserting a catheter into a vessel, guidewire exchange technique must be used to maintain vascular access. If the lumen of the catheter is blocked and the guidewire exchange cannot be used, the catheter can only be removed, vascular access is lost, and an alternate vascular approach attempted. We describe a technique to remove the blocked catheter and still maintain vascular access.

### Selecting optimal hemodialysis catheters: material, design, advanced features, and preferences [^117VZLUX]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis catheters are a necessary evil. They provide an immediate and effective lifeline for hemodialysis patients, and their use is steadily increasing. This increasingly important role has lead to the development of many generations of dialysis catheters. Some aspects of novel designs have shown potential to reduce complications, while others provide options for physician insertion preference. The two major biomaterials for catheter construction are currently polyurethane and silicone, while copolymers such as carbothane are becoming more widespread. Catheter coatings such as heparin, antibiotics, and silver ion are designed to minimize thrombosis and infection. Finally, many lumen and tip designs are also available. These new features were designed to address common problems, including maintenance of adequate flow rate and prevention of thrombosis, fibrin sheath, and catheter-related infection. However, reliable data directly comparing these different designs and coatings are currently lacking. This communication reviews current hemodialysis catheters, including materials, design, and advanced features.

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^1176774P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Tunneled cuffed venous catheters — advantages relative to other access types — are described as universally applicable, insertable into multiple sites relatively easily, requiring no maturation time so they can be used immediately, and not requiring skin puncture for repeated vascular access for HD; they also do not have short-term hemodynamic consequences (e.g., changes in cardiac output or myocardial load), have lower initial and replacement costs, can provide access during a period of months permitting fistula maturation in patients who require immediate HD, and facilitate correcting thrombotic complications.
