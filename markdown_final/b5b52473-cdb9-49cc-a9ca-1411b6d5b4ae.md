## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 56-year-old man with cirrhosis who presents with melena after 5 days of NSAID use, including timing of endoscopy, resuscitation, pharmacologic therapy, and what not to do. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and stabilization. Then, I should verify the likely bleeding source and risk stratify using the Glasgow-Blatchford Score. Next, I will determine the optimal timing of upper endoscopy and whether urgent endoscopy is indicated. After that, I need to check the role of PPIs and antibiotics in cirrhotic UGIB. Finally, I will review what to avoid, including NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors, and clarify whether a CBC alone changes management before endoscopy [^111rjcAj] [^113irrN3] [^114geXK9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk profile. A patient with cirrhosis who develops melena after NSAID exposure is at high risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, with potential sources including portal hypertensive varices and NSAID-induced peptic ulcer disease; the mortality risk is substantially higher in cirrhosis, so I need to ensure rapid stabilization and definitive diagnosis without delay [^116BmY3F] [^111rjcAj] [^113irrN3].

> I will now examine hemodynamic status immediately because this dictates everything else. I need to check blood pressure, heart rate, orthostatics, mental status, and urine output, and initiate aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation if unstable; if shock persists despite fluids, I should escalate to vasopressors and consider ICU transfer while preparing for urgent endoscopy after stabilization, since unstable patients require endoscopy within 12 hours and resuscitation must not be delayed for endoscopy [^114veQsV] [^111rjcAj].

> Wait, let me verify the risk stratification step. I should calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) on presentation; in cirrhosis with melena, the GBS is typically high, and patients with GBS ≥ 12 are considered high risk and warrant inpatient management with early endoscopy, whereas GBS 0–1 can be considered for outpatient care in selected stable patients, which is not the case here [^111rjcAj] [^113irrN3].

> Next, I should review the timing of endoscopy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "urgent" meaning better outcomes. The NEJM RCT in high-risk UGIB showed that urgent endoscopy within 6 hours was not superior to early endoscopy within 6–24 hours for mortality or rebleeding, and both ACG and ESGE recommend upper endoscopy within 24 hours for overt UGIB after resuscitation; however, in suspected variceal hemorrhage, expert guidance supports endoscopy within 12 hours, so I should align timing with the likely source and hemodynamic status rather than an arbitrary ultra-early target [^114geXK9] [^113irrN3] [^111rjcAj] [^114wrEfW] [^113SK5NN].

> I need to ensure I am not conflating nonvariceal and variceal guidance. For nonvariceal bleeding, early endoscopy within 24 hours after stabilization is appropriate; for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, many guidelines advise endoscopy within 12 hours, and ICU-level care with vasoactive therapy is standard, so I should plan for early endoscopy while initiating vasoactive agents if variceal bleeding is suspected [^111rjcAj] [^113irrN3] [^114wrEfW] [^113SK5NN].

> Let me consider pharmacologic therapy now. I should start a high-dose PPI immediately on presentation and not delay it until after endoscopy; evidence shows no advantage of IV over oral PPIs for clinical outcomes, so oral high-dose therapy is acceptable if the patient can take it, with IV preferred if oral is not feasible, and after endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk lesions, continue high-dose PPI for 72 hours to mitigate rebleeding risk [^112hNsBz] [^111rjcAj].

> But wait, what if this is variceal bleeding. I should initiate vasoactive therapy empirically if variceal hemorrhage is suspected, using octreotide or terlipressin, because these agents reduce bleeding and improve hemostasis; additionally, I should start antibiotic prophylaxis for 5–7 days in cirrhotic patients with UGIB to reduce infection and mortality, even though recent evidence suggests shorter prophylaxis may be noninferior, so I will adhere to current guideline practice while monitoring evolving data [^116BmY3F] [^11126bsm].

> I should double-check the role of a pre-endoscopy CBC. A CBC helps quantify anemia and guide transfusion thresholds, but it does not change the indication or timing of endoscopy in this high-risk presentation; therefore, I should obtain a CBC as part of initial labs, but I must not delay endoscopy for it, especially if the patient is unstable or has ongoing bleeding [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid. NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, increase the risk of peptic ulcer bleeding and are contraindicated in cirrhosis with UGIB; I need to stop the offending NSAID immediately and avoid prescribing COX-2 inhibitors as an alternative analgesic in this setting, favoring acetaminophen when appropriate after stabilization [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the endoscopy timing one more time to avoid overcalling "urgent". If the patient stabilizes with resuscitation and there is no active hemodynamic instability, early endoscopy within 6–24 hours is appropriate; if instability persists or variceal bleeding is strongly suspected, I should proceed to urgent endoscopy within 12 hours with ongoing resuscitation and vasoactive therapy, recognizing that ultra-early endoscopy within 6 hours has not shown outcome benefits in high-risk nonvariceal bleeding cohorts [^114geXK9] [^113irrN3] [^111rjcAj].

> Putting this together, my prioritized actions are: stabilize with fluids and vasopressors as needed, initiate high-dose PPI immediately, start vasoactive therapy and antibiotics if variceal bleeding is suspected, obtain a CBC and coagulation studies without delaying care, and arrange early upper endoscopy within 24 hours for overt UGIB, targeting within 12 hours if variceal bleeding is suspected or the patient remains unstable; I should avoid NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors going forward and tailor post-endoscopic management to endoscopic findings and hemostasis achieved [^111rjcAj] [^113irrN3] [^114geXK9] [^116BmY3F] [^11126bsm].

---

The correct answer is **A) urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy** [^113irrN3]. This 56-year-old man with cirrhosis and melena has a high risk of variceal bleeding and needs **urgent endoscopy within 12–24 hours** [^114wrEfW] [^111rjcAj] to diagnose and treat the bleeding source. Options B, C, and D are supportive but do not replace urgent endoscopy; **CBC alone delays definitive care** [^113irrN3], COX-2 inhibitors still increase bleeding risk in cirrhosis, and PPIs are adjuncts after endoscopy [^111rjcAj] [^112hNsBz].

---

## Clinical evaluation and risk stratification

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Assess for hypotension, tachycardia, and orthostatic changes, which indicate significant blood loss and instability [^111Edg53].

- **Severity of liver disease**: Cirrhosis increases the risk of variceal bleeding, which carries high mortality if not promptly managed [^notfound].

- **Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS)**: A high GBS (> 12) indicates high risk and necessitates urgent endoscopy [^notfound].

---

## Indications for urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy

Urgent endoscopy is indicated in patients with **upper gastrointestinal bleeding** — particularly those with cirrhosis, given the high risk of variceal hemorrhage [^114wrEfW]. Current guidelines recommend **endoscopy within 12–24 hours** of presentation for patients with suspected variceal bleeding or high-risk features [^112BYmL5] [^111rjcAj]. Early endoscopy enables accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, and definitive hemostatic therapy, significantly reducing morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Role of COX-2 inhibitors in cirrhosis

COX-2 inhibitors, while selective, still **impair platelet function** and can exacerbate bleeding in cirrhosis. They are not recommended for pain management in patients with cirrhosis and active gastrointestinal bleeding because of the risk of worsening hemorrhage.

---

## Role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

PPIs are recommended as adjunctive therapy in upper gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly for peptic ulcer disease [^111rjcAj]. However, they **do not replace the need for urgent endoscopy** in cirrhosis with suspected variceal bleeding. PPIs should be initiated after endoscopic evaluation and tailored to the identified bleeding source [^111rjcAj].

---

## Timing of endoscopy and outcomes

Studies show that **early endoscopy (within 24 hours)** improves outcomes in upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including reduced rebleeding, shorter hospital stay, and lower mortality [^notfound]. In cirrhosis, urgent endoscopy within 12–24 hours is critical to identify and treat variceal bleeding, which significantly impacts prognosis [^112BYmL5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy | Strongly recommended within 12–24 hours [^111rjcAj] |
| CBC before endoscopy | Supportive, but should not delay endoscopy [^notfound] |
| COX-2 inhibitors | Not recommended due to bleeding risk |
| PPIs | Recommended as adjunctive therapy after endoscopy [^111rjcAj] |

---

The correct answer is **A) urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy**. This patient requires urgent endoscopy within 12–24 hours to diagnose and treat the bleeding source, given his cirrhosis and melena. Options B, C, and D are supportive but do not replace the need for urgent endoscopy.

### Why Do people choose emergency and urgent care services? A rapid review utilizing a systematic literature search and narrative synthesis [^115sW6jR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We identified six distinct reasons explaining why patients choose to access emergency and urgent care services, for mainly low‐urgency health problems. Limited access to or confidence in primary care; patient perceived urgency; convenience; views of family, friends, or other health professionals; and a belief that their condition required the resources and facilities offered by a particular healthcare provider were all key factors that influence patients when they make decisions about whether to access emergency and urgent care and the type of emergency and urgent care they choose. By understanding why more people are choosing to access these services we are better able to direct and provide patients with the right care at the right time. However, there is a need to examine demand from a whole‐system perspective and, in doing so, gain better understanding of demand for different parts of the emergency and urgent care system and the characteristics of patients within each sector.

### Does this lung nodule need urgent review? A discrete choice experiment of Australian general practitioners [^115zafhJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Aims

To identify factors that influence GPs to request urgent specialist review for patients with a lung nodule on CT scan.
To assess the proportion of GP responses that request urgent review for lung nodules with a PanCan risk > 10%.
To assess the proportion of GPs requesting urgent review in the specific clinical scenarios of a) A patient with haemoptysis and a normal chest CT and b) A patient with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy without a parenchymal lung lesion.

Definitions and rationale

Urgent review was defined as review by a lung cancer specialist within two weeks of referral for suspected lung cancer.

The BTS recommendation that a lung nodule with a PanCan risk > 10% be considered for further investigation with positron emission tomography (PET) scan and / or biopsy was used as a surrogate for needing urgent (within two weeks) specialist review.

NOTE: An urgent heart failure visit was defined as an urgent, unplanned, assessment by a physician, e.g., in an Emergency Department, and requiring treatment for worsening heart failure (other than just an increase in oral diuretics).

* In DAPA-HF, the CV death component of the primary endpoint included death of undetermined cause. In DELIVER, the CV death component of the primary endpoint excluded death of undetermined cause.

† Patients at risk is the number of patients at risk at the beginning of the period.

HR = Hazard ratio, CI = Confidence interval, CV = Cardiovascular.

The treatment effect of dapagliflozin on the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure or urgent heart failure was consistent across the LVEF range as evaluated in DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials (Figure 8).

* 1 patient in DAPA-HF trial had LVEF > 40. 4 patients in DELIVER trial had LVEF ≤ 40.

In DAPA-HF trial, the 5% and 95% percentiles of LVEF were 20 and 40 respectively. In DELIVER trial, the 5% and 95% percentiles of LVEF were 42 and 70, respectively.

In DAPA-HF, the treatment benefit of dapagliflozin 10 mg in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63, 0.90)], and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy [HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.51, 0.88)].

In DELIVER, the treatment benefit of dapagliflozin 10 mg in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.97)].

In DELIVER, the hazard ratio of treatment benefit of dapagliflozin 10 mg in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy was 0.90 (95% CI 0.72, 1.12).

Comparison of mortality and further bleeding between urgent (< 6 h) versus early (6–24 h) endoscopy in patients with high risk gastrointestinal bleeding (Glasgow Blatchford Score ≥ 12)

Although current evidence does not appear to support urgent endoscopy at less than 6 h, some variceal bleeding guidelines advise that endoscopy should be performed at between 12 h and 24 h. Exact timing of endoscopy can be challenging and should be decided on the basis of thorough clinical assessment, including haemodynamics and underlying comorbidities. Appropriate resuscitation and optimisation of comorbidities is essential before endoscopy.

Meta-analysis of secondary outcomes

Length of hospital stay in the urgent and early endoscopy groups

Eight studies involving a total of 5,403 patients explored the length of hospital stay following urgent and early endoscopy (Table S3). There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the urgent and early endoscopy groups (MD = −0.41, 95% CI, −2.36 to 1.55, P = 0.68). Significant heterogeneity was observed (I² = 98%, P < 0.00001) (Fig. 4 a), and publication bias was not statistically significant (Egger test, P = 0.06; Begg test, P = 0.05).

Need for salvage treatment in the urgent and early endoscopy groups

Four studies involving a total of 4,498 patients explored the need for salvage treatment following urgent and early endoscopy (Table S3). A total of 18.9% (848/4,498) of patients needed salvage treatment, with 20% (612/3,061) in the urgent endoscopy group and 16.4% (236/1,437) in the early endoscopy group. There was no significant difference in the need for salvage treatment between the urgent and early endoscopy groups (OR = 1.13, 95% CI, 0.95–1.34, P = 0.16). The heterogeneity was not significant (I² = 24%, P = 0.27) (Fig. 4 b), and publication bias showed statistical significance (Egger test, P = 0.04; Begg test, P = 0.5).

Units of transfusion in the urgent and early endoscopy groups

Four studies involving a total of 1,389 patients explored the units of transfusion following urgent and early endoscopy (Table S3). There was no significant difference in the units of transfusion between the urgent and early endoscopy groups (MD = 0.36, 95% CI, −0.53 to 1.26, P = 0.42). Significant heterogeneity was observed (I² = 87%, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4 c), and publication bias was not statistically significant (Egger test, P = 0.7; Begg test, P = 1).

### Comparison of mortality and complications between urgent-start peritoneal dialysis and urgent-start hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113TqNk6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

The advantages of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) vis-à-vis urgent-start hemodialysis (HD) are not clear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the two modalities. Databases of PubMed, Embase, Ovoid, and Google Scholar were searched up to November 1, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality, and secondary outcomes were dialysis-related infectious complications and mechanical complications. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for all outcomes. Seven studies were included. The pooled analysis revealed a statistically significant reduced risk of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing urgent-start PD as compared to urgent-start HD (RR: 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.40, 0.94], I² = 56.34%). A meta-analysis of dialysis-related infectious complications indicated no statistically significant difference between the two modalities (RR: 0.66, 95% CI [0.29, 1.50], I² = 69.62%). Our analysis revealed a statistically significant reduced risk of mechanical complications in patients undergoing urgent-start PD (RR: 0.54, 95% CI [0.40, 0.73], I² = 0%). To conclude, unadjusted data from observational studies are indicative of lower mortality and lower risk of mechanical complications with urgent-start PD versus urgent-start HD. The risk of infectious complications was not different between the two groups. Further studies with a larger sample size using propensity-matched cohorts are needed to strengthen current evidence.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^114BpnDZ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Detection of urgent abdominal conditions

A high sensitivity for urgent conditions is clinically important, as patients with an urgent diagnosis being discharged home and left untreated is undesirable. False positive urgent diagnoses, on the other hand, could lead to overtreatment. In resource constrained settings, where access to ultrasonography and CT is limited, the percentage of missed cases is likely to be higher than with the conditional CT strategy described here, as we found that clinical examination had a lower sensitivity. The associated low specificity could lead to the overtreatment of many patients with non-urgent conditions.

The gain in diagnostic performance of the conditional CT strategy compared with the CT only strategy represents a trade-off between a gain in sensitivity and a loss in specificity. No disproportionate decrease in specificity accompanied the 5% increase in sensitivity when switching from a general to a conditional CT strategy. Assessing whether the health benefits for patients being correctly identified with an urgent condition are larger than the harms of overtreatment associated with an incorrectly assigned urgent condition is beyond the scope of this study.

In clinical practice, physicians consciously and subconsciously distinguish categories of urgency for patients with acute abdominal pain in the emergency department. Apart from patients with a low clinical suspicion who were discharged from the emergency department without imaging, all other eligible consecutive patients were invited to enter the study. As a consequence, we also included patients in whom the diagnosis after clinical evaluation was clear, with limited added value of imaging. In other patients, urgent diagnoses were suspected after clinical evaluation but could not be made with high accuracy and certainty. This category of patients, in which imaging has the largest added value after clinical evaluation, probably comprises the vast majority of included patients.

Methods

Study Design

This review was one of five linked reviews undertaken by our Evidence Synthesis Center to examine the effectiveness of different models of delivering urgent care. 25 The Evidence Synthesis Center provides rapid evidence synthesis about relevant health issues and evidence gaps to the U.K. National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). This information is used to inform calls for new research. A timeline of 6 months was given by NIHR for the Evidence Synthesis Center to complete five separate but interlinked reviews around emergency and urgent care, and this paper presents one of the reviews. The review reported here explores patient's reasons for choosing emergency and urgent care.

We were required to provide answers to the research commissioner (NIHR) within a time scale that was prohibitive to a full systematic review. The short time frame and vast scope of the review subject area lends itself to rapid review methods, to efficiently identify and synthesize the most relevant evidence within the study time frame. A rapid review is defined as "a type of knowledge synthesis in which components of the systematic review process are simplified or omitted to produce information in a short period of time", 26 for example, by limiting inclusion by date or language and reporting results narratively. 27 Rapid reviews have been described as a "streamlined alternative to standard systematic reviews" 28 and a key use of this type of review is to provide summary evidence in an environment where health service delivery decisions need to be made quickly and not within the time frames of traditional reviews. They also provide a format that makes evidence accessible for decision makers and are a valuable way of supporting evidenced‐based decision making. 28

The type of review undertaken here can also be described as a mapping review. Mapping reviews are typically used to map, summarize, and categorize broad research bases, particularly with the intention of identifying evidence gaps and are defined as "a systematic search of a broad field to identify gaps in knowledge and/or future research needs". 29 Mapping reviews are frequently used within policy development and health services research. 30 The review reported here used a systematic search strategy. However, other stages of the review are typologically different from a traditional systematic review method. For example, we did not attempt to intensively identify all applicable evidence, but instead utilized structured searches to identify key evidence. Findings were reported qualitatively using a framework‐based narrative synthesis. 31

### Why Do people choose emergency and urgent care services? A rapid review utilizing a systematic literature search and narrative synthesis [^113uTB5o]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The trend of increasing annual demand for emergency and urgent care is consistent across both developed countries and different providers of emergency and urgent care. Studies from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia report that demand for emergency department (ED) care is increasing by as much as 3% to 6% each year. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In the United States, ED attendance increased from 34.1% to 40.5% per 100 persons between 1996 and 2006 6 and in England demand has doubled from an estimated 6.8 million ED attenders in 1966 and 19677 to 13.6 million in 2006 and 2007, with a further increase to 14.3 million in 2012 and 2013. 7 Demand for urgent care center services in the United Kingdom has also grown, with attendances increasing by 46% between 2006 and 2013. 7 In addition, demand for prehospital emergency services has risen dramatically over the past 20 years, rising in England by 125%, from around 4 million calls in 1994 and 1995 to 9 million ambulance calls in 2014 and 2015 8 and in the U.S. emergency medical services (EMS) transports have risen from 16,000,000 in 2006 to 28,004,624 in 2009. 9, 10

Limitations

This was a rapid review; therefore, some aspects of systematic review methodology have been omitted or simplified to produce a review in a short time frame. 26 By limiting the evidence to 1995 to 2016, we have ensured that the evidence assessed has context and relevance to current policy and practice. In balancing the large scope of this review against the time and resource constraints, we aimed to provide a broad overview of existing evidence and utilized rapid review methods to structure the review process. For example, data extraction was focused toward the most pertinent evidence and information, rather than an exhaustive critique of all available information, and we used a framework‐based synthesis, which is an efficient method for synthesizing evidence to inform policy within short time scales. 31

As part of the review search strategy, we excluded non–English‐language studies, gray literature, abstracts, and conference items. We excluded non–English‐language studies as papers not published in English are less likely be congruent to English and U.K. healthcare systems. As befits a systematic review of patient‐reported reasons for accessing emergency and urgent care, most of the evidence was from qualitative or survey‐based research. Each of these methods has its limitations and we undertook a quality assessment to ensure that the studies included in this review met accepted quality thresholds. For example, the mean survey response rate for included studies reporting survey data was > 74%. This review examined empirical evidence that may help explain why demand for emergency and urgent care services is changing. Evidence was not assessed to identify or make recommendations regarding future services or optimum service configuration.

Research and Policy

Currently, most developed countries are exploring ways to reverse what is often termed as a "crisis in emergency medicine". 78 In particular, healthcare policy makers are examining methods to reduce ED crowding and medically unnecessary use of emergency and urgent services, while at the same time promoting methods to ensure that patients receive care from the most appropriate service. For example, in the United Kingdom, the NHS Five Year Forward View presents the case for redesigning current urgent and emergency care services. 79 By understanding what drives patients with low‐urgency health problems to access emergency and urgent healthcare, this research will help policy makers to plan future ways of managing demand so that service provision works for patients, is sustainable, and helps people with urgent care needs access the right care first time. 32

Multiple sources have identified the views and advice of others as a key driver in ED utilization. However, young people are reported as more likely to directly seek urgent care or attend ED 76 and a criticism of some telephone‐based urgent care services is that advice can lead to a rise in ED attendances. 77

As well as patient‐based factors, demand is likely to be influenced by a range of other characteristics and factors. These include aging populations with chronic conditions and complex health needs, socioeconomic factors often related to deprivation and lack of social support, and policy decisions around health planning and service provision, for example, access to primary care and geographical differences in provision. Future research to identify independent risk factors associated with accessing emergency and urgent care, as part of a population‐based whole‐system study, are required to identify and describe the sources and impact of demand on the emergency and urgent care system as a whole and to identify what demand is for different parts of the system and how these interact.

The impact of increased demand for emergency and urgent care is well known and includes issues such as ED crowding, increased costs, longer waiting times, and overstretched services. ED crowding has been a recognized problem in the United States since the mid‐1980s, 3, 11 occurs in most developed countries, 12, 13, 14, 15 and is described as a "worldwide public health problem". 16 Increased demand for services also results in increased service provision costs. For example, in the United Kingdom demand for ambulance services rises annually by 6.5% and increases costs annually by £60 million ($85 million). 17

Published literature suggests that some of the increase in demand is attributable to people with primary care problems who use emergency and urgent care services to access care, 18 and some studies suggest that large proportions of patients (10%–60%) can be managed using lower‐acuity‐care services. 19 However, this is not the only reason and factors contributing to increased demand for emergency and urgent care are often complex and multifactorial. Several studies report that increased demand for emergency and urgent care services is due to a proportionate rise of older people in the population who may have different and more complex care needs. 20, 21 Other studies have reported that patients bypass their primary care physician (PCP; also known as a general practitioner [GP]) and instead go directly to urgent or emergency care, 22 particularly for out‐of‐hours care and in urban centers. 23 Factors such as perceived superior treatment at hospitals, 18 lack of access to other care, 24 a belief that the problem was serious enough to warrant emergency treatment, 24 and lack of awareness of other services 19 have all been reported as potential reasons why people choose emergency and urgent care and thus may all impact on why demand for these services is continually increasing. The aim of this study was to systematically review the related literature and, using narrative synthesis, to identify the factors behind patient decisions to access urgent and emergency care, including why patients access emergency and urgent care and how and why they choose which service to access.

Background

Emergency department (ED) visits can be divided into urgent and non-urgent. A delay in seeking medical help, especially in urgent cases, can lead to fatal consequences, along with a higher rate of complications and morbidity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread led to restrictions and eventually quarantines. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 spread and quarantine on ED visits rates comparing to parallel periods in preceding years (2013–2019). In addition, we compared this decrease to holidays and weekends, times in which a decrease in ED visits is seen.

Methods

This was a descriptive retrospective study. Causes of ED referrals were divided into urgent and non-urgent, then into different subcategories including infectious, cardiac, etc. RESULTS: For the spring COVID-192020 quarantine period, a 56.3% decrease of mean ED visits per day was seen, as compared to preceding years (55.7% and 98.9% respectively). This decrease was also statistically evident when comparing the urgent and non-urgent causes separately and for all sub-categories. This pattern of decrease also showed statistical evidence of fewer ED visits during holidays for most comparisons, in which lower ED visit rates are expected. Significantly lower rates of ED visits were demonstrated during the COVID-19 quarantine period, as compared to preceding years and main holidays and weekends, a decrease that was also demonstrated for urgent life-threatening causes.

Conclusion

Our findings can be used to inform a wide range of stakeholders, including regional planners, historians, sociologists, and international healthcare organizations. Healthcare providers should understand the reasons for this ED visit decline pattern, attempt to address patients' concerns, and increase awareness regarding alarming symptoms in urgent medical situations.

### Urethral stricture disease guideline amendment (2023) [^1122vfuj]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urethral stricture disease — initial evaluation, diagnosis, and urgent management guidance states that after performing a history, physical examination, and urinalysis, clinicians may use a combination of patient reported measures, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound post-void residual assessment in the initial evaluation of suspected urethral stricture. Clinicians should use urethro-cystoscopy, retrograde urethrography, voiding cystourethrography, or ultrasound urethrography to make a diagnosis of urethral stricture, and clinicians planning non-urgent intervention for a known stricture should determine the length and location of the urethral stricture. For urgent management, surgeons may utilize urethral endoscopic management or immediate suprapubic cystostomy, and surgeons may place a suprapubic cystostomy to promote "urethral rest" prior to definitive urethroplasty in patients dependent on an indwelling urethral catheter or intermittent self-dilation.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH): European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline-update 2021 [^111rjcAj]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Patients with GBS ≤ 1 are at very low risk of rebleeding, mortality within 30 days, or needing hospital-based intervention and can be safely managed as outpatients with outpatient endoscopy. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in patients with acute UGIH who are taking low-dose aspirin as monotherapy for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, aspirin should not be interrupted. If for any reason it is interrupted, aspirin should be re-started as soon as possible, preferably within 3–5 days. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends that following hemodynamic resuscitation, early (≤ 24 hours) upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy should be performed. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 4: ESGE does not recommend urgent (≤ 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy since as compared to early endoscopy, patient outcomes are not improved. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends for patients with actively bleeding ulcers (FIa, FIb), combination therapy using epinephrine injection plus a second hemostasis modality (contact thermal or mechanical therapy). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends for patients with an ulcer with a nonbleeding visible vessel (FIIa), contact or noncontact thermal therapy, mechanical therapy, or injection of a sclerosing agent, each as monotherapy or in combination with epinephrine injection. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE suggests that in patients with persistent bleeding refractory to standard hemostasis modalities, the use of a topical hemostatic spray/powder or cap-mounted clip should be considered. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that for patients with clinical evidence of recurrent peptic ulcer hemorrhage, use of a cap-mounted clip should be considered. In the case of failure of this second attempt at endoscopic hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) should be considered. Surgery is indicated when TAE is not locally available or after failed TAE. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends high dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with FIIb ulcer stigmata (adherent clot) not treated endoscopically. (A): PPI therapy should be administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (e.g., 80mg then 8mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy. (B): High dose PPI therapies given as intravenous bolus dosing (twice-daily) or in oral formulation (twice-daily) can be considered as alternative regimens. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that in patients who require ongoing anticoagulation therapy following acute NVUGIH (e.g., peptic ulcer hemorrhage), anticoagulation should be resumed as soon as the bleeding has been controlled, preferably within or soon after 7 days of the bleeding event, based on thromboembolic risk. The rapid onset of action of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS), as compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), must be considered in this context. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Urgent transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair is associated with worse in-hospital outcomes: a nationwide analysis [^111VJsaE]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Procedures and Outcomes

The median length of stay for all admissions was 2 days (IQR 1−4), with a majority of procedures conducted in large urban teaching hospitals. Notably, a higher proportion of urgent admissions were transferred to another hospital (21.2% vs. 6.1%, p < 0.001) (Table 2).

Table 2
Crude and weighted analysis for all outcomes.

The overall in‐hospital mortality rate for TEER admissions was 1.8%, with urgent admissions demonstrating a significantly higher in‐hospital mortality rate after IPTW adjustment (aRR 3.67, 95% CI 2.39–5.62) compared to non‐urgent admissions (Table 2, Table 3, and Figure 2). Similarly, patients admitted urgently were at a higher risk of developing cardiogenic shock (aRR 4.95, 95% CI 3.73−6.57), acute stroke (aRR 2.56, 95% CI 1.32−4.97), and compared to non‐urgent admissions, in‐hospital cardiac arrest (aRR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08−4.69) and major bleeding (aRR 5.18, 95% CI 2.97−9.06) were also more frequent among urgent admissions (Table 3 and Figure 2).

Table 3
Association between type of TEER procedure and outcomes.

Figure 2
(A) Adjusted proportions and (B) adjusted relative risks for primary and secondary outcomes according to urgent and non‐urgent groups. aRR = adjusted relative risk; CI = confidence interval.

Furthermore, the utilization of invasive procedures was more common among urgent‐TEER patients, including IABP (aRR 3.97, 95% CI 2.53−6.23), PVAD (aRR 17.24, 95% CI 6.37−46.66), and mechanical ventilation (aRR 3.79, 95% CI 2.80−5.11) (Figure 2). No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to renal replacement therapy and pericardial complications (Table 3 and Figure 2). Urgent admissions were associated with longer median length of stay (median 6 vs. 2 days, p < 0.001) and higher total costs (median $229 160 vs. $164 653, p < 0.01) compared to non‐urgent admissions (Table 2).

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^115wGVFC]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To identify an optimal imaging strategy for the accurate detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain.

Design Fully paired multicentre diagnostic accuracy study with prospective data collection.

Setting Emergency departments of two university hospitals and four large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands.

Participants 1021 patients with non-traumatic abdominal pain of > 2 hours' and < 5 days' duration. Exclusion criteria were discharge from the emergency department with no imaging considered warranted by the treating physician, pregnancy, and haemorrhagic shock.

Intervention All patients had plain radiographs (upright chest and supine abdominal), ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT) after clinical and laboratory examination. A panel of experienced physicians assigned a final diagnosis after six months and classified the condition as urgent or non-urgent.

Main outcome measures Sensitivity and specificity for urgent conditions, percentage of missed cases and false positives, and exposure to radiation for single imaging strategies, conditional imaging strategies (CT after initial ultrasonography), and strategies driven by body mass index and age or by location of pain.

Results 661 (65%) patients had a final diagnosis classified as urgent. The initial clinical diagnosis resulted in many false positive urgent diagnoses, which were significantly reduced after ultrasonography or CT. CT detected more urgent diagnoses than did ultrasonography: sensitivity was 89% (95% confidence interval 87% to 92%) for CT and 70% (67% to 74%) for ultrasonography (P < 0.001). A conditional strategy with CT only after negative or inconclusive ultrasonography yielded the highest sensitivity, missing only 6% of urgent cases. With this strategy, only 49% (46% to 52%) of patients would have CT. Alternative strategies guided by body mass index, age, or location of the pain would all result in a loss of sensitivity.

Conclusion Although CT is the most sensitive imaging investigation for detecting urgent conditions in patients with abdominal pain, using ultrasonography first and CT only in those with negative or inconclusive ultrasonography results in the best sensitivity and lowers exposure to radiation.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113djqS1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 22 — urgent exchange transfusion for acute bilirubin encephalopathy: An urgent exchange transfusion should be performed for infants with signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (examples include hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, high-pitched cry, or recurrent apnea), with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation. Case reports and case series suggest that an immediate exchange transfusion may prevent kernicterus in some infants already showing signs and that reducing the time the brain is exposed to high TSB concentration may also reduce the severity of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy if it develops; risks include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars. The benefit of avoiding kernicterus or reducing its severity among newborns with signs of intermediate or advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy probably exceed the risks and costs of exchange transfusion, though some parents have a strong preference to avoid blood products.

### Urgently listed lung transplant patients have outcomes similar to those of electively listed patients [^114yW6C3]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To (1) determine outcomes after urgent listing compared with elective listing for lung transplant and (2) compare in-hospital morbidity and mortality, survival, and allograft function in these 2 groups.

Methods

From January 2006 to September 2017, 201 patients were urgently and 1423 electively listed. Among urgently listed patients, 130 subsequently underwent primary lung transplant as did 995 electively listed patients. Competing-risks analysis for death and transplant after listing and weighted balancing score matching (76 pairs) were used to compare in-hospital morbidity and survival. Mixed-effect longitudinal modeling was used to compare allograft function to 8 years post-transplant.

Results

At 1 month, mortality was 26% in urgently listed patients, and 58% were transplanted. Risk factors for death included older age, higher bilirubin, and transfer from an outside hospital. At transplantation, urgently listed transplant patients were younger (53 ± 13 vs 55 ± 12 years), had more ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (32/25% vs 20/2.0%), more restrictive lung disease (95/73% vs 509/51%), and a higher lung allocation score (82 ± 13 vs 47 ± 17). In-hospital morbidity and mortality, time-related survival, and longitudinal allograft function were similar between matched groups.

Conclusions

Urgent listing more often than not leads to transplantation. Although urgently listed patients are sicker overall, after transplant their perioperative morbidity and mortality, overall survival, and allograft function are similar to those of electively listed patients. Appropriate patient selection and aggressive supportive care allow urgently listed lung transplant patients to achieve these similar post-transplant outcomes.

### Urgent vs. elective endoscopy for acute non-variceal upper-GI bleeding: an effectiveness study [^116kY9Wq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Urgent endoscopy in patients with acute upper-GI bleeding identifies many patients who may be safely treated without hospitalization. The aim of this multicenter trial was to determine whether urgent endoscopy effectively decreases health care resource utilization in a real-life setting where primary care providers determine the course of care.

Methods

Ninety-three outpatients with acute upper-GI bleeding were randomized to either urgent endoscopy (before hospitalization) or elective endoscopy after admission. The results of urgent endoscopy and a recommendation regarding patient disposition were provided to the attending physician. Medical outcomes and resource utilization were measured.

Results

The timing of endoscopy did not affect resource utilization or patient outcomes. Length of stay was similar (urgent endoscopy, OR 3.98 days: 95% CI[2.84, 5.11] vs. elective endoscopy, OR 3.26 days: 95% CI[2.32, 4.21], p = 0.45). The mean number of days in an intensive care unit was the same (1.2 days). The urgent endoscopy group had more high-risk endoscopic lesions (15 vs. 9; p = 0.031). Outpatient care was recommended for 19 patients (40%). Only 4 patients were discharged.

Conclusions

Urgent endoscopy did not reduce hospitalization or resource utilization because the results of early endoscopy did not impact the decision by attending physicians regarding admission. For early (triage) endoscopy to impact resource utilization, the results of endoscopy must change subsequent patient care.

### Placing emergency care on the global agenda [^116UvMtQ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Emergency care serves a key function within health care systems by providing an entry point to health care and by decreasing morbidity and mortality. Although primarily focused on evaluation and treatment for acute conditions, emergency care also serves as an important locus of provision for preventive care with regard to injuries and disease progression. Despite its important and increasing role, however, emergency care has been frequently overlooked in the discussion of health systems and delivery platforms, particularly in developing countries. Little research has been done in lower- and middle-income countries on the burden of disease reduction attributable to emergency care, whether through injury treatment and prevention, urgent and emergency treatment of acute conditions, or emergency treatment of complications from chronic conditions. There is a critical need for research documenting the role of emergency care services in reducing the global burden of disease. In addition to applying existing methodologies toward this aim, new methodologies should be developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions and how to effectively cover the costs of and demands for emergency care needs. These analyses could be used to emphasize the public health and clinical importance of emergency care within health systems as policymakers determine health and budgeting priorities in resource-limited settings.

### Data-driven identification of urgent surgical procedures for use in trauma outcomes measurement [^1132ENqC]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

No standardized list of urgent-trauma-surgery exists for analysis in injury studies. If coded by a standard classification system, such a list could facilitate the standard evaluation and comparison of trauma systems. Solving this problem using Delphi methods or expert opinion incorporating all surgical specialties would be resource-intensive. Instead, we describe a flexible data-driven method for generating a list of urgent surgical procedures from routine administrative data.

Methods

We linked perioperative and inpatient data for trauma patients with procedures booked within 24 hours of admission from a single Australian hospital (July 2018-July 2023). Surgical procedure codes were extracted where booked free-text and coded procedures matched. Procedures were labeled urgent-by-agreement if over 75% were needed within 4hours, or urgent-by-consensus if 50–75% met this time frame with consensus below 0.7. Our method also allows adjustment for urgency time frame.

Results

Of 567 unique procedures from 6,750 total in 4,737 trauma admissions, 161 were classified as urgent-by-agreement and 6 as urgent-by-consensus. 15 surgical specialties were represented on this list.

Discussion and Conclusions

Using routinely collected data, we outline a method for generating and updating urgent surgical procedure lists for trauma patients that could be applied at the institution level or across trauma networks. In addition, different urgency periods can be accommodated. Future work could look at further automating these processes by incorporating deep learning.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^113irrN3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Timing of upper endoscopy in overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding — the panel suggests that patients admitted or under observation in hospital with overt UGIB, whether predicted to be at low risk or high risk of further bleeding and death, undergo upper endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. A large randomized clinical trial comparing urgent endoscopy within 6 hours against 6–24 hours after consultation in 516 patients predicted to be at high risk based on GBS ≥ 12 found that neither further bleeding (28/258 [10.9%] vs 20/258 [7.8%]; difference = 3%, −2% to 8%) nor mortality (23/258 [8.9%] vs 17/258 [6.6%]; difference = 2%, −2% to 7%) was reduced, although endoscopic hemostatic treatment was 11.6% more frequent in the urgent group. Because of randomization lag, the study actually compared endoscopies at means of 10 and 14 hours after presentation, with 55% of the control group undergoing endoscopy within 12 hours, and it excluded patients with hypotensive shock who failed to stabilize after initial resuscitation, a group representing only 5% of the high-risk patients. Given these data, the panel did not include the suggestion from the 2012 ACG Guidelines that endoscopy within 12 hours "may be considered" in patients with high-risk clinical features.

### Differences in SARS-CoV-2 recommendations from major ophthalmology societies worldwide [^115BuGqf]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Urgent versus non-urgent care

Table 2 highlights examples of urgent and non-urgent procedures provided by each society.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations on urgent care for ophthalmologists during the COVID-19 pandemic per international ophthalmology society

For instance, RCOphth displays UK-based resources, like the Moorfields Eye Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, and emits its own guidelines on urgent and non-urgent care. It also states that all routine ophthalmic surgeries and face-to-face outpatient must be delayed, except if patients are at elevated risk of harm. Ophthalmology accident and emergency departments must remain open with appropriate support to ensure adequate patient triage and consultations.

AAO listed 53 suggestions of 'urgent' surgical procedures associated with indications. For example, ophthalmologists should perform brachytherapy for intraocular malignancy.COS, AIOS and JOS display this comprehensive list on their website but also published their own guidelines.

AIOS provided a list of twenty ophthalmic emergencies, which are very similar to AAO's. In addition to those emergencies, it provides a list of 11 complaints in order to rule out emergencies (ie, chemical/thermal/mechanical eye injury, acute red eye, photophobia and sudden halos/floaters/discharge/eyelid drooping).

While referring its members to AAO's resources, JOS has its own list examples regarding urgent treatment, notably retinal detachment, ocular trauma and retinoblastoma. The list has then been updated to include more examples of urgent care (ie, paediatric glaucoma, orbital fracture and bulging cataracts). Unlike the other societies that consider common adult cataract surgery as an elective treatment, JOS mentions that delaying cataract surgeries depend on each patient's circumstances.

### Randomized trial of urgent vs. elective colonoscopy in patients hospitalized with lower GI bleeding [^111Edg53]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine, in patients with serious hematochezia, the proportion who have an upper gastrointestinal (GI) source and whether urgent colonoscopy improves outcomes as compared with elective colonoscopy in those without an upper source.

Methods

Patients with hematochezia were eligible if they also had heart rate > 100, systolic blood pressure < 100, orthostatic change in heart rate or blood pressure > 20, hemoglobin drop ≥ 1.5 g/dl, or blood transfusion. Patients had upper endoscopy within 6 h. Those without an upper source were randomized to urgent (≤ 12 h) or elective (36–60 h after presentation) colonoscopy. The primary end point was further bleeding. Patients were followed for the duration of hospitalization.

Results

Eighty-five eligible patients had urgent upper endoscopy; 13 (15%) had an upper source. The remaining 72 were randomized to urgent (N = 36) or elective (N = 36) colonoscopy. Further bleeding occurred in 8 (22%) vs. 5 (14%) of the urgent vs. elective groups (difference = 8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -9 to 26%). Units of blood (1.5 vs. 0.7), hospital days (5.2 vs. 4.8), subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for bleeding (36% vs. 33%), and hospital charges ($27,590 vs. $26,633) also were not lower in the urgent group. A major limitation is that the study was terminated before reaching the prespecified sample size.

Conclusions

Patients with clinically serious hematochezia should have upper endoscopy initially to rule out an upper GI source. Use of urgent colonoscopy in a population hospitalized with serious lower GI bleeding showed no evidence of improving clinical outcomes or lowering costs as compared with routine elective colonoscopy.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^111Qwb2Q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 18. AV access steal — Prevention, monitoring, referral, and treatment are addressed as expert opinion. KDOQI considers it reasonable that strategies to both prevent and treat AV access steal should be developed and implemented before AV access creation to reduce risk and morbidity. After access creation, patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms, with mild to moderate signs and symptoms prompting closer monitoring for progression, while moderate to severe signs and symptoms often require urgent treatment to correct hemodynamic changes and prevent longer‑term disability. KDOQI considers it reasonable that patients with signs and symptoms consistent with AV access steal should be referred urgently to a surgeon/interventionist familiar with diagnosis and options for definitive treatment, and that the optimal treatment should be determined based on the patient's clinical presentation, local expertise, and resources.

### The influences of timing of urgent endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding: a cohort study [^113R2d78]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Most of the previous studies defined "urgent endoscopy" as within 12 h of admission. This study is one of the very few studies to compare the short-term outcomes in patients with AVB between urgent endoscopy (< 6 h) and early endoscopy (6–24 h) with a big sample size. Actually, it is difficult in many countries to perform urgent endoscopy within 6 h of admission. In the randomized controlled trial aiming to explore the timing of endoscopy for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, patients assigned to undergo endoscopy within 6 h were regarded as urgent-endoscopy group. However, in this urgent-endoscopy group, the time from presentation to gastroenterologic consultation was 7.4 ± 6.2 h; the time from gastroenterologic consultation to endoscopy was 2.5 ± 1.7 h; time from presentation to endoscopy was 9.9 ± 6.1 h. In the present study, this limitation was overcome. Commonly, gastroenterologic consultation in our center was conducted within 1–2 h.

It is essential to select appropriate outcomes in studies of endoscopy. Since the long-term prognosis of patients with AVB is mainly associated with their basal liver function, it is inappropriate to demonstrate the precise effect of a single-point endoscopy by a long-term prognosis. Therefore, the endpoints were set to be the composite outcomes at 6 weeks in this study.

This is the first study to report the bleeding time (the duration between the start of bleeding and endoscopy), which might be more precise and valuable than the timing to endoscopy (the duration between the hospital arrival and endoscopy). Furthermore, we found that the bleeding time within 12 h was independently related to low 6-week mortality, while the timing to endoscopy was not associated with 6-week mortality. The inconsistency might be explained that basic resuscitation and medical treatments immediately after bleeding, other than timing to endoscopy, played an important role in short-term outcomes of patients with AVB. Endoscopy is a relatively invasive treatment, compared with other medical treatments. If unnecessary urgent endoscopies are frequently performed, medical staff fatigue and medical costs may increase dramatically. Further researches are needed to explore the relationship between the bleeding time and short-term mortality of patients with AVB. This is also the first study to investigate the optimal timing to endoscopy in patients with AVB in the mainland of China. The main etiology of cirrhosis was HBV in our study, which was different from the baseline characteristics of the western countries, causing that the result of this study should be interpreted discreetly worldwide.

### Urgent care utilization in the pediatric medicaid population [^111WtQZH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess healthcare utilization patterns associated with high (≥ 3 visits/year) urgent care utilization.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of 2723792 children who were less than 19 years of age in the 2013 Marketscan Medicaid database. Healthcare utilization categorized as inpatient, emergency department, urgent care, well-child primary care provider (PCP), acute PCP, and specialist visits was documented for 4 groups. We hypothesized that children with high urgent care utilization would have decreased utilization at other sites of care. Multivariable logistic models compared the odds of high urgent care utilization.

Results

Of children in the study population, 92.0% had no urgent care visits; 4.7% had 1; 1.5% had 2; and 1.0% had ≥ 3. Patient attributes of high urgent care utilization were: ages 1–2 years (aOR = 2.32, 95% CI: 2.18–2.36, reference group: 13–18 years), presence of a complex chronic condition (CCC) (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.88–2.07, reference group: no CCC) and no CCC but ≥ 3 chronic conditions (aOR = 2.85, 95% CI: 2.73–2.97, reference group: no CCC, no chronic conditions). High urgent care utilization was associated with ≥ 5 PCP visits for acute care (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11–1.20, reference group: 0 visits), and ≥ 3 emergency department visits (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 2.10–2.23, reference group: 0 visits).

Conclusions

Increased urgent care utilization was associated with an increase in overall healthcare utilization. Even though those with higher urgent care utilization had more visits for acute care, patients continued to see their PCP for both well-child and acute care visits.

### Factors associated with urgent care reliance and outpatient health care use among children enrolled in medicaid [^114GaomP]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is high reliance on urgent care facilities by children associated with decreased use of other sites of outpatient health care?

Findings

In a cohort study of 4 133 238 children enrolled in Medicaid, 5% had high reliance on urgent care (defined as > 33% of all outpatient visits). High reliance on urgent care was seen more often in healthy, nonminority, school-aged children and was associated with lower health care use across other outpatient settings.

Meaning

Although urgent care facilities may serve to increase access for acute care needs, in certain populations high reliance on urgent care was associated with lower use of other outpatient care sites.

### Why Do people choose emergency and urgent care services? A rapid review utilizing a systematic literature search and narrative synthesis [^111unE91]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Most studies reported that patients' perceptions of access to and confidence in primary care was a key factor in low‐urgency ED attendances. Patient satisfaction with care is predictive of future healthcare choices 68 and when patients experience difficulties obtaining appointments or are unsatisfied with the care they receive from their PCP, this may impact on future health‐seeking behavior and choices. Past research shows that patients with an urgent healthcare problem are unwilling to wait more than 1 day for an appointment with their own physician. 69 Demand for unplanned services is rising and this has been shown to rise further when access to PCP care is reduced. 70 A systematic review of primary care factors that impact on unscheduled secondary care use showed that better primary care access led to reduced unscheduled care, 71 with increased access to primary care leading to a reduction in ED attendances. Many people also value the convenience of ED, not having to make an appointment, and access to specialist care if needed. Important drivers for ED use were identified using factor analysis by Ragin and colleagues 72 and five factors were identified as having good reliability. These included convenience, belief that the problem was serious/medical necessity, preference for hospital facilities, and individual patient factors related to cost of care and insurance. Capp and colleagues 73 examined in detail the impact of health insurance on ED usage and identified that lack of access to alternative care was a key driver for low‐acuity ED attendance. While Kangovi and colleagues 74 also identified patients of low socioeconomic status prefer hospital care over primary care because they view it as more convenient and accessible whilst also providing higher quality care for less cost. A study about ED closures by Hsia et al. 75 found that ED closures disproportionately affected vulnerable communities, for example, those without medical insurance, minority groups, or comorbidities. It may be that convenience and accessibility issues are more important to subgroups who already experience difficulties accessing care.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YqvAp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registration

This study was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA) checklist. The study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024597970). As this study is a systematic review, ethical approval and patient consent are not required.

Search strategy and inclusion criteria

We searched for articles related to the timing of endoscopy in variceal bleeding from the earliest available publication to January 31, 2024, in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase. The search strategy was developed using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms, including "esophageal and gastric varices[Mesh]", keywords included "bleeding" and "timing of treatment". The study population was restricted to humans, with no limitations on language, publication date, or publication status, resulting in 2681 articles being identified. Duplicates were removed using EndNote, leaving 2270 articles for further review. After reviewing all titles and abstracts, 2234 irrelevant articles were excluded, and the full texts of the remaining 36 articles were assessed. Case reports, abstracts, editorials, reviews, letters, meta-analyses, guidelines, conference proceedings, and clinical trials were excluded. Studies were also excluded if they did not meet the following criteria: (1) non-cirrhotic populations; (2) upper gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to cirrhosis; (3) studies not focused on the timing of endoscopy; (4) studies that did not report data on mortality or rebleeding in AVB patients. The complete search strategy is provided in Table S1.

Definitions and outcomes

Definition of urgent and early endoscopy: In each included study, the group that underwent endoscopy earlier was defined as the urgent endoscopy group, while the group that underwent endoscopy later was defined as the early endoscopy group. The definition of time to endoscopy was consistent with the definitions provided in each included study. Salvage treatment was defined as balloon tamponade, additional endoscopic therapy, and TIPS.

Being Advised to Attend ED by Family Friends or Healthcare Professionals

The views of family, friends, and healthcare professionals were important contributory factors in patient decision making to utilize ED services in 11 of the included studies. Six studies reported that patients attended ED due to recommendations or referrals from other health professionals 19, 38, 42, 54, 57, 60 and five studies identified that patients attended due to the views of family and friends, 38, 40, 42, 57, 61 with some studies describing both family and friends and healthcare professionals advice as an explanatory factor. One study found that 52% of patients attended the ED due to advice from a healthcare professional or friends and family. 38 A study by Hodgins and Wuest 40 identified views of family and friends as one of the highest ranking explanatory factors behind ED attendance and Lobachova et al. 57 found that while 35% of patients attended the ED due to being referred by other health professionals, 48% came due to advice from friends or family. The study by Penson et al. 19 described the most common reason for attendance being advice from others, but this was more usually advice from health professionals rather than family or friends. One study identified that females were more likely to attend ED due to the recommendations of others than males 61 and that the source of the advice was more likely to be family and friends.

Convenience in Terms of Location, Not Having to Make Appointment, and Opening Hours

The perceived convenience of emergency and urgent care services was a identified in 15 studies as a key driver in patient decision making, and this is also linked to negative views around inconvenient access to primary care. Access to primary care is often viewed as limited, due to more structured opening hours and perceptions around difficulty obtaining appointments, and there is a view that the ED is more convenient due to factors such as 24‐hour availability and not having to make an appointment. 38, 43, 49, 55, 62 In one study, 60% of patients viewed the ED as more convenient than their PCP 55 and several other studies reported that people chose to visit the ED for low‐urgency problems due to ED being closer or faster, 63 the accessibility of the ED, 43, 54 the convenience of the ED location, 42 or service. 40 Conversely, one study reported that patients attended the ED with primary care problems even though few people believed that they would be seen more quickly or that it was more convenient. 19

### Urgent start peritoneal dialysis: are we there yet? [^113LouNH]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

This large cohort study appears to confirm that urgent start PD is a safe and effective dialysis procedure. Limitations of this study included the single center, retrospective design and the lack of a control group such as planned PD. Whether the results can be generalized to Western populations or healthcare systems is unclear. As noted by the authors, in most rural areas of China, PD is the only dialysis modality available. Catheters were placed by nephrologists and not interventional radiologists or surgeons as in the US. The average body mass index of patients included in the study was 21.5 kg/m 2. Only 21.8% of patients had ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy – diabetic nephropathy was not associated with functional catheter problems or catheter failure, but it was associated with a 56% increase in risk of abdominal wall complications. Although this finding will need to be confirmed in other cohorts, it suggests that more abdominal wall complications may be seen in populations with higher rates of diabetic nephropathy after PD catheter placement by open laparotomy.

Increasing interest in urgent start PD and the recently proposed Medicare payment model are likely to lead to further growth in PD use in the US. Approximately 80% of patients used a catheter at HD initiation in 2016, and the majority of these patients did not have a maturing AV fistula. Using urgent start PD in appropriate patients who are interested in PD could reduce the risks and the costs associated with HD catheters – a 2014 study showed that urgent start PD was less costly than urgent start HD in the first 90 days of unplanned dialysis. Urgent start PD, however, requires dedicated infrastructure and effective protocols. An urgent start PD program would include, at a minimum, the following: objective methods for patient selection, processes for urgent PD catheter placement, hospital support to enable urgent PD initiation in the inpatient setting as needed, nursing support to manage intermittent PD in the outpatient setting, and dialysis unit administrative support to ensure appropriate resources. Establishment of such a program is not an easy task, but likely to have a significant impact on home dialysis as we strive to meet the recently announced goals. Urgent start PD programs would likely increase trainee exposure to PD, meeting an unmet and crucial need in nephrology education, at least in the US.

### Delivering urgent care using telemedicine: insights from experienced clinicians at academic medical centers [^113mcpAD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Participants and Setting

We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews of clinicians who provided direct-to-consumer, real-time ("synchronous") telemedicine as a substitute for in-person urgent care appointments at primary care practices or dedicated urgent care clinics ("tele-urgent care"). Tele-urgent care clinicians were purposefully interviewed because tele-urgent care has been commonly employed as a strategy to compete with surrounding urgent care and retail health clinics. During the study period, few primary or specialty care clinicians had adopted telemedicine due to restrictive payment policies at the state and federal levels.

Participants were recruited from academic medical centers between July 2018 and March 2019 using multiple approaches: direct emails, phone calls, and the email listserv for the American Telemedicine Association's Academic Medical Center Group. Snowballing techniques were used to identify clinicians who delivered tele-urgent care by asking participants if they knew of other academic medical centers delivering tele-urgent care. Eligible participants included physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants who provided tele-urgent care for either or both adult and pediatric patients. Participants were compensated $50 USD for their time.

Interview Guide Development

We created a semi-structured, open-ended interview guide (see appendix A) designed to identify barriers and facilitators to providing tele-urgent care. The guide was initially created by authors NL, AKA, and KC. The interview guide was reviewed and pilot tested with two colleagues specializing in qualitative research. It was revised based on this feedback. It was then pilot tested with the first two participants. Pilot testing did not identify any significant content issues, so the guide was not revised any further. Questions were open-ended and included follow-up probes to allow for participants to expand upon answers as needed. Questions included "What do you think are the limitations of providing care via telemedicine?"; "Describe your experience of providing care through telemedicine".; "What do you imagine are the skills necessary to be a good telemedicine provider?"; and "Describe what you think is different about telemedicine versus in-person care". Demographic data, including age, gender, race, specialty, occupation, and years in clinical practice were collected from study participants at the completion of each interview.

WD must be excluded in any patient with unexplained liver disease associated with neurological or psychiatric disorder; assessment by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders may be advantageous, and psychiatric evaluation is essential for any patient with WD presenting with psychiatric or neuropsychiatric features of WD. WD should be suspected in any patient presenting with ALF with immune hemolytic anemia including intravascular hemolysis, and these patients require urgent evaluation for liver transplantation. At clinical presentation, WD may involve organ systems besides the liver and nervous system (such as renal, musculoskeletal, cardiac, or endocrine).

Acute coronary syndromes — coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative management of oral P2Y12 inhibitors specifies interruption intervals and postoperative resumption. For clopidogrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For prasugrel, elective CABG: interrupt for 7 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. For ticagrelor, elective CABG: interrupt for 3–5 d before surgery; for urgent CABG: interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24–72 hours).

### Improving access for urgent patients in paediatric neurology [^116C8vqn]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Strategy

PDSA cycle 1: To test whether the new triage system is usable and that it identifies urgent patients correctly.

Plan: all paediatric neurologists were educated about the new triage system which identifies patients as urgent or routine, referring inappropriate patients to other services.

Do: One consultant started to apply the new triage system and recorded how long it took to triage all patients.

Study: the new triage system identified 90% of all urgent patients from the first week and 100% of urgent patients after it was used by all consultants for three weeks. The new triage system did not affect the time it took to triage patients.

Act: The new triage system was built into the routine review of all referrals by the consultants participating in the urgent patient project.

PDSA cycle 2:

To test whether applying the new referral triage and utilising urgent clinic slots will reduce patient waiting time.

Plan: patients identified by the triage system were to be given urgent appointments in the clinic within 2 weeks; the team also applied flexible management by enabling booking into all cancelled and unused clinic slots.

Study: the percentage of patients seen within 2 weeks improved to 60% which met our aim.

Act: we tested this change on two clinics and the results were consistent.

PDSA cycle 3:

To test whether double notification of appointments will increase the percentage of urgent patients seen within 2 weeks.

Plan: neurology nurses were appraised on arranging appointments for urgent referrals and to notify patients in addition to patients receiving a routine notification of their appointment from the call centre.

Do: Once appointments have been made via the referral centre, neurology nurses will contact the family and ask whether they would be able to come or whether they wish for the appointment to be re-arranged. They will also confirm with them the date and time and who will be seeing them.

Study: the percentage of patients seen in clinic within 2 weeks from triage increased to 80% across three neurology clinics.

Act: This change was tested across four clinics after success in two clinics.

### Which low urgent triaged febrile children are suitable for a fast track? An observational European study [^114uCLfH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a secondary analysis of the Management and Outcome of Fever in children in Europe (MOFICHE) study, which is embedded in the Personalised Risk assessment in Febrile illness to Optimise Real-life Management across the European Union project. The MOFICHE study is an observational multicentre study assessing management and outcome of febrile children using routinely collected data of 12 EDs in 8 European countries (Austria, Germany, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands n = 3, Slovenia, Spain, the UK n = 3). The hospital characteristics are described in previous studies.

Study population and setting

Children up to 18 years with fever (temperature ≥ 38℃) measured at the ED or a history of fever within 3 days before the ED visit were included in the MOFICHE study. For this secondary analysis, we included the nine EDs who use the MTS for allocating triage urgency levels to patients, namely EDs in Austria, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands (n = 2), Spain, and the UK (n = 3). Subsequently, from these EDs we included children who were triaged as low urgent (those assigned a triage acuity of either 'standard' or 'non-urgent' using the MTS) since we hypothesise that a proportion of these children are suitable for assessment in a fast track. Children with known comorbidities and with missing data on disposition were excluded.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and public were not involved in the design and conduct of the study.

Triage urgency level

The MTS consists of 52 flow charts based on the patients' presenting problem such as abdominal pain. The most appropriate flow chart is chosen by triage nurses to prioritise patients on clinical urgency. Each flow chart consists of specific discriminators and categorises patients in one of the five triage categories, which are linked to a maximum waiting time for doctors' assessment. The five MTS urgency categories are: immediate (maximum waiting time 0 min), very urgent (maximum waiting time 10 min), urgent (maximum waiting time 60 min), standard (maximum waiting time 120 min), non-urgent (maximum waiting time 240 min). For this study, we used predefined three-category triage levels consisting of the categories 'high urgent', 'intermediate urgent' and 'low urgent'. The MTS categories very urgent and immediate were classified as high urgent, urgent was classified as intermediate urgent and patients allocated to standard or non-urgent were classified as low urgent.

### Understanding factors impacting global priority of emergency care: a qualitative policy analysis [^116JbnMD]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Main results

Problem definition

Core concepts of emergency care

The emergency care community broadly agrees on what constitutes a medical emergency, sometimes referred to as a 'true emergency'. Most highlight the acuity of the condition, the need for specific time–sensitive interventions to prevent morbidity or mortality (interviews 1, 2, 6, 11, 12, 22, 24). However, the scope of emergency care outside of these 'true medical emergencies' is an area of ongoing debate. Proponents for the specialty of emergency medicine highlight the need for a defined scope of practice that commands respect from peer specialties:

… when you define emergency medicine, you don't define just what it is. You also define what it is not, and nobody takes the steps to define what it is not (interview 16).

These experts argue that incorporating service areas such as public health and preventative care compromises the prestige of the specialty. However, some argue that emergency medical care should evolve to fill whatever gaps exist in the health system:

… we would be doing a disservice to the field if we think of emergency care only as the true emergencies because again, in terms of access, that is the only option for a lot of patients (interview 21).

Some key informants believe that emergency care is a set of building blocks that a health system arranges to match their healthcare needs (interviews 3, 9, 15, 24). But,

… there is still no agreement on what people define as the core or the essentials of emergency care (interview 24).

As the global culture moves forward into the 21st century with increasing interaction of populations through direct contact and electronic interchange, those citizens of our planet who have not benefited from the material gains that have been realized in the "mature economy" countries will increasingly seek equity on all levels, beginning with the most fundamental aspect of health care. There is a need to develop a capacity for treatment of urgent and emergent health conditions globally, a need that will only increase with advancing global economic development.

### Effect of intravenous contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis on detection of urgent and non-urgent pathology: can repeat CT within 72 hours be avoided? [^113QejP2]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine if administering IV contrast for CT abdomen and pelvis improves detection of urgent and clinically important non-urgent pathology in patients with urgent clinical symptoms compared to patients not receiving IV contrast, and in turn to determine whether repeat CT exams on the same patient within 72 h were of low diagnostic benefit if the first CT was performed with IV contrast.

Methods

We evaluated 400 consecutive patients who had CT abdomen and pelvis (CT AP) examinations repeated within 72 h. For each patient, demographic data, reason for examination, examination time stamps, and examination technique were documented. CT AP radiology reports were reviewed and both urgent and non-urgent pathology was extracted.

Results

Of 400 patients, 63% had their initial CT AP without contrast. Administration of IV contrast for the first CT AP was associated with increased detection of urgent findings compared with non-contrast CT (p = 0.004) and a contrast-enhanced CT AP following an initial non-contrast CT AP examination better characterized both urgent (p = 0.002) and non-urgent findings (p < 0.001). Adherence to ACR appropriateness criteria for IV contrast administration was associated with increased detection of urgent pathology on the first CT (p = 0.02), and the second CT was more likely to be performed with IV contrast if recommended by the radiologist reading the first CT (p = 0.0006).

Conclusion

In the absence of contraindications, encouraging urgent care physicians to preferentially order IV contrast-enhanced CT AP examinations in adherence with ACR appropriateness criteria may increase detection of urgent pathology and avoid short-term repeat CT AP.

### Geriatric screening, triage urgency, and 30-day mortality in older emergency department patients [^111yM24d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Within the APOP study, 2,629 individual ED patients, aged 70 years or older, were included in four hospitals. We excluded 21 patients with an incomplete APOP screening, resulting in 2,608 patients included in the analyses (Supplementary Figure S1).

In the total study population, the median age was 79 (IQR = 74‐84) years, and 1,227 (47.0%) patients were male (Table 1). In total, 710 (27.2%) patients were assigned as standard, 1,525 (58.5%) patients were assigned as urgent, and 373 (14.3%) patients were assigned as very urgent. Half of all patients arrived by ambulance, with an increasing percentage with increasing urgency levels: standard (28.2%), urgent (55.7%), and very urgent (75.1%). The most common chief complaint was minor trauma in the standard category (46.3%), while in the very urgent category the most common complaint was chest pain (31.9%). The presence of polypharmacy increased with increasing urgency levels: standard (53.1%), urgent (59.0%), and very urgent (64.1%). In total, 521 (20.0%) patients were high risk according to the APOP screener, which showed an increase with increasing urgency levels: standard (13.7%), urgent (22.3%), and very urgent (22.5%).

### Urgent surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma: a Study of the national cancer database [^1156PACv]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastric adenocarcinoma is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and, in the United States, can present emergently with upper GI hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation. No large studies have examined how urgent surgery affects patient outcomes. This study examines the outcomes of urgent versus elective surgery for gastric cancer.

Materials and Methods

Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma from the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2015 were examined retrospectively. Patients with metastatic disease or incomplete data were excluded. Urgent surgery was defined as definitive surgery within 3 d of diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient factors, surgical outcomes, and oncologic data was performed. P-values < 0.05 were statistically significant.

Results

Of 26,116 total patients, 2964 had urgent surgery and 23,468 had elective surgery. Urgent surgery patients were significantly older, were female, were nonwhite, had higher pathologic stage, and were treated at a low-volume center. Urgent surgery was associated with decreased quality lymph node harvest (odds ratio [OR] 0.68 95% confidence interval {CI} [0.62, 0.74]), increased positive surgical margin (OR 1.48, 95% CI [1.32, 1.65]), increased 30-d mortality (OR 1.38, 95% CI [1.16, 1.65]), increased 90-d mortality (OR 1.30, 95% CI [1.14, 1.49]), and decreased overall survival (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% CI [1.15, 1.27]).

Conclusions

Urgent surgery for gastric cancer is associated with significantly worse outcomes than elective surgery. Stable patients requiring urgent surgical resection for gastric cancer may benefit from referral to a high-volume center for resection by an experienced surgeon. Patients undergoing urgent resection for gastric cancer should be referred to surgical and medical oncologists to ensure they receive appropriate adjuvant therapy and surveillance.

### The management of antithrombotic agents for patients undergoing GI endoscopy [^116UzNdh]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Urgent and emergent endoscopic procedures — patients receiving anticoagulant therapy: In acute bleeding, We recommend patients with acute GI bleeding on anticoagulation therapy have anticoagulant agents held to facilitate achievement of hemostasis. For life-threatening bleeding on warfarin, We recommend either (1) 4-factor PCC and vitamin K or (2) fresh frozen plasma be given for life-threatening GI bleeding in patients on warfarin anticoagulant therapy. Regarding timing, We suggest endoscopic therapy not be delayed in patients with serious GI bleeding and an INR < 2.5. After hemostasis for high-risk stigmata, We suggest patients who require anticoagulation receive UFH because of its relatively short half-life after successful endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata.

### Safety of urgent endarterectomy in acute non-disabling stroke patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis: an international multicenter study [^116CQwkB]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

International recommendations advocate that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) should be performed within 2 weeks from the index event in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (sCAS) patients. However, there are controversial data regarding the safety of CEA performed during the first 2 days of ictus. The aim of this international, multicenter study was to prospectively evaluate the safety of urgent (0–2 days) in comparison to early (3–14 days) CEA in patients with sCAS.

Methods

Consecutive patients with non-disabling (modified Rankin Scale scores ≤ 2) acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack due to sCAS (≥ 70%) underwent urgent or early CEA at five tertiary-care stroke centers during a 6-year period. The primary outcome events included stroke, myocardial infarction or death during the 30-day follow-up period.

Results

A total of 311 patients with sCAS underwent urgent (n = 63) or early (n = 248) CEA. The two groups did not differ in baseline characteristics with the exception of crescendo transient ischaemic attacks (21% in urgent vs. 7% in early CEA; P = 0.001). The 30-day rates of stroke did not differ (P = 0.333) between patients with urgent (7.9%; 95% confidence interval 3.1%-17.7%) and early (4.4%; 95% confidence interval 2.4%-7.9%) CEA. The mortality and myocardial infarction rates were similar between the two groups. The median length of hospitalization was shorter in urgent CEA [6 days (interquartile range 4–6) vs. 10 days (interquartile range 7–14); P < 0.001].

Conclusions

Our findings highlight that urgent CEA performed within 2 days from the index event is related to a non-significant increase in the risk of peri-procedural stroke. The safety of urgent CEA requires further evaluation in larger datasets.

### Urgent lung allocation system in the scandiatransplant countries [^111rsKH1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Throughout the world, the scarcity of donor organs makes optimal allocation systems necessary. In the Scandiatransplant countries, organs for lung transplantation are allocated nationally. To ensure shorter wait time for critically ill patients, the Scandiatransplant urgent lung allocation system (ScULAS) was introduced in 2009, giving supranational priority to patients considered urgent. There were no pre-defined criteria for listing a patient as urgent, but each center was granted only 3 urgent calls per year. This study aims to explore the characteristics and outcome of patients listed as urgent, assess changes associated with the implementation of ScULAS, and describe how the system was utilized by the member centers.

Methods

All patients listed for lung transplantation at the 5 Scandiatransplant centers 5 years before and after implementation of ScULAS were included.

Results

After implementation, 8.3% of all listed patients received urgent status, of whom 81% were transplanted within 4 weeks. Patients listed as urgent were younger, more commonly had suppurative lung disease, and were more often on life support compared with patients without urgent status. For patients listed as urgent, post-transplant graft survival was inferior at 30 and 90 days. Although there were no pre-defined criteria for urgent listing, the system was not utilized at its maximum.

Conclusions

ScULAS rapidly allocated organs to patients considered urgent. These patients were younger and more often had suppurative lung disease. Patients with urgent status had inferior short-term outcome, plausibly due to the higher proportion on life support before transplantation.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^114veQsV]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Endoscopy best practices — timing and triage in acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) are outlined as follows: Endoscopy should generally be performed within 12 hours for emergent cases, within 24 hours for urgent cases, and can wait more than 24 hours for elective cases. In a randomized trial of high-risk upper gastrointestinal bleeding defined by Glasgow-Blatchford score ≥ 12, patients were assigned to urgent (within 6 hours) or early (the next morning and within 24 hours) endoscopy after consultation occurring on average 7–8 hours after presentation; urgent endoscopy was not associated with lower 30-day mortality than endoscopy performed the following morning between 6 and 24 hours after consultation. In general, patients with acute nonvariceal bleeding and Glasgow-Blatchford score of 0–1 may be discharged from the emergency department for timely outpatient management.

### Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients on anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet agents [^117CKyan]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants and urgent endoscopy

Both the ESGE and the ASGE guidelines strongly recommend temporary interruption of anticoagulant therapy in all patients who present with clinically significant acute GI bleeding. In the setting of VKA-based therapy, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should be based on the clinical assessment of the severity of bleeding at presentation. Evidence to support different strategies for the correction of coagulopathy is lacking, and this may potentially explain the large variation in practice among endoscopists. The updated ESGE guidelines on upper GI bleeding have endorsed the 2008 recommendation by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to administer prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or fresh frozen plasma, if PCC is unavailable, in addition to intravenous vitamin K in patients with serious, life-threatening bleeding (i.e. patients presenting with persistent or intermittent hemodynamic instability), in the case of either therapeutic or supratherapeutic elevations of the international normalized ratio (INR). For patients who are not actively bleeding and are hemodynamically stable, intravenous vitamin K administration may be an option.

### Telemedicine at a university ophthalmology practice during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic [^1172ZQeQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urgent telemedicine visits were completed for 17 patients who also had in-office follow-up. Seven (41.2%), 9 (52.9%), and 1 (5.9%) of these patients improved, remained stable, and worsened, respectively. Eighty-eight non-urgent patients also had in-person follow-ups, of which 29 (33.0%) improved, 51 (58.0%) remained stable, and 8 (9.0%) worsened. There was no significant difference in progression of disease stage or symptoms between urgent and non-urgent patients (p > 0.05).

Figure 2 presents the chief complaints, ocular history, ocular procedural history, and management for all telemedicine visits. These were compared based on patient type (new vs established), degree of urgency, and whether or not the patient followed up in person. Established patients typically utilized telemedicine for routine visits (74.9%). However, most of these established patients (81.2%) were not subsequently seen in person for follow-up throughout the duration of the study. Ocular history differed significantly between established vs new patients (p < 0.05), patients with follow-up vs those without (p < 0.05), and urgent vs non-urgent patients, respectively (p < 0.05). However, none of these groups differed in ocular surgical history (p > 0.05). All patient groups, including established vs new, follow-up vs not, and urgent vs non-urgent differed significantly in their chief complaints (p > 0.05). Finally, established vs new patients (p < 0.05) and urgent vs non-urgent patients (p < 0.05) had significantly different management, while patients with follow-up and those without did not (p > 0.05).

### Association of medicaid expansion with emergency department visits by medical urgency [^116Cy9jD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is Medicaid eligibility expansion associated with changes in emergency department (ED) visits based on the medical urgency of the conditions?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 80.6 million ED visits across 4 US states, ED visits per 1000 population decreased for states that expanded Medicaid compared with states that did not. This decrease was associated with decreases in ED visits for less-emergent or nonemergent conditions.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that expanding Medicaid might reduce ED visits for conditions that could be treated in outpatient settings.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ftewQ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis found that endoscopy performed within 6 h might be associated with higher mortality, but it did not show a significant impact on rebleeding. Furthermore, urgent and early endoscopy did not significantly affect other outcomes in AVB patients. While RCTs offer the potential to minimize bias and provide high-quality, comparable data, their implementation is challenging due to ethical considerations. Therefore, crafted and large-scale prospective studies are needed to further validate the impact of endoscopy timing on the prognosis of AVB patients. In the interim, we recommend that the timing for endoscopy would be more appropriate based on each patient's condition within 24 h.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZYnjd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Child-Pugh score and MELD score are widely used to assess the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Among the studies included in our analysis, 3 performed risk stratification based on the severity of liver disease (as measured by MELD or Child-Pugh score) at admission. Huh et al. found that in patients with a MELD score ≤ 17, urgent endoscopy was associated with higher mortality and rebleeding. Zhang et al. reported that in Child-Pugh B patients, urgent endoscopy could lead to a higher incidence of rebleeding. However, the study by Peng et al. which defined endoscopy timing as the interval between admission and endoscopy, found no significant correlation between endoscopy timing and mortality or rebleeding at different Child-Pugh scores. We extracted Child-Pugh and MELD scores for the urgent and early endoscopy groups from the included studies. Subgroup analyses combined all studies reporting these risk factors and revealed no significant correlation between the time to endoscopy and the severity of liver disease. As more than 5 studies identified the severity of liver disease at admission as an independent risk factor for the primary outcomes, we performed meta-regression analysis on studies reporting Child-Pugh scores or MELD scores for the urgent and early endoscopy groups with their mortality and rebleeding. These analyses suggested that only Child-Pugh scores was significantly associated with the risk of overall mortality. We synthesized the available data, but due to the limited number of studies providing this specific information and inconsistencies in data reporting formats, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution.

### Association of medicaid expansion with emergency department visits by medical urgency [^111gEjcp]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Emergency departments (EDs) are a vital component of the US health care system, with more than 140 million visits in 2018 incurring a total cost of approximately $75 billion. Emergency department visits are expected to increase even further in the years ahead, by a projected 12% by 2030. Although EDs treat patients with acute and unexpected health care conditions, they often serve as a safety net for individuals who are unable to access other health care settings. The use of EDs for nonemergent and preventable medical conditions has been a long-standing challenge in the US health care system. Every year, it is estimated that one-third of all ED visits occur for care that is treatable in primary care settings and preventable. At an average cost that is many times higher compared with treatment provided at a physician's office or an urgent care center, some of these visits suggest inefficient allocation of resources and present a cost-saving opportunity.

Limited or lack of insurance coverage is a key factor for many ED visits. Uninsured individuals often use the ED as a place to receive routine health care services and are also more likely to experience a health care crisis requiring emergent care owing to the lack of access to outpatient health services and preventive care. Social determinants of health among low-income beneficiaries that perpetuate difficulties in receiving routine health care services could also result in increased ED use for similar reasons.

The expansion of Medicaid eligibility afforded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) presented a unique opportunity to address this challenge by providing millions of US residents with health insurance coverage that could improve access to routine health care and preventive services. Since 2014, 35 US states have adopted the Medicaid eligibility expansion option, resulting in health insurance uptake for more than 20 million US residents. Larger gains in enrollment were documented in states that decided to expand Medicaid eligibility to adults less than age 65 years with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The implementation of the Medicaid expansion has also been associated with increased use of preventive services, access to primary care clinicians, affordability, and quality of care.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145F3wF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopy is a critical tool in the management of acute variceal bleeding (AVB). However, the optimal timing for its implementation remains controversial, with varying recommendations across different clinical guidelines. This study aims to evaluating the impact of endoscopy timing on patient outcomes.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched from the earliest available publication to January 31, 2024. Both fixed-effect and random-effect models were employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), based on the levels of heterogeneity. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of each included studies. The mortality, incidence of rebleeding and other secondary outcomes were compared between urgent and early endoscopy groups. Subgroup analysis was performed based on the endoscopy time defined in each included studies and the reporting time of primary outcomes. The publication bias was examined through Egger's test and Begg's test.

Results

Our analysis showed no significant difference in overall mortality (OR = 0.99, 95% CI, 0.60–1.62, P = 0.96) and rebleeding (OR = 1.06, 95% CI, 0.77–1.47, P = 0.71) as well as secondary outcomes between the two groups. Subgroup analysis indicated that the mortality in the 6–24 h endoscopy group was significantly lower than in the < 6 h endoscopy group (OR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.29–3.26, P = 0.002). However, no statistical difference between the other groups.

Conclusion

Endoscopy performed within 6 h might be associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, urgent and early endoscopy did not significantly affect other outcomes in AVB patients. Therefore, the timing for endoscopy would be more appropriate based on each patient's condition within 24 h.

### Improving access for urgent patients in paediatric neurology [^114SUz6K]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Referral and flow management is an important part of outpatient care; some patients require to be seen earlier than the next available appointment because of the nature of their presentation. We did not have a clear pathway for urgent patients being referred to our pediatric neurology service. When we reviewed this process in our Quality Improvement meeting we identified wide variation in the length of time such patients wait to be seen in clinic ranging from 2 to 11 weeks. Only 25% of patients identified as requiring urgent clinic appointments were seen in clinic within 2 weeks of triage. A new triage system was designed to identify urgent patients consistently. Three PDSA cycles tested change ideas: the first cycle tested introducing an urgent triage system, the second cycle tested giving urgent appointments directly from the triage decision utilising clinic cancellations and the third PDSA tested double notification of appointments for all urgent patients using the call centre and the neurology specialist nurses. After the third PDSA the percentage of patients seen within 2 weeks of triage increased from 25% to 80%. This change was tested across one clinic initially then tested across two more clinics. Our balancing measure, the third available routine appointment, remained stable indicating that improving access to emergency patients did not affect the waiting time for routine appointments. With good management of triage it is possible to improve access for urgent patients to be seen in clinic without impact on availability of routine appointments, resulting in better quality of care and patient satisfaction. Earlier appointments also improve clinic attendance rates.

### Duration and urgency of transfer in births planned at home and in freestanding midwifery units in england: secondary analysis of the birthplace national prospective cohort study [^116ivy4h]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Urgency and transfer duration

Using our classification of urgency, 668 transfers before birth from home and 642 from FMUs were for potentially urgent reasons; 884 transfers before birth from home and 687 from FMUs were classified as non-urgent. In both settings the overall transfer time was shorter for women transferred before birth for potentially urgent reasons compared with women transferred before birth for non-urgent reasons (home median 42 vs 50 minutes, p < 0.001; FMU median 50 vs 60 minutes, p < 0.001) (Table 3). The shorter transfer times for transfers from home were such that women transferred from home for non-urgent reasons had the same transfer time as women transferred from an FMU for potentially urgent reasons (Table 3 and Figure 1).

Figure 1
Overall transfer time by urgency in transfers before birth from home and FMUs.

For women transferred before birth for potentially urgent reasons the median time from their first assessment in the OU to giving birth was just over 90 minutes in both settings (Table 3).

Transfers after birth for postpartum haemorrhage are also potentially urgent. In these transfers (141 from home and 90 from FMUs) the median overall transfer time was 54 minutes from planned home births and 60 minutes from FMUs (Table 3).

Urgency and outcomes

In women transferred before birth for potentially urgent reasons from home, 13.4% had an instrumental birth and 2.8% a caesarean within 60 minutes of the start of OU care; similar proportions transferred before birth from FMUs for potentially urgent reasons had an instrumental birth (15.7%) or caesarean (3.0%) within 60 minutes of the start of OU care (Table 4, with further detail including comparable data for AMUs in Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Instrumental or caesarean birth within 60 minutes of the start of OU care was much less common in women transferred for non-urgent reasons (Home: instrumental 1.0%, caesarean 0.2%; FMU: instrumental 0.6%, caesarean 0.4%).

### Timing of endoscopy for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114geXK9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding was published by James Y W Lau and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and Variceal hemorrhage. In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the trial question was: what is the role of urgent endoscopy in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are at high risk for further bleeding or death? In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the population was: 516 patients (191 female, 325 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with overt signs of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a Glasgow-Blatchford score ≥ 12. The key exclusion criteria were continued shock despite initial volume resuscitation, age < 18 years, unable to provide written informed consent, pregnant or lactating women, moribund from terminal illnesses. In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the interventions were: n = 258 urgent-endoscopy (endoscopy within 6 hours of gastroenterology consultation) n = 258 early-endoscopy (endoscopy between 6 and 24 hours after gastroenterology consultation). In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause at 30 days (8.9% vs. 6.6%; HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.54). In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of further bleeding within 30 days (10.9% vs. 7.8%; HR 1.46, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.58) No significant difference in ICU admission (1.6% vs. 1.2%; HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.3 to 5.9) Significant increase in endoscopic hemostatic treatment during initial endoscopy (60.1% vs. 48.4%; HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.46). In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in persistent bleeding, recurrent bleeding, fatal and nonfatal adverse events. significant difference in ulcers with active bleeding or visible vessels (66.4% vs. 47.8%). In the Timing of endoscopy for acute upper GI bleeding study, the conclusion was: in patients with overt signs of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a Glasgow-Blatchford score ≥ 12, urgent-endoscopy was not superior to early-endoscopy with respect to death from any cause at 30 days.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^116BmY3F]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver's normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. While physical examination findings may be suggestive, it is recommended to stratify risk for all using the FIB-4 followed by elastography for at-risk patients. After identifying patients with cirrhosis, optimal care may involve referral to a hepatologist, liver cancer screening, and consideration of endoscopy for varices screening and/or initiation of nonselective β-blockers. BMI indicates body mass index.

Treatment of hemorrhage: vasoactive medications Octreotide: associated with hemostasis at 5 d in 77% compared with 58% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials Terlipressin: associated with hemostasis at 5 d in 65% compared with 46% with placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized trials. If nosocomial SBP: in a randomized trial of 32 patients, compared with ceftazidime, meropenem and daptomycin increased SBP resolution but not 90-d survival Terlipressin, 0. 85 mg, IV every 6 h. Does my patient need a liver biopsy to diagnose cirrhosis. No. Cirrhosis can be accurately diagnosed using sequential noninvasive testing such as the fibrosis-4 index followed by a liver stiffness measurement obtained by elastography.

Because liver stiffness measurements are also prognostic, they can be used, for example, to determine which patients need endoscopy to screen for esophageal varices. Therefore, diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for all hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites. 53, 76 Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as kidney injury in the presence of large-volume ascites if there is a 50%, or 0. 3 mg/dL, or greater increase in serum creatinine within 7 days from the last measure that does not respond to 2 days of intravenous fluids to establish normal intravascular volume. 53.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis… [^11126bsm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that guideline recommendations for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be reassessed and that higher quality randomized clinical trial data are needed. Importance International guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the evidence for this recommendation has not been reassessed recently. Objective To determine whether current evidence continues to support the recommended 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Data Sources Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics.

Study Selection Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Observational and pediatric studies, gray literature, comparisons of systemic antibiotics, studies not reporting mortality or early rebleed, and studies of nonsystemic antibiotics were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes. Results. The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants, of whom 1202 had a variceal source of bleeding. Study quality was low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events.

Two RCTs compared longer to shorter durations and 12 RCTs compared any prophylaxis to none. Shorter durations had a 97. 3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^112hNsBz]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

23 Physicians should inquire about prior upper GI bleeding, history of coagulopathy, and use of antithrombotics, NSAIDs, or SSRIs. To assess the risk of cirrhosis and variceal bleeding, physicians should inquire about prior liver disease, viral hepatitis, and alcohol use. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Treatments ENDOSCOPY Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy after fluid resuscitation and stabilization. 30 The majority of efficacy data on endoscopic therapy is from trials including individuals who have peptic ulcer bleeding. The recommended endoscopic methods for peptic ulcer bleeding include injection of epinephrine, injection of other sclerosants, bipolar electrocoagulation probes, heater probes, or endoclips.

3 Endoscopic injection of epinephrine should not be used as monotherapy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding because it has higher rates of failure than epinephrine injection combined with another modality.
31. PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS Proton pump inhibitors should be started upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. 33 Initiation of a proton pump inhibitor should not be delayed before endoscopy. Oral proton pump inhibitors may be preferred over intravenous ones because of cost savings when used in conjunction with endoscopic treatment. 34 A 2017 meta-analysis of nine RCTs showed no difference between oral and intravenous proton pump inhibitors in recurrent bleeding, surgery, or mortality. 34 Guidelines recommend high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the first 72 hours post-endoscopy because this is when rebleeding risk is highest.

5 After 72 hours of high-dose therapy, patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions should receive twice-daily proton pump inhibitors through day 14, whereas those with low-risk lesions require only once-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy. 5 One RCT of 156 individuals analyzed immediate reintroduction of aspirin with proton pump inhibitors post-endoscopy and found that patients who did not resume aspirin had an increase in all-cause mortality at eight weeks. 3 When to resume dual antiplatelet therapy is challenging because these patients often have acute coronary syndrome or recent coronary stent placement.
