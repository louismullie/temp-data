## Question

Patient having fatty blood

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "fatty blood", which most plausibly reflects hypertriglyceridemia, including how to define it, classify severity, evaluate causes, and manage it step-by-step. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "fatty blood" means in clinical terms and how to confirm it with appropriate testing. Then, I should classify severity and map that to immediate risks and treatment goals. Next, I will evaluate secondary causes and genetic contributors. After that, I will outline lifestyle therapy, pharmacologic options by severity, and special populations such as pregnancy and pancreatitis. Finally, I should set a monitoring plan and reconcile any apparent contradictions in guideline recommendations, especially around omega-3s and statins in different contexts.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity behind "fatty blood". In practice, this almost always corresponds to hypertriglyceridemia, often with lipemic serum when triglycerides are very high, and it reflects increased concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL and chylomicrons in plasma, which can be measured with a standard fasting lipid panel and visually appreciated as lipemia when markedly elevated [^1141uCqq] [^1153mx68].

> Wait, let me verify the testing conditions because nonfasting samples can mislead. I initially thought a 12-hour fast was mandatory, but hold on, I should double-check guideline nuances. The Endocrine Society suggests a 12-hour fast for diagnosis and stability, yet many contemporary programs accept nonfasting non-HDL-C and reflex to fasting profiles when abnormal; practically, I should confirm that a fasting triglyceride was obtained before labeling hypertriglyceridemia, and if the sample is lipemic or the value is extreme, repeat fasting to ensure accuracy and to guide therapy [^113DDQXj] [^1141uCqq] [^111EgeAH].

> Next, I should review severity thresholds and their clinical implications. Moderate hypertriglyceridemia is typically 150–499 mg/dL and carries increased ASCVD risk via triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, whereas severe hypertriglyceridemia at ≥ 500 mg/dL raises concern for pancreatitis, and extreme levels ≥ 1000 mg/dL are usually chylomicronemic and confer high short-term pancreatitis risk; I need to ensure I classify the patient correctly because this drives urgency and drug choices [^111GKHKd] [^1153mx68].

> I will now examine secondary causes because management hinges on identifying and reversing them. Common contributors include obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, excessive alcohol, high refined carbohydrate or fructose intake, and medications such as estrogens, corticosteroids, retinoids, and some antiretrovirals; I should screen for these systematically and correct them before escalating pharmacotherapy, as addressing them can substantially lower triglycerides [^116YNxfY] [^1153mx68] [^111AU7b3].

> But wait, what if triglycerides remain severely elevated despite optimal secondary management. I should consider genetic disorders such as familial chylomicronemia syndrome due to LPL, APOC3, or APOA5 defects, especially with recurrent pancreatitis or a history of lipemia retinalis or eruptive xanthomas; in such cases, specialized therapies like APOC3 inhibition may be indicated, and I need to refer to lipid specialists for evaluation and family screening [^115Girp4] [^1153mx68].

> Let me think about lifestyle therapy, since it is foundational at all triglyceride levels. I should confirm that the patient is on a diet that replaces refined carbohydrates and added sugars with unsaturated fats, limits total fat to 10–15% of calories temporarily when TG are ≥ 1000 mg/dL, avoids alcohol completely, and engages in at least 30–60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity most days; weight loss of 5–10% can lower triglycerides by 20–30%, and substituting saturated fats with polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats improves the lipoprotein pattern [^1157m6mj] [^115Afu2w] [^113ick6q].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic indications by severity so I do not over- or undertreat. For moderate hypertriglyceridemia, prioritize lifestyle and secondary cause correction; if ASCVD risk is borderline or intermediate and LDL-C is not at goal, add statin therapy, and consider icosapent ethyl if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL on statin with additional risk enhancers, recognizing that some guidelines discourage adding EPA+DHA broadly in mixed hypertriglyceridemia due to LDL-C effects, so I must individualize based on LDL trajectory and net benefit [^1141uCqq] [^114boZg9] [^1137e2e1].

> For severe hypertriglyceridemia, I need to ensure pancreatitis prevention. I should initiate a fibrate as first-line to reduce triglycerides by 30–50%, add high-dose omega-3 fatty acids, and maintain very low-fat intake; if triglycerides remain ≥ 1000 mg/dL despite these measures, I should consider intensifying therapy or adding agents such as niacin cautiously, balancing efficacy and side effects, and monitor closely for hepatotoxicity and myopathy [^113VoWBc] [^114JW9Hb] [^111AU7b3].

> In extreme hypertriglyceridemia with acute pancreatitis or persistent TG > 1000 mg/dL despite initial therapy, I should confirm that insulin is used when diabetic to enhance LPL activity, and I should not delay plasmapheresis in life-threatening pancreatitis or when triglycerides continue to rise despite maximal medical therapy; I need to coordinate with a lipid specialist and critical care early in this scenario [^111AU7b3].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I should confirm that statins are avoided in pregnancy and that management is nonpharmacologic with strict dietary fat restriction; if acute fatty liver of pregnancy is suspected, I must apply Swansea criteria, obtain urgent obstetric-hepatology co-management, and proceed to delivery once coagulopathy and metabolic derangements are stabilized, with consideration of plasmapheresis postpartum in severe hepatic impairment and screening of the neonate for fatty acid oxidation defects [^1141uCqq] [^111QqXKz] [^114jXPJZ] [^111R3d91] [^112r2rRS].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will recheck a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, assess liver enzymes and creatine kinase if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity or myopathy, and counsel on adherence and alcohol abstinence; if omega-3s are used with anticoagulants or antiplatelets, I should monitor for bleeding, acknowledging that clinically significant bleeding is uncommon but possible [^115yKp7s] [^114xqpux].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a potential contradiction about omega-3s in mixed hypertriglyceridemia. Initially, I thought to add EPA+DHA broadly for triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL on statin, but hold on, I should verify the LDL effect. DHA can raise LDL-C by about 7–10 mg/dL more than EPA, so in patients with concomitant LDL-C elevation, pure EPA or careful selection of omega-3 preparation and close monitoring of LDL-C is prudent; this reconciles the AACE 2025 caution against routine EPA+DHA addition with the diabetes guideline's conditional EPA recommendation in high-risk patients with persistent triglycerides on statin [^notfound] [^114boZg9] [^1137e2e1].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal risk reduction beyond triglyceride lowering. Once triglycerides are < 500 mg/dL, I should optimize LDL-C and non-HDL-C with statins as indicated, continue lifestyle therapy indefinitely, and maintain vigilance for secondary causes that can re-escalate triglycerides; I should also remember that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants contribute to residual ASCVD risk even when LDL-C is at goal, reinforcing the importance of comprehensive lipid management and risk factor control [^1141uCqq] [^111GiwjW].

"Fatty blood" refers to **lipemia**, a milky appearance of plasma or serum due to markedly elevated triglycerides (TGs) [^112anW1F], typically ≥ 1,000 mg/dL, and often ≥ 2,000 mg/dL. It reflects chylomicronemia from impaired lipoprotein lipase function or clearance [^112TW1vB], and **increases pancreatitis risk** [^1141uCqq]. Confirm with a fasting lipid panel [^113DDQXj], rule out secondary causes (diabetes, alcohol, medications) [^116YNxfY], and treat with a very low-fat diet, weight loss, and omega-3s [^114JW9Hb]; use fibrates or niacin if TG ≥ 500 mg/dL [^111AU7b3], and consider plasmapheresis for TG > 1,000 mg/dL with pancreatitis or symptoms [^111AU7b3].

---

## Clinical significance of fatty blood

- **Definition**: Lipemia is a visible milkiness from high TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) [^notfound].

- **Thresholds**: TG ≥ 1,000 mg/dL is high pancreatitis risk; ≥ 2,000 mg/dL is very high risk [^112anW1F].

- **Risks**: Acute pancreatitis, cardiovascular disease, and organ dysfunction [^111GiwjW].

---

## Causes of fatty blood

Primary causes include **familial chylomicronemia syndrome** (LPL, APOC3, APOA5 defects) [^115Girp4] and **familial combined hyperlipidemia** (polygenic dyslipidemia) [^1153mx68]. Secondary causes include uncontrolled diabetes, obesity/metabolic syndrome, chronic alcohol use, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and medications such as estrogens, corticosteroids, retinoids, protease inhibitors, and atypical antipsychotics [^1153mx68].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Fasting lipid panel**: Confirm TG elevation and assess other lipids [^113DDQXj].

- **Secondary causes**: Screen for diabetes, hypothyroidism, renal disease, alcohol use, and medications [^116YNxfY].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider for suspected familial syndromes [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound for pancreatitis or organ involvement [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Major risk at TG ≥ 1,000 mg/dL; higher risk at ≥ 2,000 mg/dL [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased ASCVD risk from remnant lipoproteins [^111GiwjW].

- **Organ dysfunction**: Hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, neurologic symptoms [^1153mx68].

---

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include a **very low-fat diet** (< 10–15% of calories) with avoidance of refined carbs and alcohol [^1157m6mj]. Weight loss of 5–10% lowers TG substantially [^notfound], and regular aerobic activity improves clearance [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: EPA/DHA 2–4 g/day lowers TG by 20–50% [^notfound].

- **Fibrates**: First-line for TG ≥ 500 mg/dL; reduce TG by 30–50% [^113VoWBc].

- **Niacin**: Alternative when fibrates/omega-3s are contraindicated or insufficient [^113VoWBc].

- **Statins**: For mixed dyslipidemia and ASCVD risk reduction [^114JW9Hb].

- **Plasmapheresis**: For TG > 1,000 mg/dL with pancreatitis or severe symptoms [^111AU7b3].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis depends on adherence and control of secondary causes; **recurrence is common** without sustained lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy [^1153mx68].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education should emphasize **dietary adherence** to a low-fat, low-carb pattern with alcohol abstinence [^1157m6mj]. Counsel on weight management and regular physical activity, and reinforce medication adherence and follow-up for lipid monitoring and complication prevention [^111vkyyP].

---

"Fatty blood" reflects severe hypertriglyceridemia with high pancreatitis risk; confirm with fasting lipids, treat with diet, weight loss, and omega-3s, escalate to fibrates or niacin if needed, and use plasmapheresis for severe cases with symptoms.

### "The city of hepar": rituals, gastronomy, and politics at the origins of the modern names for the liver [^113yTosm]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Medical etymology sometimes provides unexpected information about health concepts and medical practice in different times and cultures. We conducted an etymological analysis of the terms used to indicate "liver" in Germanic and Romance languages. The Greek word "hèpar" was originally connected to the concept of "pleasure", showing that in antiquity the liver was considered to be the seat of soul and human feelings. In Romance languages, the Latin term "ficatum" was linked to the ancient practice of fattening geese with figs (ficus in Latin) to make their livers more delicious. This relationship between the liver, fat, and carbohydrates seems to indicate that ancient gourmets had clear knowledge of the nutritional mechanisms underlying "fatty liver" in animals. On the other hand, the Germanic term "lifere" was initially connected to "life", underscoring the relation of the liver to health and existence. In the Early Modern Age, the liver became a recurring image in political reflection, especially within the Elizabethan tradition of the body politic, where the king was frequently described as the "liver" of his country. Finally, the liver was used to indicate courage, or the lack of it: some modern French and English idiomatic expressions derive from the ancient belief that people who had no blood in their liver ("lily-livered") would thus be cowards or betrayers.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosis — blood tests and enzyme patterns are described as follows: Hepatosteatosis typically results in elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) with normal bilirubin. Increase in ALT is sometimes described as more specific for NAFLD, and an AST:ALT ratio of > 1.5 may be more consistent with alcoholic liver disease; AST > ALT is associated with more advanced hepatic fibrosis. The AST-to-platelet ratio is also sometimes used to evaluate NAFLD. Notably, some reports suggest that 25% of NAFLD patients and 19% of NASH patients have normal AST blood levels.

5.9 Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

Treatment-emergent cases of moderate or severe essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) (defined as the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio > 0.2 and > 0.4, respectively) were not observed in pediatric clinical trials of SMOFlipid up to 28 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

However, cases of EFAD have been reported in adult and pediatric patients in the postmarketing period with the use of SMOFlipid. The median time to onset was greater than 28 days among cases that reported time to onset.

Monitor patients for laboratory evidence (e.g., abnormal fatty acid levels) and clinical symptoms of EFAD (e.g., skin manifestations, poor growth). Laboratory testing using the triene to tetraene ratio may not be adequate to diagnose EFAD, and assessment of individual fatty acid levels may be needed. Ensure patients are receiving recommended dosages of SMOFlipid to prevent EFAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Description (11)].

5.10 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], fluid and electrolyte status, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, coagulation parameters, and complete blood count including platelets.

The lipids contained in SMOFlipid may interfere with some laboratory blood tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if blood is sampled before lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these blood tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion.

SMOFlipid contains vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Although omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements reduce blood pressure (BP), the typical doses cause untoward side effects. A novel fatty acid supplement was tested in a randomized trial of patients with high normal diastolic BP. The novel fatty acid supplement did not significantly reduce BP in patients with high normal diastolic blood pressure.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: clinical role for alternative intravenous fat emulsions [^111mrF7A]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Fatty acids classification and inflammatory pathways — introduction/background: Fatty acids (FAs) are categorized by chain length as 2–4 carbons for short-chain FA, 6–12 carbons for medium-chain FA, and ≥ 14 carbons for long-chain FA; saturated FAs have no double bonds, monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) have 1 double bond, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) have 2 or more double bonds. Unsaturated FAs include 3 principal families — ω-3, ω-6, and ω-9 — with the first double bond at the third, sixth, or ninth carbon, respectively; the ω-6 and ω-3 FAs are metabolized through 2 different pathways but use the same enzymes with a preference of ω-3 > ω-6 > ω-9. Clinically, ω-3 FAs are relatively less proinflammatory than ω-6 FAs and some ω-3 FAs may actually have anti-inflammatory effects; more of one FA than another in the diet can drive production toward proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory metabolites, and some evidence suggests certain long-chain FAs may impair immune function via effects on phagocytosis and chemotaxis, increasing infection risk.

Plasma transport of fatty acids and triglycerides — most circulating non-esterified fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin, while triglycerides circulate in amphiphilic lipoproteins. After a fat-load meal, about 80% of the rise in triglyceride levels is due to intestinally derived apoB-48-containing chylomicrons, whereas about 80% of the rise in lipoprotein particle concentration is due to apoB-100-containing VLDL particles.

### 2017 george lyman duff memorial lecture: fat in the blood, fat in the artery, fat in the heart: triglyceride in physiology and disease [^1175tmpf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2018). Low credibility.

Cholesterol is not the only lipid that causes heart disease. Triglyceride supplies the heart and skeletal muscles with highly efficient fuel and allows for the storage of excess calories in adipose tissue. Failure to transport, acquire, and use triglyceride leads to energy deficiency and even death. However, overabundance of triglyceride can damage and impair tissues. Circulating lipoprotein-associated triglycerides are lipolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase. We inhibited these enzymes and showed that LpL inhibition reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by > 50%, and hepatic triglyceride lipase inhibition shifts low-density lipoprotein to larger, more buoyant particles. Genetic variations that reduce LpL activity correlate with increased cardiovascular risk. In contrast, macrophage LpL deficiency reduces macrophage function and atherosclerosis. Therefore, muscle and macrophage LpL have opposite effects on atherosclerosis. With models of atherosclerosis regression that we used to study diabetes mellitus, we are now examining whether triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or their hydrolysis by LpL affect the biology of established plaques. Following our focus on triglyceride metabolism led us to show that heart-specific LpL hydrolysis of triglyceride allows optimal supply of fatty acids to the heart. In contrast, cardiomyocyte LpL overexpression and excess lipid uptake cause lipotoxic heart failure. We are now studying whether interrupting pathways for lipid uptake might prevent or treat some forms of heart failure.

Causes of elevated triglycerides — pathophysiology notes that triglycerides are the most dense form of calories and serve as an important source of energy; dietary triglycerides are assembled in the gut into chylomicrons; and their interaction with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells leads to liberation of free fatty acids from triglyceride, and free fatty acids are able to traverse cell membranes.

### Triglycerides and heart disease: still a hypothesis? [^113PkHGZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the basic and clinical science relating plasma triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. Although many aspects of the basic physiology of triglyceride production, its plasma transport, and its tissue uptake have been known for several decades, the relationship of plasma triglyceride levels to vascular disease is uncertain. Are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, their influence on high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein, or the underlying diseases that lead to defects in triglyceride metabolism the culprit? Animal models have failed to confirm that anything other than early fatty lesions can be produced by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Metabolic products of triglyceride metabolism can be toxic to arterial cells; however, these studies are primarily in vitro. Correlative studies of fasting and postprandial triglycerides and genetic diseases implicate very-low-density lipoprotein and their remnants and chylomicron remnants in atherosclerosis development, but the concomitant alterations in other lipoproteins and other risk factors obscure any conclusions about direct relationships between disease and triglycerides. Genes that regulate triglyceride levels also correlate with vascular disease. Human intervention trials, however, have lacked an appropriately defined population and have produced outcomes without definitive conclusions. The time is more than ripe for new and creative approaches to understanding the relationship of triglycerides and heart disease.

### Early diagnostic test for acute fatty liver of pregnancy: a retrospective case control study [^111V9751]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis is important to lower the mortality rate of acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP). The Swansea criteria is commonly used to diagnose AFLP, but some terms could only be reached when symptoms and signs have progressed, or are not efficient in clinical practice. Therefore, it is necessary to select cost effective tests to simplify and facilitate early suspicion of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of 28,800 medical records at the Second Xiangya Hospital from 2009 to 2015, including 41 patients with AFLP and 172 other diseases that could show similar symptoms to AFLP. The evaluated variables included past history of liver diseases, blood pressure, gastrointestinal symptoms, blood count, liver function test, coagulation function test and blood sugar test. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predict value and negative predict value were calculated for models in diagnosing AFLP.

Results

The significant variables associated with AFLP included gastrointestinal symptoms, blood pressure > 140/90mmHg, aminotransferase > 42IU/l, total bilirubin > 0.8mg/dl, total bilirubin acid > 10.0μmol/L, activated partial prothrombin time(APTT) > 34s, prothrombin time(PT) > 14s, white blood cells > 11×10⁶ /l and blood sugar < 72mg/dl. Gastrointestinal symptoms +aminotransferase +bilirubin +bile acid +APTT/PT showed 97.6% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity to diagnose AFLP. Adding blood pressure, blood sugar or white blood cells decreased the accuracy of the statistical model.

Conclusions

Application of a statistical model including maternal symptoms, biochemical and haematological parameters has high diagnostic accuracy for earlier identification of AFLP. However, this finding needs to be tested in another cohort to determine whether this statistical model has the same performance.

Persistent chylomicronemia — terminology and threshold considerations: The term persistent should not be interpreted literally because occasional decreases in triglyceride levels below the chylomicronemia threshold of 1000 mg/dL do not exclude PC, and in genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome the Balance trial showed TG levels ranging from 334 to 6898 mg/dL; therefore, the appropriate cut point for defining PC is unclear.

### Fatty acid profiles in demented patients: identification of hexacosanoic acid (C26: 0) as a blood lipid biomarker of dementia [^112QcqRH]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Several lipid metabolism alterations have been described in the brain and plasma of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, suggesting a relation between lipid metabolism alteration and dementia.

Objective

We attempted to identify blood fatty acids as biomarkers of dementia.

Methods

Fatty acid profiles were established using gas chromatography with or without mass spectrometry on matched plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) of demented patients diagnosed with AD, vascular dementia, or other dementia, and compared with a control group of elderly individuals. The severity of dementia was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination test.

Results

Fatty acid analysis showed significant variations of fatty acid levels in demented patients including AD patients. The highest plasma and RBC accumulation was found with hexacosanoic acid (C26:0). Our data also support that alterations of desaturase and elongase activities may contribute to cognitive dysfunction.

Conclusion

The variations of fatty acid levels and the accumulation of C26:0 in the plasma and RBCs highlight an alteration of fatty acid metabolism in demented patients and point toward possible peroxisomal dysfunction. It is suggested that C26:0 may constitute a convenient blood biomarker of dementia that could be useful in routine medical practice.

### ASPEN lipid injectable emulsion safety recommendations part 2: neonate and pediatric considerations [^111DJ6fN]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Overview of ILE essential fatty acid composition — For PN-dependent patients, one of the original purposes for ILE was the provision of essential fatty acids (EFAs), which are those that cannot be synthesized in the body but are required from dietary sources. In addition to serving as a dense source of nonprotein energy, EFAs provide substrate for cell membranes and serve as precursors to substances known as eicosanoids that influence immune responses, contribute to pain perception, regulate cell growth, and modulate blood flow. The two major families of EFAs are the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, and EFAs draw from the same enzymatic pool to desaturate and elongate parent fatty acids to their biologically active downstream moieties.

The authors have developed a "para-midline" approach to the posterior lumbar spine using a virtually avascular surgical plane not previously described in the literature. It was their purpose to document consistent MRI presence of this plane and to prospectively evaluate its clinical use in terms of blood loss.

Methods

Fifty consecutive patients undergoing primary lumbar surgery on 1–3 levels were prospectively enrolled from September 2014 to May 2015. The para-midline approach was used in all cases. The deep lumbar fascia is longitudinally incised on either side of the spinous processes instead of directly in the midline, which reveals the para-midline fatty plane. Blood loss during the approach and overall blood loss were recorded for all patients. MRIs from each patient were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist to determine the presence of the para-midline fatty plane.

Results

There was no recorded blood loss during the approach for all procedures. The average overall blood loss was 60 cc (20–200 cc). No patient required a transfusion intraoperatively or postoperatively. The fatty para-midline plane was noted on preoperative MRI at all operated levels in all patients. The average width of this plane was 6.5 mm (2–17 mm).

Conclusions

The para-midline approach for lumbar surgery is associated with less blood loss than traditional, subperiosteal exposure techniques. The fatty interval through which this approach is made is universally present and identifiable on MRI. The authors offer this approach as a means of decreasing the risks associated with blood loss and transfusion with posterior lumbar surgery.

### Can dietary changes reduce blood pressure in the long term? [^111Xkg5j]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent dietary guidelines for the prevention and treatment of hypertension emphasized a healthy eating pattern called the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, in addition to avoidance of obesity, high salt intake, and excessive alcohol intake. Our new challenge is to examine the long-term efficacy and effectiveness of dietary change, including the DASH diet, on blood pressure in the general population, or in a high-risk population. We reviewed recent short-term and long-term studies, both observational and interventional, which investigated whether dietary change can reduce blood pressure.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of several nutrients has been investigated in short-term trials (e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids, and trans fatty acids), but no substantial effect of these nutrients on blood pressure has been proved, except for dietary fiber. The PREMIER trial showed the effectiveness of implementing the DASH diet for 6 months in addition to the established recommendations on lifestyle modification, but other long-term trials of dietary modification did not show sufficient blood pressure reduction. However, long-term observational studies have shown that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables and a lower intake of red meat (except fish) can prevent higher blood pressure increase with age.

Summary

More effective programs of dietary modification are needed to achieve greater reduction of blood pressure. Long-term studies of population-wide dietary interventions to decrease the blood pressure level of a whole population are also needed.

5.8 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

Routine Monitoring

Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure.

Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters.

The lipids contained in Omegaven may interfere with the results of some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if the blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion.

Omegaven contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Essential Fatty Acids

Monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) is recommended. Laboratory tests are available to determine serum fatty acids levels. Reference values should be consulted to help determine adequacy of essential fatty acid status. Increasing essential fatty acid intake (enterally or parenterally) is effective in treating and preventing EFAD.

### Low blood levels of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in US hemodialysis patients: clinical implications [^113Z4SBH]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardioprotective and other clinical benefits of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are inversely related to dietary intake and hence blood content. We therefore investigated, in the first study of its kind, the blood content and distribution of these fatty acids in a large representative population of US hemodialysis patients.

Methods

Frozen sera were obtained from 400 individuals who were part of a large, contemporary, representative cohort of US incident hemodialysis patients. Long-chain n-3 PUFA were measured in total serum lipids and in the neutral and polar serum fractions using gas chromatography and solid phase extraction techniques. Mean long-chain n-3 PUFA levels were compared to levels in other dialysis and nondialysis populations from published reports.

Results

The study population was qualitatively similar to the overall US hemodialysis population in terms of major clinical characteristics. Long-chain n-3 PUFA were present in the serum polar fraction, with essentially none being detected in the neutral fraction (p < 0.0001 for polar vs. neutral fractions for all three long-chain n-3 PUFA). Mean serum long-chain n-3 PUFA levels (weight percent (± SD): total 1.55 ± 0.95, polar 3.99 ± 1.45) were low compared to nondialysis and most other non-US hemodialysis cohorts.

Conclusions

While US hemodialysis patients have a blood distribution of long-chain n-3 PUFA that is similar to that in the general population, blood content is among the lowest recorded in the medical literature. This has implications for renal dietary recommendations and makes US patients an ideal group for testing the clinical effects of long-chain n-3 PUFA supplementation.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders. Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although this has not been studied in clinical trials. For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis.

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes and prognostic factors in acute fatty liver of pregnancy [^114nRbxp]. European Journal of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute fatty liver of pregnancy:

- **Definition**: AFLP is a rare, potentially life-threatening liver disorder that affects pregnant women in the third trimester.
- **Pathophysiology**: AFLP is associated with defects in fatty acid oxidation secondary to various enzymatic deficiencies, leading to microvesicular fatty infiltration of the liver.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AFLP in Canada is estimated at 8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include defects in fatty acid oxidation, particularly long-chain 3-acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, and pre-existing metabolic or hepatic disorders. Other risk factors include obesity, male fetus, nulliparity, multiple gestation, and preeclampsia.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, AFLP can present with a range of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. In severe cases, it can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and multiorgan failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis largely depends on early diagnosis and prompt delivery. Prompt delivery is recommended, especially in cases of elevated lactate levels and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Prospective study of liver dysfunction in pregnancy in southwest wales [^111QqXKz]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Swansea criteria for acute fatty liver of pregnancy" for acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

The Swansea Criteria is a clinical scoring system used for the diagnosis of Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP). This condition is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy, typically occurring in the third trimester or early postpartum period. The Swansea Criteria is used to identify patients who may have AFLP based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

The criteria include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, polydipsia, and polyuria, as well as laboratory findings like elevated bilirubin, hypoglycemia, increased transaminases, leukocytosis, and coagulopathy. The presence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasound without other clear cause is also a part of the criteria.

The clinical utility of the Swansea Criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of AFLP, which can be challenging due to its rarity and the nonspecific nature of its symptoms. Early recognition and management of AFLP is crucial to prevent maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Swansea Criteria, but it should be noted that it is not definitive; a negative result does not rule out AFLP, and a positive result should be confirmed with further diagnostic testing

The Swansea criteria for diagnosing acute fatty liver of pregnancy are evaluated through a series of clinical and laboratory indicators. Each indicator, or input, is binary (true/false), representing the presence or absence of specific symptoms or test results.

The inputs considered are: nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, polydipsia/polyuria, encephalopathy, bilirubin > 0.8 mg/dL [> 14 mcmol/L], blood glucose < 72 mg/dL [4 mmol/L], uric acid > 5.7 mg/dL [> 340 mcmol/L], white blood cells > 11×10⁶/L, transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase) > 42 IU/L, ammonia > 27.5 mg/dL [> 47 mcmol/L], creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL [> 150 mcmol/L], coagulopathy (prothrombin time > 14 sec or activated partial thromboplastin time > 34 sec), ascites or bright-appearing liver on ultrasound, and microvesicular steatosis on liver biopsy.

Each positive indicator contributes a score of 1. The total score is calculated by summing the scores of all positive indicators.

Here is a table summarizing the input indicators and their contribution to the score:

| **Indicator** | **Score contribution** |
|-|-|
| Nausea/vomiting | 1 |
| Abdominal pain | 1 |
| Polydipsia/polyuria | 1 |
| Encephalopathy | 1 |
| Bilirubin > 0.8 mg/dL [> 14 mcmol/L] | 1 |
| Blood glucose < 72 mg/dL [4 mmol/L] | 1 |
| Uric acid > 5.7 mg/dL [> 340 mcmol/L] | 1 |
| White blood cells > 11×10⁶/L | 1 |
| Transaminases > 42 IU/L | 1 |
| Ammonia > 27.5 mg/dL [> 47 mcmol/L] | 1 |
| Creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL [> 150 mcmol/L] | 1 |
| Coagulopathy | 1 |
| Ascites or bright-appearing liver | 1 |
| Microvesicular steatosis on biopsy | 1 |

The score ranges from 0 to 14. The interpretation of the score is as follows:

- If the total score is 6 or greater, the interpretation is "Diagnostic criteria are met" for acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
- If the total score is less than 6, the interpretation is "Diagnostic criteria are not met".

### Relation between blood and atrial fatty acids in patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery [^1123ypvy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Studies relating cardiovascular outcomes to dietary or blood measures of various fatty acids rely on the implicit assumptions that dietary change results in changes in blood fatty acids that, in turn, alter cardiac fatty acids. Although dietary intakes of n-3 (omega-3), n-6 (omega-6), and trans fatty acids are reflected in their concentrations in blood, there are few human data on the relation between blood and cardiac concentrations of fatty acids.

Objective

The objective was to explore relations between blood and myocardial n-3, n-6, trans, monosaturated, and saturated fatty acids over a range of community intakes to evaluate whether blood fatty acids are useful surrogate markers of their cardiac counterparts.

Design

Patients undergoing on-pump coronary bypass surgery were recruited. Right atrial appendages and blood were collected at surgery for fatty acid analysis.

Results

Atrial appendages and matching blood samples were collected from 61 patients. Highly significant correlations were identified between atrial and erythrocyte or plasma n-3 [eg, eicosapentaenoic acid (erythrocytes: r = 0.93, P < 0.0001; plasma: r = 0.87, P < 0.0001)], some n-6 [eg, arachidonic acid (erythrocytes: r = 0.45, P = 0.0003; plasma: r = 0.39, P = 0.002)], trans [eg, total trans 18:1 (erythrocytes: r = 0.89, P < 0.0001; plasma: r = 0.74, P < 0.0001)], and monounsaturated [eg, oleic acid (erythrocytes: r = 0.37, P = 0.003)] fatty acids. There were no statistical associations between blood and cardiac saturated fatty acids.

Conclusion

Erythrocyte- and plasma phospholipid-derived fatty acids can be used to estimate cardiac fatty acid status in humans.

### Olive oil and soybean oil (clinolipid) [^11312M3w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency

In pediatric trials, EFAD was defined by calculating the Holman index (the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio; T:T ratio > 0.4). One patient treated with CLINOLIPID became at risk for EFAD (T:T ratio > 0.2) after 14 days of treatment. No cases of biochemical EFAD and no cases of clinical EFAD were observed; however, the median treatment duration in three of the four pediatric trials was 15 days or less. There are insufficient data to determine whether CLINOLIPID can supply adequate amounts of essential fatty acids in patients who may need treatment for more than 15 days.

Monitor patients for laboratory evidence (e.g., abnormal fatty acid levels) and clinical symptoms of EFAD (e.g., skin manifestations, poor growth). Laboratory testing using the triene to tetraene ratio may not be adequate to diagnose EFAD, and assessment of individual fatty acid levels may be needed. Ensure patients are receiving recommended dosages of CLINOLIPID to prevent EFAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Description (11)].

5.10 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

Routine Monitoring

Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure.

Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)], fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters.

The lipids contained in CLINOLIPID may interfere with the results of some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if the blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion.

CLINOLIPID 20% contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Ticlopidine hydrochloride [^1154HjNS]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

How Ticlopidine Hydrochloride Tablets Work:

Stroke Patients: A stroke occurs when a clot (or thrombus) forms in a blood vessel in the brain or forms in another part of the body and breaks off, then travels to the brain (an embolus). In both cases the blood supply to part of the brain is blocked and that part of the brain is damaged. Ticlopidine hydrochloride tablets work by making the blood less likely to clot, although not so much less that it causes you to become likely to bleed, unless you have a bleeding disorder or some injury (such as a bleeding ulcer of the stomach or intestine) that is especially likely to bleed.

Stent Patients: A heart attack or angina (chest pain) can occur when fatty deposits block the arteries that carry oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your heart. To decrease the chance of fatty deposits building up over time, your doctor may recommend the placement of a coronary stent. Ticlopidine hydrochloride tablets may be given to you with aspirin to make blood clots less likely to form inside the stent so that the artery remains open.

Who Should Not Take Ticlopidine Hydrochloride Tablets? Contact your doctor immediately and do not take ticlopidine hydrochloride tablets if:

you have an allergic reaction to ticlopidine hydrochloride tablets
you have a blood disorder or a serious bleeding problem, such as a bleeding stomach ulcer
you have previously been told you had TTP or aplastic anemia
you have severe liver disease or other liver problems
you are pregnant or you are planning to become pregnant
you are breast-feeding

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^115Girp4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome — medical management: The only US FDA-approved treatment for adults with FCS at the time of publication is an APOC3 inhibitor, olezarsen. Plozasiran, a first-in-class investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic designed to reduce production of APOC3, is currently in clinical trials and in January 2025 received a new drug application acceptance by the FDA for the same indication. Volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense therapeutic oligonucleotide that targets the messenger RNA for APOC3, is approved by the European Medicines Agency for FCS; however, blood platelets need to be monitored closely for concerns of thrombocytopenia. Medications known to worsen hypertriglyceridemia in patients should be carefully assessed for benefit-to-risk ratio, and lipoprotein profiles should be monitored closely. For women with FCS, any estrogen and estrogen-like medications should be avoided.

### Use of a whole blood rapid panel test for heart-type fatty acid-binding protein in patients with acute chest pain: comparison with rapid troponin T and myoglobin tests [^114Ggitv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine the clinical utility of a newly developed qualitative test to measure heart-type fatty acid-binding protein levels in blood for the early identification of myocardial infarction.

Methods

We measured heart-type fatty acid-binding protein levels in 371 consecutive patients with acute chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction, and compared the performance of this test with those of troponin T and myoglobin tests. Levels of heart-type fatty acid-binding protein ≥ 6.2 ng/mL were considered as positive results.

Results

A final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made in 181 patients (49%). Of the 68 patients who presented within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms, 37 (54%) had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The sensitivity of the rapid heart-type fatty acid-binding protein test was 89% (33/37), significantly higher than for troponin T (22% [8/37]; P < 0.001) and myoglobin (38% [14/37]; P < 0.001). However, the specificity of troponin T (94% [29/31]) was significantly better than for heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (52% [16/31]; P = 0.002) within 2 hours. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for heart-type fatty acid-binding protein levels was greater than that for myoglobin (0.72 vs. 0.61, P = 0.01) among patients who presented within 2 hours.

Conclusion

A novel whole blood rapid heart-type fatty acid-binding protein test can be useful in the early evaluation of patients who present with acute chest pain.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Afu2w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Management of hypertriglyceridemia — We recommend lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Dietary evidence notes a quantitative linear relation between replacement of dietary carbohydrate with fat and reduction in serum triglycerides, and saturated, monounsaturated, and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids all lower serum triglycerides when they replace carbohydrate, with no clear difference between fatty acid classes in this action. It is recommended that reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, whether composed mainly of high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose, is an important part of lowering serum triglycerides, and fructose as contained in sweetened beverages may have stronger triglyceride-raising effects than glucose. The glycemic index, defined as the rise in blood glucose of 50 g of carbohydrate in a specific food compared with either 50 g of glucose or white bread, may correlate with the extent of rise of serum triglyceride after eating carbohydrate-rich foods. Compared with a diet that emphasized carbohydrate, a similar diet that emphasized protein decreased triglyceride levels further, and this decrease was about twice the effect of a diet that emphasized unsaturated fat; African-Americans have lower serum triglyceride levels than other racial or ethnic groups, and in a study in which 50% of the population was African-American, diet modification had less effect on triglyceride levels than in a Caucasian population when matching baseline triglyceride levels. Exercise can modulate postprandial triglycerides; exercise the day before a high-fat meal is associated with a marked dampening of the postprandial triglyceride increase, and although the minimum effective dose is undetermined, a period of 30–60 min of intermittent aerobic exercise or mild resistance exercise has been shown to be effective in lowering plasma and VLDL triglycerides.

### Red blood cell omega-3 fatty acids and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure [^117TWUmy]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological studies support the protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids on sudden cardiac death. However, patients with structural heart disease and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) showed no effect or even a proarrhythmic response to fish oil supplementation. Animal studies suggest different electrophysiologic effects of circulating and incorporated omega-3 fatty acids.

Methods

In 102 ICD patients in New York Health Association functional class II or III, the fatty acid composition of red blood cells was analyzed by gas chromatography. The omega-3 index was calculated from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Patients were followed for 1 year, and ventricular arrhythmias requiring antitachycardic therapy were analyzed. Twenty-five healthy subjects served as control.

Results

In ICD patients, the fatty acid profile was significantly altered and the baseline omega-3 index was significantly elevated, as compared to control subjects (5.12% ± 0.87% vs 4.24% ± 0.96%, P < .001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of ventricular arrhythmias showed significant differences among quartiles of the omega-3 index. Twelve percent of patients in the lowest quartile had ventricular arrhythmias, as compared to 54% of patients in the highest quartile (P = 0.022). In a multivariate analysis, the omega-3 index was the only independent predictor for ventricular arrhythmias up to 9 months. At 12 months, a reduced ejection fraction was an additional risk predictor.

Conclusions

In heart failure patients, the red blood cell fatty acid profile is altered. Omega-3 fatty acids are elevated and predict the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

Obesity and intestinal cholesterol absorption — among patients with obesity, increased adiposity is associated with decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption and weight reduction may improve absorption; very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diets may modestly to markedly increase blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and if LDL-C rises substantially during such a diet, recommendations include dietary fat substitution, lowering dietary cholesterol, and considering lipid-lowering medications or discontinuation of the diet. If a patient treated with a ketogenic diet develops moderate/marked increases in blood LDL-C levels, recommendations include: replacing dietary saturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, reducing dietary cholesterol, consider a trial of ezetimibe, consider additional cholesterol-lowering treatment (e.g., statin), and temporarily or permanently discontinuing the ketogenic diet to determine if elevated blood LDL-C levels resolve.

Very high triglycerides (TG) and chylomicron clearing — When fasting TG are ≥ 500 mg/dL, and particularly when ≥ 750 mg/dL, fasting chylomicronemia is often present; at very high fasting TG levels, especially if ≥ 1000 mg/dL, restriction of dietary fat to less than 15% total energy intake (usually < 20–40 g daily; 40 g is 15% of energy for a 2400 kcal diet) is recommended, and Table 6 advises to temporarily limit total fat to 10%–15% calories (typically 20–40 g/day) during chylomicron clearing, avoid alcohol, avoid refined starches and added sugars, exercise 30–60 min most days, and if extra calories are needed add medium chain TG oil and increase gradually; once chylomicron particles have been cleared and TGs are < 500 mg/dL, gradually advance dietary fat to tolerance, with additional guidance including complete alcohol abstinence for those with very high TG, engaging in moderate or higher intensity aerobic activity ≥ 5 days per week, and for those on very-low fat diets (< 15% of energy) over an extended period, consumption of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VoWBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — definitions and risk context are summarized as follows: Two categories of hypertriglyceridemia consist of moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or nonfasting triglycerides 175–499 mg/dL [2.0–5.6 mmol/L]) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]). In the former, excess triglycerides are carried in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), whereas in the latter most patients have elevated VLDL plus chylomicrons; VLDL are believed to be atherogenic, similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). With severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevations of VLDL raise risk of ASCVD, but increases in chylomicrons impart risk of acute pancreatitis, so therapies should address excesses in both lipoproteins. In pregnancy, in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia, statins are not part of the treatment regimen because they are not recommended at the present time in pregnancy.

Macronutrient replacement of saturated fatty acids — predicted lipid effects: Table 4 summarizes controlled feeding trial data for replacing 5% of energy from saturated fatty acids with a matched quantity of energy from PUFA, MUFA, or carbohydrates. Predicted lipoprotein changes (mg/dL) include for PUFA: LDL-C −9.0 mg/dL, TG −2.0 mg/dL, and HDL-C −1.0 mg/dL. Effects on VLDL-C are estimated by dividing the predicted change in TG by 5, and approximated non-HDL-C changes (LDL-C + TG/5) with this 5% substitution are −9.4, −6.0, and −4.1 mg/dL for PUFA, MUFA, and carbohydrate, respectively. Results are summarized from controlled feeding trials of subjects with average-to-mildly dyslipidemic baseline levels of lipoprotein lipids, and effects may be more pronounced in those with higher baseline values.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia management to prevent pancreatitis (IIa B-R; IIa B-NR): In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy; in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L], it is reasonable to identify and address other causes and, if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy. Statins alone cannot prevent increasing levels of triglycerides from triggering acute hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis.

Adipose triglyceride uptake and transporter regulation — lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on capillary surfaces surrounding adipocytes facilitates the hydrolysis of triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins into fatty acids. Apolipoproteins modulate LPL, with apoC-I and apoC-III inhibiting LPL and apoC-II and apoA-V activating LPL, and obesity is often associated with an increase in apoC-III levels that would be expected to inhibit LPL, impair the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and increase circulating blood triglyceride levels. Adipocyte fatty acid transporters include fatty acid transport proteins (SLC27A1–6), plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm), acyl coA synthetases (FATP and ACSL), and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36); CD36 is a marker of human adipocyte progenitors, CD36 deletion promotes triglyceride hydrolysis and an increase of circulating free fatty acids, and increased expression with obesity has been suggested to contribute to diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and adipocyte cell death.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^1153mx68]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertriglyceridemia:

- **Definition**: Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: Underlying pathophysiology occurs through abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production, and intestinal chylomicron synthesis; dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or impaired remnant clearance. Primary etiology includes genetic mutations (LPL, APOC3, APOA5 genes), while secondary etiologies may consist of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcohol use, renal disease, pregnancy, and MASLD.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US is estimated at 29% in men and 21% in women.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, lipemia retinalis, tuberous xanthoma, palmar crease xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, focal neurologic symptoms (irritability), and recurrent epigastric pain with an increased risk of pancreatitis seen mostly with both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, T2DM, and acute pancreatitis with a reduction in health-related QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypertriglyceridemia with high (150–500 mg/dL) and very high levels (> 500 mg/dL) is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality with hazard ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.36–1.63, p < 0.001) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.46–6.50, p < 0.01), respectively.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112TW1vB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology — production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and atherogenesis — pattern and mechanisms — indicate a possible nonlinear association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), with very large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins not atherogenic while remnant particles and lipolytic products are atherogenic. There may be a nonlinear relationship between triglyceride levels and CVD, and very large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are not atherogenic because they are too large to penetrate into the arterial wall, whereas metabolic products of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are atherogenic and chylomicron remnants are atherogenic, with remnants identified within human atherosclerosis plaques. Chylomicrons contain a truncated apoB, apoB-48, and apoB-48 lipoproteins are clearly atherogenic as shown in a mouse model constructed with apoB-48 as the only type of apoB in VLDL and LDL, although severely hypertriglyceridemic animals develop only early-stage lesions. Although it is cholesterol and not triglyceride that is the pathological signature of atherosclerosis that accumulates in plaques, lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins also produces fatty acids and lysolecithin.

Mixed dyslipidemia — defined pattern and triglyceride threshold effects are described: The term denotes concurrent elevations in triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and familial combined hyperlipidemia is the most common type. When the TG concentration exceeds ~300–400 mg/dL, conversion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to LDL in circulation is typically impaired; when TG is lowered in such patients, LDL-C commonly rises due to a shift from VLDL-C to LDL-C as VLDL to LDL conversion increases.

### Omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels are reduced in whole blood of Italian patients with a recent myocardial infarction: the AGE-IM study [^112gh9jY]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The relationship between whole blood fatty acids and myocardial infarction (MI) risk has not been analyzed in detail, especially in Mediterranean countries. The AGE-IM (Acidi Grassi Essenziali e Infarto Miocardico) study was planned to examine the relationships between MI, whole blood fatty acids and the diet in an Italian cohort.

Methods

119 Patients with a recent MI and 103 control subjects were enrolled in the study. The whole blood fatty acid composition was determined; information on anthropometrics, biochemical parameters and blood pressure values were also obtained. Diet composition was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire from 86 cases and 72 controls.

Results

Total PUFA, omega-6 and omega-3 PUFA (as percentage of whole blood fatty acids) were significantly lower in MI patients than in matched controls, whereas saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were higher in cases. MI infarction risk significantly and steadily decreased with increasing levels of total PUFA (OR: 0.14) and of total omega-6 and omega-3 (OR: 0.15 and 0.37, respectively). No correlation was identified between dietary fats and MI risk or between whole blood fatty acid levels and dietary nutrients and fats.

Conclusion

Percentage levels of total PUFA, total omega-3 PUFA and total omega-6 PUFA are lower in MI patients than in matched control subjects in the AGE-IM cohort. These data support a favorable association not only of whole blood percentage levels of total omega-3, but also of total omega-6, with cardiovascular risk.

Hypertriglyceridemia spectrum and identification of patients with chylomicronemia — classification thresholds are provided: Normal fasting triglyceride (TG) levels are typically defined as < 150 mg/dL; mild–moderate hypertriglyceridemia (mHTG) is TG 150 to 499 mg/dL; severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) is TG ≥ 500 mg/dL; and extreme hypertriglyceridemia (eHTG) is TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL. The distribution of plasma TG in the population is highly skewed to the right, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia, defined as TG levels ≥ 1000 mg/dL, is almost always indicative of chylomicronemia.

### Inborn errors of metabolism (metabolic disorders) [^1166tgLs]. Pediatrics in Review (2016). Low credibility.

By their very nature, rare inborn errors of metabolism challenge the generation and application of evidence-based medicine.
- On the basis of limited research evidence as well as consensus, newborn screening for select metabolic disorders, including phenylketonuria, medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, and glutaric acidemia type I, may improve long-term outcomes for affected children.
- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, inborn errors due to defects in the metabolism of energy sources (protein, fatty acids, and carbohydrates) may present in infancy with overwhelming metabolic decompensation, and initial laboratory evaluations may reveal hyperammonemia, nonketotic hypoglycemia, or a metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, depending on the disorder.
- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, specific laboratory testing for inborn errors of metabolism should include plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, plasma carnitine, and plasma acylcarnitine profile.
- On the basis of primarily consensus, due to lack of relevant clinical studies, disorders of cellular organelles, such as lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders, may present with progressive organomegaly, developmental regression, dysmorphic facial characteristics. or sensory loss.

### Omega-3-acid ethyl esters [^114YJmFQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Omega-3-acids may prolong bleeding time. Patients taking omega-3-acid ethyl esters capsules and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically. (7.1)

7.1 Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation

Some trials with omega-3-acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time. The prolongation of bleeding time reported in these trials has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes. Clinical trials have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of omega-3-acid ethyl esters and concomitant anticoagulants. Patients receiving treatment with omega-3-acid ethyl esters and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation (e.g., anti-platelet agents) should be monitored periodically.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level < 150 mg/dL is accepted widely as the upper limit of normal range. Guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia are variable without a global consensus on classification and goals for triglyceride levels. A general classification of hypertriglyceridemia is mild < 200 mg/dL, moderate = 200 to 500 mg/dL, moderate to severe = 500 to 1000 mg/dL, and severe > 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia does increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on 3 common scenarios encountered in clinical practice. Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption and use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### Updating the healthy range for serum ALT levels… [^111sKU9M]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The populations used to determine this normal level in the 1980s probably included patients with nonal-coholic fatty liver, which is now acknowledged to be a common cause of chronic liver disease. The prevalence of chronic liver disease may be underestimated if this normal range is used. Prati and associates used the results of a four-year study of first-time blood donors to update the acceptable ALT range and identify a healthy range. This newly identified range was then tested for sensitivity and specificity among anti-HCV–positive persons with and without documented liver disease. More than 6, 000 healthy blood donors and 209 persons with confirmed anti-HCV were included. The median ALT level in the entire group was 12 U per L, with men having a slightly higher range than women. The sex-specific 95th percentile for ALT among the healthy blood donors was 30 U per L in men and 19 U per L in women, and these were suggested as healthy ALT levels.

When the old normal ALT range was compared with the new healthy range to detect ALT abnormalities among anti-HCV–positive persons, the sensitivity for liver disease of the new range's gender-specific levels was significantly higher, while the specificity was slightly lower. Persons with a greater body mass index, glucose intolerance, or hyperlipidemia tended to have higher ALT levels. The authors conclude that updated normal or healthy guidelines would better identify persons at risk for liver disease. These patients should probably be investigated for liver disease. Flexibility is appropriate considering the impact of other factors that may cause slight elevations of ALT, including obesity and hyperlipidemia. In an editorial in the same journal, Kaplan legitimizes the findings of this study but puzzles over the implications.

He discusses three courses of action: accepting the new lower ALT range, adjusting the current ALT range for effects of BMI and sex, and leaving the current standards alone. He suggests that combining the last two options would be appropriate because adapting the new ALT range would greatly increase the number of persons with ALT elevations who would require evaluation and impose anxiety on many otherwise healthy persons. Although additional patients with chronic HCV infection might be discovered, these patients with minimally elevated ALT levels generally have a more benign disease course that has not been documented to improve with treatment.
