## Question

I have a patient who is recovering from a hip replacement that was done 2 weeks ago. Their discharge notes list limited mobility, moderate pain, and daily PT sessions. They also have a mild infection at the surgical site that needs regular wound checks. I'm finalizing a home health certification form for the insurer so they can get skilled nursing at home. I'd like guidance on how to phrase the patient's condition, outline the daily wound care requirement, and estimate how long these services should last. Typically I would say 3 weeks, but I'm not sure that's enough. Should I be concerned?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to phrase the patient's condition, outline the daily wound care requirement, and estimate the appropriate duration of skilled home health services for a patient who is 2 weeks post–total hip arthroplasty with limited mobility, moderate pain, and a mild surgical site infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification. Then, I should verify wound care best practices and monitoring cadence. Next, I will examine rehabilitation intensity and functional recovery timelines. After that, I need to integrate infection-related considerations and surveillance. Finally, I will synthesize a defensible duration and write the certification language with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. At 2 weeks post–total hip arthroplasty, patients are in the early post-acute phase where functional gains are most rapid but also where complications like wound issues and infection risk are nontrivial, and discharge to home with skilled services is generally associated with fewer adverse events than discharge to institutional post-acute care when appropriately selected, though evidence quality varies and patient selection matters [^3c611871] [^62fe9f97]. I should also remember that early mobilization and rehabilitation are standard of care after hip arthroplasty, and guidelines support either supervised physical therapy or structured home exercise, with the choice individualized to patient needs and supports [^b4294c34] [^35a9ecec].

> Now, I need to check wound care specifics and monitoring cadence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about changing dressings too frequently. Consensus guidance advises keeping a dry occlusive dressing in place until staple or suture removal and avoiding routine early changes unless there is concern for infection, which aligns with minimizing unnecessary dressing disruptions and cost while maintaining an antimicrobial barrier [^bb84fee5]. For a suspected or confirmed mild infection, I should confirm that daily wound assessments are reasonable to detect evolving erythema, drainage, dehiscence, or systemic signs, and that early communication with the surgeon is indicated if infection is suspected, with clinical examination being a moderate-to-strong rule-in test for surgical site infection in the right context [^a588d800]. I should double-check that drainage persisting at 2 weeks warrants evaluation for hematoma or infection and that superficial infections may respond to local wound care while deep infections require operative management, which reinforces the need for close surveillance in this window [^bb84fee5].

> Next, I should review rehabilitation intensity and functional recovery timelines. Wait, let me verify the expected trajectory: most patients with caregiver support can achieve independent transfers and household ambulation with supervision within 2 to 4 weeks of intensive rehabilitation, but this assumes an uncomplicated course; with a wound infection, progress may be slower and pain-limited, so I should build in extra time and justify it clinically [^f3d649ca]. I need to ensure the plan reflects daily skilled nursing for wound care and coordination with daily physical therapy, which is consistent with high-frequency early rehabilitation principles after hip surgery and with guideline support for structured, progressive therapy across settings [^5a0b7d6f] [^b4294c34]. But wait, what if the patient could manage with unsupervised home exercises? The AAOS guideline allows either supervised PT or unsupervised home exercise, yet acknowledges that some patients require structured supervision to achieve optimal outcomes, and given limited mobility and pain with an active wound issue, supervised home services are reasonable here [^b4294c34] [^69306305].

> I will now examine infection-related considerations that could extend the timeline. I should confirm that early postoperative infection risk is real, with reported periprosthetic joint infection rates around 1.6% at 2 years and higher over longer horizons, which underscores the importance of vigilant wound surveillance and timely escalation if signs worsen [^1ee727e2]. Hold on, I should verify that clinical examination has moderate diagnostic value for suspected SSI and that persistent drainage at 2 weeks is a red flag warranting surgeon evaluation, which supports the need for skilled nursing to monitor and report changes promptly [^a588d800] [^bb84fee5]. I need to ensure the plan includes contingency for escalation to imaging or surgical consultation if the infection fails to improve with local care, aligning with best-practice SSI management pathways [^a588d800].

> Let me synthesize a defensible duration. Initially, I thought 3 weeks might suffice, but wait, I should double-check the recovery curve and the complicating infection. Given that uncomplicated patients often need 2 to 4 weeks of intensive rehab to reach basic independence, and that this patient has both pain and a wound infection likely to slow progress, 4 to 6 weeks of skilled home health is more appropriate to safely achieve mobility goals and ensure wound resolution before transitioning to outpatient care [^f3d649ca] [^bb84fee5]. I should confirm that this aligns with observational data showing home health lengths of stay averaging around 2 weeks longer than SNF stays, which, while not directly comparable, supports that 4 to 6 weeks is within a reasonable range for clinically complex home cases [^af1a029e]. I need to ensure the certification is time-limited and tied to measurable functional milestones and wound healing criteria to facilitate reassessment and de-escalation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to phrase the patient's condition and justification. I would state: "Status post primary total hip arthroplasty performed 2 weeks ago with limited mobility requiring assistive device and supervision, moderate postoperative pain limiting participation in therapy, and mild surgical site infection requiring daily skilled wound assessment, local care, and infection surveillance; patient remains at risk for dehiscence, delayed healing, and progression to deep infection without close monitoring and coordinated rehabilitation" [^bb84fee5] [^a588d800]. Hold on, I should verify that this captures medical necessity: the combination of impaired function, pain limiting therapy, and active infection justifies skilled nursing for wound care and coordination with physical therapy to prevent complications and restore safe mobility [^e0412d38] [^b4294c34].

> For the daily wound care requirement, I should specify: "Daily skilled nursing visits for wound assessment, measurement, photography as indicated, sterile dressing changes if drainage or dehiscence is present, observation for erythema, warmth, fluctuance, drainage characteristics, and systemic signs; coordination with the orthopedic surgeon for any deterioration or non-improvement within 48 to 72 hours; patient and caregiver education on signs of worsening infection and activity modifications to protect the wound" [^bb84fee5] [^a588d800]. I need to ensure I note that occlusive dressings should remain in place unless there is a clinical indication to change, to avoid unnecessary disruptions and maintain barrier protection [^bb84fee5].

> Regarding duration, I should write: "Request 4 to 6 weeks of skilled home health services, with reassessment at 2 weeks and again at 4 weeks to evaluate wound healing trajectory, pain control, functional independence with transfers and ambulation, and readiness for transition to outpatient physical therapy; anticipate step-down to outpatient PT once wound is closed, pain is controlled, and patient demonstrates safe, independent household mobility with assistive device" [^f3d649ca] [^b4294c34]. Hold on, I should verify that this is framed as medically necessary and time-limited with clear exit criteria, which insurers expect to see for authorization [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm that the plan addresses fall risk, medication reconciliation, and follow-up. I need to ensure the home health team screens for fall hazards, reinforces use of assistive devices, and coordinates with the surgical team for wound checks and staple removal around 2 weeks, while also aligning pain management with multimodal strategies to enable participation in therapy and monitoring for adverse effects, which is consistent with geriatric and orthopedic best practices [^c15f7bd4] [^e6754470]. If recovery lags or new deficits emerge, I should reconsider extending services or escalating care, but with the infection risk and current functional limitations, 4 to 6 weeks remains the most evidence-aligned and defensible request here [^f3d649ca] [^bb84fee5].

For a patient 2 weeks post–hip replacement with limited mobility, moderate pain, and a mild surgical site infection, **skilled nursing is medically necessary** for wound care, infection monitoring, and pain management. The condition should be documented as "post–total hip arthroplasty with limited mobility, moderate pain, and surgical site infection", and **daily wound care** should include assessment, dressing changes, and infection surveillance. A 3-week certification is likely insufficient; **4–6 weeks is more appropriate** to ensure wound healing, infection resolution, and safe progression of mobility with PT, aligning with post-arthroplasty recovery timelines and infection-risk management [^bb84fee5] [^b4294c34].

---

## Patient condition statement

Document the condition as: "Post–total hip arthroplasty (2 weeks) with limited mobility, moderate pain, and surgical site infection requiring skilled nursing care". This captures the **key clinical issues** and supports medical necessity for skilled services.

---

## Daily wound care requirements

Skilled nursing should provide the following **daily wound care**:

- **Wound assessment**: Evaluate for erythema, warmth, swelling, drainage, dehiscence, and signs of infection [^a588d800].

- **Dressing changes**: Perform sterile dressing changes as indicated, maintaining aseptic technique [^bb84fee5].

- **Infection surveillance**: Monitor for systemic signs (fever, chills, malaise) and document wound progress.

- **Patient education**: Teach recognition of infection signs and adherence to care instructions.

---

## Estimated duration of skilled nursing services

Three weeks is likely insufficient given the infection and limited mobility; **4–6 weeks is more appropriate** to allow wound healing, infection resolution, and safe mobility progression with PT. This aligns with post-arthroplasty recovery and infection-risk management [^bb84fee5] [^b4294c34].

---

## Rationale for extended duration

- **Wound healing**: Persistent drainage at 2 weeks warrants close monitoring and extended care [^bb84fee5].

- **Infection risk**: Early infection increases risk of deep infection and complications, requiring vigilant surveillance [^1ee727e2].

- **Functional recovery**: Limited mobility and pain necessitate ongoing skilled support to prevent setbacks [^f3d649ca].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

A 3-week certification is **likely insufficient**; **4–6 weeks of skilled nursing** is recommended to ensure wound healing, infection resolution, and safe mobility progression. Document the condition clearly, specify daily wound care, and justify the extended duration with clinical rationale to support insurance approval.

Designing Optimal Physical and Occupational Therapy

Physical therapy should start as early as possible after admission to a PAC facility. Older adults after surgical repair of a hip fracture should be performing high intensity lower extremity strength training, along with activities that challenge balance and encourage mobility such as rising from a chair, walking, and climbing steps. Patients should receive education regarding pain related to the process of rehabilitation.

National and international guidelines recommend that PT is initiated on the first day after surgery and continues across the continuum of care. The most successful PT plans include early intervention with intense PT. - Rehabilitation (PT and occupational therapy [OT]) plans should expedite recovery and take into consideration active comorbid conditions and other socioeconomic determinants of health, and address the abilities needed to function at home. For most patients who have caregiver support at home, reasonable goals include standing from a chair and out of bed with minimal assistance or contact guard and walking the length of the home using an assistive device with close supervision. Those who do not have caregiver assistance at home need to be independent in all these key functions, in addition to bathing, toileting, and dressing before discharge. With intensive daily OT and PT, these goals should be achievable in 2 to 4 weeks for most uncomplicated patients. Therapy should be focused on transferring the patient to the preinjury living environment as soon and as safely possible to minimize the risk of learned helplessness.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was discharge status (home vs not home, eg, skilled nursing facility or in-patient rehabilitation facility). An additional primary outcome for patients receiving the intervention (those in arms 2a and 2b) was the mean change in daily steps from baseline (week 2) to the end of the intervention (week 6). Prespecified secondary outcomes included the number of days at home, Timed Up and Go (TUG) scores measured after surgery, rehospitalization rate, number of rehospitalizations, and emergency department visits. Rehospitalization rate is the percentage of patients rehospitalized at least once, and the number of rehospitalizations allows for multiple rehospitalizations per patient. Additional outcomes included patient satisfaction with the intervention (measured by postintervention text survey), outpatient visits, physical therapy visits, skilled nursing visits, occupational therapy visits, home health aide visits, and length of hospital stay.

Postoperative physical therapy after total hip arthroplasty — High quality evidence supports either formal physical therapy or unsupervised home exercise after total hip arthroplasty for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip. Quality of Evidence: High, and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (Downgraded). Evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention, and the recommendation was downgraded based on EtD framework. The strength of recommendation was downgraded to moderate for several reasons including heterogeneity in the duration, timeframe, types of modalities and interventions, and frequency of the physical therapy interventions in these studies, making direct comparisons and definitive conclusions difficult. Two high quality articles and one moderate quality article showed no significant difference in outcomes between guided physiotherapy or unguided home exercises. In reviewing the quantity of articles in favor of supervised physical therapy versus those that showed no difference, there was a slight favor for formal physical therapy after surgery, and there were no studies that demonstrated unsupervised exercise was superior to supervised physical therapy. There is concern that recommending home exercise after surgery may limit the recovery of patients who need a more structured and supervised rehabilitation program to achieve optimal outcomes, and at this point there are no formal guidance measures to identify patients who may have an acceptable outcome with home exercise versus supervised physical therapy; a home program in which patients do not routinely interact with a health care professional after surgery may also result in delayed or missed negative sequalae after surgery.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline — post–total hip arthroplasty (THA) physical therapy emphasizes that exercise, mobility, and physical activity "should be a part of postoperative care, regardless of the manner in which it is implemented". Cost considerations note that "there is a cost associated with supervised physical therapy", but these are "a relatively small portion of the total course of peri- and postoperative care", and feasibility has "no major concerns". Acceptability reflects that "structured physical therapy is commonly prescribed for patients after THA", although "some stakeholders may have concerns that there is no guidance as to which patients are likely to have equivalent outcomes with unsupervised exercise after total hip arthroplasty (THA)". Evidence and research needs are described as "mixed, showing either a benefit to physical therapy or no difference when compared to unsupervised home exercise", with "future research… warranted" to clarify benefits, to include individualized and progressive programs with "both short- and long-term performance-based and self-reported measures", and to identify "which patients are likely to succeed without formal physical therapy".

ESSKA Guidelines emphasise that complete planning of the treatment pathway should be made available and carefully discussed with the patient prior to any operation. Care should be taken to only operate on patients when a standardised and adequate post-operative rehabilitation can be assured.

The International Consensus Group (ICM) and the AAHKS Research Committee recommend that the following changes be made in the post-operative care of patients during the pandemic:
The length of hospital stay for patients should be minimised
Post-operative rounds by the surgeon may be done using telemedicine, whenever possible
Patients should be discharged home and transfer to inpatient rehabilitation minimised
The patient should be instructed on how to perform self-directed physical therapy at home
Post-discharge visits to the office should be minimised, with the majority of the follow-up being done by telemedicine
Office visits should be limited to those who are having issues/complications, such as wound healing problems, suspected fracture, stiffness and so on
Digital health programmes and wearable sensor technologies that allow monitoring of patients will play a larger role in management of patients in the future
Social distancing should be resumed and at-home visits avoided, unless absolutely essential

OrthoEvidence recommends that patients with substantial co-morbidities and risk factors should be scheduled after healthier patients have been treated and experience has been amassed from the establishment of screening, prevention and treatment protocols.
2 Should a shelter-in-place post-operative period, home care, community nurses or informal care be organised?

Statement Ideally, patients should be discharged home with the standard SARS-CoV-2 precautions being taken and only transferred to a nursing home in cases where that is not possible, since higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 may exist in those facilities.

Rationale The communal nature of nursing homes and long-term care facilities and the characteristics of the population served (generally older adults, often with underlying medical conditions) put those living in nursing homes at higher risk of infection and severe illness from SARS-CoV-2. Until normality returns, unnecessary human contact should be avoided as much as possible to reduce the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among patients and their family members. All these people, including family members and nurses, can transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus from one person to another and from one location to another.

### Comparison of discharge functional status after rehabilitation in skilled nursing, home health, and medical rehabilitation settings for patients after hip fracture repair [^af1c029e]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine differences in rehabilitation outcomes across 3 post-acute care (PAC) rehabilitation settings for patients after hip fracture repair.

Design

Prospective, observational cohort study.

Setting

Six skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), 4 inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), and 8 home health agencies (HHAs) in 10 states.

Participants

Patients (N = 181) receiving PAC rehabilitation following hip fracture with internal fixation (n = 116) or total hip replacement (n = 64), or no surgical intervention (n = 1).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure

Self-care and mobility status at PAC discharge measured by the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument.

Results

IRF and HHA patients had lower self-care function at discharge relative to SNF patients controlling for patient characteristics, severity, comorbidities, and services. Adding length of stay (LOS) resulted in nonsignificant differences between IRFs and SNFs. In contrast, there was no setting-specific advantage in discharge mobility for patients with or without the addition of LOS. The average LOS of HHA patients was 2 weeks longer than that of SNF patients, whose average LOS was 9 days longer than that of IRF patients (average, 15d). IRF and SNF patients received about the same total minutes of therapy over their PAC stays (∼2100min on average), whereas HHA patients received only approximately 25% as many minutes.

Conclusions

Setting-specific effects varied depending on whether self-care or mobility was the outcome of focus. It remains unclear to what extent rehabilitation intensity or natural recovery effects changes in functional status for patients with hip fracture. This study points to important directions for PAC setting comparative effectiveness studies in the future, including uniform measurement, limited consensus on factors affecting recovery, accounting for selection bias, and using end-point data collection that is at the same follow-up time periods for all settings.

### Experiences of boosting inpatient exercise after hipFracture surgery using an alternative workforce – A qualitative study [^d528670e]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The average age of people admitted to hospital in 2019 following a hip fracture was 82 years in both Australia and New Zealand, with people aged above 90 years comprising 25% of this cohort. This older population is at risk of frailty, with numerous risk factors that may contribute to subsequent hip fractures, morbidity, and mortality. Hip fracture is a debilitating injury that may arise from a variety of traumatic experiences, including high and low trauma fractures. The number of hip fractures worldwide is predicted to increase by about four-fold from an overall incidence estimated between 1.25 and 1.66 million in 1990 to an estimated 4.5 to 6.5 million by 2050. Hip fractures impose a huge financial encumbrance on the Australian healthcare system due to the need for surgery and hospitalisation. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, there is a projected rise in annual acute hip fracture care costs from AUD$163.9 million in 2011 to between AUD$224.8 to $345.0 million in 2036. Therefore, it is highly important to participate in physical rehabilitation during the acute phase of recovery after hip fracture surgery to improve patients' general health and overall function.

Best practice physiotherapy encourages commencing mobility within 24 h after surgery. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that patients who first mobilised on postoperative days 1 or 2 (early ambulation) significantly increased walking distance and reduced assistance required for mobility at one-week post-surgery compared to those who first mobilised on postoperative days 3 or 4. Patients engaged in early mobilisation were more likely to be discharged directly home from acute care and less likely to need high-level care. Conventionally, mobilisation occurs with a physiotherapist once per day after surgical repair of hip fracture. Another RCT investigated the effects of thrice-daily mobilisation after surgical repair of hip fracture, with two daily physiotherapy sessions delivered by a physiotherapist and an additional session delivered by an allied health assistant. This was safe and significantly reduced total (combined acute and rehabilitation) hospital length of stay. Despite this high-quality evidence, as yet there is no evidence supporting successful implementation in a typical clinical setting, and hence no knowledge of the acceptability of such an approach to inpatients and clinicians.

The aim of our embedded qualitative study was to examine, in the acute period after surgical repair of hip fracture, the experiences and acceptability of higher frequency physiotherapy implemented by an alternative workforce (allied health staff and physiotherapy students) among inpatients, carers, and relevant healthcare workers.

### Patient-reported outcome measure for early postoperative recovery following lower limb arthroplasty: a systematic review [^0f517bb1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lower limb arthroplasty is an effective surgical treatment option for patients with moderate to severe arthritis who have not responded to medical management. However, surgical interventions can lead to postoperative consequences such as limited mobility, pain, and infection. Consequently, improving postoperative recovery holds significant benefits for patients, health care professionals, and health care payers. The purpose of this review is to determine if any recovery tools exist that can effectively measure early postoperative recovery after hip or knee arthroplasty.

Methods

The following databases were searched; PubMed (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Cochrane library, and SCOPUS. We restricted our search to English language articles and adult respondents. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers using a proforma spreadsheet, and existing quality criteria were applied.

Results

Our literature search identified 23 articles relating to development, assessment, and validation of 15 tools. Not all instruments demonstrated the same levels of quality. None of the tools found were specific to both the orthopedic arthroplasty population and early recovery periods.

Conclusion

At the present time, there are no fully validated tools to assess early postoperative recovery during the first week following lower limb arthroplasty. A brief, easy-to-complete, reliable patient-reported tool could be of great use. It could not only aid in assessment of recovery but could also evaluate the efficacy of perioperative interventions such as drugs or surgical technique and provide a foundation for evidence-based care.

Surgical Wound Care

An occlusive dressing that is dry should remain in place until staple or suture removal. Any concern for infection should prompt urgent communication with the surgeon.

Postoperative wound care is essential to decrease risks of deep wound infection. If an occlusive dressing was changed by a surgeon before hospital discharge, it could be left in place for 1 week. These dressings are thought to be an antimicrobial barrier and have been found to reduce the need of dressing changes and reduce the risk of tape blisters. A common mistake is to immediately change an occlusive dressing upon arrival to a PAC facility. Often, this is done with no available occlusive dressing replacement. Occlusive dressings are costly, and changing them routinely on patient arrival is an unnecessary expense. Wound closure may be with staples or sutures that require removal or with dissolvable suture and skin glue.

Signs of infection include increased pain and increased drainage. A certain amount of warmth, bruising, or redness may be normal in the immediate postoperative phase. Drainage from a wound typically is minimal of absent in the first few days after surgery. Wounds that have undergone multiple surgeries and those in the morbidly obese patient may drain for a longer period. Drainage that continues at 2 weeks after surgery could be associated with either hematoma or infection. Wound check by a surgeon is recommended 2 weeks after surgery. This may require a visit to the surgeon's office or where available, telemedicine may be an option.

If there is concern for infection, the surgeon should be notified, and the patient evaluated. Early treatment of infection is important. Superficial wound infections or suture abscesses typically happen several weeks after surgery and can be treated with local wound care. Deep wound infection or deep drainage hematoma require a return trip to the operating room for washout and debridement as well as antibiotics. Antibiotics alone are not a treatment for deep wound infection. The use of telemedicine appears to be an emerging option for patients in PAC facilities to have access to orthopedic surgeons' care.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^a588d800]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Clinical exam for the diagnosis of surgical site infections — moderate strength evidence supports that clinical exam (i.e. pain, drainage, fever) is a moderate to strong rule-in test (i.e. high probability of presence of infection, if test is positive) for patients with suspected surgical site infections, but a weak rule-out test. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Patients with suspected surgical site infections should be assessed by a history and physical examination. In one study using a structured interview to evaluate 80 patients undergoing revision total hip arthroplasty, 16 had proven infection; a positive clinical examination was defined as current painful joint, history of chronic joint pain, or a history of wound drainage or fever lasting greater than 48 hours in the first month after primary surgery, and a positive history had a sensitivity of 0.625 and specificity of 0.98. Another moderate strength study evaluating 230 patients against the confirmed infections of positive culture found fever had a sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.90, and persistent drainage had a sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.90. There are no known harms associated with implementing this recommendation, and the absence of pain after treatment does not assure the absence of infection.

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^eb86e223]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Hip fracture — early assisted transfers and ambulation — evidence from a clinical practice guideline (CPG) and a hospital study supports initiating assisted transfer out of bed and ambulation early after surgery, with a directive for daily mobilization when not contraindicated. A high-quality CPG "recommended 'mobilization' on the day after surgery and at least once a day" and noted improvements "within 7 days". In a hospital study comparing early versus delayed assisted ambulation, early walking was defined as "postoperative day 1 or 2" versus delayed "postoperative day 3 or 4" among "60 participants (2 groups of 30)", with higher discharge to home in the early group "(26.3%)" versus delayed "(2.4%)", and the delayed group more often requiring "high-level care (56% compared to 36.8%)". Based on level II evidence and a high-quality CPG, "the CPG provides a strong recommendation for assisted transfer out of bed and ambulation as soon as possible after hip fracture surgery, unless contraindicated for medical or surgical reasons", and the explicit directive states, "Clinicians must provide assisted transfer out of bed and ambulation as soon as possible after hip fracture surgery and at least daily thereafter, unless contraindicated for medical or surgical reasons".

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to postoperative rehabilitation, AOPT 2021 guidelines recommend to provide opportunities for additional therapies if strength, balance, and functional deficits remain beyond 8–16 weeks after fracture. Offer strength, balance, functional, and gait training as additional therapies to address existing impairments, activity limitations, and fall risk. Consider offering outpatient services, progressive home exercise programs, or evidence-based community exercise programs.

### More than just morbidity and mortality-quality of recovery and long-term functional recovery after surgery [^01532c1b]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Traditional surgical outcome measures include minor and major complications, hospital length of stay and sometimes longer-term survival. Each of these is important but there needs to be greater emphasis on patient-reported outcome measures. Global measures of a patient's quality of recovery, avoidance of postoperative morbidities, early hospital discharge to home (without re-admission) and longer term disability-free survival can better define postoperative recovery. A patient's recovery pathway can be mapped through the immediate days or weeks after surgery with documentation of morbidity using the postoperative morbidity survey and/or a quality of recovery score, days alive and at home up to 30 days after surgery and then longer term disability-free survival using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 scale. These can be used to define quality of recovery after surgery.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary of surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee [^62fe9f97]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on surgical management of osteoarthritis of the knee — discharge facilities/disposition states that discharge to home, with or without home services, is associated with fewer adverse events compared to discharge to acute rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility. The evidence rating is Quality of Evidence: Low and Strength of Option: Limited, with the description that this reflects evidence from one or more "Low" quality studies with consistent findings or evidence from a single "Moderate" quality study recommending for or against the intervention. The rationale reports there were no high quality and three low quality studies evaluating discharge to facility versus home; McLawhorn (2017) showed fewer adverse events and readmissions with home discharge, Padgett (2018) demonstrated a higher length of stay with home discharge but no difference in adverse events, and Naylor (2017) showed significantly better functional scores with home discharge, and in the absence of reliable, comparative studies a consensus recommendation was made by the workgroup. Benefits and harms note there are no known harms with implementation; the decision between home and post-acute care facility should consider the patient's medical complexity and postoperative function, and practitioners should be aware of advantages and disadvantages of specific discharge disposition. The rationale also notes that literature comparing costs associated with discharge disposition was not included for analysis. Future research calls for higher-quality studies following total knee arthroplasty and cites Christensen (2020) showing significantly better VAS Pain, strength, and functional testing at one-month post-op with immediate outpatient physical therapy compared to immediate home physical therapy followed by outpatient therapy, noting this was not included in the recommendation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^ba3ad769]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip and knee osteoarthritis — exercise therapy overall evidence indicates benefit versus control but no preferred specific type and highlights patient considerations. A systematic review and meta-analysis including 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2,991) reported a greater benefit of exercise therapy on total distance walked at six months and on time spent walking at eight weeks, although there was significant heterogeneity of exercise type and program among RCTs. The document notes that the use of pooled estimated effects provides insight into overall effects but does not explain potential differences between types of exercise programs, and states there was insufficient evidence to recommend any specific exercise intervention over another, with no reported harm associated with any specific type of exercise. Patient focus group feedback expressed support for exercises under the guidance of a physical therapist and care in convenient settings, while barriers include time commitment and the perception among some patients that exercise will increase pain; patient adherence to home-based exercise programs is also a concern.

### Postacute management of older adults suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture: a consensus statement from the international geriatric fracture society [^e0412d38]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to schedule follow-up appointments after discharge with the patient's primary care provider and with the orthopedic surgeon. Home health services should be involved, not only to continue improving mobilitybut also to assess the status of chronic or newly acquired medical conditions such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections, pressure injuries, and depression. For those patients who encounter challenges leaving their homes, telemedicine appears to be a feasible option where available.

Medication changes might happen while in a PAC facility and it is important that the new list of medications is communicated to the patient's health care providers in the community. If the patient is unable to leave the house, it might be helpful to seek for a primary care provider who can provide home visits and establish home delivery pharmacy services. Referral to fall prevention programs also should be part of the care plan at the time of discharge as well as providing services necessary after returning home, either temporarily or permanently.

### Association of length of stay, recovery rate, and therapy time per day with functional outcomes after hip fracture surgery [^e8e58121]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between therapy minutes per day and mobility and self-care outcomes for patients receiving rehabilitation services in postacute care facilities after undergoing hip fracture surgery?

Findings

This cohort study of 150 participants found that rate of recovery and length of stay were associated with discharge functional outcomes. Therapy minutes per length of stay day explained only 1% of variance in discharge mobility and self-care outcomes.

Meaning

These findings suggest that for patients who improve at a medium rate, shorter length of stay (< 21 days) may transfer additional burden of care to family caregivers, home health agencies, and outpatient services.

### Age trends in 30 day hospital readmissions: US national retrospective analysis [^cfaf35de]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Index admission demographics and clinical characteristics

We assessed characteristics of the index admissions available in the NRD, including sex, payer (Medicare, Medicaid, private, self pay, no charge, and other), length of stay, type of admission (elective versus emergent), and discharge disposition (routine home; to home with skilled home healthcare; to skilled facility based, post-acute care; and left the hospital against medical advice). Routine home disposition indicates hospital discharge to a patient's home without any additional assistance from skilled nursing or other home care professional providers. Home healthcare disposition indicates discharge to a patient's home with additional care giving, functional, and/or medical assistance provided in the home by a skilled nurse or other health professional (such as a physiotherapist). This skilled assistance might include help with activities of daily living, transfers (for example, wheelchair to bed), administration of drugs and medical equipment (for example, oxygen), and palliative care. Facility based, post-acute care disposition indicates discharge to another medical facility that provides intensive rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and/or palliative care. In the US, patients (especially older people) are more likely to use skilled home health or facility based, post-acute care after hospital discharge when they have considerable mobility problems, social challenges, and/or limited family support.

We also assessed the reason for and severity of illness for each index admission by using 3M Health Information System's all patient-refined diagnosis related groups. There are 314 such groups, organized by medical (n = 195) versus procedural (n = 119) reasons for hospital admission. Each groups maps to a mutually exclusive 25 organ systems (that is, major diagnostic categories). We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's chronic condition indicator to count the number of patients' chronic conditions and to describe the chronic conditions. This indicator system defines chronic conditions as those expected to last 12 months or longer and meeting one or both of the following criteria: the condition places limitations on self care, independent living, and social interactions; and/or it results in the need for ongoing intervention with medical products, services, and special equipment. On the basis of the distribution of the number of chronic conditions of patients in the study cohort, we used the categories 0, 1, 2–3, 4–5, and 6 or more chronic conditions.

Conclusions

The recommendations can be summarised as:
National guidance for the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic should be adhered to.
National and local guidance for the pathway for elective arthroplasty should be followed.

In addition:
(i) Patient information materials should now include information on what the patient should do if they develop SARS-CoV-2 symptoms or become SARS-CoV-2 positive whilst on the elective arthroplasty pathway.
(ii) Patients should only be accompanied by their primary caregiver during their elective hip or knee arthroplasty pathway.
(iii) The appropriate facilities, workforce, testing and supplies for all the equipment needed must be in place.
(iv) Agreed protocols should be in place for selecting suitable patients, taking into consideration the resources available to cater to their needs on an individual basis.
(v) A robust testing regime for SARS-CoV-2 for both patients and staff should be in place and incorporated into the protocols for the patient journey. Being SARS-CoV-2-positive is an absolute contra-indication for primary elective hip and knee arthroplasty.
(vi) Enhanced recovery protocols are encouraged, with a further reduction in the inpatient stay implemented.
(vii) To reduce the risk of aerosolisation to staff, the use of spinal anaesthetic techniques is encouraged and should be included in the patient information material. An agreed policy must be in place on how to manage patients who can only undergo a general anaesthetic, which may include this being a contra-indication for surgery.
(viii) Theatre staff should use personal protective equipment (PPE) in line with national and local policies. Laminar flow theatres are encouraged, and, if available, exhaust suits with a mask should be used for the operating team.
(ix) Primary elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients should be physically isolated from patients admitted with trauma or for other emergencies, including the sick elderly.
(x) Ideally, patients should be discharged directly back to their normal residence. Patients should be advised to maintain social distancing for 2 weeks following discharge.
(xi) Post-operative rehabilitation should be implemented during the inpatient stay, with remote follow-up as the norm after discharge.
(xii) Follow-up visits should be minimised and remote follow-up instituted with the relevant approvals with respect to Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection in place.

### Early musculoskeletal pain management in the general practitioner's office&E-referral: a multidisciplinary expert opinion [^e6754470]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient Management After Hospital Discharge: The Post-Surgery Period

The immediate post-surgery period is a vulnerable phase for orthopedic elective patients. Fragile subjects are directly to a rehabilitation ward. The remaining are discharged home with a tailored rehabilitation program. In this regard, an effective and substantial pain therapy is pivotal to guarantee the patient's immediate mobility. Indeed, in cases of post-surgical pain, especially in patients with osteoporosis and musculoskeletal problems, it is crucial that the patient is able to move as soon as possible. There is no univocal protocol for pain therapy in this context, however paracetamol is again the first choice, sometimes in combination with NSAIDs or opioids, for the first two weeks after surgery, with the aim of minimize pain and enhance post-operative mobility. Moreover, in hospital settings, post-operative blocks and a combination of paracetamol with NSAIDs are often used to manage pain and improve patient's autonomy. Notably, although some studies suggest that they may slow tissue healing, NSAIDs are still used for their effectiveness in controlling pain and inflammation, taking into consideration the potential associated risks. Generally, most patients are able to independently manage pain therapy in the first post-operative two weeks. Nevertheless, it is important that GPs are informed and able to monitor and support patients during the recovery period, intervening if necessary. Indeed, after 7–14 days blood count is advised to exclude the development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anemia. Usually, a specialist's visit takes place after one month together with X-ray control. It should be anticipated only in case of refractory pain, required wound care or anemia. It can be suggested to use e-referral to avoid unnecessary visits and promptly solve some problems. In case of refractory pain, a rescue therapy is needed, once excluded surgical complication, to favor rehabilitation and movement. Otherwise, paracetamol alone after two weeks of multimodal therapy is advised. The algorithm suggested by experts regarding the early management of MP is resumed in Figure 2.

### Global forum: an international perspective on outpatient surgical procedures for adult hip and knee reconstruction [^caf1bbc8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Outpatient surgical procedures for adult hip and knee reconstruction are gaining interest on a worldwide basis and have been progressively increasing over the last few years. Preoperative screening needs to concentrate on both the patient's comorbidities and home environment to provide a proper alignment of expectations of the surgeon, the patient, and the patient's family. Preoperative multidisciplinary patient information covering all aspects of the upcoming treatment course is a mandatory step, focusing on pain management and early mobilization. Perioperative pain management includes both multimodal and preventive analgesia. Preemptive medications, minimization of narcotics, and combination of general and regional anesthesia are the techniques required in joint arthroplasty performed as an outpatient surgical procedure. A multimodal blood loss management program should be used with preoperative identification of anemia and attention directed toward minimizing blood loss, considering the use of tranexamic acid during the surgical procedure. Postoperative care extends from the initial recovery from anesthesia to the physical therapist's evaluation of the patient's ambulatory status. After the patient has met the criteria for discharge and has been discharged on the same day of the surgical procedure, a nurse should call the patient later at home to check on wound status, pain control, and muscle weakness, which will be further addressed by physiotherapy and education. Implementing outpatient arthroplasty requires monitoring safety, patient satisfaction, and economic impact.

### The bumpy road to recovery: older adults' experiences during the first year after hip replacement surgery-a longitudinal qualitative study [^515a0ac7]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally, it is estimated that half of the older adult population will undergo at least one surgical procedure in their lifetime. The number of older adults undergoing surgery is increasing more rapidly than that of the general population. For older adults, surgery is a significant event since they are more prone to postoperative complications. Hospital stays following surgery are typically short, and efforts to reduce these stays are not always beneficial for older adults. Consequently, most of the recovery process occurs at home, requiring older adults to manage their symptoms independently. The postoperative recovery process can be particularly challenging for older adults because of the effects of aging on the organ system. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how postoperative recovery is experienced and how older adults cope with these changes over time.

Postoperative recovery is a challenging period of transition, involving both an individual process and a transformative journey. This journey involves regaining normal functions and achieving optimal well-being, reaching a new stable state that may be the same, better or worse than preoperatively. It has also been defined as 'getting back to normal' or "to be as before". The postoperative recovery journey includes physical, emotional, social, and habitual aspects and can be divided into different phases: early, intermediate, late, and long-term recovery as well as a pre-recovery phase. Early and intermediate recovery occurs before discharge from the hospital and includes normalizing coordination and physiological function to achieve "home readiness". Late recovery begins upon discharge and continues until the patient regains usual function and activity, which can take hours to days. Long-term recovery often takes three to six months to restore functional and cognitive abilities. Recovery time varies from days to months, with older individuals generally experiencing slower recovery than younger people do. This is particularly relevant for older individuals with physical limitations, as the likelihood of postoperative complications is greater for medical reasons than for surgical reasons. Some may never fully recover to their previous level of functioning. Apart from postoperative pain, a significant aspect of the postoperative recovery period is the temporary loss of independence. Additionally, emotions such as fear, anxiety, and powerlessness, as well as fatigue, are commonly reported. These aspects of postoperative recovery are rarely discussed among healthcare professionals and are communicated to patients or their relatives. Patients who experience postoperative symptoms and complications may be taken aback by their impact on recovery. These complications can affect psychosocial functioning and the ability to participate in daily activities, leading to feelings of helplessness and uncertainty. Therefore, informing patients about common complications and symptoms and providing and explaining their potential impact on recovery are crucial.

### Rapid rehabilitation and recovery with minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty [^950272db]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the potential recovery rate of a minimally invasive total hip replacement technique with minimal soft tissue disruption, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol was implemented with weightbearing as tolerated on the day of surgery. One hundred consecutive patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Ninety-seven patients (97%) met all the inpatient physical therapy goals required for discharge to home on the day of surgery; 100% of patients achieved these goals within 23 hours of surgery. Outpatient therapy was initiated in 9% of patients immediately, 62% of patients by 1 week, and all patients by 2 weeks. The mean time to discontinued use of crutches, discontinued use of narcotic pain medications, and resumed driving was 6 days postoperatively. The mean time to return to work was 8 days, discontinued use of any assistive device was 9 days, and resumption of all activities of daily living was 10 days. The mean time to walk (1/2) mile was 16 days. Furthermore, there were no readmissions, no dislocations, and no reoperations. Therefore, a rapid rehabilitation protocol is safe and fulfills the potential benefits of a rapid recovery with minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty.

### Why Do patients choose skilled nursing facilities after total hip and knee arthroplasty? [^e3103712]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current research indicates that total joint arthroplasty patients who are discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have higher complication rates as compared to home. Many factors like age, sex, race, Medicare status, and past medical history have been shown to influence discharge destination. The present study sought to gather patient-indicated reasons for SNF discharge and identify potentially modifiable factors influencing the decision.

Methods

Primary total joint arthroplasty patients were asked to complete surveys at their presurgical and 2-week postsurgical follow-up appointments. The surveys included home access and social support questions as well as patient-reported outcome measures: Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement and Information System, Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement, or Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement.

Results

Of 765 patients who met inclusion criteria, 3.9% were discharged to an SNF and these were more frequently post-THA, women, older, Black, and persons living alone. Regression analyses indicated that lower Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score, higher age, no caregiver presence, and Black race were significantly associated with SNF discharge. Patients discharged to an SNF most commonly reported social concerns rather than medical or home access concerns as the main factor for SNF discharge.

Conclusions

While age and sex are nonmodifiable factors, the availability of a caregiver and social support represents an important modifiable factor in regard to discharge destination. Dedicated attention during the preoperative planning period may help augment social support and avoid unnecessary discharges to SNFs.

COX-2 agents — evidence across orthopedic surgery trials — There are eight high quality and four moderate quality studies supporting this recommendation. In total knee arthroplasty, celecoxib given twice daily for 6 weeks after discharge vs. placebo led to significantly fewer opioids over the course of 12 months, with pain scores at rest and with activity significantly lower out to 3 weeks and at night out to 6 weeks; patients in the celecoxib group had a significant increase in function at 6 weeks and no differences were noted in adverse events. In total hip arthroplasty, celecoxib administered preoperatively and postoperatively through day 5 improved VAS pain scores through 72 hours postop with no difference in Harris Hip Scores, and mean times to ambulation were 4.5 ± 1.2 days vs. 5.83 ± 2.04 days; there were no differences in adverse events between groups. In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a one-time preoperative dose, no significant differences were found between pain, narcotic use, or function between celecoxib and placebo, and there were no other differences to include adverse events. In patients after TKA receiving tramadol, adding celecoxib significantly reduced indicators of aseptic inflammation and improved Knee Society Scores, and pain was not assessed. In hip arthroscopy, a single preoperative dose produced significant improvements in postoperative pain scores up to 2 hours after surgery, with no differences in opioid consumption and small but not significant decreases in PACU time.

### Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for older people with hip fractures [^8c95c804]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hip fracture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, and its impact on society is substantial. After surgery, people require rehabilitation to help them recover. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation is where rehabilitation is delivered by a multidisciplinary team, supervised by a geriatrician, rehabilitation physician or other appropriate physician. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, in either inpatient or ambulatory care settings, for older people with hip fracture.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (October 2020), and two trials registers (November 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials of post-surgical care using multidisciplinary rehabilitation of older people (aged 65 years or over) with hip fracture. The primary outcome - 'poor outcome' - was a composite of mortality and decline in residential status at long-term (generally one year) follow-up. The other 'critical' outcomes were health-related quality of life, mortality, dependency in activities of daily living, mobility, and related pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently performed study selection, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

The 28 included trials involved 5351 older (mean ages ranged from 76.5 to 87 years), usually female, participants who had undergone hip fracture surgery. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity in the trial interventions and populations. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more items, such as blinding-related performance and detection biases. We summarise the findings for three comparisons below. Inpatient rehabilitation: multidisciplinary rehabilitation versus 'usual care' Multidisciplinary rehabilitation was provided primarily in an inpatient setting in 20 trials. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation probably results in fewer cases of 'poor outcome' (death or deterioration in residential status, generally requiring institutional care) at 6 to 12 months' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.98; 13 studies, 3036 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on an illustrative risk of 347 people with hip fracture with poor outcome in 1000 people followed up between 6 and 12 months, this equates to 41 (95% CI 7 to 69) fewer people with poor outcome after multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Expressed in terms of numbers needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), 25 patients (95% CI 15 to 100) would need to be treated to avoid one 'poor outcome'. Subgroup analysis by type of multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention showed no evidence of subgroup differences. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation may result in fewer deaths in hospital but the confidence interval does not exclude a small increase in the number of deaths (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.04; 11 studies, 2455 participants; low-certainty evidence). A similar finding applies at 4 to 12 months' follow-up (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 18 studies, 3973 participants; low-certainty evidence). Multidisciplinary rehabilitation may result in fewer people with poorer mobility at 6 to 12 months' follow-up (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; 5 studies, 1085 participants; low-certainty evidence). Due to very low-certainty evidence, we have little confidence in the findings for marginally better quality of life after multidisciplinary rehabilitation (1 study). The same applies to the mixed findings of some or no difference from multidisciplinary rehabilitation on dependence in activities of daily living at 1 to 4 months' follow-up (measured in various ways by 11 studies), or at 6 to 12 months' follow-up (13 studies). Long-term hip-related pain was not reported. Ambulatory setting: supported discharge and multidisciplinary home rehabilitation versus 'usual care' Three trials tested this comparison in 377 people mainly living at home. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we have very little confidence in the findings of little to no between-group difference in poor outcome (death or move to a higher level of care or inability to walk) at one year (3 studies); quality of life at one year (1 study); in mortality at 4 or 12 months (2 studies); in independence in personal activities of daily living (1 study); in moving permanently to a higher level of care (2 studies) or being unable to walk (2 studies). Long-term hip-related pain was not reported. One trial tested this comparison in 240 nursing home residents. There is low-certainty evidence that there may be no or minimal between-group differences at 12 months in 'poor outcome' defined as dead or unable to walk; or in mortality at 4 months or 12 months. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we have very little confidence in the findings of no between-group differences in dependency at 4 weeks or at 12 months, or in quality of life, inability to walk or pain at 12 months.

Authors' Conclusions

In a hospital inpatient setting, there is moderate-certainty evidence that rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery, when delivered by a multidisciplinary team and supervised by an appropriate medical specialist, results in fewer cases of 'poor outcome' (death or deterioration in residential status). There is low-certainty evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation may result in fewer deaths in hospital and at 4 to 12 months; however, it may also result in slightly more. There is low-certainty evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation may reduce the numbers of people with poorer mobility at 12 months. No conclusions can be drawn on other outcomes, for which the evidence is of very low certainty. The generally very low-certainty evidence available for supported discharge and multidisciplinary home rehabilitation means that we are very uncertain whether the findings of little or no difference for all outcomes between the intervention and usual care is true. Given the prevalent clinical emphasis on early discharge, we suggest that research is best orientated towards early supported discharge and identifying the components of multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation to optimise patient recovery within hospital and the components of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including social care, subsequent to hospital discharge.

### Association of discharge to home vs institutional postacute care with outcomes after lower extremity joint replacement [^3c611871]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

What level of postacute care support is provided to patients after elective lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) is an increasingly important clinical and policy issue. More than 1 million LEJR operations are performed annually in the United States, and this volume is expected to increase as the population ages. The growth in the volume of LEJR and associated costs has led the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to reform payments for LEJR, which has changed the landscape of postacute care following surgery.

The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) and Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) models have shown reductions in episode costs primarily through reduced use of expensive forms of postacute care (eg, skilled nursing facility [SNF] care) in favor of discharges home (with or without home health care). The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) announced inclusion of elective hip and knee replacements as a targeted condition in 2013 and instituted penalties for 30-day readmissions starting in 2015. Early evaluations of these individual programs have not shown evidence of harm, even in frail LEJR populations, although long-term effects remain unstudied.

### A comparison of discharge functional status after rehabilitation in skilled nursing, home health, and medical rehabilitation settings for patients after lower-extremity joint replacement surgery [^a14b941c]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine differences in outcomes of patients after lower-extremity joint replacement across 3 post-acute care (PAC) rehabilitation settings.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs; n = 5), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs; n = 4), and home health agencies (HHAs; n = 6) from 11 states.

Participants

Patients with total knee (n = 146) or total hip replacement (n = 84) not related to traumatic injury.

Interventions

None.

Main Outcome Measure

Self-care and mobility status at PAC discharge measured by using the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument.

Results

Based on our study sample, HHA patients were significantly less dependent than SNF and IRF patients at admission and discharge in self-care and mobility. IRF and SNF patients had similar mobility levels at admission and discharge and similar self-care at admission, but SNF patients were more independent in self-care at discharge. After controlling for differences in patient severity and length of stay in multivariate analyses, HHA setting was not a significant predictor of self-care discharge status, suggesting that HHA patients were less medically complex than SNF and IRF patients. IRF patients were more dependent in discharge self-care even after controlling for severity. For the full discharge mobility regression model, urinary incontinence was the only significant covariate.

Conclusions

For the patients in our U.S.-based study, direct discharge to home with home care was the optimal strategy for patients after total joint replacement surgery who were healthy and had social support. For sicker patients, availability of 24-hour medical and nursing care may be needed, but intensive therapy services did not seem to provide additional improvement in functional recovery in these patients.

### Postacute management of older adults suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture: a consensus statement from the international geriatric fracture society [^ed97cae0]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients require some form of PAC after a hip fracture. Postacute care may be delivered at home (including senior living centers and assisted living facilities) with physical therapists and nurses, in a skilled nursing facility or, in complicated cases, an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. The focus of the statements in this article is institutional-based PAC in nursing facilities (NF).

The general aim of PAC interventions is to restore patients to their preinjury level of function. In the case of hip fracture patients, many other aspects of care are important, calling for some standardization of PAC for this population (Table 1). - There is a subgroup of patients who suffer a hip fracture and do not undergo surgical repair. Part of this group represents those for whom surgery is not indicated due to the type of fracture, and the other part includes patients who due to their functional status at the time of the injury or severity of illness cannot undergo or might not benefit from surgical management. This approach to care is especially relevant for long-term residents of nursing homes with advanced dementia. Some of the recommendations in this document might not apply to this patient population.

### An evaluation of the outcome metric' days alive and at home' in older patients after hip fracture surgery [^774adff4]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Among 514 patients (65%) who survived and returned to their home, median (IQR [range]) DAH 90 was 71 (56–83 [4–88]) days. Out of these, 189 (37%) were discharged early (discharged within postoperative 2 weeks) with a majority (167, 88%) returning to their nursing home and only 22 (12%) to their own home.

Overall median (IQR [range]) DAH 30 was 2 (0–21 [0–28]) days; among them, 374 patients (47%) did not return home, including 87 patients who died and 287 who remained in hospital or a new care facility during this period. For those who did return to their home, median (IQR [range]) DAH 30 was 20 (10–24 [1–28]) days.

The results for associations between baseline characteristics or peri‐operative factors and failure to return home are reported in Table 2. The odds of not returning home increased about two‐fold for patients aged ≥ 85 y, compared with younger patients. We note also that the odds of failure to return home was about one and a half times greater when pre‐operative dementia was present, compared with when it was absent. Other factors associated with failure to return home were as follows: male sex; pre‐operative anaemia; and postoperative acute renal impairment. There was also a tendency towards an association with increasing ASA physical status.

The association between failure to return home within 90 postoperative days and baseline characteristics or peri‐operative factors.

The results for associations between baseline characteristics or peri‐operative factors and number of days at home, among patients who did return home within 90 days, are reported in Table 3. The odds of a patient having an additional day at home decreased by 21% among patients aged 85–89 y, compared with younger patients. However, this negative age effect was not apparent among older patients aged > 89 y. Moreover, the odds of a patient having an additional day at home increased about two and a half fold when pre‐operative dementia was present, compared with when it was absent.

Defining the strength of recommendation — judging the quality of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a CPG recommendation, and strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation, including how likely future evidence could overturn it; it is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect, but it is much more likely that future evidence will overturn recommendations derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are given a strong strength of recommendation, whereas statements based on the latter are presented as options to the practicing clinician with either a limited strength or, in the event of no supporting or only conflicting evidence, a consensus strength.

### Moving toward evidence-based practice [^2dc6767e]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

"Evidence-based practice" involves applying the best available evidence to the care of individuals. Explicit, systematic methods have developed for determining what is the best available evidence. However, often even the highest-level evidence is not thoroughly or effectively used in practice, even if it is widely known. We must rigorously and critically analyze study results to understand their strengths, limitations, and generalizability, and bear in mind that our knowledge will evolve and thereby change our practice. The clinical question is not always how to apply the evidence but whether the available evidence applies to a particular patient. We should always ask whether the right provider is doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time in the right setting with the right resources.

### Inpatient vs outpatient total hip replacement… [^c4bf103e]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Furthermore, functional and symptomatic goals need to be clearly defined. In these educational sessions, pain management strategies are one of the main focuses. To have a successful same day discharge, patients must be well versed in pain management and proper rehabilitation strategies. Before the preoperative class, all patients are instructed to practice certain skills, such as bed transfer, cane/crutches use and gait training. Potential complications are discussed so that the patient is reassured with what is normally supposed to happen following surgery. The goal of preoperative care is that the patient has a defined set of goals and expectations for their surgery, medications, and rehabilitation. The combination of this early rehabilitation program, combined with the minimally invasive surgical technique is vital to the rapid recovery process. Home physical therapy should begin immediately, with a focus on ambulation.

The patient is then asked for a follow-up visit within 1 week of the surgery to make sure all of the patient's goals have been met. The primary concern with outpatient THA is safety of the patient. There are also concerns including emergency room readmissions in patients who have difficulty once home in the immediate postoperative period. Furthermore, some patients will require transfer to an inpatient facility when they are experiencing a delayed recovery after surgery. Anecdotal data was collected prior to the start of this research project. Since there was a clinical practice change, informal conversations with outpatient THA demonstrated that 10/11 patients would have outpatient surgery again, and 9/11 would recommend outpatient THA surgery to others. These encouraging findings are an important justification for performing the present study.
- Patients in the outpatient group are discharged the same day following surgery.

All patients are required to meet the discharge criteria to be sent home.
- **Interventions**:
- Procedure: Outpatient Active Comparator: Inpatient
- Patients in the inpatient group stay in the hospital overnight and then are discharged home the next day. All patients are required to meet the discharge criteria to be sent home.

### Postoperative care… [^62585b43]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

HOW QUICKLY SHOULD SURGERY BE PERFORMED. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 2021 clinical practice guideline recommends operative management within 24 to 48 hours of injury unless a delay is needed to stabilize comorbidities. ANESTHESIA Spinal or general anesthesia are used intraoperatively. A randomized superiority trial of 1, 600 patients demonstrated that incidence of death or the ability to ambulate at 60 days did not differ between spinal vs. general anesthesia. 32 Peripheral nerve blocks on admission and postoperatively offer additional pain management and improve outcomes. 28, 33. VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM PROPHYLAXIS Patients with hip fracture are at high risk of venous thromboembolism caused by immobility, so chemoprophylaxis is recommended over mechanical prophylaxis alone.

TRANSFUSION The threshold for blood transfusion in asymptomatic postoperative patients with hip fracture is a hemoglobin level less than 8 g per dL, unless cardiac contraindications exist.
28. REHABILITATION Early rehabilitation and weight-bearing initiated within 24 hours postoperatively are associated with improved mobility outcomes. 39 Following hospital discharge, inpatient and home-based rehabilitation are options, depending on the specific needs of the patient. 40 Physical therapists can help guide and individualize the approach to rehabilitation. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE Physical activity is effective for primary and secondary prevention of hip fractures. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS Primary care physicians should consider a full geriatric assessment for patients at high risk for falls.

A formal home safety assessment and medication reconciliation should be performed, with deliberate discontinuation of nonessential medications that can increase fall risk or decrease BMD. MANAGEMENT If femoral neck stress fracture is confirmed on imaging, treatment depends on whether the fracture is on the tension side or the compression side. For tension-sided stress fracture, immediate surgical consultation is indicated for consideration of percutaneous screw fixation. 62, 63 Even with a lower-risk, compression-sided fracture, if surgical consultation recommends no surgery, patients must remain non–weight-bearing until pain improves and repeat imaging demonstrates evidence of healing. Based on expert opinion, gradual progression to weight-bearing activities over the course of four to six weeks can then begin. 61.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^44373fb2]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Supervised exercise vs unsupervised exercise after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for small tears — Visits of physical therapy for supervision of exercises that are performed independently at home do not provide greater improvements in pain and function outcomes (at 3 months, up to 1 year) compared to a single session of physical therapist instruction followed by an independent home program in patients following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for small tears. Quality of Evidence is Moderate and Strength of Recommendation is Moderate. In a randomized trial comparing a single session instruction of a 2-phase home exercise program to the same program with additional supervised visits, there were no clinically meaningful differences in pain and function outcomes at 3 months and 1 year follow up. In multimodal programs, at 6, 12 and 24 weeks post-operative comparable outcomes were reported between individualized supervised physiotherapy and a standardized unsupervised home exercise program, though functional deficits of 14% and 32% were reported in the individualized physiotherapy group and standardized home exercise group, respectively, at 24 weeks post-operatively, with methodological limitations including a high number (28%) of patients (9/32) crossed over to the supervised therapy group and missing data up to 31% for the PT group and 44% for the HEP group. In contrast, another randomized trial reported supervised multi-modal physical therapy resulted in improved short term (3 and 6 week) outcomes versus an independent home exercise program. Potential harms include cost and resource use when postoperative interventions are limited only to supervision of the same exercises done independently at home.

### Does implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery program for hip replacement improve quality of recovery in an Australian private hospital: a quality improvement study [^147151d0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Enhanced recovery after surgery programs may improve recovery and reduce duration of hospital stay after joint replacement surgery. However, uptake is incomplete, and the relative importance of program components is unknown. This before-and-after quality improvement study was designed to determine whether adding 'non-surgical' components, to pre-existing 'surgical' components, in an Australian private healthcare setting, would improve patient recovery after total hip replacement.

Methods

We prospectively collected data regarding care processes and health outcomes of 115 consecutive patients undergoing hip replacement with a single surgeon in a private hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Based on this data, a multidisciplinary team (surgeon, anesthetists, nurse unit managers, physiotherapists, perioperative physician) chose and implemented 12 'non-surgical' program components. Identical data were collected from a further 115 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was Quality of Recovery-15 score at 6 weeks postoperatively; the linear regression model was adjusted for baseline group differences.

Results

The majority of health outcomes, including the primary outcome measure, were similar in pre- and post-implementation groups (quality of recovery score, pain rating and disability score, at time-points up to six weeks postoperatively). The proportion of patients with zero oral morphine equivalent consumption at six weeks increased from 57 to 80% (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13, 1.58). Mean (SD) length of hospital stay decreased from 5.94 (5.21) to 5.02 (2.46) days but was not statistically significant once adjusted for baseline group differences.

Four of ten measurable program components were successfully implemented. Antiemetic prophylaxis increased by 53% (risk ratio [RR] 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16, 2.02). Tranexamic acid use increased by 41% (RR 95% CI 1.18, 1.68). Postoperative physiotherapy treatment on the day of surgery increased by 87% (RR 95% CI 1.36, 2.59). Postoperative patient mobilisation ≥ three metres on the day of surgery increased by 151% (RR 95% CI 1.27, 4.97).

Conclusions

Implementation of a full enhanced recovery after surgery program, and optimal choice of program components, remains a challenge. Improved implementation of non-surgical components of a program may further reduce duration of acute hospital stay, while maintaining quality of recovery.

### Clozapine [^47e25c24]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy

Prior to initiating treatment with clozapine tablets, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline ANC must be at least 1500/μL for the general population, and at least 1000/μL for patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be monitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Dosing Information

The starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose can be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum dose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided dosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Clozapine tablets can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

2.3 Maintenance Treatment

Generally, patients responding to clozapine tablets should continue maintenance treatment on their effective dose beyond the acute episode.

2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment

Method of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patient's last ANC:

See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt treatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.
Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of clozapine therapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.
For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of the existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their ANC is ≥ 1500/μL and for BEN patients until their ANC is ≥ 1000/μL or above their baseline.
Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature of 38.5°C or 101.3°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms related to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### Estimating the societal benefits of THA after accounting for work status and productivity: a Markov model approach [^ba6ae098]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Direct Costs

We used the Medicare Carrier, Home Health Agency, Inpatient, Outpatient, and Skilled Nursing Facility 5% sample Limited Data Sets from 2009 to 2011 to estimate direct costs for THAs and revision THAs. Patients who received THA were identified using ICD-9 procedure code 81.51 with a principal diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis (ICD-9 diagnosis code 715.x5). We identified instances of revision hip replacement using ICD-9 procedure code 81.53. The sample was limited to patients with Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. We excluded patients who died during the episode period or who had multiple primary hip replacements.

Our direct cost estimate for surgical patients was computed by averaging total payments 1 year after surgery. We assumed that, if these patients had not received surgery, their healthcare utilization in the subsequent year would equal prior-year utilization. For revision, we computed direct costs for 3 months following revision, and assumed that direct costs for the remainder of the year resembled those of patients who had primary hip replacement. Direct costs include spending for services provided in hospitals (inpatient and outpatient), home, physician offices, and postacute care settings. Payments were inflated to 2011 US dollars using the Medicare standardized amounts and conversion factors of each setting. Medicare payments were converted to all-payer payment rates using a conversion factor. We assumed a successful primary or revision THA reduced direct medical costs related to symptomatic osteoarthritis by USD 590.

Utilities

We obtained utilities from Mota for five of the health states in our study: (1) nonsurgery; (2) end-stage hip OA; (3) more severe OA; (4) successful post-THA; (5) post-first revision THA.

These utilities, synthesized by Mota in a literature review, were based on studies researching individual patient data of quality of life with the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. We calculated the utilities for the other two health states: (1) initial post-THA and (2) post-second THA revision. The utility of initial post-THA state was a combination of 25% of the pre-THA utility and 75% of post-THA utility. The utility of post-second THA revision was calculated based on the assumption that post-second THA revision utility could reach 90% of the utility for post-first THA revision (Table 1).

### The cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials [^2c498fd1]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Some of the items in the tool, such as methods for randomisation, require only a single assessment for each trial included in the review. For other items, such as blinding and incomplete outcome data, two or more assessments may be used because they generally need to be made separately for different outcomes (or for the same outcome at different time points). However, we recommend that review authors limit the number of assessments used by grouping outcomes — for example, as subjective or objective for the purposes of assessing blinding of outcome assessment or as "patient reported at 6 months" or "patient reported at 12 months" for assessing risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^acf36cb5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Pretreatment Evaluation

Evaluate all patients for a bleeding disorder before starting enoxaparin sodium treatment, unless treatment is urgently needed.

Abdominal Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg by subcutaneous injection once a day (with the initial dose given 2 hours prior to surgery) in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 30 mg every 12 hours administered by subcutaneous injection in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. Administer the initial dose 12 to 24 hours after surgery, provided that hemostasis has been established. The usual duration of administration is 7 to 10 days [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

A dose of enoxaparin sodium of 40 mg once a day subcutaneously may be considered for hip replacement surgery for up to 3 weeks. Administer the initial dose 12 (± 3) hours prior to surgery.

Medical Patients during Acute Illness

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 40 mg once a day administered by subcutaneous injection for medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications due to severely restricted mobility during acute illness. The usual duration of administration is 6 to 11 days [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, who can be treated at home in an outpatient setting.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours administered subcutaneously or 1.5 mg/kg once a day administered subcutaneously at the same time every day for inpatient (hospital) treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism or patients with acute deep vein thrombosis without pulmonary embolism (who are not candidates for outpatient treatment).

In both outpatient and inpatient (hospital) treatments, initiate warfarin sodium therapy when appropriate (usually within 72 hours of enoxaparin sodium). Continue enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect has been achieved (International Normalization Ratio 2 to 3). The average duration of administration is 7 days [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Comparison of highly intensive home-based post-acute care to inpatient program for patients with fragility fractures after surgery [^4333a7e1]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The population of Taiwan is aging similar to world trends. Taiwan is predicted to become a super-aged society soon, which means 20% of the population will comprise elderly people (≥ 65 years). As people getting older, the risk of fragility fracture increases, and common affected site including spine, hip, wrist, and pelvis. This causes disability as well as high mortality. - With the improvement in medical care, diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based reimbursement systems have led to shorter hospital stays. However, patients with fragility fractures often experience pain, disability, and barriers after discharge. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop post-acute care (PAC) programs to enable these patients to regain their health.

The PAC program is intended to help patients discharged from hospital after acute care to return home successfully, live independently, and restore their function by providing them continuous care and rehabilitation. Common PAC providers include inpatient rehabilitation facilities, home health agencies, and skilled nursing facilities. In previous studies, patients who received home-based PAC (HPAC) or inpatient PAC (IPAC) could significantly improve their ambulation performances, and activities of daily living (ADLs). However, some studies reported that patients in the home-based group had better outcomes in functional recovery and balance confidence than those in the inpatient group. - Compared with inpatient rehabilitation, home-based rehabilitation has lower risks of complications and readmissions after joint replacement. In contrast, Seitz, et al. found that, compared with the control group, the rates of using long-term care were lower in the HPAC group, but of mortality were lower in the IPAC group. Therefore, both the HPAC and the IPAC programs would be an important factor for recovery after an orthopedic surgery.

After being discharged from the acute care, however, it was rare for patients in Taiwan to receive any kind of PAC. Therefore, patients may need further long-term care. Since July 2017, the National Health Insurance Administration in Taiwan has launched HPAC and IPAC projects for fragility fracture patients, providing within three weeks care services in order to help patients recovery, reduce medical cost, and release the burden on patients' families.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the HPAC to the IPAC programs for patients with fragility fractures in Taiwan.
