## Question

How does risperidone affect serum prolactin levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how risperidone affects serum prolactin levels and what the clinical implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism by which risperidone elevates prolactin. Then, I should verify the magnitude and time course of prolactin elevation across populations. Next, I will examine dose–response and sex differences. After that, I need to check the clinical consequences and monitoring guidance. Finally, I will consider management strategies and special populations, and I should confirm how to distinguish risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia from other causes before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Risperidone blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, removing the normal tonic inhibition of pituitary lactotrophs and thereby increasing prolactin secretion. Importantly, its active metabolite paliperidone contributes substantially to this effect, and both parent drug and metabolite have high D2 affinity with relatively slow dissociation, which sustains prolactin elevation during chronic therapy [^116FYBqL] [^115MYSgT] [^115SESKP].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and prevalence across populations. In adults with schizophrenia, risperidone produces marked prolactin elevations that are among the highest among antipsychotics, with frequent hyperprolactinemia and dose-related increases; in pediatric populations, placebo-controlled trials show 49–87% of risperidone-treated youth develop elevated prolactin depending on indication, with galactorrhea and gynecomastia reported in clinical trials [^114zwVt5] [^112efys6] [^113L8jbP].

> I should double-check the time course. Acutely, prolactin rises within hours of dosing and can double by about 6 hours. With continued treatment, levels often peak within 1–2 months and may partially decline thereafter, though elevations persist during chronic administration and typically normalize within about 3 days after discontinuation in drug-induced cases, which helps distinguish persistent pharmacologic blockade from other etiologies [^111JM3C9] [^115qixkj] [^1159xoFg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose and sex effects. I need to check whether higher doses drive larger increases and whether females are more affected. Multiple sources indicate dose-dependent prolactin elevation with risperidone, and females generally experience greater absolute increases than males; pediatric data also show higher incidence and magnitude of hyperprolactinemia in females, aligning with broader sex-based differences in prolactin physiology and drug response [^114zwVt5] [^112efys6] [^112RkB4s].

> Next, I should review clinical consequences. Hyperprolactinemia can suppress GnRH, leading to hypogonadism with menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. Chronic hyperprolactinemia with hypogonadism may reduce bone mineral density, and tissue culture data suggest a subset of breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, though epidemiologic data in risperidone users have not shown a consistent increase in breast cancer risk to date [^116FYBqL] [^1146WaXC] [^117W1s2T].

> I need to ensure monitoring recommendations are clear. Guidelines advise routinely asking about menstrual changes, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and sexual dysfunction when initiating and during therapy with prolactin-elevating antipsychotics; obtaining a baseline prolactin and at least one follow-up is prudent, with repeat testing if symptoms emerge or dosing changes occur, and in symptomatic suspected drug-induced cases, holding the antipsychotic for 3 days and remeasuring can help confirm causality [^114VpLhE] [^1159xoFg] [^112MSUJk].

> Let me consider management strategies. First-line options include dose reduction to the lowest effective dose or switching to a prolactin-sparing agent such as aripiprazole, quetiapine, or clozapine; switching from risperidone to olanzapine or aripiprazole typically normalizes prolactin and improves related symptoms within weeks. If switching is undesirable, adjunctive low-dose aripiprazole (often around 5 mg/day) can reliably lower prolactin and improve prolactin-related adverse effects, with meta-analytic data showing large mean reductions and good tolerability; dopamine agonists like cabergoline can be considered in selected cases but require caution due to potential psychiatric activation [^111PEVqX] [^114jBBd1] [^1126eE97] [^114n7Ce3] [^116d6yWW].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent or has first-episode psychosis. I should confirm that youth are particularly vulnerable to prolactin elevation with risperidone, with high rates of hyperprolactinemia and measurable clinical effects, and that early-phase psychosis cohorts show sustained prolactin elevations with risperidone relative to some comparators; this strengthens the case for proactive monitoring and early intervention if prolactin-related adverse effects emerge [^112efys6] [^116Hafhy] [^115R5h6t].

> I should double-check how to differentiate risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia from other causes. Macroprolactin can artifactually elevate immunoassay results, so if the clinical picture is discordant, measuring macroprolactin is reasonable; additionally, stress and certain medical conditions can raise prolactin, and a short medication hold with re-measurement helps confirm drug causality when clinically safe, aligning with endocrine guidance for suspected drug-induced hyperprolactinemia [^112mhEqU] [^1159xoFg] [^112MSUJk].

> In summary, risperidone predictably elevates serum prolactin via potent D2 antagonism, with contributions from paliperidone, producing dose-dependent, often substantial increases that are typically more pronounced in females. Elevations begin within hours, peak over weeks, and persist with chronic therapy, carrying risks of reproductive and sexual dysfunction and potential bone effects, which warrant routine symptom inquiry, judicious baseline and on-treatment prolactin monitoring, and timely management via dose reduction, switching, or adjunctive aripiprazole when indicated [^116FYBqL] [^112efys6] [^1126eE97].

Risperidone increases serum prolactin by **blocking dopamine D2 receptors** in the tuberoinfundibular pathway [^116HZKyq], removing dopamine's inhibitory control of prolactin secretion [^115SESKP]. This causes **dose-dependent hyperprolactinemia** [^114zwVt5] that persists with chronic use [^1146WaXC] and is generally higher than with most other antipsychotics [^1146WaXC]. Prolactin typically rises within hours of dosing, peaks at 4–6 weeks, and may return toward baseline with continued therapy, though levels often remain elevated [^115qixkj]. Hyperprolactinemia can cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and reduced bone density [^116FYBqL]; management includes dose reduction, switching to a prolactin-sparing agent, or adding aripiprazole [^1126eE97] [^114n7Ce3].

---

## Mechanism of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia

Risperidone **blocks dopamine D2 receptors** in the tuberoinfundibular pathway [^116HZKyq], removing dopamine's inhibition of prolactin and increasing secretion [^116FYBqL]. Its active metabolite, paliperidone, has similar D2 affinity and contributes to sustained elevation [^115MYSgT] [^116uhq9P].

---

## Magnitude and prevalence of prolactin elevation

- **Dose-dependent elevation**: Higher doses cause greater prolactin increases [^114zwVt5] [^114P27SP].
- **Higher than many antipsychotics**: Risperidone's prolactin elevation exceeds most other agents [^1146WaXC] [^112uAjok].
- **Pediatric data**: In youth, 49–87% develop hyperprolactinemia, with median increases of 29–83 ng/mL depending on dose and sex [^112efys6] [^115BW5k7].

---

## Time course of prolactin elevation

Prolactin rises within hours of dosing, peaks at **4–6 weeks**, and may decline toward baseline with continued therapy, though levels often remain elevated [^115qixkj] [^111JM3C9].

---

## Clinical consequences of hyperprolactinemia

- **Reproductive effects**: Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, and infertility [^116FYBqL] [^1154sxxT].
- **Bone health**: Chronic hyperprolactinemia can reduce bone density and increase fracture risk [^116FYBqL] [^115t57mb].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Decreased libido and erectile dysfunction are common [^116FYBqL] [^116Hafhy].

---

## Management strategies

- **Dose reduction**: Lowering dose can reduce prolactin [^113HRWMN].
- **Switching**: Move to a prolactin-sparing agent (e.g. aripiprazole, quetiapine) [^1126eE97] [^115Q8rSc].
- **Adjunctive aripiprazole**: Low-dose aripiprazole (≤ 5 mg/day) can normalize prolactin without worsening psychosis [^1126eE97] [^114n7Ce3].
- **Dopamine agonists**: Cabergoline or bromocriptine can be used cautiously if needed [^116d6yWW].

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

| **Antipsychotic** | **Prolactin elevation** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Risperidone | High | Greater than most SGAs [^1146WaXC] [^112uAjok] |
| Paliperidone | High | Similar to risperidone [^116uhq9P] |
| Haloperidol | Moderate | Typical antipsychotic [^116Dcv4Z] |
| Olanzapine | Moderate | Lower than risperidone [^114zwVt5] |
| Quetiapine | Low | Minimal prolactin effect [^113jZmrf] |
| Aripiprazole | Low | Partial agonist; often lowers prolactin [^1126eE97] |

---

Risperidone causes **significant, dose-dependent hyperprolactinemia** via D2 blockade, with clinical effects including reproductive and bone consequences; management includes dose reduction, switching, or adjunctive aripiprazole.

### Add-on effects of a low-dose aripiprazole in resolving hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone or paliperidone [^114n7Ce3]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effects of a low-dose aripiprazole adjunctive treatment for risperidone- or paliperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in Han Chinese women with schizophrenia. After 4 weeks of risperidone or paliperidone treatment, 60 out of 66 patients improved significantly and experienced hyperprolactinemia. They were randomly assigned to the treatment group (aripiprazole adjunctive treatment) (n = 30) or control group (non-adjunctive treatment) (n = 30). The dosage of risperidone and paliperidone were maintained; and aripiprazole was maintained at 5mg/day during the 8-week study period. The prolactin levels at the end of the 8th week were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group. The estradiol level correlated negatively with serum prolactin level both in the treatment group and the control group at the end of the 8th week and the 4th week respectively. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score improved significantly during the 8-week study period in both groups. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse event was similar in two groups. Low-dose aripiprazole adjunctive treatment is effective in relieving risperidone- and paliperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in female schizophrenic patients without increasing adverse event.

Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia — evidence summary indicates that the most frequent cause of nontumoral hyperprolactinemia is medications, with neuroleptics/antipsychotic agents most commonly causing hyperprolactinemia; among patients taking typical antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines or butyrophenones), 40–90% have hyperprolactinemia, as do 50–100% of patients on risperidone; and with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, prolactin levels increase slowly after oral administration and it usually takes 3 d for levels to return to normal after discontinuation.

### Adjunctive aripiprazole for antipsychotic-related hyperprolactinaemia in patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a meta-analysis [^1126eE97]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common antipsychotic (AP)-induced adverse effect, particularly in female patients.

Aims

This meta-analysis examined the efficacy and safety of adjunctive aripiprazole in preventing AP-related hyperprolactinaemia in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.

Methods

PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, WanFang and China Journal Net databases were searched to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Primary outcomes were the reductions of serum prolactin level and prolactin-related symptoms. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and analysed using RevMan (V.5.3). Weighted/standardised mean differences (WMDs/SMDs)± 95% CIs were reported.

Results

In the five RCTs (n = 400), the adjunctive aripiprazole (n = 197) and the control groups (n = 203) with a mean of 11.2 weeks of treatment duration were compared. The aripiprazole group had a significantly lower endpoint serum prolactin level in all patients (five RCTs, n = 385; WMD: −50.43 ng/mL (95% CI: −75.05 to −25.81), p < 0.00001; I² = 99%), female patients (two RCTs, n = 186; WMD: −22.58 ng/mL (95% CI: −25.67 to −19.49), p < 0.00001; I² = 0%) and male patients (two RCTs, n = 127; WMD: −68.80 ng/mL (95% CI: −100.11 to −37.49), p < 0.0001). In the sensitivity analysis for the endpoint serum prolactin level in all patients, the findings remained significant (p < 0.00001; I² = 96%). The aripiprazole group was superior to the control group in improving negative symptoms as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (three RCTs, n = 213; SMD: −0.51 (95% CI: −0.79 to −0.24), p = 0.0002; I² = 0%). Adverse effects and discontinuation rates were similar between the two groups.

Conclusions

Adjunctive aripiprazole appears to be associated with reduced AP-induced hyperprolactinaemia and improved prolactin-related symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.

### Risk of breast cancer in risperidone users: a nationwide cohort study [^117W1s2T]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several antipsychotics, especially risperidone, are known to increase serum prolactin. Hyperprolactinemia has been linked to the development of mammary gland tumors in animal studies. We therefore investigated the risk of breast cancer in a nationwide cohort of women using risperidone or other antipsychotics.

Methods

All women, 18years or older, who initiated treatment with risperidone or any other antipsychotic between 2006 and 2012 were identified in Swedish nationwide registers. Patients with two consecutive dispensations of the same antipsychotic within 3months, no previous cancer diagnosis, and no previous dispensations of paliperidone were included. The final cohort consisted of 55976 women of whom 22908, 24524, and 8544 were exposed to risperidone, other atypical antipsychotics, and typical antipsychotics, respectively. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between antipsychotics and breast cancer.

Results

Patients were followed prospectively, the mean follow-up time ranging from 2.4 to 2.8years between treatment groups. After adjusting for age, there was no increased risk for breast cancer among risperidone users compared to patients exposed to another atypical antipsychotic (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72–1.22) or a typical antipsychotic (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.94–1.66). Analyses stratified by tumor stage, using active treatment follow-up time, or including only treatment naïve patients did not reveal any noteworthy change in the results.

Conclusion

Risperidone use does not confer an increased short-term risk of breast cancer compared to other antipsychotic agents.

### Effects of aripiprazole on prolactin levels in subjects with schizophrenia during cross-titration with risperidone or olanzapine: analysis of a randomized, open-label study [^111PEVqX]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia, an adverse effect associated with the use of typical antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, has both acute and chronic clinical consequences. One option for clinical management is switching to an agent with a lower liability for inducing hyperprolactinemia. This post-hoc sub-analysis of an 8-week, open-label study in outpatients with schizophrenia (CN138–215) examined short-term effects on prolactin levels during a switch from risperidone or olanzapine to aripiprazole 30 mg/day. Three switch strategies were used: (I) immediate aripiprazole initiation with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of olanzapine/risperidone; (II) immediate aripiprazole initiation while tapering off olanzapine/risperidone over 14 days; (III) titrating aripiprazole upwards while tapering off olanzapine/risperidone over 14 days. Changes in prolactin levels from baseline to each last observation carried forward time point were compared with t-tests using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This sub-analysis included 269 subjects: 105 previously treated with risperidone; 164 previously treated with olanzapine. Mean baseline prolactin levels (ng/mL) were within normal range for the three olanzapine groups (Group-I, 11.7; Group-II, 13.2; Group-III, 11.2), but above normal for the risperidone groups (Group-I, 39.7; Group-II, 48.5; Group-III, 33.5). Following aripiprazole initiation, mean prolactin levels decreased significantly (p < 0.001) at week-1 and were maintained to week-8 in all groups irrespective of prior treatment. Previously elevated prolactin levels in the risperidone groups were reduced to within normal range within 1 week, irrespective of switching strategy. Tolerability was good regardless of prior medication or switching strategy. Overall, rapid decreases of prolactin levels were achieved safely with all three aripiprazole switching strategies. Reversal of hyperprolactinemia during the crossover period indicates the safety and potential utility of aripiprazole addition in patients with elevated prolactin.

### Treatment challenges and safety considerations for antipsychotic use in children and adolescents with psychoses [^114gUBtx]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

With increased prescribing of psychotropic medications to children and adolescents, more attention should be given to the safety and tolerability of these drugs in this population. Compared with adults, children are especially vulnerable to adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), sedation, weight gain, and prolactin elevation. The prevalence of EPS is much higher in children treated with conventional antipsychotics than in those given atypical antipsychotics. Sedation, which can be minimized through gradual dose escalation, is common with risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. The relative propensities for producing weight gain in children and adolescents are olanzapine > risperidone > quetiapine. All conventional and some atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone) increase serum prolactin levels. Nonetheless, preclinical studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics may have neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system; further studies, especially in children and adolescents, are required to confirm these results.

### Prolactin elevation with antipsychotic medications: mechanisms of action and clinical consequences [^1153gHrT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.

### Cabergoline treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia: a pilot study [^116d6yWW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

D(2) blockers, including the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, induce hyper-prolactinemia in a significant number of patients treated. The endocrine and sexual side effects related to hyperprolactinemia significantly impair tolerability and compliance in patients, including those with a good response to risperidone. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a low dose of cabergoline, a D(2) agonist, in the treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia.

Method

Nineteen male and female DSM-IV-defined schizophrenic patients who were clinical responders to risperidone but were suffering from symptomatic hyperprolactinemia were treated with cabergoline, 0.125 to 0.250 mg/week for 8 weeks. Plasma prolactin level was assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Data were collected from January 2002 to April 2003.

Results

After cabergoline treatment, the mean decrease in plasma prolactin levels was statistically significant (p < .05) for the total sample, and 11 patients showed remission of clinical signs with prolactin values within the normal range. No side effect was observed or reported, and the patients' psychopathology was unchanged.

Conclusions

Results suggest that low-dose cabergoline treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia may be safe and clinically effective in a relevant number of patients.

### Hyperprolactinemia in antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode psychosis [^112giKNq]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinemia is frequent in patients with schizophrenic psychoses. It is usually regarded as an adverse effect of antipsychotics but has recently also been shown in patients without antipsychotic medication. Our objective was to test whether hyperprolactinemia occurs in antipsychotic-naive first-episode patients (FEPs).

Method

In the framework of the European First Episode Schizophrenia Trial (EUFEST), 249 out of 498 FEPs were eligible for this study, of whom 74 were antipsychotic naive. All patients were investigated regarding their serum prolactin levels with immunoassays standardized against the 3rd International Reference Standard 84/500.

Results

Twenty-nine (39%) of the 74 antipsychotic-naive patients showed hyperprolactinemia not explained by any other reason, 11 (50%) of 22 women and 18 (35%) of 52 men.

Conclusions

Hyperprolactinemia may be present in patients with schizophrenic psychoses independent of antipsychotic medication. It might be stress induced. As enhanced prolactin can increase dopamine release through a feedback mechanism, this could contribute to explaining how stress can trigger the outbreak of psychosis.

### Antipsychotic-related prolactin levels and sexual dysfunction in mentally ill youth: a 3-month cohort study [^116Hafhy]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although these agents are used frequently, prospective data comparing serotonin/dopamine antagonists/partial agonists (SDAs) in youth regarding prolactin levels and sexual adverse effects (SeAEs) are scarce.

Method

Youth aged 4 to 17 years, SDA-naive (≤ 1 week exposure) or SDA-free for ≥ 4 weeks were followed for ≤ 12 weeks on clinician's-choice aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Serum prolactin levels, SDA plasma levels, and rating scale-based SeAEs were assessed monthly.

Results

Altogether, 396 youth (aged 14.0 ± 3.1 years, male participants = 55.1%, mood spectrum disorders = 56.3%, schizophrenia spectrum disorders = 24.0%, aggressive-behavior disorders = 19.7%; SDA-naive = 77.8%) were followed for 10.6 ± 3.5 weeks. Peak prolactin levels/any hyperprolactinemia/triple-upper-limit-of-normal-prolactin level were highest with risperidone (median = 56.1 ng/mL/incidence = 93.5%/44.5%), followed by olanzapine (median = 31.4 ng/mL/incidence = 42.7/76.4%/7.3%), quetiapine (median = 19.5 ng/mL/incidence = 39.7%/2.5%) and aripiprazole (median = 7.1 ng/mL/incidence = 5.8%/0.0%) (all p < .0001), with peak levels at 4 to 5 weeks for risperidone and olanzapine. Altogether, 26.8% had ≥ 1 newly incident SeAEs (risperidone = 29.4%, quetiapine = 29.0%, olanzapine = 25.5%, aripiprazole = 22.1%, p = .59). The most common SeAEs were menstrual disturbance = 28.0% (risperidone = 35.4%, olanzapine = 26.7%, quetiapine = 24.4% aripiprazole = 23.9%, p = .58), decreased erections = 14.8% (olanzapine = 18.5%, risperidone = 16.1%, quetiapine = 13.6%, aripiprazole = 10.8%, p = .91) and decreased libido = 8.6% (risperidone = 12.5%, olanzapine = 11.9%, quetiapine = 7.9%, aripiprazole = 2.4%, p = .082), with the least frequent being gynecomastia = 7.8% (quetiapine = 9.7%, risperidone = 9.2%, aripiprazole = 7.8%, olanzapine = 2.6%, p = 0.61), galactorrhea = 6.7% (risperidone = 18.8%, quetiapine = 2.4%, olanzapine = 0.0%, aripiprazole = 0.0%, p = .0008), and mastalgia = 5.8% (olanzapine = 7.3%, risperidone = 6.4%, aripiprazole = 5.7%, quetiapine = 3.9%, p = .84). Postpubertal status and female sex were significantly associated with prolactin levels and SeAEs. Serum prolactin levels were rarely associated with SeAEs (16.7% of all analyzed associations), except for the relationship between severe hyperprolactinemia and decreased libido (p = .013) and erectile dysfunction (p = .037) at week 4, and with galactorrhea at week 4 (p = .0040), week 12 (p = .013), and last visit (p < .001).

Conclusion

Risperidone, followed by olanzapine, was associated with the largest prolactin elevations, with little prolactin-elevating effects of quetiapine and, especially, aripiprazole. Except for risperidone-related galactorrhea, SeAEs did not differ significantly across SDAs, and only galactorrhea, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction were associated with prolactin levels. In youth, SeAEs are not sensitive markers for significantly elevated prolactin levels.

### Risperidone [^112efys6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia

Risperidone has been shown to elevate prolactin levels in children and adolescents as well as in adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 8 weeks duration in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with autistic disorder or psychiatric disorders other than autistic disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar mania, 49% of patients who received risperidone had elevated prolactin levels compared to 2% of patients who received placebo. Similarly, in placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years) with bipolar disorder, or adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, 82–87% of patients who received risperidone had elevated levels of prolactin compared to 3–7% of patients on placebo. Increases were dose-dependent and generally greater in females than in males across indications.

In clinical trials in 1885 children and adolescents, galactorrhea was reported in 0.8% of risperidone-treated patients and gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of risperidone-treated patients.

Growth and Sexual Maturation

The long-term effects of risperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.

Five observational studies were identified which assessed patient experiences with SGAs. The interventions represented in this set of literature included three doses of risperidone (1–6 mg/day, 2–6 mg/day, 25–50 mg biweekly), quetiapine 200–800 mg/day, clozapine 25–900 mg/day, and olanzapine 30 mg/day. Characteristics of included observational studies are presented in Table 1.

Two of the observational studies restricted enrollment to patients with a diagnosis of only schizophrenia. The remaining studies represented patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophreniform disorder. Three of the observational studies also specified disease severity in the inclusion criteria, with PANSS scores restricted to between 40 and 120, 80 or below, and 60 or above.

Treatment durations varied widely, with one observational study reporting on patient outcomes after 3 weeks of treatment, two studies after 12 weeks, one study after 24 weeks, and one three-arm study after 24 weeks for two arms and 48 weeks for the third arm. All observational studies included adolescent patients with ages varying between 10 and 18 years.

One study, published by Pandina and colleagues (2012), adopted a non-conventional comparative observational study methodology. This three-arm study was designed to include one arm with 24 weeks prior treatment experience with risperidone 2–6 mg/day (treatment-experienced arm), one arm with no risperidone experience (treatment-naïve arm), and one arm with varying levels of treatment experience prior to study treatment (open-label arm). At enrollment, patients received 24 weeks open-label treatment with risperidone 2–6 mg/day, thus resulting in one arm with 48 weeks of treatment experience and two arms with 24 weeks of treatment experience.

### Differences in plasma prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia treated on monotherapy with five second-generation antipsychotics [^116aDjNS]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are characterized by fewer prolactin (PRL)-related side effects compared with first-generation antipsychotics, the detailed effects of SGAs on the plasma PRL levels still remain unclear. We examined the differences in plasma PRL levels among 268 patients treated for schizophrenia with olanzapine (OLZ), risperidone (RIS), aripiprazole (ARP), quetiapine (QTP), or perospirone (PER). The participants had received antipsychotic monotherapy with stable doses of OLZ, RIS, ARP, QTP, or PER for ≥ 3 weeks, and fasting blood samples were drawn to examine plasma PRL levels. The differences in median plasma PRL levels in all (P < 0.001), male (P < 0.001) and female patients (P < 0.001) among the five SGA groups were statistically significant. A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that ARP treatment was found to contribute to lower plasma PRL level, while female sex, RIS, OLZ and chlorpromazine equivalent dose were found to contribute to a higher plasma PRL level. The median value of plasma PRL level in the RIS group was twice as much compared with that in the OLZ group, although this was not statistically significant. In this study, OLZ had a considerable effect on plasma PRL level, similar to RIS, while PER did not affect plasma PRL levels, similar to QTP. Further studies are needed to clarify the differences in plasma PRL levels among SGAs.

Concomitant Medication

Advise patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Alcohol

Advise patients to avoid alcohol while taking with risperidone [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Pregnancy

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with risperidone. Advise patients that risperidone may cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in a neonate. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to risperidone during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise breastfeeding women using risperidone to monitor infants for somnolence, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Infertility

Advise females of reproductive potential that risperidone may impair fertility due to an increase in serum prolactin levels. The effects on fertility are reversible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

### Antipsychotic agents and serum prolactin levels… [^116sTS2p]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In their report of statistically significant increases in serum prolactin levels among hypertensive patients receiving reserpine Dr Lee et al suggested that "reserpine may facilitate synthesis or release or it may delay degradation of prolactin even when the drug is given for as long as 23 years". The antipsychotic agents include a number of major classes of drugs, one of which is reserpine, the most widely used derivative of Rauwolfia serpentina. Today, the reserpines are essentially no longer used in psychiatric treatment because they are less effective and more toxic than many of the other classes. However, the phenothiazines and some other neuroleptic drugs have been clearly demonstrated to increase serum prolactin levels in man. This increase in serum prolactin levels is measurable within 72 hours of initiation of oral administration and persists for up to the three months in subjects who have been. Gold DD.

### Female puberty: clinical implications for the use of prolactin-modulating psychotropics [^114AExeU]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

During puberty, girls may present with psychiatric illness necessitating treatment with psychotropic medications. Pubertal girls are especially vulnerable to medication-associated adverse events. Atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have the potential to elevate prolactin levels, altering pubertal progression. Selection of prolactin-sparing atypical antipsychotics is recommended, as is treatment with the lowest effective dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Monitoring of serum prolactin levels may be necessary.

### Is rational antipsychotic polytherapy feasible? A selective review [^114HUKuu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic polytherapy (APT) has evolved as a common treatment strategy at odds with recommendations from schizophrenia treatment guidelines. The literature on combinations with clozapine as a means to enhance efficacy and with aripiprazole to reduce side effects was reviewed. No solid evidence supporting antipsychotic combinations with clozapine for treatment-resistant patients with schizophrenia was identified. The reason for this may be that most combinations with clozapine increase the D(2)-receptor blockade, and this strategy is probably not efficient for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Some basic and clinical evidence for the addition of aripiprazole to lower prolactin levels was identified. In conclusion, there is very limited support in the evidence for the feasibility of rational APT.

### Risk factors of hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone and olanzapine and their correlations with plasma glucose and lipids [^116PQTXM]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinemia is a common adverse reaction in patients with schizophrenia who take antipsychotic drugs; it often leads to treatment non-compliance in patients and has an adverse effect on their prognosis.

Aims

This study aimed to explore the risk factors of elevated prolactin (PRL) caused by risperidone (RIS) and olanzapine (OLZ) and the relationship between PRL and fasting plasma glucose and lipids.

Methods

Patients with schizophrenia were divided into two groups: 264 patients who were taking RIS and 175 patients who were taking OLZ. These two groups were further divided according to serum PRL levels: an elevated PRL group (> 30 ng/mL) and a normal PRL group (PRL ≤ 30 ng/mL). The demographics, medication dosage, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides were compared in the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of elevated PRL levels.

Results

Compared with the OLZ group, the RIS group had a greater number of patients with elevated PRL (155/264 vs 58/175). Either the RIS or the OLZ group, the proportion of elevated PRL was greater in female patients (RIS: χ² = 6.76, p = 0.009; OLZ: χ² = 12.98, p < 0.001) and with higher doses of the related drugs (RIS: U = −3.73, p < 0.001; OLZ: U = −2.31, p = 0.021). In patients taking RIS, the elevated PRL subgroup took the drug for a longer period (U = −2.76, p = 0.006) and had lower triglyceride levels (U = 2.76, p = 0.006). In patients taking OLZ, the elevated PRL subgroup had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (U = 2.29, p = 0.022). Logistic regression analysis showed that gender, dose and fasting glucose levels were significantly associated with elevated PRL levels (RIS: p = 0.001, OLZ: p < 0.001; RIS: p < 0.001; OLZ: p = 0.003; RIS: p = 0.020, OLZ: p = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusion

Compared with OLZ, RIS had a greater effect on PRL in patients with schizophrenia, and in patients with schizophrenia taking RIS or OLZ, gender and dose were significantly correlated with the PRL value. Moreover, the plasma glucose level of the group with elevated PRL was lower than that of the group with normal PRL. The results also showed that high serum PRL may be associated with a favourable glucose metabolic profile in patients with schizophrenia taking RIS or OLZ. Further studies are warranted to confirm this association.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^117KB8Wj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis - Oral

Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are equivalent to approximately 0.2, 0.75, and 3 times (mice) and 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times (rats) the MRHD of 16 mg/day, based on mg/m2body surface area. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There was a significant increase in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreatic adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The table below summarizes the multiples of the human dose on mg/m2(mg/kg) basis at which these tumors occurred.

Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5–6 fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114pB88y]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based current evidence, three recommendations for pharmacotherapy for women with SSD can be made. First, for women taking antipsychotics other than quetiapine with high or normal doses (conform SPC), a dose reduction might be advised. High blood levels (according to the therapeutic range established by Schoretsanitis) indicate that dose reduction and TDM is required. For quetiapine, menopausal status and age should be considered, as sex differences in dose-adjusted serum concentrations depend on estrogen levels and increase with age. Second, estrogen augmentation is effective for both pre- and post-menopausal women, but safety has not yet been studied for a longer duration than 6–8 weeks. Raloxifene augmentation can improve symptom severity during perimenopause and shortly after menopause without increasing the risk for breast and uterus cancer. However, at this point, we cannot provide any evidence-based recommendations for the use of estrogens, raloxifene, or combined contraceptives for premenopausal women, despite their potential value. Before any estrogen-like therapies are considered, women should always be screened for contra-indications including a (family) history of thrombo-embolism, which is a contra-indication. Third, antipsychotic-induced prolactin elevation can be reduced by switching to prolactin-sparing antipsychotics or (when relapse risk is significant), with the addition of aripiprazole. An overview of our recommendations, based on the currently available literature, is shown in Fig. 1. Eventually, these recommendations could be a first step towards female-specific pharmacotherapy. Although better outcome and fewer side effects for women with SSD are expected, the impact of these strategies needs to be confirmed in future RCTs.

### Predominant role of the 9-hydroxy metabolite of risperidone in elevating blood prolactin levels [^115MYSgT]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The atypical antipsychotic risperidone significantly raises plasma prolactin levels in patients, but clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine do not. The differences in neuroendocrine response may be connected with the metabolism of the medications. The authors examined the contributory role of risperidone's active metabolite 9-hydroxy-risperidone by measuring plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, and prolactin.

Method

Blood samples taken from 25 patients with psychotic disorders following 6 weeks of treatment with risperidone (mean dose = 3 mg/day) were examined. Mean plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, and prolactin were 4.6, 19.4, and 49.3 ng/ml, respectively.

Results

The oral dose of risperidone correlated significantly with plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, active moiety, and prolactin. The plasma concentration of 9-hydroxy-risperidone, but not of risperidone, correlated significantly with increases in plasma prolactin.

Conclusions

These data suggest that the 9-hydroxy metabolite plays a predominant role in risperidone's effect on prolactin release.

### Prolactin levels during long-term risperidone treatment in children and adolescents [^115qixkj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This analysis was designed to investigate prolactin levels in children and adolescents on long-term risperidone treatment and explore any relationship with side effects hypothetically attributable to prolactin (SHAP).

Method

Data from 5 clinical trials (total N = 700) were pooled for this post hoc analysis. Children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years with subaverage intelligence quotients and conduct or other disruptive behavior disorders received risperidone treatment (0.02–0.06 mg/kg/day) for up to 55 weeks. Outcome measures analyzed included serum prolactin levels, reported adverse events, and the conduct problem subscore of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form.

Results

Mean prolactin levels rose from 7.8 ng/mL at baseline to a peak of 29.4 ng/mL at weeks 4 to 7 of active treatment, then progressively decreased to 16.1 ng/mL at weeks 40 to 48 (N = 358) and 13.0 ng/mL at weeks 52 to 55 (N = 42). There was no relationship between pro-lactin levels and age. Females returned to a mean value within the normal range (≤ 30 ng/mL) by weeks 8 to 12, and males were close to normal values (≤ 18 ng/mL) by weeks 16 to 24. At least 1 SHAP was reported by 13 (2.2%) of 592 children. There was no direct correlation between prolactin elevation and SHAP.

Conclusion

With long-term risperidone treatment in children and adolescents, serum prolactin levels tended to rise and peak within the first 1 to 2 months and then steadily decline to values within or very close to the normal range by 3 to 5 months.

### Prolactin monitoring in the acute psychiatry setting [^115jygtn]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect associated with psychotropic medication. Limited guidance on its monitoring and management results in inconsistency in practice due to individual clinical variability. A retrospective service evaluation study was conducted on all patients admitted to an acute psychiatric assessment unit in South Wales, United Kingdom, over one calendar year (n = 524), to assess the prevalence and possible causes of hyperprolactinaemia, correlation with symptomatology and monitoring and management by clinicians. The prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in this population (n = 67, 13%) was higher than in the general population. The most common association was medication (n = 39, 58%), particularly Risperidone (n = 19). Illicit substance use (n = 10, 15%), and physical conditions (n = 12, 18%) may also have contributed. However, only 44 (66%) received follow-up for their hyperprolactinaemia. There was a statistically significant difference in the sample means of those that did receive follow-up and those who did not, suggesting a degree of bias in patients selected to receive follow-up. These findings suggest that hyperprolactinaemia is relatively common in patients with mental illness, and that comprehensive guidelines need to be established for the monitoring and management thereof.

Weight Gain

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

Data from an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study with PERSERIS in adult patients with schizophrenia are presented in Table 3.

In an open-label, 12-month long-term safety study, for all patients receiving PERSERIS, mean weight increased approximately 2 kg from baseline to Day 85, then remained stable for the remainder of the study.

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited data from published literature reports the presence of risperidone and its metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, in human breast milk at relative infant dose ranging between 2.3 and 4.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. There are reports of sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in breastfed infants exposed to risperidone (see Clinical Considerations).

There is no information on the effects of risperidone on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for UZEDY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from UZEDY or from the mother's underlying condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to UZEDY through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements).

8.3 Females and Males of
Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Females

Based on the pharmacologic action of risperidone (D2receptor antagonism), treatment with UZEDY may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^114P27SP]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Change in prolactin levels: Change from baseline, treatment-treatment comparison

Figure 2 presents comparisons for change from baseline in prolactin levels between treatments for the overall population. Risperidone 4–6 mg/day reported a greater increase in prolactin levels when compared with the lower dose of 1–3 mg/day. Similarly, both paliperidone 3–6 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day reported a greater increase in prolactin levels when compared with paliperidone 1.5 mg/day. However, the difference between paliperidone 6–12 mg/day and 3–6 mg/day was not statistically significant. Further, no statistically significant differences were reported for the comparisons between quetiapine 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day or between aripiprazole 30 mg/day and 10 mg/day.

Figures 3 and 4 present comparisons of change in prolactin levels from baseline between treatments for the male and female populations, respectively. The comparison between risperidone at 4–6 mg/day and 1–3 mg/day was significant in the female population, but not in the male population, with the higher dose producing a greater change from baseline for both populations. Similarly, comparisons between quetiapine 800 mg/day and 400 mg/day, paliperidone 6–12 mg/day and 1.5 mg/day, and paliperidone 6–12 mg/day and 1.5 mg/day were statistically significant in the male population, but not in the female population, with greater increases observed in the treatments with the higher dose. The comparison between paliperidone 6–12 mg/day and paliperidone 3–6 mg/day was not significant for either patient population.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111pjHdd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced hyperprolactinemia — drug associations and prolactin levels is usually associated with prolactin levels ranging from 25 to 100 μg/ liter, with metoclopramide, risperidone, and phenothiazines sometimes leading to prolactin levels exceeding 200 μg/liter; in one group of 106 antipsychotic-treated patients, hyperprolactinemia was present in 81, 35, 29, and 38% of those taking risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and typical antipsychotics, respectively. Verapamil causes hyperprolactinemia in 8.5% of patients, opiates and cocaine act through the μ-receptor to cause mild hyperprolactinemia, and twelve to 30% of women taking higher estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may have a small increase in serum prolactin.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^117GX9cf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Increased Prolactin

In the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, there was a typical increase in mean prolactin levels in fasting blood samples from baseline to the EOS assessments in both the PERSERIS 90 mg and 120 mg groups, while mean prolactin for the placebo group remained stable during the study. Changes in mean prolactin were dose-dependent and more pronounced in female patients than male patients.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

Several methods were used to measure EPS, including: (1) the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) global clinical rating score which evaluates akathisia, (2) the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores which evaluates dyskinesia, (3) the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) global score which broadly evaluates parkinsonism, and (4) the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS-related adverse reactions.

In the 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the mean changes from baseline in BARS, AIMS, and SAS total scores were comparable between PERSERIS- and placebo-treated patients. At all postbaseline assessments, mean changes from baseline were between -0.1 and 0.2 (inclusive) for the BARS, between 0 and 0.2 (inclusive) for the AIMS and between -0.1 and 0.2 (inclusive) for the SAS.

The rates of ADRs associated with EPS were similar across treatment groups, including placebo. There was a higher incidence of akathisia in the PERSERIS 120 mg (6.8%) group compared with the PERSERIS 90 mg (2.6%) and placebo group (4.2%); reports of extrapyramidal disorders were higher in the PERSERIS 90 mg group (4.3%) compared with the PERSERIS 120 mg (1.7%) and placebo group (0.8%). In contrast, there was a higher incidence of dystonia in the placebo group (2.5%) compared with the PERSERIS groups (0 and 0.9%, respectively).

### Antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinaemia: a series of illustrative case reports [^115R1PGF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side-effect of many antipsychotic drugs but, in comparison to extrapyramidal side-effects, it has received little attention. Four case reports are presented which illustrate important clinical and pharmacological aspects of the syndrome. Two of the cases were caused by conventional antipsychotic drugs and two by risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic. Symptoms included gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea and sexual dysfunction. Three patients were switched to a prolactin sparing antipsychotic leading to normalization of serum prolactin and resolution of the symptoms. Patients prescribed prolactin elevating antipsychotics should, where possible, have this issue explained to them prior to commencing treatment and be screened for symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinaemia before starting treatment and regularly thereafter.

### Risperidone-associated hyperprolactinemia [^117LnXUC]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the prolactogenic effects of risperidone, clozapine, and typical antipsychotic agents in an outpatient community-based psychiatric population.

Methods

Prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were measured in 68 outpatients with schizophrenia who were receiving antipsychotic medications and were recruited from a community mental health clinic.

Results

The percentage of women with increased prolactin concentrations was significantly greater in the risperidone group (100%, 12 of 12 patients) than in the clozapine group (25%, 1 of 4) (P = 0.0071) but not in comparison with the typical antipsychotic agent group (83%, 5 of 6) (P = 0.333). The percentage of men with increased prolactin concentrations was significantly greater in the risperidone group (94%, 17 of 18) than in the clozapine group (18%, 3 of 17) (P < 0.0001) and in comparison with the typical antipsychotic agent group (27%, 3 of 11) (P = 0.0003). The mean prolactin concentration (all ng/mL ± standard deviation) was also significantly higher in patients taking risperidone (women, 125.0 ± 56.6; men, 37.3 ± 23.9) than clozapine (women, 22.0 ± 25.9; men, 13.3 ± 22.4) (female patients, P = 0.0004; male patients, P < 0.0001) or typical antipsychotic agents (women, 69.0 ± 59.8; men, 13. 3 ± 9.1) (female patients, P = 0.036; male patients, P = 0.0003). In the risperidone group, gender affected prolactin level, with women having higher concentrations than men, but the duration of therapy did not. In this group, prolactin was inversely dependent on age. No difference was noted in TSH concentrations between medication groups.

Conclusion

Risperidone is a potent inducer of hyperprolactinemia in outpatients with schizophrenia in a community population. The higher and more frequently increased prolactin concentrations caused by risperidone could adversely affect patient health and compliance.

### Aripiprazole or metformin for hyperprolactinemia in women with schizophrenia: a 6-month, real-world chart review study [^116JpUi6]. Schizophrenia Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is a relevant clinical issue. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the comparative efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole and metformin in treating antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia among female patients with schizophrenia.

Methods

A chart review of females diagnosed with schizophrenia and hospitalized from 2010 to 2020, all with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and elevated serum prolactin levels. Data included antipsychotic types, baseline and post-intervention prolactin levels. Remission was defined as prolactin levels below 25 ng/dL in females. Cox regression and instrumental variables were used to assess remission hazard ratios at 30, 60, and 180 days.

Results

Among 652 female inpatients (mean age = 38.8 ± 12.7 years; 53.2% on haloperidol, 17.8% on risperidone) with hyperprolactinemia (mean baseline prolactin: 69.9 ± 47.8 ng/dL), 366 (56.1%) received add-on aripiprazole (mean baseline prolactin: 76.5 ± 51.3 ng/dL) and 286 (43.9%) received metformin (mean baseline prolactin: 61.5 ± 41.6 ng/dL). Aripiprazole was associated with decreased prolactin levels on the 30th day with a remission rate of 73.6% compared to a 15.0% remission rate in the metformin group. The effect was significantly greater in the low-dose group (aripiprazole ≤ 5 mg). Throughout the 180-day follow-up period, the final remission rate was substantially higher in the aripiprazole group than in the metformin group (77.6% vs 23.1%). Aripiprazole outperformed metformin in treating hyperprolactinemia induced primarily by haloperidol (remission rate 79.9%), quetiapine (72.7%), olanzapine (68.8%) and risperidone (65.2%) (all p < 0.01).

Conclusions

This real-world study suggests that adjunctive aripiprazole therapy effectively reduces prolactin levels in females with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. Maximum efficacy is achieved at no > 5 mg/day and within 30 days.

### Sex based subgroup differences in randomized controlled trials: empirical evidence from cochrane meta-analyses [^115WReqH]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In another example, a statistically significant subgroup finding was seen for surgery (carotid endarterectomy) compared with no surgery in patients with recent symptomatic carotid stenosis for the primary outcome of five year cumulative risk of ipsilateral carotid ischemic stroke or any stroke or death within 30 days. The authors of the review suggest that sex is a clinically important effect modifier given the lower risk of ischemic stroke during medical treatment and higher operative risk in women. Other authors have offered a mechanistic explanation as to why anatomical differences could affect carotid endarterectomy. Although the most recent American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for the prevention of stroke do not make a distinction between the treatment of men and women, UpToDate suggests differential management for men and women with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50–69%.

Finally, in the topic where risperidone was compared with olanzapine for the adverse effect of change in prolactin levels from baseline, the authors included a discussion about clinical significance. Antipsychotic drug treatments are known to cause increases in plasma prolactin levels, and for women, hyperprolactinemia could be related to severe menstrual disorders. Although the review does not discuss any biological rationale, the authors state that clinicians might want to consider the different tolerability profiles of risperidone and olanzapine.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^111dunFg]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for pediatric patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders despite their lack of approval for use in children. Although considered a safer alternative to first-generation antipsychotics, there is evidence to suggest that second-generation antipsychotics may be associated with some adverse events as well as an increase in prolactin levels. The purpose of this review is to examine the risk of prolactin-related adverse events in pediatric patients using antipsychotics and to quantify changes in prolactin for this population.

Methods

Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO databases, supplemented with review of select gray literature to identify both randomized controlled trials and observational studies on pediatric patients prescribed antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Using a narrative approach, data on adverse events were recorded and changes from baseline in prolactin were pooled, where possible, from the randomized trials. Change from baseline in prolactin was evaluated for each treatment, as well as in comparison to placebo and to other treatments. Where data was available, these changes were evaluated separately for male and female patients.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials and five observational studies, all examining the effects of second-generation antipsychotics, were selected. Literature reporting the effects of risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and paliperidone was identified, with varying doses. Prolactin-related adverse events were sparsely reported across studies. In evidence gathered from randomized controlled trials, risperidone, olanzapine, and two doses of paliperidone (3–5 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day) were associated with increased prolactin levels compared to baseline. With the exception of paliperidone, similar trends were observed in males and females, separately. The findings of the observational evidence served to both complement and run contrary to the randomized trials, with discrepancies attributed to differences in patient and treatment characteristics.

Conclusions

No definitive conclusions between second-generation antipsychotic use and prolactin-related adverse events can be made based on the available literature. While some trends in prolactin level changes emerged, this was based on few trials with small sample sizes. Future investigations should emphasize reporting on treatment safety.

### Efficacy and tolerability of ziprasidone versus risperidone as augmentation in patients partially responsive to clozapine: a randomised controlled clinical trial [^112LhiAM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from schizophrenic psychoses sometimes insufficiently respond to antipsychotic monotherapy and then combination approaches are preferred. We aimed in validating the add-on of ziprasidone and risperidone to clozapine, and we performed a randomised head-to-head trial. Patients with partial response to clozapine were randomly attributed to augmentation with ziprasidone (n = 12) or risperidone (n = 12). Efficacy assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Furthermore, several safety and tolerability measures were obtained. After six weeks, both groups showed significant reductions of positive and negative symptoms. In addition, affective state, psychosocial functioning and clozapine side effects improved without significant differences between the groups. Both approaches were well tolerated. However, the ziprasidone group experienced a small elongation of the QTc interval and a reduction of extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients under clozapine-risperidone therapy developed a rise of serum prolactin levels. The clozapine augmentation with ziprasidone or risperidone resulted in significant psychopathological improvements. The side effects differed between the treatment groups. Further head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics as add-on to clozapine are necessary.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^111jehmL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other dopamine D2receptor antagonists, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

RYKINDO may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.8% (12/1499 patients) of patients treated with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) in multiple-dose studies. Patients should be instructed in nonpharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position).

RYKINDO should be used with particular caution in (1) patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and (2) in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of oral risperidone and antihypertensive medication.

### Prolactin and macroprolactin levels in psychiatric patients receiving atypical antipsychotics: a preliminary study [^112mhEqU]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to clarify whether atypical antipsychotics can elevate serum levels of both macroprolactin and prolactin, and whether the macroprolactin levels differ according to the type of atypical antipsychotic being taken. In total, 245 subjects were enrolled consecutively in 6 hospitals. Serum prolactin and macroprolactin levels were measured at a single time point during maintenance antipsychotic monotherapy. The mean total serum prolactin levels including macroprolactin were 11.91, 20.73, 16.41, 50.83, 12.84, and 59.1ng/mL for patients taking aripiprazole, blonanserin, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, and risperidone, respectively, while those for macroprolactin were 1.71, 3.86, 3.73, 7.28, 2.77, and 8.0ng/mL. The total prolactin and macroprolactin levels were significantly higher among those taking paliperidone and risperidone than among those taking any of the other antipsychotics (p < 0.01). Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between serum levels of prolactin and macroprolactin. Sexual dysfunction was reported in 35.5% (87/245) of the total subjects. However, the total prolactin level did not differ significantly between subjects with and without sexual dysfunction except gynecomastia. These findings suggest that treatment with risperidone and paliperidone can induce hyperprolactinemia and macroprolactinemia in psychiatric patients.

### Changes in serum prolactin level during intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and effect on clinical pregnancy rate: a prospective observational study [^1122FwDm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Experimental design & sample size

An internal review board "The Scientific & Ethics committee" of the OBGYN department, Cairo University approved this study protocol on the fifth of October 2014. One hundred two normo-prolactinemic patients were recruited in the study while attending the assisted reproduction clinic in Kasr Alainy, Cairo university hospital. All enrolled subjects were already scheduled for ICSI. Each participant was subjected to investigations which included follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, and semen analysis for the husband.

The sample size was calculated using an online calculator where the measured outcome was the difference of serum prolactin levels between samples. The confidence level was set at 95%, and the margin of error at 10.4%, in a 50% response distribution, giving us 90 patients in a population more than 20,000.

Inclusion Criteria for the study included an age range between 20 and 38 years, women with either 1ry or 2ry infertility scheduled for ICSI. Exclusion from the study was due to hyperprolactinemia (high basal serum prolactin), uterine anomalies, repeated ICSI failure (3 or more failed trials), embryo transfer beyond day 3, frozen –thawed cycles, or had any contraindications for pregnancy (serious uncontrolled medical diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or ovarian tumors (cancer of any location). Patients were also excluded if they were on any medication that is known to alter prolactin levels e.g. antipsychotics and risperidone, or had a history of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. low TSH), or had any medical disorders that affect serum prolactin e.g. acromegaly and chronic renal failure.

### Comparative physiological effects of antipsychotic drugs in children and young people: a network meta-analysis [^112uAjok]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

For prolactin, 30 trials compared nine different antipsychotics with placebo (3255 participants received active treatment, 1622 placebo). We found very strong evidence of increased prolactin with risperidone or paliperidone. Increased prolactin was also seen with olanzapine. No strong evidence suggested any effect on prolactin with aripiprazole, molindone, asenapine, quetiapine, lurasidone, or blonanserin (figure 3; appendix p 36). Aripiprazole thus ranked highest and risperidone or paliperidone lowest in terms of effect on prolactin (figure 4; appendix p 45). τ was 7·45 ng/mL, which was considered large in the context of the observed antipsychotic-associated changes. The global test showed inconsistency (p < 0·0001), although the back-calculation method did not (appendix p 52). On the basis of available data, we deemed that there was evidence of important heterogeneity and inconsistency in this network meta-analysis. Certainty of evidence was very low in 30 (83%) of 36 comparisons (appendix p 72). When SMD was used as the outcome, heterogeneity was lower (appendix p 44). The SMD for increase in prolactin with risperidone or paliperidone relative to placebo was 1·17 (95% CI 0·85–1·49).

For fasting glucose, 25 trials compared 11 different antipsychotics with placebo (3052 participants received active treatment, 1371 placebo). We found strong evidence of increased fasting glucose with quetiapine. Increased fasting glucose was also associated with clozapine, but with increased uncertainty. No strong evidence suggested any change in fasting glucose with blonanserin, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, asenapine, molindone, and risperidone or paliperidone (figure 5; appendix p 36). Ziprasidone thus ranked highest and quetiapine lowest in terms of effect on fasting glucose (figure 4; appendix p 45). τ was 0·69 mmol/L, which was considered large in the context of observed alterations. The global test showed inconsistency (p < 0·0001), but the back-calculation method did not (appendix p 54). Certainty of evidence was very low in 55 (100%) of 55 of comparisons (appendix p 74).

### Risperidone added to clozapine: impact on serum prolactin levels [^115C3fys]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Several years ago, we reported that the addition of risperidone to clozapine improved response in some patients with schizophrenia. Risperidone, in general, is well tolerated when administered as monotherapy, but has been linked to a persistent elevation of serum prolactin and associated symptoms. The goal of this study was to determine whether the addition of risperidone to clozapine results in an elevation of serum prolactin levels in patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Method

Twenty patients on clozapine-risperidone combination therapy were matched for age and gender with 20 patients treated with clozapine monotherapy. Demographic information was gathered along with clozapine and risperidone dose and the length of time on risperidone. Serum prolactin levels were measured from a single blood sample.

Results

The 2 groups did not differ in age, race, gender, diagnosis, age at clozapine initiation, age at onset, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores, or clozapine dose. The mean ± SD serum prolactin level was 8.42 ± 4.17 ng/mL for clozapine monotherapy patients and 35.76 ± 17.43 ng/mL for combination therapy patients. The 2 medication categories showed a significant difference in log prolactin values (t = -7.97, df = 38, p ≤ .0001). Sixteen combination therapy patients (80%) exhibited elevated prolactin levels (range for entire group, 9.7–69.8 ng/mL) while only 2 clozapine monotherapy patients (10%) exhibited prolactin elevation levels (range for entire group, 2.4–20.2 ng/mL; df = 1, p < .0001).

Conclusion

The combination of risperidone and clozapine appears to result in a moderate elevation of serum prolactin levels. Additionally, controlled prospective studies are needed to clarify the risks of long-term elevations of serum prolactin level.

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with subcutaneous risperidone suspension. Carcinogenicity studies were conducted with oral risperidone in mice and rats. Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18-months to mice and for 25-months to rats. These doses are equivalent to approximately 0.2-, 0.75-, and 3-times (mice) and 0.4-, 1.5-, and 6-times (rats) the oral MRHD of 16 mg/day, based on a mg/m2body surface area. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There were statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The table below summarizes the multiples of the human dose on a mg/m2(mg/kg) basis at which these tumors occurred.

Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5- to 6-fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^116FfCdh]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), developed in the 1950s, were the first class of antipsychotics to be prescribed for schizophrenia. However, FGAs were associated with adverse events such as extrapyramidal motor control disabilities. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were developed with the aim of providing similar or greater efficacy in the reduction of schizophrenia-related symptoms with a reduction in adverse events.

Of the men and women diagnosed with schizophrenia, 40% and 23%, respectively, will be diagnosed before the age of 19. While SGAs have not been approved for use in the Canadian pediatric population, they are nevertheless widely prescribed for these patients. Between 1999 and 2008 antipsychotic use in Canada for patients aged 18 years or younger increased from 1.9 per 1000 to 7.4 per 1000. However, while SGAs are considered a safer alternative to FGAs due to the reduced tendency to induce adverse neurological effects, other equally problematic adverse events have been associated with SGAs, especially in the pediatric population.

Hyperprolactinemia may become a clinical concern when patients are prescribed medications that block the inhibition of prolactin secretion, such as through interference with tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway. In 2011, the Canadian Alliance for Monitoring Effectiveness and Safety of Antipsychotics in Children published a report on the association between elevated prolactin levels and adverse events such as gynecomastia, galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and decreased libido. The effect of prolactin on gynecomastia in men and galactorrhea in women has also been reported elsewhere.

The effect of antipsychotics to raise prolactin levels have been summarized in a review by Byerly et al. Risperidone, in particular, has been associated with a greater than normal elevation in prolactin levels compared to other SGAs in both pediatric and adult populations. Despite lack of approval, there is considerable off-label use of risperidone in Canadian pediatric patients.

The primary objective of this review is to examine the risk of prolactin-related adverse events associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders in pediatric patients. The secondary objective is to examine changes in prolactin levels associated with the use of antipsychotic medications in this patient population.

### Prolactin and dopamine: what is the connection? A review article [^115SESKP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Dopamine (DA) holds a predominant role in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) secretion. Through a direct effect on anterior pituitary lactotrophs, DA inhibits the basally high-secretory tone of the cell. It accomplishes this by binding to D2 receptors expressed on the cell membrane of the lactotroph, activation of which results in a reduction of PRL exocytosis and gene expression by a variety of intracellular signalling mechanisms. The hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, which provide DA to the anterior pituitary gland, are themselves regulated by feedback from PRL through a 'short-loop feedback mechanism'. A variety of other modulators of prolactin secretion act at the hypothalamic level by either disinhibition of the dopaminergic tone (e.g. serotonin, GABA, oestrogens and opioids) or by reinforcing it (e.g. substance P). All typical antipsychotic medications are associated with sustained hyperprolactinaemia due to their high affinity for the D2 receptor and their slow dissociation from the receptor once bound, but atypicals differ quite dramatically in their propensity to cause prolonged high prolactin levels. Of those atypicals that are associated with prolactin elevation, the main causative factor appears to be a higher peripheral-to-central dopamine receptor potency of either the parent drug or its active metabolite (e.g. risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone and amisulpride). Antipsychotics that easily cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit fast dissociation from the dopamine receptor once bound do not result in sustained hyperprolactinaemia.

### Review of evidence that posttransplantation psychiatric treatment commonly affects prolactin levels and thereby influences graft fate [^116Dcv4Z]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Delirium, depression and other psychiatric difficulties are commonly encountered by posttransplantation patients, and antipsychotic medicines are frequently used to treat these difficulties. This article reviews previous research data concerning the immunological effects of these medicines, with particular focus on the consequences of prolactin elevation. Unproven but of concern is that these effects may influence graft fate. Older antipsychotic medicines such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine have a high likelihood of elevating prolactin. Prolactin is an immunologically active molecule generally promoting bone marrow function. This may be of benefit post-stem-cell transplant, helping engraftment, but could further rejection of solid-organ transplants. Elevated prolactin is implicated in the facilitation of graft-versus-host disease. Aripiprazole is the antipsychotic medicine least likely to increase prolactin (and may actually decrease prolactin); risperidone, the most likely to increase prolactin. Olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprazadone are antipsychotic medicines with a lower likelihood of elevating prolactin. Older ("neuroleptic") antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine, droperidol and haloperidol, perphenazine and many others, are likely to elevate serum prolactin. Among antidepressants, most serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with the exception of sertraline, can slightly elevate prolactin. The atypical (i.e., alone in their class) antidepressants bupropion and mirtazapine are prolactin neutral. The immunological consequences of psychiatric medicines should be considered when treating transplant patients for delirium, depression and thought disorders; in addition, if elevation of prolactin is thought to be of immunological importance during psychiatric treatment, then it should be monitored and treated. The dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson's disease — bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinerole — usually reverse antipsychotic-induced prolactin increases without compromising psychiatric effectiveness.

### Prolactin levels in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol [^114zwVt5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin levels are elevated to varying degrees by antipsychotics. Prolactin elevations may result in sexual and other adverse effects, and they may be related to antipsychotic effects. We used the data collected in a trial of antipsychotics to study the differential effect of these drugs on prolactin level, to explore the relation between clinical effects and prolactin level, and to determine the relationship between plasma levels of antipsychotics and prolactin level.

Method

Treatment-resistant patients (133 men, 24 women) diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a double-blind, randomized, 14-week trial comparing clozapine (N = 40), olanzapine (N = 39), risperidone (N = 41), and haloperidol (N = 37). Plasma levels of prolactin and antipsychotics were determined at baseline and at weeks 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14 during the trial. Clinical effects were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale. Statistical analyses were limited to the 75 men for whom repeated prolactin levels were available. Data were gathered from June 1996 to December 1999.

Results

Risperidone caused significant elevation of prolactin levels (p < .05) that appeared to be dose-dependent. Clozapine and olanzapine were associated with decreases of prolactin, whereas haloperidol led to a minor, nonsignificant increase. Plasma olanzapine and prolactin levels were correlated. Prolactin levels were not related to clinical improvement or extrapyramidal side effects.

Conclusion

Antipsychotics show major differences in their effects on prolactin, and risperidone has clearly the most robust effect.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^116yVUdY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia

Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

Pooled data from 7 placebo-controlled, 3- to 8- week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar mania are presented in Table 2.

In longer-term, controlled and uncontrolled studies, RISPERDAL was associated with a mean change in (a) non-fasting cholesterol of +4.4 mg/dL at Week 24 (N = 231) and +5.5 mg/dL at Week 48 (N = 86); and (b) non-fasting triglycerides of +19.9 mg/dL at Week 24 (N = 52).

Weight Gain

Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.

Data from a placebo-controlled, 12-week, fixed-dose study in adult subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 3.

In an uncontrolled, longer-term, open-label study, RISPERDAL CONSTA was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.1 kg at Week 24 (N = 268) and +2.8 kg at Week 50 (N = 199).

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer.

### Risperidone [^116FYBqL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hyperprolactinemia

As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, risperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic agents.

Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.

### Paliperidone for treatment of schizophrenia [^112jErw7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In short-term studies, oral paliperidone is an antipsychotic that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its parent compound, risperidone, with movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone than placebo. In addition, paliperidone is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin that may be associated with sexual dysfunction, although sexual functioning outcomes were not reported. At doses greater than 3 mg per day, oral paliperidone appears comparable in efficacy to oral olanzapine 10 mg per day. Regarding the critical comparison of oral paliperidone to risperidone, we have no information and are thus unable to determine if paliperidone has any advantages or disadvantages compared to its well-known parent compound.

### Risperidone-induced increase in serum prolactin is correlated with positive symptom improvement in chronic schizophrenia [^115QSSEJ]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

The elevation in serum prolactin (PRL) concentration in schizophrenic patients treated with typical antipsychotic drugs is well documented. Recently, increased prolactin levels have been reported in patients taking risperidone. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone on serum prolactin, and to investigate the relationship between the change in PRL and the therapeutic outcome. In this study, 30 male inpatients with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with risperidone after a 2-week washout period. The risperidone dose was fixed at 6 mg/day. Clinical efficacy was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Serum PRL was assayed in serum by radioimmunometric assay in schizophrenic patients before and after 12-week treatment, as compared to 30 age-matched normal male subjects. The results showed that risperidone treatment significantly increased the serum PRL. A significant and positive relationship between the change in PRL at pre- and post-treatment and the reduction rate of PANSS positive subscore was observed. Risperidone treatment significantly increased the serum PRL levels of schizophrenic patients. There was a close relationship between the improvement in positive symptoms and the change of serum PRL level before and after risperidone treatment. The serum PRL levels at baseline could be used to predict the responses of schizophrenic patients to risperidone.

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: clinical recommendations [^117JamwL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia. This paper summarises the group's collective views and provides a summary of the recommendations agreed by the consensus group to assist clinicians in the recognition, clinical assessment, investigation and management of elevated plasma prolactin levels in patients being treated for severe mental illness. It also deals with the special problems of particular populations, gives advice about information that should be provided to patients, and suggests a strategy for routine monitoring of prolactin. The recommendations are based upon the evidence contained in the supplement 'Hyperprolactinaemia in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: Clinical Implications' (2008). The guidance contained in this article is not intended to replace national guidance (such as that of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence), however, it does provide additional detail that is unlikely to be covered in existing guidelines, and focuses on areas of uncertainty and disagreement. We hope it will add to the debate about this topic.

### Effects of olanzapine on prolactin levels of female patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone [^114jBBd1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This study was conducted to prospectively examine the effect of switching from risperidone to olanzapine on female schizophrenia patients who experienced menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or sexual dysfunction.

Method

Twenty female patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who were taking risperidone and were suffering from menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and/or sexual dysfunction were enrolled. Patients were switched from risperidone to olanzapine over a 2-week period, then treated with olanzapine for 8 additional weeks. The serum prolactin concentrations were examined every 2 weeks. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), and questions from the Dickson-Glazer Sexual Functioning Scale were administered to evaluate efficacy, extrapyramidal side effects, and sexual and reproductive functioning at baseline and the endpoint of 10 weeks.

Results

Serum prolactin levels decreased significantly (p < .01) following the switch from risperidone to olanzapine. Scores of PANSS, AIMS, and SAS at the endpoint were also significantly decreased (p < .01) compared to those of baseline. Patients experienced improvements in menstrual functioning and perceptions of sexual side effects.

Conclusion

Olanzapine reversed hyperprolactinemia in risperidone-treated female schizophrenic patients. This was associated with a decrease in amenorrhea, improved cycle regularity, and a decrease in sexual side effects that the women attributed to antipsychotic medication. This study suggests that switching to olanzapine is a safe and effective alternative method for patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia associated sexual and/or reproductive dysfunction. Long-term follow-up studies are warranted, with particular attention to the course of sexual and reproductive dysfunction.

### A randomized comparison of aripiprazole and risperidone for the acute treatment of first-episode schizophrenia and related disorders: 3-month outcomes [^115sLnnz]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Research findings are particularly important for medication choice for first-episode patients as individual prior medication response to guide treatment decisions is unavailable. We describe the first large-scale double-masked randomized comparison with first-episode patients of aripiprazole and risperidone, 2 commonly used first-episode treatment agents. One hundred ninety-eight participants aged 15–40 years with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and who had been treated in their lifetime with antipsychotics for 2 weeks or less were randomly assigned to double-masked aripiprazole (5–30 mg/d) or risperidone (1–6 mg/d) and followed for 12 weeks. Positive symptom response rates did not differ (62.8% vs 56.8%) nor did time to response. Aripiprazole-treated participants had better negative symptom outcomes but experienced more akathisia. Body mass index change did not differ between treatments but advantages were found for aripiprazole treatment for total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, and prolactin levels. Post hoc analyses suggested advantages for aripiprazole on depressed mood. Overall, if the potential for akathisia is a concern, low-dose risperidone as used in this trial maybe a preferred choice over aripiprazole. Otherwise, aripiprazole would be the preferred choice over risperidone in most situations based upon metabolic outcome advantages and some symptom advantages within the context of similar positive symptom response between medications.

### Pharmacological treatment strategies for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116SStQa]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Data abstraction and synthesis

The baseline PRL level and endpoint PRL level were extracted (must include the mean and standard deviation), and the change of prolactin between baseline and endpoint was also extracted, if any.

For studies with multiple treatment arms of the same type of interventional drug, the mean/SDs were combined following methods described in the Cochrane Handbook and elsewhere.

Quality assessment

For single-arm and case-control studies, we applied the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) score to assess the risk of bias. For RCT studies, we applied the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 (RoB 2) to assess the risk of bias. For the outcomes of NMA, we applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to evaluate the level of evidence, which provided the framework for rating the certainty of the evidence of each paired comparison as high, moderate, low, or very low.

Discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and if needed, a third author. The risk of bias was marked in both articles and survey results.

### Editorial: a better perspective on antipsychotic-related hyperprolactinemia in children and adolescents [^11174kzL]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is common in children and adolescents, but this quotidian presence in our clinics should neither reassure us nor make us complacent. The report by Koch and colleagues 1 stands out against the landscape of trials describing the adverse effects of psychotropic medications in youth. It goes beyond the typical examination of adverse effects in most clinical trials. The authors followed children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years who were dopamine-serotonin receptor antagonist naive (≤ 1-week exposure) or free, and serially evaluated not only serum prolactin concentrations but medication concentrations and side effects for 12 weeks after participants began aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. This report provides insights into the temporal course of adverse effects, examines differential tolerability among dopamine-serotonin receptor antagonists, links specific adverse effects-galactorrhea, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction-with prolactin concentrations in youth, and focuses on the clinical aspects of hyperprolactinemia and related adverse effects in children and adolescents.

### Adjunctive aripiprazole for antipsychotic-related hyperprolactinaemia in patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a meta-analysis [^116HZKyq]. General Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications

APs, such as haloperidol or risperidone, increase prolactin secretion through dopamine-blocking actions in the tuberoinfundibular system. Antagonist activity at D2 receptors in the tuberoinfundibular system region reduces dopamine activity and then increases the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. In contrast, aripiprazole is a partial dopamine agonist in conditions of low endogenous dopamine activityand could suppress the elevated serum prolactin level by preventing the development of hypodopaminergia in the tuberoinfundibular system.

Aripiprazole dose–response effects in reducing the elevated prolactin level could not be analysed in this meta-analysis because the aripiprazole mean doses (7.5 mg/day) were only provided in four RCTs. A prior meta-analysisof five RCTs (n = 663) suggested aripiprazole less than 5 mg/day could significantly decrease prolactin levels in patients with chronic schizophrenia. In addition, 2 mg/day of aripiprazole could act as a partial dopamine agonist and showed improvement of prolactin-related symptoms. Thus, a dose of 5 mg/day appears to be a reasonable target dose for aripiprazole for AP-related hyperprolactinaemia in patients with first-episode schizophrenia, but further studies are needed to explore the optimal dose range.

Apart from its efficacy in reducing the elevated prolactin level, adjunctive aripiprazole could significantly improve negative symptoms, which is consistent with a recent published meta-analysis.

### Risk factors of hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone and olanzapine and their correlations with plasma glucose and lipids [^113HRWMN]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

This study also found a correlation between the doses of RIS and OLZ and elevated PRL. Other studies have reported that the level of PRL decreased significantly in patients with schizophrenia after a reduction in the dose of medication. There are also reports in the literature indicating that the level of elevated PRL is dose dependent: the larger the dose, the higher the level of PRL. This suggests that antipsychotic dosage may be an important predictor of hyperprolactinaemia. Decreasing the dose of antipsychotic drugs is feasible for patients with schizophrenia in order to reduce PRL.

The results showed that for patients taking RIS or OLZ, the elevated PRL group had lower plasma glucose levels than the normal PRL group. Previous studies have found that low-dose PRL injections enhanced insulin secretion through glucokinase and glucose transporter 2 in diabetic rats. In recent years, attention has focused on the relationship between PRL, diabetes and glucose regulation in China. The relationship between PRL and glucose regulation has been investigated in a large sample of men and women based in Shanghai. Investigators found that physiologically high PRL levels were associated with a lower prevalence of diabetes in both men and postmenopausal women. In addition, studies have found that in diabetic rats, a low dose of PRL (25 µg/kg bw/12 hours) enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through glucokinase and glucose transporter 2 induction and reduces plasma glucose. However, the high-dose PRL injection exacerbated systemic and hepatic insulin resistance. This suggests that the degree of elevated PRL levels may have different effects on glucose metabolism. In this study, PRL levels in patients with schizophrenia after taking RIS and OLZ were generally below 100 µg/mL, and high serum PRL was associated with a favourable glucose metabolic profile. This suggests a possible association between PRL levels and β-cell function in patients with schizophrenia after taking RIS and OLZ. Furthermore, in our study, female patients taking RIS had a slight decrease in plasma glucose level in the elevated PRL group, but there were no statistical differences between the two groups. However, in male patients, there was a significant statistical difference in plasma glucose between the two groups. Perhaps because PRL secretion varies at different stages of the menstrual cycle, there were more confounding factors affecting PRL secretion in female patients.

### Risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in adolescents: a case series [^111G9bTJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effect of risperidone on prolactin levels in 3 adolescent patients.

Method

This is a case study of 3 adolescent patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophreni-form disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, or chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia who were treated in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric settings with risperidone. Patients developed hyperprolactinemia with clinical symptoms. Risperidone was discontinued gradually over 2 weeks, and patients were treated with other atypical antipsychotics.

Results

Prolactin levels returned to normal, and clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia resolved in all 3 patients after 2 weeks of tapering and discontinuation of risperidone.

Conclusion

Hyperprolactinemia can be a troublesome side effect with potentially serious complications. It is being increasingly reported in younger patients treated with risperidone. Recognition and treatment of this condition including switching to a prolactin-sparing agent are important to prevent this complication.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited data from published literature reports the presence of risperidone and its metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, in human breast milk at relative infant doses ranging between 2.3% and 4.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. There are reports of sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and EPS (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in breastfed infants exposed to risperidone (see Clinical Considerations). Risperidone has been detected in the plasma in adult subjects up to 6 weeks after a single-dose of RYKINDO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and the clinical significance on the breastfed infant is not known. There is no information on the effects of risperidone on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RYKINDO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RYKINDO or from the mother's underlying condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to RYKINDO through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and EPS (tremors and abnormal muscle movements).

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Females

Based on the pharmacologic action of risperidone (D2receptor antagonism), treatment with RYKINDO may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^115iBsrB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis - Oral

Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are equivalent to approximately 0.2, 0.75, and 3 times (mice) and 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times (rats) the MRHD of 16 mg/day, based on mg/m2body surface area. A maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in male mice. There was a significant increase in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreatic adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. Table 8 summarizes the multiples of the human dose on a mg/m2(mg/kg) basis at which these tumors occurred.

Antipsychotic drugs chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels by 5- to 6- fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms were found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs. These neoplasms were considered to be prolactin-mediated. The clinical relevance of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Risk factors of hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone and olanzapine and their correlations with plasma glucose and lipids [^115t57mb]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

With the widespread use of RIS and OLZ, their effects on PRL levels have received increasing attention. Elevated PRL levels can lead to breast overflow in women and breast development in men and can inhibit progesterone and oestrogen, causing delayed menstruation, amenorrhoea, infertility and endometrial cancer. In addition, PRL can stimulate the proliferation of osteoclast precursors, reduce bone density, increase the risk of fractures and increase the secretion of interleukin-6 by inhibiting oestradiol levels. These consequences can seriously affect the quality of life.

This study found that gender played a role in the effects of RIS and OLZ on serum PRL. The proportion of female patients in the elevated PRL group was larger. Logistic regression analysis also showed that gender was a risk factor for elevated PRL. This finding was consistent with some previous reports in the literature. Kearns et al found that the PRL level of women was significantly higher than that of men among those taking RIS, which was consistent with the conclusions of the study by Bushe and Shaw. Moreover, the results of an epidemiological investigation in China showed that gender is one of the independent factors influencing the increase in PRL levels caused by antipsychotic use. Therefore, combined with the results of this study, there is a greater likelihood of female patients taking RIS or OLZ being affected by the increased PRL levels, and steps to prevent female-specific PRL increase during clinical use should be explored.

### Resolution of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with substitution of quetiapine [^115Q8rSc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia that was successfully managed with quetiapine.

Case Summary

A 30-year-old white woman with schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, and comorbid alcohol and cocaine abuse was treated successfully for her psychotic symptoms with risperidone until she developed adverse effects consistent with hyperprolactinemia. This was confirmed by laboratory blood tests, as her prolactin level was 186.9 ng/mL (normal for nonpregnant women 2.8–29.2). The woman had experienced similar effects in the past, which had led to noncompliance and subsequent psychotic relapse. Normalization of prolactin levels and associated adverse effects were achieved upon switching to quetiapine. No psychotic symptoms reoccurred.

Discussion

Dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptor blockade in the mesolimbic tract is thought to mediate the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics. This action in the tuberoinfundibular system produces prolactin level elevation. Risperidone has a relatively higher affinity for the D(2) receptor in comparison with other atypical antipsychotics, which may explain why it is associated with a higher incidence of hyperprolactinemia. Quetiapine, which has one of the lowest D(2) receptor affinities, is not known to increase prolactin levels to any significant degree. This pharmacologic property allows quetiapine to be a reasonable treatment option for patients who develop risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia.

Conclusions

Quetiapine may be a suitable substitute when a patient taking risperidone develops hyperprolactinemia.

### Risk factors of hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone and olanzapine and their correlations with plasma glucose and lipids [^113AMr9R]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Risperidone (RIS) and olanzapine (OLZ) are widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, and their therapeutic effects have been recognised in long-term clinical practice. Both RIS and OLZ exert antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors. The dopamine D 2 receptor occupancy rate is correlated with adverse drug reactions. The meta-analyses have shown that OLZ has less effect on PRL levels in adolescent patients than RIS. In addition, a meta-analysis of World Psychiatry in 2019 included 16 studies in a subgroup analysis of elevated PRL levels. The results indicated that OLZ had a significantly more favourable effect on PRL levels than RIS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors for elevated PRL levels in patients with schizophrenia taking RIS and OLZ and to explore the relationship between PRL and plasma glucose and lipids levels.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^116s8JBs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carcinogenesis - Intramuscular

Risperidone was evaluated in a 24-month carcinogenicity study in which SPF Wistar rats were treated every 2 weeks with intramuscular (IM) injections of either 5 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg of risperidone. These doses are 1 and 8 times the MRHD (50 mg) on a mg/m2basis. A control group received injections of 0.9% NaCl, and a vehicle control group was injected with placebo microspheres. There was a significant increase in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and adrenomedullary pheochromocytomas at 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2basis. The incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female rats at both doses (1 and 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2basis). A significant increase in renal tubular tumors (adenoma, adenocarcinomas) was observed in male rats at 8 times the IM MRHD on a mg/m2basis. Plasma exposures (AUC) in rats were 0.3 and 2 times (at 5 and 40 mg/kg, respectively) the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD.

Dopamine D2receptor antagonists have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the carcinogenicity studies of oral risperidone; however, measurements taken during subchronic toxicity studies showed that oral risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5- to 6-fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the oral carcinogenicity studies. Serum prolactin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner up to 6- and 1.5-fold in male and female rats, respectively, at the end of the 24-month treatment with risperidone every 2 weeks IM. Increases in the incidence of pituitary gland, endocrine pancreas, and mammary gland neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and may be prolactin-mediated.

The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Mutagenesis

No evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential for risperidone was found in the in vitro tests of Ames gene mutation, the mouse lymphoma assay, rat hepatocyte DNA-repair assay, the chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, Chinese hamster ovary cells, or in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice, and the sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila.

In addition, no evidence of mutagenic potential was found in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation test for RISPERDAL CONSTA.

### Effects of elevated serum prolactin on bone mineral density and bone metabolism in female patients with schizophrenia: a prospective study [^114xoRkU]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to prospectively examine differential effects of sustained "high" and "low" serum prolactin levels on bone mineral density and peripheral markers of bone metabolism.

Method

A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer was used to measure bone mineral density. Peripheral markers of bone formation and resorption were used to measure bone metabolism in 14 Caucasian female patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or olanzapine monotherapy over 12 months.

Results

Analyses of variance failed to show an association between elevated prolactin and bone mineral loss over time. However, higher rates of bone formation and resorption were seen in those with high prolactin levels.

Conclusions

The results failed to show that elevated prolactin accelerates bone mineral density loss. However, sustained hyperprolactinemia did have an impact on the rate of bone metabolism. Perhaps higher prolactin levels over longer time periods are necessary before the metabolic processes become uncoupled, leading to bone mineral density loss.

### An agonist-antagonist interaction model for prolactin release following risperidone and paliperidone treatment [^115r7AYF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

A mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model is presented, characterizing the time course of prolactin in healthy as well as schizophrenic subjects following the administration of various doses and formulations of the antipsychotic drugs risperidone and paliperidone. Prolactin concentrations from nine studies (1,462 subjects) were analyzed in NONMEM. A competitive agonist-antagonist interaction model described the competition between these drugs and dopamine for the D(2) receptors that regulate prolactin release. Tolerance development was explained by a feedback loop with prolactin stimulating dopamine release, whereas models wherein tolerance is described in terms of depletion of a prolactin pool did not explain the data well. The diurnal prolactin rhythm was described by a two-period cosine function. Baseline prolactin was health-status dependent and higher in women than in men, although the drug-induced release was less than proportional to baseline. This quantitative mechanism-based model is the first to describe prolactin release in patients, and it confirms that paliperidone and risperidone have similar potencies for prolactin release.

### Hyperprolactinaemia in first episode psychosis – A longitudinal assessment [^115R5h6t]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Little is known about hyperprolactinaemia (HPL) in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients. We investigated longitudinal changes in serum prolactin in FEP, and the relationship between HPL, and antipsychotic medication and stress. Serum prolactin was recorded in FEP patients at recruitment and again, 3 and 12months later. HPL was defined as a serum prolactin level > 410mIU/L (~19.3ng/ml) for males, and a serum prolactin level > 510mIU/L (~24.1ng/ml) for females. From a total of 174 people with serum prolactin measurements at study recruitment, 43% (n = 74) had HPL, whilst 27% (n = 21/78) and 27% (n = 26/95) had HPL at 3 and 12months respectively. We observed higher serum prolactin levels in females versus males (p < 0.001), and in antipsychotic treated (n = 68) versus antipsychotic naïve patients (p < 0.0001). Prolactin levels were consistently raised in FEP patients taking risperidone, amisulpride and FGAs compared to other antipsychotics. No significant relationship was observed between perceived stress scores (β = 7.13, t = 0.21, df = 11, p = 0.0.84 95% CI -72.91–87.16), or objective life stressors (β = -21.74, t = -0.31, df = 8, p = 0.77 95% CI -218.57–175.09) and serum prolactin. Our study found elevated rates of HPL over the course of the first 12months of illness. We found no evidence to support the notion that stress is related to elevated serum prolactin at the onset of psychosis.

Based on the pharmacologic action of paliperidone (D2 receptor antagonism), treatment with paliperidone extended-release tablets may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of paliperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia were evaluated in 150 adolescent subjects 12 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia who received paliperidone in the dose range of 1.5 mg to 12 mg/day in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Safety and effectiveness of paliperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients < 12 years of age have not been established. Safety and effectiveness of paliperidone for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in patients < 18 years of age have not been studied.

Juvenile Animal Studies

In a study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral paliperidone from days 24 to 73 of age, a reversible impairment of performance in a test of learning and memory was seen, in females only, with a no-effect dose of 0.63 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of paliperidone similar to those in adolescents at MRHD of 12 mg/day. No other consistent effects on neurobehavioral or reproductive development were seen up to the highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg/day), which produced plasma levels of paliperidone 2 to 3 times those in adolescents.

Juvenile dogs were treated for 40 weeks with oral risperidone, which is extensively metabolized to paliperidone in animals and humans, at doses of 0.31, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone length and density were seen with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of risperidone plus paliperidone which were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the MRHD of risperidone. In addition, a delay in sexual maturation was seen at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12-week drug-free recovery period.

The long-term effects of paliperidone on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.

### Increased prolactin levels during reserpine treatment of hypertensive patients… [^115uAX4b]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Serum prolactin levels are significantly greater among hypertensive patients receiving reserpine as compared to levels six weeks after discontinuing the treatment. This association between regular, longterm reserpine use and greater prolactin levels may be clinically significant, since an increased incidence of breast cancer has been reported among hypertensive patients receiving reserpine.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^113gb6tq]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This review is useful in that the process and design was well structured, with screening and data extraction conducted using a duplicate, consensus-based approach. Additionally, the body of evidence considered was broad, including both RCTs and observational studies. While observational studies may lack the methodological rigor of RCTs, they may still be considered an important source of information on treatment efficacy and safety. Despite this, this review presents some limitations. First, few trials were identified from the available literature and many were characterized by small sample sizes. Secondly, the observational studies suffered from significant heterogeneity in study populations, both in comparison to one another and to the RCT evidence base. Similarly, the patients represented in the evidence base were primarily Caucasians, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to the wider patient population. Follow-up time, prior treatment experience, and patient diagnoses also differed significantly in the observational studies. Thirdly, estimates of dispersion were large in each of the RCTs. Finally, while the mechanism is clear between prolactin and breast development/lactation, there is no conclusive research to confirm this association epidemiologically. In a similar vein, it was not possible, from the included studies, to directly associate changes in prolactin levels with patient adverse events. While this review was focused on pediatric patients with schizophrenia, in order to present outcomes for a well-defined clinical area, it must also be recognized that the potential for treatment-related prolactin elevation is not limited to this population. The risk and effects of prolactin elevation are an important clinical concern in other diagnostic areas and should be explored.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^112AbCgE]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This review was designed to evaluate the frequency of prolactin-related adverse events and to consolidate/quantify differences in prolactin level changes between antipsychotics in pediatric patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding differences in prolactin-related adverse events between antipsychotics due to the paucity of data. However, analyses of mean change from baseline in prolactin levels demonstrated some differences between treatments.

A review of the evidence reported in RCTs found that, in analyses of both the overall population and the population stratified by patient sex, risperidone at 1–3 mg/day and 4–6 mg/day was associated with an increase in prolactin levels compared to baseline. This change was particularly marked in females. When compared to placebo, both doses of risperidone produced greater increases in prolactin levels. Risperidone 4–6 mg/day was found to produce greater increases than risperidone 1–3 mg/day in the overall population. However, this trend was not observed in males. A single-arm observational study by Duval et al. reported outcomes in patients treated with risperidone 1–6 mg/day. They found that prolactin levels increased, on average, in these patients after three weeks of treatment. This finding is in line with the findings in the RCT evidence. A three-arm study by Pandina et al. in patients treated with risperidone 2–6 mg/day reported outcomes at 24 weeks for two arms, one treatment-naïve and the other treatment-experienced, and 48 weeks for the remaining open-label arm. Patients in the treatment-experienced and open-label arms showed relatively little change in prolactin levels. However, this may be attributed to previous treatment experience. Patients in the treatment-naïve arm experienced increases in prolactin levels, with a more marked increase in females. However, these changes were accompanied by large dispersions. The findings in the treatment-naïve patients reflect those of the RCT evidence that risperidone is associated with an overall increase in prolactin levels. Differences in patient characteristics such as treatment-experience, which was not reported in the included RCTs, and time horizons may explain the contradictory nature between the observational and RCT evidence.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^114rVSyr]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Differences between male and female patients with respect to the prolactin elevation response, particularly the more pronounced responses among female patients, have been described in the literature. A 1992 study of schizophrenia patients found that serum prolactin increased more markedly in female patients following the commencement of neuroleptic medications, despite the female patients receiving lower doses of treatment. Interestingly, the individual patient variability in response was also higher in females than males. These findings supported an earlier study also conducted in patients with schizophrenia. Similar trends were observed in the current review, with females having a higher prolactin elevation response compared to males when treated with risperidone and quetiapine. However, an opposite trend was observed for patients treated with paliperidone 3–6 mg/day or 6–12 mg/day.

Typically, reference ranges for biochemical markers are established to inform physicians on levels at which these markers may pose a risk to patient safety. While the endocrinology literature documents the effect of prolactin on the body, no acceptable ranges have been established for serum prolactin levels in the pediatric population. A 1973 study of 19 normal children aged 2–12 years and 54 adolescent children aged 13–16 years estimated mean prolactin levels in both male and females to be approximately 5 ng/mL. However, patient characteristics were poorly described, so generalizations must be made with caution. A study by Cook et al. proposed reference ranges (2.5 to 97.5 percentiles) for pediatric prolactin based on a hospital sample. Based on this patient sample, the normal ranges for males and females aged 13 to 15 years of age were defined as 1.6–16.6 ng/mL and 3.0–14.4 ng/mL, respectively. However, the level of elevation in prolactin levels that warrants concern for adverse events in children has yet to be defined. According to some clinical investigators, however, prolactin levels between 18 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL are rarely associated with adverse events related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, though prolonged elevations nearing 100 ng/mL necessitate clinical investigation. It is, therefore, difficult to determine what prolactin levels substantially increase the risk of prolactin-related adverse events in these patients. Therefore, although some trends emerged in the analysis of prolactin changes in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics, the lack of causal association precludes conclusions being drawn between the use of any particular antipsychotic and prolactin-related adverse events.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: a network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^115EoFVJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional outcomes

Anthropometric measurements

Antipsychotics ranked higher than mood stabilisers in elevating anthropometric measurements (including body weight, BMI, and waist circumference) (Fig. 2 g and h). Amisulpride ranked 1st in elevating body weight, while olanzapine ranked 1st in elevating BMI after eliminating sensitive comparisons. Olanzapine also ranked 1st in elevating waist circumference among all interventions with applicable data.

Serum prolactin and total serum bilirubin

Risperidone ranked 1st in elevating serum prolactin, and significance was noticed in comparisons of most of the interventions versus lumateperone. Cariprazine ranked 1st in elevating total serum bilirubin, but no significance was detected among all comparisons.

Other detailed information of main and additional outcomes was summarised in Supplementary Appendix 4. The summary of mean SUCRA and mean ranking of fasting serum glucose, TC, TG, and body weight is shown in Table 1. Divalproex, asenapine, and valproic acid were absent for lack of data or sensitivity elimination. Most antipsychotics ranked higher than mood stabilisers, and all observed mood stabilisers ranked below placebo. Of note, lumateperone was the only antipsychotics ranking lower than placebo.

Subgroup analyses

Age

Divalproex ranked 1st in elevating fasting serum glucose among the youths, while it ranked last in the adult subgroup [SMD = −0.11 mmol/L, 95% CI = (−0.35, 0.13) mmol/L, compared to placebo]. Quetiapine ranked the last in elevating fasting serum glucose among the youths [SMD = −1.53 mmol/L, 95% CI = (−2.15, −0.91) mmol/L, compared to placebo], and ranked 2nd among the adults. Risperidone and valproic acid both tended to elevate insulin levels among the youths, while lurasidone ranked 1st in elevating insulin levels among the adults. Asenapine and lurasidone ranked the highest in elevating serum HbA1c among youths and adults, respectively. Lithium ranked higher than most of the interventions in elevating TC and TG levels among the youths. Risperidone was the most likely to affect serum prolactin levels among the youths, while olanzapine ranked 1st in elevating serum prolactin levels among the adults.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^114VpLhE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

### A double-blind controlled study of adjunctive treatment with risperidone in schizophrenic patients partially responsive to clozapine: efficacy and safety [^112XFXtE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Several open trials and case studies have reported beneficial effects following the addition of risperidone for partial responders to clozapine. The purpose of this study was to carry out a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive treatment with risperidone in patients with schizophrenia partially responsive to clozapine.

Method

In this 6-week double-blind study, 30 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who had partial response to clozapine despite being treated for a mean of 32 months were randomly assigned to risperidone (N = 16) up to 6 mg/day or placebo (N = 14). Efficacy assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale, the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning scale, and the Quality of Life Scale. A variety of safety and tolerability measures were also obtained. Data were collected between November 2001 and July 2003.

Results

Significant improvement was noted in both groups on a variety of measures of psychopathology, but there was significantly greater improvement in the placebo-treated patients on the primary outcome measure, the PANSS positive symptom subscale. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups regarding extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, vital signs, serum clozapine levels, and QTc interval. The only side effect significantly more severe in risperidone-treated compared to placebo-treated patients was sedation. The patients treated with risperidone developed significant increases in plasma prolactin levels.

Conclusion

Adjunctive risperidone treatment in schizophrenia patients partially responsive to clozapine does not significantly improve psychopathology or quality of life compared to placebo in a 6-week period.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^111SyYex]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, while some trends in prolactin level changes from baseline emerged in the data, no definitive conclusions on the association between particular antipsychotic use and prolactin-related adverse events can be drawn. Nevertheless, clinician monitoring of prolactin-related adverse events is pertinent. Future trials examining the effects of antipsychotic medications for pediatric schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients should emphasize reporting on safety outcomes, with studies of adequate duration to allow for the observation of these outcomes. Routine monitoring of serum prolactin levels in study participants is encouraged, as this may allow investigators to directly attribute adverse events to changes in prolactin.

### Pharmacological treatment strategies for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112s7evN]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

When multiple studies are conducted on the same research question, even if the same protocol is used, the results obtained in different medical settings are not the same. Therefore, clinical studies need to be repeated. Meta-analysis of all evidence is crucial for decision-making. Meta-analysis can ensure the reproducibility of research results by using standardized operating procedures, systematically retrieving relevant research evidence for methodological evaluation, and comprehensively analyzing the results of a certain research question. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their meta-analyses provide the highest level of evidence from epidemiological studies and are ideal for testing scientific hypotheses. However, RCTs are often expensive, time-consuming, and in some cases even unethical or unfeasible. Due to various limitations of realistic conditions, RCTs are often difficult to carry out or to meet the current demand for evidence. Single-arm trials are common in medical research, and single-arm meta-analysis will conduct quantitative comprehensive analysis of single-arm trials with the same purpose. A network meta-analysis (NMA) is a method of assessing the effects of multiple interventions that leverages all direct and indirect evidence to provide a more precise estimate of the relative relationship between interventions than a single direct or indirect estimate. In addition, even if some interventions have never been compared in RCTs, NMA can use indirect evidence to estimate the relative effects of these interventions. The Bayesian hierarchical model is a statistical model with a structured hierarchy, based on interchangeability. The core idea is to add random effect parameters to the model to reflect the correlation of data within a group and the heterogeneity between data in different groups. The Bayesian Hierarchical NMA model increases the precision of parameter estimates and preserves the interpretability of the intervention.

To our knowledge, there is no systematic reviews or meta-analysis that examine all strategies for lowering prolactin levels have been conducted yet. The aim of our study is to perform NMA to compare the efficacy of all the above strategies in reducing AP-induced HPRL, and to test the results according different initial PRL levels, so that to provide a reasonable treatment suggestion for AP-induced HPRL.

### A comparison of serum prolactin concentrations after administration of paliperidone extended-release and risperidone tablets in patients with schizophrenia [^112AGSAo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Increases in serum prolactin concentrations after administration of risperidone have been attributed, by some, to the availability of paliperidone in plasma. This double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in patients with schizophrenia compared serum prolactin concentrations following the administration of paliperidone extended-release and risperidone immediate-release tablets. At steady state, the doses administered resulted in a similar exposure to paliperidone and the pharmacologically active fraction of risperidone (i.e. risperidone + paliperidone), respectively. Eligible patients were randomized to either paliperidone extended-release 12 mg on days 1–6 or risperidone immediate-release 2 mg on day 1 and 4 mg on days 2–6. Mean serum prolactin concentrations increased on day 1 (C(max): 71.8 ng/ml and 89.7 ng/ml reached at 6.5 hours and 2.6 hours for paliperidone extended-release and risperidone immediate-release, respectively). On day 6, serum prolactin concentration-time profiles were similar for both treatments, with overall higher serum prolactin concentrations than on day 1 (AUC(0–24 h): 1389 and 842 ng h/ml, and 1306 and 741 ng.h/ml on day 6 and day 1 for paliperidone extended-release and risperidone immediate-release, respectively). These results indicate that paliperidone extended-release 12 mg and risperidone immediate-release 4 mg, administered over a period of 6 days, lead to similar elevations in serum prolactin concentrations.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^117Rnozn]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Paliperidone at doses of 3–6 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day, but not 1.5 mg/day, was associated with increases in prolactin levels between baseline and endpoint and when compared to placebo. When evaluating the evidence stratified by patient sex, the same trend was observed in males but not in females. Comparisons in the overall population between paliperidone doses suggest that paliperidone 3–6 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day both increase prolactin more than the 1.5 mg/day dose. However, this trend only held for males when results were stratified by patient sex. The difference in change in prolactin between paliperidone 6–12 mg/day and 3–6 mg/day was not statistically significant. No observational study was identified reporting on patients treated with paliperidone.

Changes in prolactin levels were significant for both doses of quetiapine and for aripiprazole in the RCT evidence, with mean decreases compared to baseline. When compared to placebo, quetiapine 800 mg/day reported an increase from baseline in prolactin levels over the study period. This change was statistically significant for females, but not for males. In the single observational study reporting on changes in patients treated with quetiapine, a decrease in prolactin levels in the overall and male only populations was reported, with a reported increase for the female population. It is of note that the dispersions reported with these values were wide. However, direct comparisons across these bodies of evidence must be made with caution, given that there a number of factors that may contribute in explaining the disparity of these results. For example, the doses included in the observational study varied considerably, from 200 mg/day to 800 mg/day, while patients in the RCT were treated with doses of 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day. Moreover, the observational study reported outcomes at 12 weeks, while the RCT reported outcomes at 6 weeks.

### Differences in prolactin elevation and related symptoms of atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenic patients [^1169xEA8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the degree and frequency of prolactin (PRL) elevation and related symptoms in patients treated with 3 different atypical antipsychotics: clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone.

Method

Twenty-eight patients receiving clozapine, 29 patients receiving olanzapine, and 18 patients receiving risperidone (all meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreni-form disorder, or schizoaffective disorder) were studied. The median daily dose was 400 mg of clozapine, 10 mg of olanzapine, and 3 mg of risperidone. Fasting morning blood samples were analyzed for PRL, and the occurrence of hyper-prolactinemic symptoms in the patients was evaluated.

Results

Elevated PRL levels were found in 16 (89%) of the patients receiving risperidone and in 7 (24%) of the patients receiving olanzapine, but in none of the patients receiving clozapine. In addition, there was a significant difference in median PRL level among the treatment groups (p < .0001), in that the PRL level was higher both in the patients treated with risperidone and in the patients treated with olanzapine, compared to those treated with clozapine. Moreover, hyperpro-lactinemic symptoms-menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, impotence, oligospermia, and decreased libido-were reported in 8 (44%) of the risperidone-treated patients and in 1 (3%) of the olanzapine-treated patients, but in none of the clozapine-treated patients.

Conclusion

Treatment with risperidone was frequently associated with hyperprolactinemia and related symptoms, whereas the occurrence of PRL elevation and related symptoms was modest in patients receiving olanzapine and nonexistent in those receiving clozapine. Thus, atypical anti-psychotics in therapeutic doses differ with regard to effect on PRL secretion.

### Paliperidone [^116uhq9P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hyperprolactinemia

Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs.

Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.

Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^112Lmrqp]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The findings of this review are generally in agreement with recent reviews on changes in prolactin levels relating to the use of antipsychotic medications. A 2012 review by Cohen et al. reported on short-term (3 to 12 week) outcomes from SGA use in child and adolescent patients for the management of a number of diagnoses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and conduct disorder. They identified four studies on the use of aripiprazole where patients were reported to have statistically significant decreases in prolactin levels compared to baseline. This is consistent with the findings of the current review. However, when changes from baseline were compared between aripiprazole and placebo in the current review, this decrease was not found to be statistically significant. Compared to placebo, Cohen reported that risperidone and olanzapine both produced increases in prolactin levels, which is consistent with the findings of the current review. Similarly, Leucht et al. reported increases in prolactin levels associated with the use of risperidone and paliperidone. However, the dose of paliperidone was not specified. In the current review, paliperidone was found to increase prolactin levels at the 3–6 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day dose ranges, but not in patients treated with the 1.5 mg/day regimen. Consistent with the current review, treatment with aripiprazole was not found to increase prolactin compared to placebo. Leucht et al. also found that quetiapine was not associated with increases when compared to placebo. In the current review, however, treatment with quetiapine at both the 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day doses was found to increase prolactin levels relative to placebo in the overall population. Treatment with olanzapine was found, by Leucht et al. to increase prolactin relative to placebo, which is consistent with the current review. While the review by Leucht et al. was also in patients with schizophrenia, the scope was not limited to children. This difference may explain discrepancies between findings.

### Relation between serum prolactin levels and antipsychotic response to risperidone in patients with schizophrenia [^111xXnfU]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinemia is commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia on risperidone. Dopamine receptor blockade plays a major role in risperidone induced hyperprolactinemia. However, limited studies are available with inconsistent results on antipsychotic response to risperidone and prolactin elevation. Therefore, we aimed to study the change in serum prolactin levels and response to risperidone and to test the association between DRD2 genetic variants and prolactin levels in schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone.

Methods

A prospective study comprising of 102 patients with schizophrenia were recruited. Prolactin levels and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score were recorded at baseline and after four weeks of risperidone treatment. Prolactin concentrations were measured by standard method Advia-Centaur® Chemiluminescence immuno assay method. Taq1A DRD2 genotyping was performed by qRT-PCR.

Results

The mean ± SD prolactin levels (ng/ml) were increased after four weeks of treatment in both responders (males 21.66 ± 15.15 to 41.63 ± 18.73; p < 0.01 females 51.92 ± 40.89 to 122.35 ± 52.16; p < 0.01) and non-responders group (males 23.89 ± 14.85 to 37.45 ± 13.5; p < 0.01 females 39.25 ± 26.94 to 91.13 ± 54.31; p < 0.01). Patients with increased prolactin concentration were 4.6 fold higher in responders (OR 4.60; 95%CI 1.376–15.389; p-value 0.01) compared to non-responders. Ninety-six patients were genotyped for Taq1A DRD2 gene (AA = 9, AG = 46, GG = 41) and found no association (p = 0.6) between genetic variants and response to risperidone.

Conclusion

Patients were showing more than 20% increase in prolactin levels had a better chance of responding to risperidone therapy. Taq1A DRD2 gene did not show any association with prolactin elevation and response to risperidone.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^115BW5k7]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Mean change from baseline in prolactin levels is presented in Table 4. Mean changes were available in four studies; one reporting on quetiapine and three on risperidone. Patients treated with quetiapine 200–800 mg/day experienced a mean decrease of 1.4 ng/mL (standard deviation [SD] 21.1). Changes in patients treated with risperidone varied considerably, from a mean increase of 66.8 ng/mL (SD 41.8) to a mean decrease of 13.1 ng/mL (SD 17.1).

Change from baseline stratified by sex was available in two studies. In the first study, male patients treated with quetiapine 200–800 mg/day were found to have a mean decrease of 4.5 ng/mL (SD 5.7), while females experienced an increase of 3.2 ng/mL (SD 21.7). In the second study, male patients treated with risperidone 2–6 mg/day who were previously treatment-naïve were found to have a mean increase of 29.1 ng/mL (SD 32.6), whereas treatment-experienced patients were found to decrease levels by 6.2 ng/mL (SD 22.2). Female patients experienced larger changes from baseline, with treatment-naïve patients reporting mean increases of 83.4 ng/mL (SD 44.7) and treatment-experienced patients reporting a mean decrease of 14.0 ng/mL (49.3). In the open-label arm of this risperidone study, which consisted of patients with varying levels of treatment experience, males were reported to have a mean increase of 3.7 ng/mL (SD 28.5) while females reported a mean increase of 11.5 ng/mL (SD 43.3).

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^112RkB4s]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Change in prolactin levels: Change from baseline, treatment-placebo comparison

Five RCTs provided data for mean change in prolactin levels for the overall population (see Table 4). Mean changes from baseline compared to placebo for each intervention in the overall population are presented in Fig. 2.

Table 4
Changes from baseline in prolactin

NR Not reported, SD Standard deviation

Fig. 2
Forest plot of mean change from baseline for SGAs presented in RCTs, overall population

Compared to baseline, both doses of quetiapine and aripiprazole resulted in decreased prolactin levels. When compared to placebo, these changes were significantly greater compared to baseline for quetiapine but not for aripiprazole.

Both doses of risperidone, olanzapine, and paliperidone 3–5 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day were found to increase prolactin levels from baseline. These changes also reflected statistically significant increases when compared to placebo. Paliperidone 1.5 mg/day was not associated with a statistically significant change.

Three RCTs reported changes in serum prolactin levels stratified by sex. When evaluating the change from baseline for each of the included SGAs, trends reflected those observed in the overall populations for both males and females. However, the change from baseline for females treated with any dose range of risperidone was higher than males treated with the same dose. Figures 3 and 4 present the mean changes from baseline compared to placebo for males and females, respectively. Compared to placebo, the change from baseline for females treated with either dose of quetiapine resulted in a statistically significant difference. This change was not found to be significant in males. Compared to placebo, both males and females were found to experience significant increases when treated with risperidone, though this increase was more marked in female patients treated with risperidone 4–6 mg/day. Conversely, the change from baseline compared to placebo was significant for males, but not females, treated with paliperidone 3–6 mg/day and 6–12 mg/day.

### Drug insight: prolactin-receptor antagonists, a novel approach to treatment of unresolved systemic and local hyperprolactinemia? [^116S1dNQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone whose major biological actions are related to normal lactation and reproduction. Abnormally high prolactin levels, referred to as hyperprolactinemia, can result in various reproductive disorders. Currently, therapeutic management of hyperprolactinemia relies on dopamine agonists, since dopamine is the primary physiological suppressor of pituitary prolactin production. Epidemiologic studies have shown that prolactin levels in the high-normal range, as well as medications that interfere with dopamine action (e.g. certain antipsychotic drugs), might correlate with increased breast cancer risk. In addition to circulating prolactin, it is now well established that prolactin is also produced locally within various tissues, including breast and prostate. Increasing evidence, mainly from animal studies at present, suggests that excess locally produced prolactin may promote the growth of breast and prostate tumors via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. These findings have renewed the interest in finding alternative strategies to suppress prolactin actions when dopamine agonists are ineffective. Our studies of the relationship between prolactin structure and function have resulted in the development of pure prolactin-receptor antagonists. These molecules prevent endogenous prolactin from exerting its actions via a competitive mechanism for receptor binding. In this review, we discuss the possible future therapeutic utility of this novel class of compounds.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited data from published literature reports the presence of risperidone and its metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, in human breast milk at relative infant dose ranging between 2.3% and 4.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. There are reports of sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in breastfed infants exposed to risperidone (see Clinical Considerations). Risperidone has been detected in plasma in adult subjects up to 8 weeks after a single-dose administration of RISPERDAL CONSTA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and the clinical significance on the breastfed infant is not known. There is no information on the effects of risperidone on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RISPERDAL CONSTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RISPERDAL CONSTA or from the mother's underlying condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to RISPERDAL CONSTA through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation, failure to thrive, jitteriness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements).

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Females

Based on the pharmacologic action of risperidone (D2receptor antagonism), treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Risk factors of hyperprolactinemia induced by risperidone and olanzapine and their correlations with plasma glucose and lipids [^114cNpXw]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness with a prevalence of about 1% and usually requires long-term treatment with antipsychotics. Elevated prolactin (PRL) levels are one of the common adverse reactions that patients experience after taking antipsychotic drugs, which lead to a reduction in drug compliance and subsequently affect prognosis.

PRL is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the lactotropic cells in the anterior pituitary. The factors that influence the effect of different levels of PRL caused by antipsychotic drugs include age, gender, type of antipsychotic drug, dosage of medication and length of time for which medication is taken. The incidence of hyperprolactinemia in menopausal women is lower than that in women of childbearing age. Among male patients, age has less effect on elevated PRL levels. Women tend to have higher levels of PRL than men and may be associated with higher levels of oestrogen. In addition, the level of PRL is also related to medication dosage, with higher doses of antipsychotics leading to higher levels of PRL. Previous studies in elderly patients with schizophrenia have found that after reducing medication dose, the D 2 /D 3 receptor occupancy rate decreases and PRL levels significantly decrease.

PRL is a multifunctional hormone. Studies have shown that PRL is related to the growth of pancreatic cells and the function of insulin. Animal studies have shown that PRL levels have a direct stimulating effect on insulin in non-pregnant rodents and can induce insulin production. In addition, studies have found that maternal PRL increases concurrently to insulin during the second half of pregnancy and stimulates β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Current studies suggest that the glucose metabolic regulation effect of PRL is not limited to the period of pregnancy. Moreover, studies have discovered that human adipose tissue produces PRL and also expresses PRL receptors, which highlights the role of PRL as a cytokine involved in adipose tissue function.PRL can downregulate lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthesis, which inhibits lipogenesis, and regulate the bioactivities of adipokines such as adiponectin, interleukin-6 and leptin. Studies have reported that elevated PRL is associated with lower levels of glucose and lipids, as well as higher insulin sensitivity. At present, it is unclear whether PRL level is correlated with plasma glucose and lipids in patients with schizophrenia taking antipsychotic drugs as part of their treatment.

### Comparison of quetiapine and risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, 8-week study [^113jZmrf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine and risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Method

In this 8-week, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose study, patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV diagnosis) were randomly assigned to quetiapine (200–800 mg/day) or risperidone (2–8 mg/day). The primary hypothesis was that quetiapine was not inferior to risperidone. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores; secondary outcomes included response rate (≥ 40% reduction in PANSS scores), Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), and cognitive and social functioning. Tolerability assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events and changes in weight, glucose, and prolactin. Patients were recruited from June 2001 to September 2002.

Results

Patients (N = 673) were randomly assigned to quetiapine (N = 338, mean dose = 525 mg/day) or risperidone (N = 335, mean dose = 5.2 mg/day). The primary analysis demonstrated noninferiority between treatments (p < .05). Improvements with both treatments were comparable on PANSS total, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Risperidone-treated patients had a significantly (p = .03) greater improvement in PANSS positive subscale score among all patients, but not among completers. Improvements in PANSS response rates, CGI-C, and cognitive function were similar between treatment groups. Changes in serum glucose and weight were minimal and comparable. The rate of extrapyramidal symptom (EPS)-related adverse events was significantly higher with risperidone (22%) than quetiapine (13%; p < .01). Somnolence was more common with quetiapine (26%) than risperidone (20%; p = .04). Prolactin levels increased with risperidone (+35.5 ng/mL), but decreased with quetiapine (-11.5 ng/mL; p < .001).

Conclusions

Quetiapine and risperidone had broadly comparable clinical efficacy. Both agents improved cognitive and social functioning, and neither had a clinically significant effect on weight or glucose. Somnolence was more common with quetiapine; EPS and elevated prolactin rates were significantly higher with risperidone.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^113L8jbP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia

RISPERDAL has been shown to elevate prolactin levels in children and adolescents as well as in adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of up to 8 weeks duration in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 17 years) with autistic disorder or psychiatric disorders other than autistic disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar mania, 49% of patients who received RISPERDAL had elevated prolactin levels compared to 2% of patients who received placebo. Similarly, in placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years) with bipolar disorder, or adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with schizophrenia, 82–87% of patients who received RISPERDAL had elevated levels of prolactin compared to 3–7% of patients on placebo. Increases were dose-dependent and generally greater in females than in males across indications.

In clinical trials in 1885 children and adolescents, galactorrhea was reported in 0.8% of RISPERDAL-treated patients and gynecomastia was reported in 2.3% of RISPERDAL-treated patients.

Growth and Sexual Maturation

The long-term effects of RISPERDAL on growth and sexual maturation have not been fully evaluated in children and adolescents.

### Serum prolactin levels, plasma risperidone levels, polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 and clinical response in patients with schizophrenia [^117Mnx8k]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

The object of this study is to assess 1) the relationship between plasma antipsychotic drug concentration, serum prolactin levels and the clinical efficacy of risperidone, 2) the relationship between the CYP2D6 polymorphisms and metabolizing of risperidone and 3) the role of 9-hydroxyrisperidone in elevating prolactin levels. One-hundred and eighteen Chinese schizophrenia patients (40 males, 78 females, age 15–60 years) were given risperidone at dosages ranging from 2–8 mg/day for 8 weeks. Clinical efficacy was determined using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scores (BPRS). Serum prolactin levels were assayed before and after the 8 week treatment and plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were also measured at the end of the 8-week treatment. The results showed there was no significant correlation between the concentration of active moiety and clinical response. Risperidone treatment significantly increased serum prolactin levels. Furthermore, changes of prolactin levels were not correlated with the clinical response. For the risperidone/ 9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio, there was a statistically significant difference among the CYP2D6✱1/✱1, *1/✱10, *10/✱10 genotypes (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.012). No significant differences were found in the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone and active moiety among the genotypes. In addition, the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was not significantly correlated with the increase of serum prolactin. In conclusion, our study has, for the first time, produced evidence that in Chinese schizophrenic patients, the metabolism of risperidone is dependent on CYP2D6. Neither changes in serum prolactin levels nor plasma concentration of active moiety were significantly correlated with clinical efficacy of risperidone. 9-hydroxyrisperidone may not play a predominant role in elevating serum prolactin level.

### Elevation of prolactin levels by atypical antipsychotics [^111JM3C9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Atypical antipsychotics are thought not to elevate prolactin levels. The authors examined data suggesting that atypical antipsychotics do elevate prolactin levels but more transiently than typical antipsychotics.

Method

Prolactin levels in 18 male patients with schizophrenia who were receiving atypical antipsychotics were monitored over the 24-hour period following administration of their daily oral dose of risperidone, olanzapine, or clozapine.

Results

The baseline prolactin levels in patients receiving risperidone (mean = 27 ng/ml, SD = 14) were abnormally high, but baseline prolactin levels in patients receiving olanzapine (mean = 9 ng/ml, SD = 5) and clozapine (mean = 9 ng/ml, SD = 5) were not high. All three atypical antipsychotics caused a doubling of prolactin levels over baseline levels 6 hours after medication administration.

Conclusions

These data suggest that these atypical antipsychotics raise prolactin levels, although the increases with olanzapine did not reach statistical significance. This suggests that the differences in the effects on prolactin levels of atypical and typical antipsychotics are not categorical but lie in the degree and duration of dose-induced prolactin elevation, attributable to the differential binding properties of each drug on pituitary dopamine D(2) receptors.

### Antipsychotic medication, prolactin elevation, and ovarian function in women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [^112gCTep]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

Some, but not all, antipsychotics elevate serum prolactin. Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is thought to account for high rates of menstrual dysfunction and diminished estrogen levels in women with schizophrenia. However, few studies have directly assessed the relationships between prolactin, menstrual function, and ovarian hormone levels in this population. Sixteen premenopausal women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential (five with typical antipsychotics and three with risperidone) and eight treated with an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential (seven with olanzapine and one with clozapine), were studied for eight weeks. Data were collected on menstrual functioning and on serum prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone levels, and were compared between subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential and an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, and between subjects with hyperprolactinemia (N = 6) and normoprolactinemia (N = 10). Additionally, peak ovarian hormone levels were compared to normal values. While mean prolactin levels of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-elevating potential were significantly greater than those of subjects who received an antipsychotic with prolactin-sparing potential, there were no differences in rates of menstrual dysfunction or in ovarian hormone values between the two groups. Additionally, similar rates of menstrual dysfunction and ovarian hormone values were observed between the hyperprolactinemic and normoprolactinemic subjects. Moreover, irrespective of medication type or prolactin status, most subjects had peak estradiol levels below normal reference values for the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. While our sample size is small, warranting the need for further investigation, the findings of this preliminary study suggest that antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia, alone, may not adequately explain the observed ovarian dysfunction in women with schizophrenia.
