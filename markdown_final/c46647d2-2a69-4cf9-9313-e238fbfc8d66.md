## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the next steps in evaluation and management for a 19-day-old with suspected vitamin K deficiency bleeding who is hospitalized following a post-circumcision bleed, did not receive vitamin K at birth, and has severe anemia (Hgb 6.6, Hct 18.5). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stabilization and emergent hemostatic therapy. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, including coagulation studies and imaging for intracranial hemorrhage. Next, I will review definitive hemostatic management, blood product support, and monitoring. After that, I need to consider consultations, disposition, and family counseling. Finally, I should confirm long-term prevention strategies and differential diagnoses if the response is atypical or delayed, anchoring each step to appropriate references and noting any necessary course-corrections as I go [^116P6dUR] [^113gyawy].

> Let me start with ABCs and shock management, because the infant's hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL and hematocrit of 18.5% are consistent with hemorrhagic shock and organ hypoperfusion, and I need to ensure airway protection, oxygenation, and perfusion before anything else; I will secure two large-bore IVs or intraosseous access if IV fails, give 20 mL/kg isotonic crystalloid boluses titrated to perfusion, and initiate PRBCs at 10–15 mL/kg to restore oxygen-carrying capacity, while anticipating a high likelihood of respiratory support given the severity seen in late VKDB cohorts with frequent mechanical ventilation needs [^113SUmNw] [^116giQP4].

> Wait, let me verify the emergent hemostatic therapy sequence, because time to correction matters; I will administer phytonadione promptly, but I need to be precise about route and labeling: although many clinicians give 1 mg IM or IV urgently in this setting, the FDA-labeled treatment dose for neonates is 1 mg SC or IM with reassessment of INR in 2–4 hours, and IV use is off-label for neonates and should be slow, diluted, and light-protected if chosen for life-threatening bleeding; I should explicitly flag this as a self-correction of my initial "IM or IV" phrasing to align with label while acknowledging emergent off-label pediatric practice when shock or severe bleeding precludes delay [^116P6dUR].

> Hold on, I should confirm adjunctive factor repletion for life-threatening bleeding; in severe hemorrhage with markedly prolonged PT/INR and aPTT, I will favor 4-factor PCC at 50 units/kg for rapid normalization of vitamin K–dependent factors when available, recognizing this is extrapolated from adult warfarin reversal and pediatric case data, with FFP 10–15 mL/kg as an alternative if PCC is unavailable or contraindicated, all while proceeding in parallel with vitamin K and transfusion support and explicitly noting the extrapolative nature of PCC dosing in infants [^116twg79] [^1179bPhq] [^115zE1sn].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic laboratory evaluation in parallel with resuscitation; I expect a markedly prolonged PT/INR and aPTT with normal platelets and fibrinogen in VKDB, and I will send PIVKA-II to confirm vitamin K–dependent undercarboxylation if available, understanding that a rapid correction of INR after vitamin K also supports the diagnosis if PIVKA-II cannot be resulted; I will add type and crossmatch, CBC with differential, and a metabolic panel including hepatic function and bilirubin fractions to screen for cholestasis or malabsorption as secondary drivers [^115Pgq3o] [^115NkTg5] [^1178wtPp].

> I need to ensure I do not miss catastrophic bleeding in the brain; therefore, I will obtain urgent head imaging with non-contrast CT or bedside cranial ultrasound depending on stability, because late VKDB has a high rate of intracranial hemorrhage with substantial mortality and neurosurgical intervention rates, and a history of post-circumcision bleeding can be a "warning bleed" preceding ICH, prompting a lower threshold for imaging [^112ySBBP] [^113SUmNw].

> Let me think about the focused history and exam elements that pivot the pretest probability; I should confirm whether intramuscular vitamin K was refused at birth, document exclusive breastfeeding, and screen for maternal risk factors such as malabsorption or drugs that interfere with vitamin K, because the absence of neonatal IM vitamin K increases late VKDB risk roughly 80-fold and exclusive breastfeeding adds risk due to low milk vitamin K content; on exam, I will look for mucocutaneous, umbilical, GI, or soft-tissue bleeding that can accompany or precede ICH [^116bb8rz] [^113gyawy] [^116JLtwa].

> I should confirm the post-dose reassessment plan now; after the initial 1 mg SC/IM phytonadione, I will recheck PT/INR at 2–4 hours to ensure shortening, because failure of INR to improve by that time suggests an alternative or additional process such as liver dysfunction or DIC, and in ongoing severe bleeding or INR > 10, I will consider repeat vitamin K dosing up to an additional 1–4 mg IM in consultation with hematology, acknowledging published case escalation while carefully monitoring for response and adverse events [^116P6dUR] [^115PSccz].

> But wait, I need to double-check blood product support targets; I will continue PRBC transfusions to maintain hemodynamic stability and adequate oxygen delivery, redose PCC or FFP guided by clinical bleeding and serial PT/INR, and transfuse platelets to maintain counts above 50,000/µL if thrombocytopenia develops with massive hemorrhage, while recognizing that platelets are typically normal in isolated VKDB and tailoring products to measured deficits rather than replacing indiscriminately [^116twg79] [^116giQP4].

> I will now examine the monitoring cadence and triggers to escalate; continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and strict I/O are necessary, with neurologic checks every 2–4 hours and a low threshold for repeat neuroimaging if the exam worsens; serial PT/INR every 4–6 hours until normalization is reasonable, as coagulation parameters can correct within hours after parenteral vitamin K in VKDB, alongside CBC and electrolytes during active transfusion [^115Pgq3o].

> Hold on, I should verify the consultation and disposition pathway; I will involve pediatric hematology immediately to guide hemostatic therapy and diagnostic confirmation, admit to PICU for shock, coagulopathy, and potential respiratory failure, and notify pediatric neurosurgery and neurology if ICH is present given the substantial proportion requiring neurosurgical intervention and the high rate of ventilatory support in late VKDB cohorts [^113SUmNw].

> I need to ensure we address parent counseling and systems issues now rather than later; social work and ethics should be engaged to document prior refusal, provide education on the preventable nature of VKDB, and revisit consent for IM vitamin K prophylaxis for future children, reiterating AAP and public health guidance on the superiority of IM prophylaxis and the consequences of refusal seen in recent clusters [^113gyawy] [^116bb8rz].

> Let me consider secondary prevention after acute control, and I should be careful here; some countries employ oral prophylaxis regimens such as the Dutch daily 25 mcg or weekly 1 mg protocols, with data suggesting better biochemical efficacy for extended weekly dosing compared with limited-dose schedules, yet oral regimens require perfect adherence and may fail in occult cholestasis where IM remains superior, so I will prefer IM prophylaxis when possible and reserve oral courses for shared decision-making with candid counseling about adherence and malabsorption risk [^1178wtPp] [^113rNcr5] [^112q1ZGp] [^113dPnuJ].

> I should confirm the neurodevelopmental follow-up plan if ICH is present; structured developmental surveillance every few months in the first two years and early intervention referrals are warranted given the high rates of severe neurologic sequelae after late VKDB-associated intracranial hemorrhage, and families should be counseled about early signs of developmental delay and epilepsy risk [^113SUmNw].

> Next, I should review what to do if the INR does not budge within 2–4 hours of vitamin K or if bleeding persists; I will re-evaluate for secondary causes including cholestatic liver disease and malabsorption, disseminated intravascular coagulation, antibiotic-associated dysbiosis, and non-accidental trauma in the appropriate clinical context, while considering rare congenital bleeding disorders if the laboratory pattern deviates from VKDB, and I will escalate supportive and specific therapies accordingly [^115ra398] [^115NkTg5] [^114vYD4Z] [^1111R46S] [^114iKMjF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I see an unfinished line in the original trace that reads "Disseminated intr".; hold on, I should verify and state explicitly that this refers to disseminated intravascular coagulation and ensure it remains on the differential when vitamin K correction is incomplete or when fibrinogen and platelets are consumed, as that would change both diagnostic emphasis and product selection during resuscitation [^115NkTg5].

> Finally, let me reconsider the early procedural bleed as a clinical clue; post-circumcision hemorrhage in an exclusively breastfed infant without IM vitamin K is a prototypical "warning bleed", and I should not jump to conclusions that it is isolated or benign, because up to half of late VKDB ICH cases have antecedent mucocutaneous bleeding, so timely vitamin K plus factor support and neuroimaging are critical to preempt catastrophic progression [^113SUmNw] [^112ySBBP].

The next steps are to **administer 1 mg IV/IM vitamin K immediately** [^116P6dUR] and **transfuse PRBCs 10–15 mL/kg** for severe anemia [^115PSccz]. Give **FFP 10–15 mL/kg** if PT/INR is markedly prolonged or bleeding is ongoing. Obtain **PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, platelets, and type and crossmatch**; repeat PT/INR 2–4 hours after vitamin K to confirm correction [^116P6dUR]. Monitor for ongoing bleeding, check for intracranial hemorrhage with head ultrasound or CT [^113SUmNw], and admit to the NICU for close observation. Educate parents on the risks of refusing vitamin K [^113gyawy] and arrange follow-up to ensure no further bleeding or neurologic complications [^114zPTum].

---

## Immediate clinical management

### Vitamin K administration

- **Immediate administration of vitamin K**: Give 1 mg phytonadione IV or IM without delay [^116P6dUR] [^113gyawy].
- **Route of administration**: IV is preferred for rapid effect; IM is acceptable if IV access is delayed.
- **Monitoring response**: Recheck PT/INR 2–4 hours after vitamin K; rapid correction supports VKDB [^116P6dUR].

---

### Blood product support

- **Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)**: Transfuse 10–15 mL/kg for severe anemia (Hgb 6.6 g/dL, Hct 18.5%) [^115PSccz].
- **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)**: Give 10–15 mL/kg if PT/INR is markedly prolonged or bleeding continues.
- **Platelets**: Transfuse if count is < 50,000/µL or if there is ongoing bleeding [^115NkTg5].

---

### Local hemostatic measures

Apply **firm direct pressure** to the circumcision site and use topical hemostatic agents (e.g. fibrin sealant or thrombin) when available. If bleeding continues despite medical therapy, **consult surgery** for possible intervention [^1111R46S].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Assess hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets [^116giQP4].
- **Coagulation profile**: PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen [^115NkTg5].
- **Type and crossmatch**: Prepare for transfusion.
- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, bilirubin to assess hepatic function [^111eU7Zj].

---

### Follow-up laboratory tests

Repeat **PT/INR 2–4 hours after vitamin K** to confirm correction; rapid normalization supports VKDB [^116P6dUR]. Obtain a **daily CBC** to monitor for ongoing bleeding or anemia. Consider **PIVKA-II testing**, if available, to help confirm VKDB [^115Pgq3o].

---

## Imaging studies

Obtain **head ultrasound or CT scan** to screen for intracranial hemorrhage [^113SUmNw], given the high risk in VKDB [^115onUV5]. Also perform **abdominal ultrasound** to evaluate for internal bleeding or hepatic abnormalities [^115NkTg5].

---

## Monitoring and supportive care

Continuously **monitor vital signs** to detect shock or ongoing bleeding [^113gyawy]. Perform regular neurologic assessments for seizures, lethargy, and fontanel changes. Admit to the **NICU** for close monitoring and rapid intervention.

---

## Parental education and counseling

Explain to caregivers that declining **vitamin K** [^113gyawy] places infants at high risk of severe bleeding [^114zPTum], including intracranial hemorrhage and death [^116twg79]. Emphasize the importance of **vitamin K prophylaxis** to prevent VKDB, and advise avoiding invasive procedures until coagulation has normalized.

---

## Follow-up and long-term management

Arrange **hematology consultation** to evaluate for an underlying bleeding disorder if coagulation parameters fail to normalize. Ensure **neurology follow-up** to monitor for neurologic sequelae if intracranial hemorrhage occurred [^113zj9Z5]. Maintain regular **pediatric follow-up** to track growth and development and to ensure no recurrent bleeding.

## Summary of management steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Immediate vitamin K administration (1 mg IV/IM) |
| 2 | PRBC transfusion (10–15 mL/kg) |
| 3 | FFP transfusion (10–15 mL/kg) if indicated |
| 4 | Local hemostatic measures |
| 5 | Initial laboratory evaluation (CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen) |
| 6 | Imaging studies (head ultrasound/CT) |
| 7 | Continuous monitoring and NICU admission |
| 8 | Parental education and counseling |
| 9 | Follow-up laboratory tests and specialist consultations |

---

Immediate **vitamin K administration**, **blood product support**, and **close monitoring** are essential for a 19-day-old newborn with suspected VKDB after circumcision bleeding. Early intervention and parental education are critical to prevent severe complications [^113gyawy].

### Intracranial bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency: Advantages of using a pediatric intensive care registry [^113SUmNw]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Of the 16 infants with confirmed late intracranial vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), 12 were boys (75%). The mean age at diagnosis was 47 days. In eight infants (50%), so-called warning bleeds, such as hematemesis, nasal bleeding, and ecchymoses, were observed before symptoms consistent with late intracranial VKDB occurred. The most common locations of the intracranial VKDB were subdural (8/16, 50%) and intracerebral (6/16, 38%). Eleven infants (69%) required mechanical ventilation. Seven infants (44%) underwent neurosurgical intervention. In three additional infants (19%), a neurosurgical intervention was considered but could not be performed due to the poor condition of the infant. In total, six patients died as a consequence of intracranial bleeding (38%), and six infants had severe neurological sequelae following a follow-up period of six months (38%).

Fourteen of the 16 infants had secondary late intracranial VKDB (88%), with 13 cases related to cholestasis (81%). Although no disorder predisposing to vitamin K deficiency could be established in two cases, abnormalities consistent with fat malabsorption were present in both patients. One infant had elevated serum bile acids (22 μmol/l), indicative of cholestasis. The other infant had diminished values of cholesterol and triglycerides (1.0 and < 0.1 mmol/l, respectively).

### Phytonadione [^116P6dUR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for the prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in neonates is as follows.

- **Prophylaxis of vitamin K-deficiency bleeding in neonates**: The recommended dosage of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion is 0.5 mg to 1 mg, administered as a single dose within one hour of birth.

- **Treatment of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in neonates**: The recommended dosage is 1 mg of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion, given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Consider higher doses if the mother has been receiving oral anticoagulants. A failure to respond, indicated by a lack of INR shortening within 2 to 4 hours, may suggest another diagnosis or coagulation disorder.

Directions for the dilution of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion specify that it should be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or 5% Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection. Administration should commence immediately after dilution. Any unused portions of the diluted solution and the contents of the vial should be discarded. Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion must be protected from light at all times. Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^116twg79]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB)**: VKDB is a life-threatening yet preventable disorder that causes severe critical illness in infants.

- **Increasing caregiver refusal**: An increase in caregiver refusal of vitamin K prophylaxis has led to more cases of VKDB. Exclusively breastfed infants are at a particularly higher risk due to low levels of vitamin K in breast milk, especially when caregivers have refused vitamin K prophylaxis.

- **Emergent treatment**: The emergent treatment of suspected VKDB includes parenteral vitamin K and, if severe, either four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate or fresh frozen plasma.

- **Healthcare provider responsibility**: Healthcare providers must offer ongoing education, advocacy, and an informed consent process for vitamin K administration in newborns.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^116JLtwa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is a crucial co-enzyme activator for factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, X, protein C, and protein S; these specific procoagulants participate in the coagulation cascade. Newborns can easily develop vitamin K deficiency due to minimal hepatic stores at birth, low vitamin K content in breast milk, immature gut flora, and poor placental transfer of vitamin K. If vitamin K is not parenterally supplemented within the newborn period, the infant is at high risk for vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), previously known as haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Late-onset VKDB occurs between 1 week and 6 months of age, with a peak incidence between 2 and 8 weeks of age.

A rare yet potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder of early infancy, VKDB is commonly characterised by cutaneous bruising or bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, umbilicus or circumcision site, mucosal surfaces, and/or intracranial haemorrhage. There are several reports of significant rare and specific complications of VKDB, such as mediastinal masses due to thymic haemorrhage, intrathoracic bleeding, hemopericardium, intracranial bleeding, transient cholestasis, and scrotal haematomas. However, there are no reports that describe severe, multi-system organ failure from VKDB.

### Temporal association between serious bleeding and immunization: Vitamin K deficiency as main causative factor [^111HyQzU]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Bleeding as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is rarely reported in children, although it can be a parental concern. Bleeding episodes, ranging in severity from mild to severe and defined as any external and/or internal bleeding, can be caused by acquired or hereditary disorders. This study analyzes whether bleeding episodes in children, recorded as AEFIs, are causally associated with immunization and elaborates on their etiology.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study of 388 AEFI cases in children from the West Java Provincial Committee in Indonesia, confirmed by case findings from 2000 until 2017.

- **Results**: Of the total number of cases studied, 55 (14%) involved children aged 5 days to 12 years who presented with bleeding and were referred to a provincial hospital. Analysis revealed that 32 cases were most likely caused by acquired prothrombin complex deficiency (APCD), and 30 of these APCD cases were strongly suspected to be manifestations of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). All VKDB subjects were aged 5 days to 3 months without a history of administration of prophylactic vitamin K. When a World Health Organization classification was used, most bleeding cases in this study became coincidental events with a temporal association with immunization. A causality assessment suggested that these cases were causally unrelated.

- **Conclusion**: Most cases of bleeding reported as an AEFI were found to be VKDB, which is considered a coincidental event following immunization with a temporal association, and an unrelated category based on the results of a causality assessment.

### Diagnosis and management of bleeding disorder in a child [^116giQP4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Children with symptoms of bleeding and bruising are commonly seen in clinical practice. Primary care providers should be able to decide when and whether evaluation for a bleeding disorder is warranted. This decision depends on one's index of suspicion for bleeding disorder based on history, physical examination, and screening laboratory investigations. Knowledge of the hemostatic physiology is essential to be able to order appropriate laboratory investigations and their accurate interpretation. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and blood platelet concentration constitute the initial diagnostic workup of any bleeding disorder. An abnormality in any of these parameters in a child with excessive bleeding should lead to a presumptive diagnosis of bleeding disorder and trigger referral to a hematologist for confirmation and definitive treatment. Awareness of basic treatment principles for management of bleeding/clotting disorders may prepare the provider to develop appropriate management plans, especially in a life-threatening situation.

### Temporal association between serious bleeding and immunization: Vitamin K deficiency as main causative factor [^112amvHi]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Bleeding in children is often a great concern for parents and physicians, as it frequently suggests an underlying disorder. It can occur spontaneously following medical procedures such as surgery, circumcision, or injection. When bleeding occurs following the administration of immunization, it is sometimes considered an adverse event following immunization (AEFI), which is defined by the WHO as any unfavorable sign, symptom, laboratory result, or disease that occurs after immunization, although it may not necessarily be caused by the vaccination.

Although not widely reported, bleeding symptoms have been listed as AEFIs. Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) was reported and reviewed as an AEFI following the administration of measles-mumps-rubella, hepatitis B, and hepatitis A vaccinations. A study by Hamiel et al. recounted bleeding symptoms as a manifestation of thrombocytopenia in a patient receiving the influenza vaccine. Susanah et al. reported bleeding manifestations as AEFI cases in West Java Province, Indonesia, with most due to vitamin K deficiency, followed by cases caused by underlying diseases, either hereditary hemostasis disorders such as hemophilia or acquired hemostasis disorders such as dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Because vaccines are given to healthy individuals, a higher standard of safety is generally expected compared to other medical interventions. Fear of AEFIs can deter people from getting immunizations; therefore, every case of AEFI must be investigated thoroughly to maintain public trust and improve immunization coverage.

### Early vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a neonate associated with maternal Crohn's disease [^114iKMjF]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

We report herein a case of early vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in a neonate associated with maternal Crohn's disease. A female neonate was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 2778 g. She developed broad purpura on her back on day 1. Laboratory data showed anemia, prolonged coagulation time, and elevated protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II. Early VKDB has not been reported in a neonate born from a mother with active Crohn's disease. It is essential to give vitamin K selectively as soon as possible after birth to prevent early VKDB in neonates.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^117PnfTg]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin K1 1 mg IM prophylaxis should be administered immediately after birth to prevent early-onset VKDB. In addition, pregnant women who have received drugs that interfere with vitamin K metabolism, such as anti-epileptic drugs, anti-tuberculosis drugs, or vitamin K antagonist drugs, or who have fat malabsorption, should be given prophylactic vitamin K1, 20 mg/day orally. Vitamin K1 should be administered at least two weeks before the expected delivery time.

Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate is approved for use in life-threatening bleeding secondary to vitamin K antagonism in adults. We describe the use of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for hemostasis in a 6-week-old child with life-threatening vitamin K-dependent bleeding who never received vitamin K prophylaxis at birth.

### Temporal association between serious bleeding and immunization: Vitamin K deficiency as main causative factor [^1122pYUb]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Most adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with bleeding manifestations in this study (41 out of 55) were considered coincidental due to an absence of evidence of causation, and the results of a causality assessment suggested unrelated categories. It is possible that temporal associations are often conflated with an immunization-related cause; these purely temporal associations are unavoidable. Some cases proved to be program errors caused by inappropriate injection techniques, which are preventable.

All cases with bleeding manifestations suspected to be an AEFI were referred to the regional hospital or Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital as severe conditions involving seizures, unconsciousness, and severe anemia requiring hospitalization. These cases were considered serious adverse events.

The etiology of severe bleeding as a manifestation of an AEFI in this study was mainly due to vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB)-related acquired prothrombin complex deficiency (APCD). All cases had no history of prophylactic vitamin K administration during the neonatal period. VKDB diagnoses were established clinically, and laboratory results suggested that the condition was due to a deficiency of vitamin K, with partially or completely decreased factors II, VII, IX, and X, producing a hypocoagulable state that responded to vitamin K administration. This study did not measure undercarboxylated prothrombin (factor II) or proteins induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA) to confirm VKDB, as the relevant tests were not available. This measurement aims to exclude liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), two conditions that can be ruled out by clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.

### Notes from the field: Late vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants whose parents declined vitamin K prophylaxis — Tennessee, 2013 [^116bb8rz]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is a coagulopathy that develops in infants who do not have sufficient vitamin K stores to support the production of clotting factors. In adults, vitamin K is absorbed from food and from vitamin K synthesized by gut bacteria. However, placental transfer in humans is limited; cord blood and infant liver reserve levels of vitamin K are substantially below adult levels. As a result, infants are predisposed to develop VKDB, which is classified as early, classic, and late, according to when it presents.

In the United States, the administration of intramuscular vitamin K at birth to prevent all forms of VKDB has been standard practice since first recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1961. Without this prophylaxis, the incidence of early and classical VKDB ranges from 0.25% to 1.7% of births; the incidence of late VKDB ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 per 100,000 infants. The relative risk for developing late VKDB has been estimated at 81 times greater among infants who do not receive intramuscular vitamin K than in infants who do receive it.

During February–September 2013, four confirmed cases of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding were diagnosed at a children's hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. The four infants had laboratory-confirmed coagulopathy, defined as an elevation of prothrombin time (PT) greater than or equal to four times the laboratory limit of normal, correctable by vitamin K administration, and symptomatic bleeding. Three of the infants were born at major area hospitals, and one was born at home. The infants all had been healthy and developed normally prior to the onset of symptoms.

### Late vitamin K deficiency bleeding after intramuscular prophylaxis at birth: a case report [^114oWJ4a]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 6-week-old female who presented an intracranial hemorrhage due to late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). No other evident bleeding sites were present at the moment of diagnosis. Intramuscular vitamin K (1 mg) was administered at birth. She was exclusively breast-fed. No other risk factors for VKDB were detected. Low levels of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors and their normalization after vitamin K administration confirmed the diagnosis of late VKDB. The present case suggests potential risks related to a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K at birth.

### Notes from the field: Late vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants whose parents declined vitamin K prophylaxis — Tennessee, 2013 [^112DQc9C]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

All four of the infants survived. The infant with gastrointestinal bleeding recovered fully. The three with intracranial hemorrhage are being followed by neurologists; one has an apparent gross motor deficit. Although deficits have not yet been identified in the other infants, all are currently under 1 year of age, and the neurodevelopmental impact of the hemorrhages might become apparent in the context of further development.

Preliminary queries of Tennessee hospital discharge data during 2007–2012 revealed no confirmed cases of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding, defined as an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code of either hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (776.0) or vitamin K deficiency (269.0), along with any codes for symptoms of bleeding, including intracranial or gastrointestinal hemorrhages, epistaxis, bruising, or hemothorax. During this period, 493,259 live births occurred in Tennessee.

To assess the proportion of neonates who did not receive a vitamin K injection in 2013, records of a random sample of infants born during January–October 2013 at each of three Nashville area hospitals and at four major Tennessee nonhospital birthing centers were reviewed. At the Nashville hospital with the highest proportion of neonates not administered vitamin K, 3.4% of 3,080 infants discharged from the newborn nursery received no vitamin K injection. In contrast, 28.0% of 218 neonates at birthing centers did not receive vitamin K. Case-finding efforts revealed no additional cases of late VKDB in Tennessee in 2013.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: A systematic review [^114JL44Y]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis: For the first objective, data from the available studies were tabulated to obtain the median incidence of VKDB in LMICs and high-income countries. We intended to pool the incidence if the relevant data were available. For objective 2, meta-analysis of the studies with complete data was carried out using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We used the fixed effects model for meta-analysis. For categorical outcomes, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. For significant findings, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated along with 95% CIs.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^1135Nc6p]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, particularly in cases of supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering 1–5 mg of oral vitamin K to asymptomatic patients with an INR greater than 8.0. A follow-up INR should be obtained the following day to determine if an additional dose of vitamin K is necessary.

### Neonatal thymic hemorrhage secondary to vitamin K deficiency: A case report [^116DFs1y]. Neonatology (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in newborns remains a preventable yet potentially devastating condition. Maternal malabsorption disorders such as Crohn's disease may place infants at increased risk of coagulopathy due to impaired transplacental vitamin K transfer. This report describes a rare and severe case of VKDB in a preterm infant and his postpartum mother, highlighting the potential consequences of undiagnosed maternal vitamin K deficiency and emphasizing the importance of heightened awareness in high-risk pregnancies.

- **Case report**: A 32-year-old woman with Crohn's disease presented at 34+6 weeks' gestation with preeclampsia and was delivered via urgent cesarean at 35+3 due to non-reassuring fetal testing. Her newborn son required resuscitation and developed severe coagulopathy with bruising, bleeding, and a large anterior mediastinal mass, later confirmed as hemorrhagic thymic tissue without neoplasm. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly elevated INR and PIVKA-II, which improved with vitamin K and plasma transfusions. The mother experienced significant postpartum hemorrhage with a pelvic hematoma and coagulopathy, requiring transfusions, embolization, and vitamin K supplementation. Both mother and infant recovered following appropriate interventions. At 13 months, the infant had mild left-hand weakness but normal neurodevelopmental scores.

- **Conclusion**: This case highlights a rare but serious complication of maternal vitamin K deficiency resulting in neonatal coagulopathy and thymic hemorrhage. Given the increased risk in mothers with malabsorptive disorders, heightened awareness is crucial.

### Intracerebral mass bleeding in a term neonate: Manifestation of hereditary protein S deficiency with a new mutation in the PROS1 gene [^116eWrkA]. Neonatology (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency is the major cause of coagulopathy-induced intracranial bleeding in term neonates and is considered first in any term neonate with severe hemorrhage. The most common manifestation of hereditary prothrombotic disorders during the neonatal period is thrombosis of the A. cerebri media or sinus thrombosis.

- **Case report**: A 4-day-old newborn was admitted with seizures and hemorrhagic shock. Ultrasound revealed a left-sided intraparenchymatous bleeding. MRI findings supported a subarachnoidal and intracerebral mass bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency-related bleeding or hemophiliac diseases were excluded; however, homozygous protein S deficiency with a new mutation in the protein S (PROS1) gene (c.701A > G, p. Tyr234Cys) was found. The patient experienced an additional thrombosis of the A. abdominalis and expired.

- **Conclusion**: Congenital prothrombotic disorders have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. This newly described mutation in the PROS1 gene (c.701A > G, p. Tyr234Cys) appears to be of clinical relevance.

### Neonatal vitamin K refusal and nonimmunization [^1139B7Rx]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal vitamin K prophylaxis is an effective intervention for reducing vitamin K deficiency bleeding. A recently published report of parental refusal of vitamin K prompted an investigation into the prevalence and characteristics of this group and explored whether these same parents were likely to subsequently refuse immunization for their children.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study of all infants born in Alberta between 2006 and 2012 using linkage of administrative health data. Risk factors for vitamin K refusal were determined using Poisson regression. The association between vitamin K refusal and nonimmunization was assessed using relative risk.

- **Results**: Among the 282,378 children in the cohort, 99.7% received vitamin K, and 0.3% declined. Midwife-assisted deliveries were more likely to be associated with vitamin K refusal compared to physician-attended delivery (risk ratio 8.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5–11.0). Planned home delivery (risk ratio 4.9, CI 3.8–6.4) or delivery in a birth center (risk ratio 3.6, CI 2.3–5.6) were more likely to result in the decline of vitamin K compared to hospital delivery. Vitamin K refusal was associated with a 14.6 (CI 13.9–15.3) higher relative risk of having no recommended childhood vaccines at 15 months.

- **Conclusions**: This is the first population-based study to characterize parents who are likely to decline vitamin K for their infants and whose children are likely to be unimmunized. These findings enable earlier identification of high-risk parents and provide an opportunity…

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^115Pgq3o]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

In many countries, vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) has been effectively eliminated through routine prophylaxis. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in caregiver refusal of intramuscular vitamin K administration at birth. Unsurprisingly, late-onset VKDB is re-emerging, putting more infants at risk of presenting with severe multi-system organ failure and life-threatening complications.

The diagnosis of VKDB should be considered in the broad differential of an infant presenting with subtle signs and symptoms, such as pallor, poor feeding, and lethargy, along with bruising, bleeding, or being in extremis. Obtaining a birth and immunisation history from caregivers and the electronic medical record is crucial. Laboratory studies in VKDB will invariably show increased aPTT, PT, and INR values in the presence of normal platelet count and fibrinogen levels but are otherwise non-specific. The diagnosis of VKDB can also be confirmed by increased biomarker levels of proteins induced by vitamin K absence or antagonism (PIVKA-II). This test can be sent at the time of presentation or up to several days post hoc and provides irrefutable evidence of VKDB.

Unfortunately, the PIVKA-II drawn on this patient was unable to be resulted by the processing laboratory. However, rapid normalisation of coagulation parameters with vitamin K replacement, as was evident in this case, is also consistent with a VKDB diagnosis. Infants with suspected or confirmed VKDB should be treated with parenteral vitamin K. In cases of severe bleeding, the administration of prothrombin complex concentration is preferable to fresh frozen plasma due to the speed of action.

### Temporal association between serious bleeding and immunization: Vitamin K deficiency as main causative factor [^115ra398]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency can occur as a secondary deficiency after the neonatal period due to a lack of oral intake of vitamin K, alteration in gut flora as a consequence of long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, liver disease, or malabsorption of vitamin K. In this study, the VKDB cases were classified as classical and late-onset VKDB variants. Late-onset VKDB is commonly accompanied by intracranial bleeding and severe anemia and is associated with a high mortality rate. VKDB contributes to neonatal mortality and morbidity. The case fatality rate of VKDB cases is high, as reported by Cekinmez et al, who found a survival rate of VKDB in infants to be 50%, with all deaths presenting with intracranial bleeding. The incidence rate of VKDB in Asia ranges from 20 to 116 per 100,000 births. Takahashi et al. estimated the incidence of late VKDB in Japan to be 1.9 cases per 100,000 births. This number is higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Despite the WHO recommendation, vitamin K prophylactic treatment in low-resource settings remains low.

All VKDB cases in this study were determined to be coincidental events with a temporal association with immunization. VKDB was not considered to be caused by vaccine products, immunization error, or immunization anxiety. This finding is in line with a previous study in West Java, Indonesia, by Susanah et al, who reported that VKDB is the main cause of severe bleeding in AEFI cases in children, with all cases categorized as coincidental events following immunization.

Vaccines are usually administered to healthy children. In this study, no subjects…

### Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: A systematic review [^111b3B9y]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Search methods for identification of studies**: We initially searched electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, CINAHL, IndMed, and the clinical trials website, up to September 2009. We used the following search terms for searching MEDLINE: (Newborn OR infan* OR neonat*) AND (vitamin K prophylaxis). Similar terms were used for searching the other databases. No language restrictions were applied. We later updated the search in December 2013; however, due to practical reasons, we could only update the search in MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and IndMed.

	- Related conference proceedings, such as the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meetings for the years 2000 to 2013, were also searched for relevant abstracts. For further identification of ongoing trials, we searched the website.

	- We scanned the titles and abstracts of the retrieved citations to exclude those that were obviously irrelevant. The full text of the remaining studies was retrieved to identify relevant articles. The search strategy is summarized in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Table 1).

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was carried out using a pre-designed data extraction form that was pilot-tested by the review authors (MJS, PK, and RA). We extracted information on the study setting (country, type of population, and socioeconomic status), study intervention (type of conventional treatment, description of vitamin K used, including dose and frequency), sample size, length of follow-up, randomization procedure, allocation concealment, risk of bias, and outcomes as listed above.

### Are pediatricians complicit in vitamin K deficiency bleeding [^115KPhXK]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all newborns receive a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding. How should the clinician respond when parents decline vitamin K? Although vitamin K deficiency bleeding can have devastating sequelae, they are uncommon; therefore, parents are generally allowed to decline vitamin K after counseling is provided. When parents ask for a vitamin K preparation of unproven effectiveness, should the clinician honor that request?

To address these questions, we present a case of a healthy newborn whose parents declined intramuscular vitamin K and requested an oral preparation. Two general pediatricians discuss the medical and ethical issues these situations pose, and the parents describe their experience.

### Rise in late onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding in young infants because of omission or refusal of prophylaxis at birth [^114P3NmB]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Newborns are at risk for vitamin K deficiency and subsequent bleeding unless supplemented at birth. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding is an acquired coagulopathy in newborn infants due to the accumulation of inactive vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, which leads to an increased bleeding tendency. Supplementation of vitamin K at birth has been recommended in the United States since 1961 and has successfully reduced the risk of major bleeding. However, the refusal or omission of vitamin K prophylaxis is increasing and places newborn infants at risk for life-threatening bleeding.

- **Patients**: Over an eight-month period, we encountered seven infants with confirmed vitamin K deficiency; five of these patients developed vitamin K deficiency bleeding.

- **Results**: The mean age of the seven infants with vitamin K deficiency was 10.3 weeks (range, 7–20 weeks); manifestations ranged from overt bleeding to vomiting, poor feeding, and lethargy. None of the infants had received vitamin K at birth, and all were found to have profound derangement of coagulation parameters, which corrected rapidly with the administration of vitamin K in IV or intramuscular form. Four of the seven infants had intracranial hemorrhage; two of these infants required urgent neurosurgical intervention.

- **Conclusion**: Supplementation of vitamin K at birth for all newborns prevents major hemorrhagic complications, such as intracranial bleeding, due to vitamin K deficiency. Parental refusal of vitamin K is increasingly common. It is critical that health care providers and the public be made aware of the varied presentation of this condition to ensure timely intervention.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis in newborns [^115DLFXN]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

One Cochrane systematic review was identified, addressing prophylactic vitamin K for the prevention of HDN in preterm neonates (Ardell 2018). We identified another Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of prophylactic vitamin K in preventing HDN in all infants, mainly term babies (Puckett 2000). Although published before 2010, we included this review as it serves as the foundational evidence supporting the existing recommendations from both the WHO and PrevInfad. The Puckett 2000 Cochrane review assessed the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in preventing classic and late HDN, but clinical bleeding was only evaluated as an outcome for classical HDN.

The 13 identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs included only term infants or infants without complications; for one trial, this information was unknown. Eight of these studies included only exclusively breastfed infants. The studies were published between 1960 and 1998, though the countries where they were conducted were not mentioned. The authors of the review acknowledged the poor methodological quality of the included trials, such as poorly described or incorrect randomization and high losses to follow-up. The certainty of the evidence in this review was not graded. However, the evidence was assessed as moderate to low quality by the authors of the WHO recommendations for managing common childhood conditions.

Another systematic review was identified, with the literature search conducted up to 2008.

### Vitamin K and the newborn infant [^113gyawy]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Intramuscular administration of vitamin K for the prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) has been a standard of care since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended it in 1961. Despite the success of preventing VKDB with vitamin K administration, the incidence of VKDB appears to be on the rise. This increase in incidence is attributable to parental refusal and the lowered efficacy of alternate methods of administration. The aim of this statement is to discuss the knowledge of prevention of VKDB with respect to term and preterm infants and address parental concerns regarding vitamin K administration.

### Genetic variants of the vitamin K dependent coagulation system and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants [^113BDwNr]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

This study investigates the role of genetic variants in the vitamin K dependent coagulation system and their association with intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. The research team, led by experts in medical care, genotyping, and coagulation studies, collected clinical data, carried out genotyping, and analyzed the results. The findings contribute to our understanding of how genetic predispositions might influence the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in this vulnerable population.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^114Ad6jj]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of early-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in at-risk neonates who did not receive vitamin K supplementation varied from 6 to 12%. This case report aims to show that VKDB can occur abruptly after birth despite vitamin K1 1 mg IM being given immediately after birth.

- **Case presentation**: A term female baby was born through vaginal delivery of a 28-year-old mother, G1P0A0, 39–40 weeks gestation, with a normal APGAR score. The birth weight was 3445 g, and the birth length was 52 cm. During pregnancy, the mother did not take any drugs except vitamins. There were no abnormalities on the baby's physical examination, and the anus was patent. Immediately after birth, the baby received a vitamin K1 1 mg intramuscularly. Abruptly, 50 min after delivery, there was meconium with lots of fresh blood. Laboratory results showed hemoglobin at 19.6 g/dL; leukocytes at 25,010/uL; platelets at 390,000/uL, with increased PT and aPTT. A peripheral blood smear showed normal blood morphology. When 7 hours old, the baby experienced significant hematochezia. Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin to 17.5 g/dL and increased PT, aPTT, and INR. No abnormalities were found on the babygram and abdominal ultrasound. The working diagnosis was gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early-onset VKDB. The baby received vitamin K1 2 mg IM, fresh frozen plasma, and a packed red cells transfusion. The patient returned home in good clinical condition.

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin K1 1 mg IM prophylaxis should be given immediately after birth to prevent early-onset VKDB. In addition, pregnant women who receive drugs that could inhibit vitamin K should be closely monitored.

### Bleeding issues in neonates and infants - update 2015 [^115NkTg5]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

The presentation of a neonate with clinical bleeding symptoms commonly causes considerable anxiety to parents and treating physicians. Since inherited coagulation disorders are rare, many children with persistently abnormal coagulation screens will have an underlying bleeding disorder. Apart from emergency cases, a family history, including a bleeding questionnaire, is mandatory. It should inquire about the onset and/or severity of hemorrhage symptoms prior to laboratory assessment. The absolute values of reference ranges for coagulation assays in neonates and children vary with analyzer and reagent systems, confirming the concept of developmental hemostasis. Physiologic concentrations of coagulation proteins gradually increase and are lower in premature infants compared to full-term babies or healthy children.

The evaluation should include global screening tests and a full blood cell count to rule out thrombocytopenia. As in adults, a prolonged PT in neonates reflects decreased plasma concentrations of vitamin-K-dependent factors, whereas a prolonged PTT stems from decreased plasma levels of contact factors. When initial laboratory test results reveal abnormalities, as compared to age-related values, a stepwise diagnostic approach should be followed. In the bleeding neonate or infant with no laboratory abnormality, FXIII and alpha-2 antiplasmin activity should be assessed. When primary hemostatic defects are suspected, platelet function should be further evaluated. Treatment options for a bleeding neonate vary according to the underlying medical condition.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: a systematic review [^11449vB7]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

In the Thailand surveillance study reported by Chuansumrit et al, two time periods were studied: from 1981 to 1984, when no prophylaxis was routinely used, and from 1988 to 1995, when most neonates were supplemented (2 mg orally for normal and 0.5 to 1 mg IM for sick neonates). The response rates in the survey were 58.2% and 67%, respectively, for the two time periods. VKDB (total n = 830) was reported mainly in exclusively breastfed infants (92%) who did not receive vitamin K prophylaxis at birth (90%). The incidence of VKDB significantly declined from 72 per 100,000 live births in the earlier time period to 4.2 to 7.8 per 100,000 live births in the later period. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was high (82%), as was the case fatality rate (24%).

Pooled analysis of the two studies from Germany and the United Kingdom showed a significant reduction in the incidence of late VKDB following IM vitamin K prophylaxis.

### Intracranial bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency: Advantages of using a pediatric intensive care registry [^112ySBBP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Intracranial bleeding

Between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2007, 18,233 infants were admitted to the Dutch PICUs. The search strategy retrieved 428 infants, 64 of whom were diagnosed with intracranial bleeding. Child abuse was the proven cause in 5 patients or highly suspected in 12 patients, totaling 17 patients. Sixteen infants had confirmed late intracranial VKDB. In one additional infant, late intracranial VKDB was suspected but couldn't be confirmed, as vitamin K was supplemented before coagulation factors were measured and no PIVKA analysis was performed. The mean age at presentation in patients with late intracranial VKDB was significantly lower than in those with intracranial bleeding due to child abuse (47 versus 90 days, p = 0.01). Consequently, VKDB was the most common cause of intracranial bleeding in the first 3 months of life (14/41, 34%).

### Vitamin K prophylaxis in newborns [^117KNbdu]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The comparison of vitamin K versus placebo or no treatment in preventing hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN) involves two main methods of administration: intramuscular (IM) and oral.

- **IM vitamin K (single dose) versus placebo or no treatment**:
	Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from the 1960s compared a single dose of IM vitamin K with placebo or no intervention. These studies demonstrated a reduction in clinical bleeding within one to seven days of life (relative risk [RR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.96; risk difference [RD] -0.02; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.00 in one trial), and a reduction in bleeding after circumcision (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42; RD -0.11; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.07 in one trial). Additionally, two trials from the 1990s examined the same comparison but reported different outcomes. These later trials showed improved biochemical indices of coagulation status among children who received vitamin K, specifically a reduction in the detection of prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA II) at 1 to 7 days of life (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.71; RD -0.49; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.28; 2 trials).

- **Oral vitamin K (single dose) versus placebo or no treatment**:
	Three trials compared a single dose of oral vitamin K with placebo or no supplement. These studies showed a significant reduction in the detection of PIVKA II at 3 days of life, favoring vitamin K (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.61; RD -0.44; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.29; 3 trials). Clinical bleeding was not assessed in these studies.

### Intracranial bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency: Advantages of using a pediatric intensive care registry [^1178wtPp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Of the infants with late intracranial VKDB, the values of several biochemical parameters, and the age and weight at diagnosis were obtained, as well as information concerning the severity, outcome, and etiology of the bleeding. Age at diagnosis was defined as the age of the infant when first seen by a doctor with complaints related to VKD. Cholestasis was defined as total serum bilirubin concentration > 50 μmol/l with direct fraction ≥ 20%. When administration of vitamin K prophylaxis to an infant was mentioned in the patient file but the quantity of vitamin K was not specified, it was assumed that the Dutch vitamin K prophylactic regimen was followed. This regimen consists of administering 1 mg vitamin K orally directly after birth, followed by daily administration of 25 μg vitamin K orally from one week to three months postpartum. According to the absence or presence of an underlying disorder predisposing to VKD, late intracranial VKDB was subclassified as idiopathic late intracranial VKDB or secondary late intracranial VKDB, respectively.

- **Statistical analysis**: To determine the overall incidence of late intracranial VKDB and to assess completeness of ascertainment of late intracranial VKDB, a capture–recapture analysis was performed on the patients captured in 2005 by the PICE registry and general surveillance. Birth date, gender, and initials from patients captured by the PICE registry were retrieved from local databases and were used to identify the infants detected in both studies.

### Evaluation of bleeding disorders in the newborn [^111eU7Zj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Neonatal bleeding disorders may present a diagnostic challenge to the pediatric clinician. Isolated thrombocytopenia rarely presents as a hemorrhagic emergency. Appropriate laboratory testing with consideration of the time of presentation and disease state is crucial for developing an appropriate differential diagnosis. Deficiencies of certain coagulation proteins, coupled with multiple acquired risk factors and/or thrombocytopenia, can result in a hemorrhagic emergency in the neonatal period.

### Vitamin k prophylaxis in newborns [^113QwfSc]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

All newborns should receive vitamin K prophylaxis, as it has been proven that oral and intramuscular prophylactic vitamin K given after birth is effective for preventing classical HDN. There are no randomized trials looking at the efficacy of vitamin K supplement on late HDN. Additionally, there are no randomized trials comparing the oral and intramuscular route of administration of prophylactic vitamin K in newborns. As such trials are unlikely to be conducted, the efficiency of the different regimens is assessed by national epidemiological surveillance.

Older trials comparing oral versus intramuscular administration of vitamin K do not report clinical bleeding as an outcome, but they conclude that both routes of administration improve biochemical indices of coagulation status. Looking at surveillance data from European countries, it seems that there is no significant difference between the IM and the oral regimens for preventing classical and late HDN, provided that the oral regimen is duly completed. However, the oral route is not appropriate for newborns with biliary atresia. Evidence assessing vitamin K prophylaxis in preterm infants is scarce.

### Notes from the field: Late vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants whose parents declined vitamin K prophylaxis — Tennessee, 2013 [^114zPTum]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is a coagulopathy that develops in infants who do not have sufficient vitamin K stores to support the production of clotting factors. In adults, vitamin K is absorbed from food and from vitamin K synthesized by gut bacteria. However, placental transfer in humans is limited; cord blood and infant liver reserve levels of vitamin K are substantially below adult levels. As a result, infants are predisposed to develop VKDB, which is classified as early, classic, and late, according to when it presents. In the United States, administration of intramuscular vitamin K at birth to prevent all forms of VKDB has been standard practice since first recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1961. Without this prophylaxis, incidence of early and classical VKDB ranges from 0.25% to 1.7% of births. The incidence of late VKDB ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 per 100,000 infants. The relative risk for developing late VKDB has been estimated at 81 times greater among infants who do not receive intramuscular vitamin K than in infants who do receive it.

### Prophylactic vitamin K for the prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in preterm neonates [^116hboMD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of coagulation factors. Term infants, especially those who are exclusively breastfed, are deficient in vitamin K and consequently may have vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). Preterm infants are potentially at greater risk for VKDB because of delayed feeding and subsequent delay in the colonization of their gastrointestinal system with vitamin K-producing microflora, as well as immature hepatic and hemostatic function. The objective is to determine the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of VKDB in preterm infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 December 2016), Embase (1980 to 5 December 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 December 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any preparation of vitamin K given to preterm infants were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We evaluated potential studies and extracted data in accordance with the recommendations of Cochrane Neonatal.

- **Main results**: We did not identify any eligible studies that compared vitamin K to no treatment. One study compared intravenous (IV) to intramuscular (IM) administration of vitamin K and compared various dosages of vitamin K. Three different prophylactic regimes of vitamin K (0.5 mg IM, 0.2 mg vitamin K1, or 0.2 mg) were analyzed.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^113of3to]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

**Differential diagnosis**: The presenting signs of hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnoea, poor feeding, and inconsolability raised concern for sepsis. The hyperglycaemia suggested a stress response to severe systemic disease, toxic ingestion, congenital diabetes mellitus, or an inborn error of metabolism. The progressive shock, impending cardiorespiratory failure, encephalopathy, ecchymoses, and clinical signs of coagulopathy on arrival to the PICU supported the differential diagnosis of septic shock but broadened it to include haemorrhagic shock, possibly due to non-accidental trauma. Chest radiography obtained after endotracheal intubation revealed a widened mediastinum and pleural effusions, which could be attributable to an underlying haematologic or oncologic disease. Laboratory and further imaging alone were not diagnostic but supported severe systemic disease with multi-system organ failure. After multi-organ stabilisation, a review of the electronic medical record revealed that intramuscular vitamin K administration had been declined at birth. The history of intramuscular vitamin K refusal made late-onset VKDB the most likely aetiology of the haemorrhagic shock and subsequent multi-system organ failure.

### Prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in breastfed infants: Lessons from the Dutch and Danish biliary atresia registries [^112q1ZGp]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Newborns routinely receive vitamin K to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding. The efficacy of oral vitamin K administration may be compromised in infants with unrecognized cholestasis. We aimed to compare the risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding under different prophylactic regimens in infants with biliary atresia.

From Dutch and Danish national biliary atresia registries, we retrieved data on infants who were either breastfed and received 1 mg of oral vitamin K at birth followed by 25 micrograms of daily oral vitamin K prophylaxis (Netherlands, 1991–2003), 2 mg of oral vitamin K at birth followed by 1 mg of weekly oral prophylaxis (Denmark, 1994 to May 2000), or 2 mg of intramuscular prophylaxis at birth (Denmark, June 2000–2005) or were fed by formula. We determined the absolute and relative risk of severe vitamin K deficiency and vitamin K deficiency bleeding on diagnosis in breastfed infants on each prophylactic regimen and in formula-fed infants.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding was noted in 25 of 30 breastfed infants on 25 micrograms of daily oral prophylaxis, in 1 of 13 on 1 mg of weekly oral prophylaxis, in 1 of 10 receiving 2 mg of intramuscular prophylaxis at birth, and in 1 of 98 formula-fed infants (P < .001). The relative risk of bleeding in breastfed compared with formula-fed infants was 77.5 for 25 micrograms of daily oral prophylaxis, 7.2 for 1 mg of weekly oral prophylaxis, and 9.3 for 2 mg of intramuscular prophylaxis at birth.

A daily dose of 25 micrograms of vitamin K fails to prevent bleedings in apparently healthy infants.

### Intracranial hemorrhage due to late hemorrhagic disease in two siblings [^111yeNMe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Deficiency of vitamin K predisposes infants to early, classic, or late hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN); late HDN may be associated with serious and life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. It is characterized by intracranial bleeding in infants aged 1 week to 6 months due to severe vitamin K deficiency, occurring particularly in exclusively breastfed infants. Late HDN remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in developing countries where vitamin K prophylaxis is not routinely practiced. In this study, we report on two siblings with intracranial bleeding who were fully breastfed without routine supplementation of vitamin K. Vitamin K should be given to all newborns as a single intramuscular dose of 1 mg.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency resulting in intracranial bleeds: A case report and literature review [^111jXWCG]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 24-day-old male neonate who presented with multiple episodes of apnea, poor feeding, excessive crying, irritability, vomiting, and yellowish discoloration. The patient did not receive a vitamin K injection at birth, and most likely, the neonate's dietary intake was insufficient to meet vitamin K requirements for coagulation. This deficiency resulted in an intracranial hemorrhage, ultimately leading to the mortality of the child.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis in newborns [^115kdGJX]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin K given after birth in preventing the haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). We conducted a literature search up to the 10th of December 2019 using key terms and manual searches in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported. All newborns should receive vitamin K prophylaxis, as both oral and intramuscular prophylactic vitamin K given after birth have been proven effective for preventing classical HDN. There are no randomized trials looking at the efficacy of vitamin K supplement on late HDN, and no trials comparing the oral and intramuscular routes of administration for prophylactic vitamin K in newborns. From older trials and surveillance data, it seems that there is no significant difference between the intramuscular and oral regimens for preventing classical and late HDN, provided that the oral regimen is duly completed. Evidence assessing vitamin K prophylaxis in preterm infants is scarce.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^113aRAMN]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The early-onset VKDB diagnosis in this case was established based on the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding in a clinically healthy newborn with no thrombocytopenia, normal blood morphology at peripheral blood smear, increased PT, aPTT, and INR. The values of PT, aPTT, and INR returned to normal after the administration of vitamin K1. Moreover, no abnormalities were found on the babygram and abdominal ultrasound.

Why did a baby receiving vitamin K1 1 mg still have early-onset VKDB? Factors inducing vitamin K deficiency in newborns include poor placental transfer of vitamin K, immature gut flora, low vitamin K content in breast milk, substantial differences among individuals, poor intestinal absorption of vitamin K, and the low activity level of vitamin K epoxide reductase. In this case, the cause may be poor placental transfer of vitamin K, as well as low vitamin K content in breast milk or poor intestinal absorption of vitamin K. In healthy newborns, vitamin K1 in cord blood is often below the detection limit of 0.02 μg/L. The content of vitamin K1 in mature human milk is only 2.1 μg/L, and in colostrum, 2.3 μg/L, while formula milk can be up to 4.9 μg/L. Even if taking mature human milk at 200 mL/kg a day, it has been estimated that a baby would receive less than 1 μg vitamin K a day. One study showed that 25 μg of vitamin K3 is the minimum effective dose required to achieve optimal prothrombin complex levels in term newborns. An injection of 1 mg of vitamin K1 at birth will cause vitamin K1 levels 24–48 hours later to reach 1000–5000 times higher than baseline levels.

### A blown pupil and intracranial hemorrhage in a 4-week-old: a case of delayed onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding, a rare "can't miss" diagnosis [^115onUV5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Infants are at risk for vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) due to limited stores of vitamin K (VK) at birth and a low concentration of VK in human breast milk. Consequently, the administration of intramuscular (IM) VK at birth has been recommended in the United States since 1961. Infants who do not receive IM VK and who are exclusively breast-fed are at increased risk for VKDB. Although VKDB is rare, a common presentation of late onset VKDB is intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Case report**: We describe a 4-week-old infant who presented to the emergency department with lethargy and a grossly dilated right pupil. The parents denied trauma. A computed tomography scan revealed a right-sided subdural hematoma with midline shift. The infant's international normalized ratio was > 10.9, and his prothrombin time (PT) was > 120 seconds. VK was administered, and the child was transferred to a tertiary care center for emergent neurosurgery.

- **Clinical awareness**: The challenging aspect of making this critical diagnosis is considering it. Any bleeding in a newborn without trauma should prompt inquiry regarding neonatal VK administration and a serum prothrombin time level. Fortunately, once the diagnosis is made, therapy in the emergency department can be lifesaving and is familiar to emergency physicians. Treatment parallels usual care for adults with excess anticoagulation caused by warfarin. Prompt intravenous VK is universally accepted. Studies to support fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate are lacking but considered clinically sensible.

### A diagnostic approach to mild bleeding disorders [^114vHxZQ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Mild inherited bleeding disorders are relatively common in the general population. Despite recent advances in diagnostic approaches, mild inherited bleeding disorders still pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Hemorrhagic diathesis can be caused by disorders in primary hemostasis (von Willebrand disease, inherited platelet function disorders), secondary hemostasis (hemophilia A and B, other rare coagulant factor deficiencies) and fibrinolysis, as well as in connective tissue or vascular formation. This review summarizes the currently available diagnostic methods for mild bleeding disorders and their pitfalls, from structured patient history to highly specialized laboratory diagnosis. A comprehensive framework for a diagnostic approach to mild inherited bleeding disorders is proposed.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^114NX7jv]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of early-onset vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in at-risk neonates who did not receive vitamin K supplementation varied from 6 to 12%. This case report aims to show that VKDB can occur abruptly after birth despite administration of vitamin K1 1 mg intramuscularly immediately post-birth.

- **Case presentation**: A term female baby was born through vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old mother (G1P0A0) at 39–40 weeks gestation with a normal APGAR score. The birth weight was 3445 g and birth length 52 cm. During pregnancy, the mother only took vitamins and no other drugs. The physical examination of the baby showed no abnormalities, and the anus was patent. The baby received 1 mg of vitamin K1 intramuscularly right after birth. However, abruptly, 50 minutes post-delivery, there was meconium with a significant amount of fresh blood. Laboratory results revealed hemoglobin at 19.6 g/dL, leukocytes at 25,010/uL, platelets at 390,000/uL, with increased PT and aPTT, while a peripheral blood smear indicated normal blood morphology. At 7 hours old, the baby experienced significant hematochezia. Subsequent laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin to 17.5 g/dL and further increases in PT, aPTT, and INR. No abnormalities were observed on the babygram and abdominal ultrasound. The working diagnosis was gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early-onset VKDB. The baby was treated with 2 mg of vitamin K1 IM, fresh frozen plasma, and a packed red cells transfusion. The patient returned home in good clinical condition.

- **Conclusion**: Vitamin K1 1 mg IM prophylaxis should be administered immediately post-birth to prevent early-onset VKDB.

### Vitamin K deficiency mimicking child abuse [^114vYD4Z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Supplemental vitamin K is required for normal hemostasis in infancy. Infants born outside the hospital may not receive prophylactic vitamin K and may suffer from bleeding into various tissues, likely presenting to the emergency department. This report describes an infant born at home who presented with intracranial bleeding and signs and symptoms consistent with child abuse. Further investigations confirmed the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency. Although it is important to consider child abuse when the history and examination are consistent with the diagnosis, it is equally important to consider other potential diagnoses, including vitamin K deficiency.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^113wVpky]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

**Management**: Effective management of hypovitaminosis K requires rapid detection of signs related to clotting disorders. Administration of 0.5–1.0 mg of intramuscular vitamin K has become the antenatal standard of care. However, 2 mg oral vitamin K1 at birth, with subsequent 1 mg orally weekly for 3 months, has been introduced as an alternative. This approach has demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of VKDB worldwide. For infants who do develop bleeding events in the setting of vitamin K deficiency, 1 mg of intramuscular vitamin K has been shown to restore homeostatic coagulation and reverse increased INR and PTT times. For adults with vitamin K nutritional deficiency, supplementation of 90 µg/day for women and 120 µg/day for men has been encouraged. If retinal hemorrhages occur in the setting of VKDB, close observation is warranted to ensure prompt resolution and to monitor for amblyopia. Careful observation of low-vision habits in newborns or bleeding events visualized by the parents is crucial during the developmental period.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: a systematic review [^111UZT8a]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Given the lack of consensus, the WHO (World Health Organization) did not make a universal recommendation on routine vitamin K prophylaxis in the first edition of its Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children. Instead, it advised health providers to follow their respective national guidelines to decide the need for prophylaxis. In 2010, WHO reviewed the available evidence on key questions, including routine vitamin K prophylaxis, to update the recommendations in the second edition of its Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children. As a part of this process, we conducted the present systematic review to synthesize the evidence on the need for and efficacy of vitamin K prophylaxis at birth.

### Intracranial hemorrhage due to vitamin K deficiency after the newborn period [^113zj9Z5]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

This study presents the clinical and laboratory findings and outcomes of infants with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to vitamin K deficiency after the newborn period. It evaluates vitamin K prophylaxis. The hospital records of 19 infants with a diagnosis of ICH due to vitamin K deficiency, seen in our clinic over less than four years, were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age at the onset of symptoms was 49 ± 18 days.

The most frequent presenting complaints were convulsions (58%), vomiting (47%), and irritability (47%). The most frequent examination findings were coma (74%), fontanel bulging (68%), and absence of pupil reaction (42%).

The localizations of the ICHs were as follows: parenchymal (47%), subarachnoid (47%), subdural (42%), and intraventricular (26%). Four patients had used antibiotics and one patient had suffered diarrhea before the onset of the symptoms. One patient had mild hepatic dysfunction that resolved spontaneously in a few weeks, with no identified cause.

Mortality was observed in six (32%) patients. Ten patients were followed up for a mean period of 26.9 ± 22.6 months. The follow-up findings included developmental delay (40%), microcephaly (30%), epilepsy (30%), blindness (20%), strabismus (20%), spastic tetraparesis (10%), spastic hemiparesis (10%), growth retardation (10%), and hydrocephaly (10%). Three (30%) patients remained neurologically normal.

Vitamin K deficiency leads to death and neurological defects, making vitamin K prophylaxis at birth a priority. In this series, hepatic dysfunction was detected in only one patient.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^115PSccz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Within 2 hours of arrival, the infant received 1 mg intramuscular vitamin K empirically for profound coagulopathy of yet unclear aetiology. Once the initial INR result was available, an additional 4 mg intramuscular vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma at 10 mL/kg were administered due to the potential for ongoing bleeding apparent on imaging. The decision to give the additional vitamin K was extrapolated from dosing recommendations in biliary atresia and was made in consultation with pediatric pharmacy and pediatric hematology. The infant received packed red blood cells at 15 mL/kg, divided into aliquots of 5 mL/kg, each administered over 3 hours, to mitigate the risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload.

### Vitamin K prophylaxis in neonates: comparing two different oral regimens [^113rNcr5]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

This prospective study evaluated PIVKA-II and PT-INR levels in infants receiving two vitamin K (VK) prophylactic regimens. At a single institution, 119 healthy newborns were given 2 mg of VK syrup. Infants were assigned either to a 3-time regimen (n = 56) with VK administered at birth, five days (5D), and at one-month-old (1M), or a 13-time regimen (n = 63) with VK given at birth, 5D, and then weekly for 11 weeks.

The 13-time regimen significantly lowered PIVKA-II and reduced PT-INR at 1M in both breastfed (PIVKA-II: 18–16 mAU/mL, p = 0.02; PT-INR: 1.37–1.13, p < 0.01) and formula-fed infants (PIVKA-II: 18–15 mAU/mL, p = 0.01; PT-INR: 1.54–1.24, p < 0.01) compared to baseline measurements taken at 5D. The 3-time regimen did not significantly alter PIVKA-II levels and only improved PT-INR (2.00–1.50, p < 0.01) in formula-fed infants.

In conclusion, the 13-time VK regimen significantly enhanced coagulation profiles more effectively than the 3-time regimen.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^1173JdSX]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) is defined as a bleeding disorder caused by insufficient activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, in which coagulation is promptly corrected by vitamin K supplementation. The process of hemostasis is a complex mechanism involving local reactions of blood vessels (vascular phase), the activity of platelets (platelet phase), and the interaction of several specific coagulation factors circulating in the blood (plasma phase). If one of these factors is disturbed, there will be a disruption in the hemostasis process, manifesting clinically as bleeding.

Acquired clotting disorders may result from a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, liver disease, accelerated breakdown of coagulation factors, and coagulation inhibitors. Vitamin K is essential for the activity of several carboxylase enzymes in liver cells and is necessary for the synthesis and activation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, proteins C, and S. The half-lives of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are short, and thus, vitamin K deficiency may lead to neonatal VKDB.

The incidence of early-onset VKDB in at-risk neonates who did not receive vitamin K supplementation is 6–12%. Among cases that did not receive vitamin K administration before delivery, the occurrence of early-onset VKDB is 50%. The usual bleeding sites are the head (cephalohematoma, intracranial), intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, or gastrointestinal tract. The severity of the clinical presentation may be related to the type of maternal treatment that interf…

### Vitamin K prophylaxis for prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding: A systematic review [^113dPnuJ]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the burden of late vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) and the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis on the incidence of VKDB. We searched MEDLINE and other electronic databases, and included all observational studies including population surveys as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The median (interquartile range) burden of late VKDB was 35 (10.5 to 80) per 100,000 live births in infants who had not received prophylaxis at birth. The burden was much higher in low- and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries — 80 (72 to 80) vs. 8.8 (5.8 to 17.8) per 100,000 live births.

Two randomized trials evaluated the effect of intramuscular (IM) prophylaxis on the risk of classical VKDB. Although one trial reported a significant reduction in the incidence of any bleeding (relative risk (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.96) and moderate to severe bleeding (RR 0.19, 0.08 to 0.46; number needed to treat (NNT) 74, 47 to 177), the other trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of secondary bleeding after circumcision in male neonates (RR 0.18, CI 0.08 to 0.42; NNT 9, 6 to 15).

No RCTs evaluated the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis on late VKDB. Data from four surveillance studies indicate that the use of IM/subcutaneous vitamin K prophylaxis could significantly reduce the risk of late VKDB when compared with no prophylaxis (pooled RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.10). When compared with IM prophylaxis, a single oral dose of vitamin K increased the risk of VKDB (RR 24.5; 95% CI 7.4 to 81.0).

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^117P98HJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin K is an essential dietary cofactor required for the synthesis of active forms of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant proteins. Vitamin K deficiency, particularly late-onset deficiency occurring between 1 week and 6 months of age, can cause a life-threatening bleeding disorder. An exclusively breastfed, full-term, 6-week-old infant male presented with severe haemorrhagic shock and multi-system organ failure related to caregiver refusal of intramuscular vitamin K after birth. Coagulation studies were normalized within 8 hours of intramuscular vitamin K administration. An increasing number of caregivers are refusing intramuscular vitamin K, which has led to a rise in the incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Health policy organizations around the world emphasize the benefits of intramuscular vitamin K and the risks of refusal, particularly in exclusively breastfed infants who are at higher risk due to low vitamin K levels in breast milk. This case highlights the multi-system severity of this life-threatening yet preventable disorder.

### Controversies concerning vitamin K and the newborn [^1153XuZP]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Prevention of early vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in newborns, which occurs from birth to 2 weeks of age (formerly known as classic hemorrhagic disease of the newborn), is commonly achieved through oral or parenteral administration of vitamin K. In contrast, late VKDB, with onset from 2 to 12 weeks of age, is most effectively prevented by parenteral administration of the vitamin. Earlier concerns regarding a potential causal link between parenteral vitamin K and childhood cancer have not been substantiated. This revised statement presents updated recommendations for using vitamin K in preventing early and late VKDB.

### International normalized ratio testing with point-of-care coagulometer in healthy term neonates [^113wq5Kf]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, the researchers investigated the utility of point-of-care (POC) coagulometers for testing international normalized ratio (INR) among healthy term neonates. The use of POC devices allows for rapid INR assessments that are particularly beneficial in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) where timely decisions are crucial.

For the purposes of this study:

- **Reference interval (RI)**: was established for healthy term neonates.
- **Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB)**: incidence was monitored through INR measurements.
- **International sensitivity index (ISI)**: ensured consistency across POC devices.
- **Additional measurements included**:
	- Prothrombin time (PT), recorded to determine coagulation status.
	- Standard deviation (SD) and interquartile range (IQR) provided statistical context for INR values.

The study emphasized the need for INR testing to prevent VKDB, a condition that is preventable through early detection and treatment. Proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA) were also noted, highlighting the significance of vitamin K in neonatal health. The authors noted limitations in their study, particularly regarding the variability of INR measurements across different devices.

### Vitamin k prophylaxis in newborns [^112GVkVH]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We examined existing recommendations and supporting evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin K given after birth in preventing the haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). We conducted a literature search up to the 10th of December 2019 using key terms and a manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation as reported by the authors, along with the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as indicated.

All newborns should receive vitamin K prophylaxis, as both oral and intramuscular prophylactic vitamin K given after birth have been proven effective in preventing classical HDN. There are no randomized trials examining the efficacy of vitamin K supplements on late HDN. Furthermore, no randomized trials compare the oral and intramuscular routes of administration of prophylactic vitamin K in newborns. From older trials and surveillance data, it appears there is no significant difference between intramuscular and oral regimens in preventing classical and late HDN, provided that the oral regimen is duly completed. Evidence assessing vitamin K prophylaxis in preterm infants is scarce.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding due to idiopathic early onset of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in a girl baby 50 min after birth: a rare case [^115VjgEH]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Early-onset VKDB (Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding) in newborns is usually associated with medications taken by the mother during pregnancy. These medications include anti-epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates; anti-tuberculosis medications like isoniazid and rifampicin; certain antibiotics, specifically cephalosporins; and vitamin K antagonists like warfarin. Additionally, early-onset VKDB is associated with impaired fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption in the mother and is often found among pregnant women who do not receive vitamin K prophylaxis before delivery.

In Japan, a national survey conducted from 2007 to 2016 identified 18 cases of early-onset VKDB. Among the mothers whose babies had early-onset VKDB, 12 were malnourished, three had Crohn's disease, and three were on warfarin therapy. In the presented case, the mother regularly attended antenatal care with an obstetrician, and her pregnancy was reported to be normal. She did not take any medications except vitamins that do not contain vitamin K. Furthermore, the mother never experienced fat malabsorption disorders and did not have any bleeding episodes prior to delivery. However, during screening, it was found that her hemoglobin level was 7 g/dL, and she received a packed red cell (PRC) transfusion before delivery. The delivery process was smooth without any complications. Consequently, in this case, no maternal factors could account for the early-onset VKDB.

Immediately after birth, the baby received an injection of vitamin K1, 1 mg intramuscularly. As soon as the baby was born, she was able to breastfeed directly from her mother. However, abruptly, 50 minutes after delivery, there was meconium with a significant amount of fresh blood.

### Evaluation and management of congenital bleeding disorders [^1111R46S]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute bleeding and a history of clotting or platelet disorders pose a unique challenge to the emergency physician. The severity of a bleeding presentation is based on the mechanism as well as factor levels. Patients with factor levels greater than 5% can respond to most minor hemostatic challenges, whereas those with factor levels less than 1% may bleed with minor trauma or even spontaneously. Treatment should be initiated in consultation with the patient's hematologist, using medications and specific factor replacement. However, in rare, life-threatening, resource-poor situations, cryoprecipitate or activated prothrombin complex may be considered.
