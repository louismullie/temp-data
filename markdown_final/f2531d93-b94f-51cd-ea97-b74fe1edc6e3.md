## Question

Are erythrocytes macrocyclic in anemia of chronic didease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether erythrocytes are macrocytic in anemia of chronic disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and definitions. Then, I should verify the classic morphologic description of anemia of chronic disease. Next, I will consider exceptions and confounders that can make the red cells appear larger. After that, I should review guideline statements and high-quality sources to confirm the typical MCV pattern. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note when macrocytosis might still be present despite the underlying process.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. The question says "macrocyclic", but the correct hematology term is "macrocytic", which refers to an increased mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells, typically MCV greater than 100 femtoliters in adults, and it is distinct from "microcytic" (small) and "normocytic" (normal size).

> Now, I should verify the classic morphologic description of anemia of chronic disease, also called anemia of inflammation. Multiple authoritative sources consistently describe it as a normocytic, normochromic anemia, meaning the red cells are of normal size and normal hemoglobin content, reflecting impaired erythropoiesis and iron sequestration rather than a change in RBC size per se [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK] [^117Bn4Sx].

> Wait, let me verify whether there are any exceptions that could make the cells look larger. Macrocytosis can occur in chronic inflammatory states when there is a concurrent process such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease with altered RBC membrane lipids, reticulocytosis from hemolysis or bleeding, or medication effects, and these can coexist with anemia of chronic disease, so an elevated MCV in that context reflects the second process rather than the core pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease itself [^111bDP7o] [^1114iuj8] [^111kLtJd].

> I should double-check guideline statements to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. KDIGO guidance for CKD-related anemia, which shares the same pathophysiology as anemia of inflammation, explicitly notes that anemia of CKD is generally normocytic and normochromic, and that macrocytosis should prompt evaluation for B12 or folate deficiency rather than being attributed to the chronic disease anemia itself, reinforcing that macrocytosis is not expected in uncomplicated anemia of chronic disease [^112jsrXp] [^112Si3NX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider the clinical implications. If macrocytosis is present in a patient who otherwise fits anemia of chronic disease, I should confirm B12 and folate status, assess for hemolysis or bleeding with reticulocyte count and hemolysis labs, review medications and alcohol use, and consider liver disease or myelodysplasia, because these are the more likely explanations for the enlarged RBCs rather than the inflammatory anemia mechanism itself [^111bDP7o] [^111kLtJd] [^112Si3NX].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, erythrocytes are not macrocytic in uncomplicated anemia of chronic disease; the typical morphology is normocytic and normochromic, and macrocytosis, when present, signals a concurrent process such as B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, reticulocytosis, or medication effect rather than the anemia of chronic disease itself [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK] [^112jsrXp].

---

Erythrocytes are **not macrocytic** in anemia of chronic disease (ACD); ACD is classically **normocytic** (MCV 80–100 fL) [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK]. Macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL) is not a feature of ACD and, if present, suggests a concurrent cause such as vitamin B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or medication effects [^111bDP7o] [^1114iuj8]. Always evaluate for these alternative etiologies when macrocytosis is observed in a patient with ACD [^111bDP7o].

---

## Morphological characteristics of erythrocytes in ACD

- **Normocytic anemia**: ACD typically presents as a normocytic, normochromic anemia, with erythrocytes of normal size and hemoglobin content [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

- **Normal MCV**: The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is usually within the normal range (80–100 fL) in ACD [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

- **Absence of macrocytosis**: Macrocytosis, characterized by an MCV > 100 fL, is not a typical feature of ACD [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying erythrocyte size in ACD

The **normocytic morphology** in ACD results from complex interactions among inflammatory cytokines, iron metabolism, and erythropoiesis:

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines induce hepatic production of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron homeostasis [^116ir8de] [^115LoZnQ].

- **Iron sequestration**: Hepcidin increases iron retention within macrophages and reduces iron availability for erythropoiesis, leading to functional iron deficiency despite adequate iron stores [^116ir8de] [^115LoZnQ].

- **Impaired erythropoiesis**: Inflammatory cytokines also suppress erythropoietin production and inhibit erythroid progenitor proliferation, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and normocytic anemia [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

---

## Conditions associated with macrocytosis in chronic diseases

Although ACD itself is not macrocytic, **macrocytosis may occur in chronic diseases due to concurrent factors**:

| **Condition** | **Mechanism of macrocytosis** |
|-|-|
| Vitamin B12 deficiency | Impaired DNA synthesis causing megaloblastic anemia [^111bDP7o] |
| Folate deficiency | Impaired DNA synthesis causing megaloblastic anemia [^111bDP7o] |
| Liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis) | Altered lipid metabolism and membrane changes [^1114iuj8] |
| Hypothyroidism | Impaired erythropoiesis and membrane alterations [^111bDP7o] |
| Medications (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine) | Inhibition of DNA synthesis or direct toxicity [^111bDP7o] |

---

## Clinical implications of macrocytosis in chronic diseases

When macrocytosis is observed in a patient with chronic disease, **clinicians should**:

- **Evaluate for concurrent causes**: Assess for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, liver disease, hypothyroidism, and medication-induced macrocytosis [^111bDP7o].

- **Perform additional tests**: Consider serum vitamin B12, folate, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and a peripheral blood smear to identify the underlying cause [^111bDP7o].

- **Differentiate from ACD**: Recognize that macrocytosis is not a feature of ACD and indicates an additional pathological process [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

---

## Summary of key points

- **ACD is normocytic**: Erythrocytes in anemia of chronic disease are typically normocytic, not macrocytic [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

- **Macrocytosis is atypical**: Macrocytosis is not a characteristic feature of ACD and, if present, suggests a concurrent condition [^117SGuKh] [^116xxuaK].

- **Evaluate for concurrent causes**: Clinicians should investigate alternative causes of macrocytosis, such as vitamin deficiencies, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or medication effects [^111bDP7o].

---

Erythrocytes are **not macrocytic** in anemia of chronic disease; ACD is a normocytic anemia. If macrocytosis is present, evaluate for other causes such as vitamin B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or medication effects [^111bDP7o].

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^112jsrXp]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^116ve3vu]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Several causes have been identified including iron deficiency, reduced production of erythropoietin, shortened red cell survival and folate deficiency. Among these, endogenous erythropoietin deficiency is the predominant cause.

Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been effective in treating the anemia of ESRD. However, despite their use, anemia may still occur and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Furthermore, higher ESA doses have also been associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. Whether the increase in mortality observed with ESAs is due to achieved hemoglobin, ESA resistance due to inflammation, a direct effect of erythropoietin, concurrent administration of intravenous iron or some other mechanism, is unclear.

Morphologically, the anemia of ESRD is typically normocytic and normochromic, but up to 30% may have macrocytosis. Proposed causes of macrocytosis in dialysis patients include intravenous iron, megaloblastic anemia due to B12 and folate deficiency or dialysis-induced changes in red cell volume. Reticulocytosis is associated with macrocytosis in the general population and initial studies of ESAs suggested stable and predictable increases in reticulocyte levels with maintenance erythropoietin therapy. However, reticulocytes can also be smaller than mature red cells, and no studies have specifically addressed the relationship between ESAs and macrocytosis.

While several studies have suggested causes, no studies have examined for clinical associations with macrocytosis in dialysis patients. Furthermore, an association between red cell size and mortality has not been identified in previous study.

In our hemodialysis population, we have observed that many patients have an unexplained macrocytosis. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, to identify its clinical associations and to determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^112Si3NX]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — vitamin B12 and folate testing notes these are uncommon but treatable causes of anemia linked to macrocytosis and low red blood cell (RBC) indices, with limited data indicating the prevalence is ≤ 10% of hemodialysis patients and unknown in CKD. Because these deficiencies are easily correctable and vitamin B12 deficiency may signal other disease processes, assessment of folate and vitamin B12 levels are generally considered standard components of anemia evaluation, especially with macrocytosis. Folate deficiency is best detected with serum folate testing, and RBC folate can be measured when serum levels are equivocal or recent dietary intake may obscure deficiency using serum levels alone.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^112FNxzX]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease — abstract states that the guideline aims to provide guidance on diagnosis, evaluation, management and treatment for all chronic kidney disease patients, including non-dialysis, dialysis, kidney transplant recipients and children, at risk of or with anemia, and includes chapters on diagnosis and evaluation and on use of therapeutic agents such as iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents as well as red cell transfusion. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials, with development using an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal and appraisal of evidence quality and recommendation strength following the GRADE approach, and the document discusses controversies, limitations of evidence, and suggestions for future research.

### Molecular basis of inherited microcytic anemia due to defects in iron acquisition or heme synthesis [^1165NARa]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

Microcytic anemia is the most commonly encountered anemia in general medical practice. Nutritional iron deficiency and beta thalassemia trait are the primary causes in pediatrics, whereas bleeding disorders and anemia of chronic disease are common in adulthood. Microcytic hypochromic anemia can result from a defect in globin genes, in heme synthesis, in iron availability or in iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These microcytic anemia can be sideroblastic or not, a trait which reflects the implications of different gene abnormalities. Iron is a trace element that may act as a redox component and therefore is integral to vital biological processes that require the transfer of electrons as in oxygen transport, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism. However, it can also be pro-oxidant and to avoid its toxicity, iron metabolism is strictly controlled and failure of these control systems could induce iron overload or iron deficient anemia. During the past few years, several new discoveries mostly arising from human patients or mouse models have highlighted the implication of iron metabolism components in hereditary microcytic anemia, from intestinal absorption to its final inclusion into heme. In this paper we will review the new information available on the iron acquisition pathway by developing erythrocytes and its regulation, and we will consider only inherited microcytosis due to heme synthesis or to iron metabolism defects. This information could be useful in the diagnosis and classification of these microcytic anemias.

### Anemia of inflammation [^116xxuaK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammation arising from various etiologies, including infection, autoimmune disorders, chronic diseases, and aging, can promote anemia. The anemia of inflammation (AI) is most often normocytic and normochromic and is usually mild. Characteristic changes in systemic iron handling, erythrocyte production, and erythrocyte life span all contribute to AI. The preferred treatment is directed at the underlying disease. However, when the inflammatory insult is intractable, or the cause has not been diagnosed, there are limited options for treatment of AI. Because anemia is a comorbid condition that is associated with poor outcomes in various chronic disease states, understanding its pathogenesis and developing new tools for its treatment should remain a priority. Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide has taken center stage in recent years as a potent modulator of iron availability. As the technology for quantitative hepcidin analysis improves, hepcidin's role in various disease states is also being revealed. Recent insights concerning the regulatory pathways that modify hepcidin expression have identified novel targets for drug development. As the field advances with such therapeutics, the analysis of the impact of normalized hemoglobin on disease outcomes will confirm whether anemia is a reversible independent contributor to the morbidity and mortality associated with inflammatory diseases.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin values at diagnosis of iron deficiency and for assessing trends over periods of weeks or months, but not for assessing acute changes in iron availability secondary to therapy with ESAs.

### Anemia-SEER hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm databaseseer.cancer.gov › seertools › hemelymph… [^113pDRgE]. seer.cancer.gov (2018). Low credibility.

Definition Anemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Many cancer patients develop anemia due to the cancer and/or cancer therapy. This condition may be referred to as Anemia in neoplastic disease or anemia of chronic disorders. The anemia by itself is not reportable. The neoplasm causing the anemia would be reportable. Aplastic anemia occurs when the bone marrow does not make enough new red cells. A neoplasm may cause the aplastic anemia; however, the aplastic anemia by itself is not reportable. Hemolytic anemia is a group of acute or chronic anemias, inherited or acquired, characterized by shortened survival of mature erythrocytes and inability of bone marrow to compensate for the decreased life span. Idiopathic refractory anemia is when the cause of the anemia is not known. This is not the same thing as Refractory Anemia.

Iron -refractory iron deficiency anemia or refractory iron deficiency anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder. Macrocytic anemia is usually caused by vitamin deficiencies, alcohol use, medications or thyroid. The term "macrocytic" refers to the enlarged size of the red blood cells. Aplastic anemia occurs when the bone marrow does not make enough new red cells. A neoplasm may cause the aplastic anemia; however, the aplastic anemia by itself is not reportable. Hemolytic anemia is a group of acute or chronic anemias, inherited or acquired, characterized by shortened survival of mature erythrocytes and inability of bone marrow to compensate for the decreased life span.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- CBC (including MCH, MCV, platelet count) in addition to the hemoglobin concentration

- absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated)

- assessment of iron status (percentage of hypochromic RBCs, but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 hours, or reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, or combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait)

- serum ferritin to assess iron stores

- serum CRP to assess possible inflammation.

### Molecular pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease [^116ir8de]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients suffering from chronic infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and some malignancies develop a mild to moderate anemia designated anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Patients with this anemia have low serum iron, low to normal transferrin, and high to normal serum ferritin concentration. The anemia is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, inducing increased production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. Hepcidin blocks the release of iron from macrophages, hepatocytes, and enterocytes, causing the characteristic hypoferremia associated with this anemia and iron-deprivation of the developing erythrocytes.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112ZPDVr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, anaemia of CKD is normochromic and normocytic and is morphologically indistinguishable from the anaemia of chronic illness. Initial assessment of anaemia in CKD patients should aim at identifying other factors that may influence the response to treatment.

In addition to Hb, other indices of the FBC report may provide important clinical information:
Macrocytosis could be due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency.
In addition to anaemia of CKD, microcytosis could be due to iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathies.
Macrocytosis with leucopoenia or thrombocytopenia could be due to several factors such as alcohol intake, nutritional deficit (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), or myelodysplasia.
Serum folate is more prone to variation and can be affected by the patient's diet immediately prior to blood being taken, alcohol, trauma and other factors therefore occasionally red cell folate may need to be measured where serum folate is equivocal.
Haemolysis is suggested by the presence of macrocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase and positive Coombs test.
The normal absolute reticulocyte count ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 cells/μL. Although it has a significant inter-patient variability, this test may be useful as a semi-quantitative marker of erythropoietic activity.

c.) Evaluating Iron Status in Anaemic Patients with CKD

The aim of evaluating iron status is to assess:
Iron level in tissue stores and
The adequacy of iron utilisation for erythropoiesis.

Serum ferritin level is the only available blood marker of storage iron. There are several tests to assess adequacy of iron for erythropoiesis: TSAT, MCV, MCH, percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (HRC) and reticulocyte Hb content (CHr) or Ret-Hb.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^114f2UTX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The importance of macrocytic anemia or macrocytosis seems to be underestimated in the past. Only a few studies focused on its risk of adverse events or death. Among these studies, Yoon et al. documented that the elevated MCV level was associated with increased liver cancer mortality in men; this finding was consistent with the result of our study. A small-sample study also found a markedly higher MCV in patients with chronic liver failure than in healthy subjects. These observations, though not directly, provided evidence for our conclusion that patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis who have macrocytic anemia were more likely to present worse liver condition.

There are several potential pathological mechanisms that explain why macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment. First, patients with advanced liver damage are more likely to have vitamin B 12 or folate deficiencies, which directly result in macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B 12 and folate coenzymes are required for thymidylate and purine synthesis, thus, their deficiencies result in retarded DNA synthesis and eventually will develop into macrocytic anemia. Second, macrocytic anemia in liver disease may be due to an increased deposition of cholesterol on the membranes of circulating RBCs. This deposition effectively increases the surface area of the erythrocyte. Third, hemolytic anemias are common in advanced liver failure. In this case, excessive destruction of RBCs and increased reticulocyte count can be observed. The immature erythrocytes are approximately 20% larger compared to the mature erythrocytes, which result in macrocytic anemia. Moreover, erythrocyte morphology is affected by various factors in liver disease, such as causes, degree of liver damage, and drugs used. Complicated mechanisms, which allow the synchronized performance of their independent or collaborative functions, determine the shape of RBCs. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that there is a positive correlation between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^113dZg6a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective study, we demonstrated that macrocytic anemia, defined as anemia in which the RBCs are larger than their normal volume (100 fL), is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. This finding remains substantial even after adjusting for demographics and laboratory parameters, such as age, gender, smoking, drinking and total cholesterol.

An MCV level greater than 100 fL, which is also known as macrocytosis, may not always be associated with anemia. Moreover, it presents independently from anemia in most cases. Nevertheless, we chose anemia as one of our inclusion criteria because 84.2% of the 1445 pre-screened patients have anemia. This result was consistent with the finding of another study, which reported that about 75% of patients with chronic liver disease have a diverse aetiology of anemia. Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis may have anemia due to a lack of haematopoietic factors, shortened erythrocyte survival, reduced bone marrow function, or gastrointestinal bleeding. All these conditions indicate impaired liver function and a high risk of mortality. Therefore, patients without anemia were excluded from the data analysis to avoid potential bias in our present study.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^113xYrjt]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in CKD — transfusion when erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy is ineffective notes that chronic anemia may require prolonged red cell replacement leading to iron overload. Approximately 200 mg of iron are delivered per unit of red cells, the "freshest-available" units should be selected to maximize post-transfusion survival, and hemolysis can cause organ damage when the total iron delivered approaches 15 to 20 grams (about 75 to 100 units of red cells); transfusion issues in acquired or congenital hemolytic anemia are more complex.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Macrocytic anemia is associated with the severity of liver impairment in patients with hepatitis B virus-related decompensated cirrhosis: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^113JiJuT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is an end-stage disease that invariably leads to death. It is the 14th most common cause of death in adults worldwide and results in 1.03 million deaths per year. Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major causes of cirrhosis and 30% of deaths are attributable to HBV. China is a highly endemic area of HBV, where 78% of patients with cirrhosis are HBsAg positive. In patients with cirrhosis, the 5-year probability of decompensation is 15–20%, while the 5-year survival rate decreases from 84 to 14–35% once clinical decompensating events occur.

Anemia is a common comorbidity in cirrhosis that is associated with poor prognosis. Erythrocyte abnormalities were clinically important and frequent findings in patients with chronic disease. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), a measurement of the average volume of red blood cells (RBCs), has been documented to be associated with an increase in many clinical conditions. Typically, anemia can be classified into macrocytic anemia (> 100 fL), normocytic anemia (80–100 fL), and microcytic anemia (< 80 fL) based on the patient's MCV level. A recent study has reported that the elevated MCV level was associated with increased liver cancer mortality, especially in men who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that a common association might exist between macrocytic anemia and the severity of liver impairment in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

We used the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for evaluating the severity of liver impairment of HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis. The MELD score was developed to predict the short-term mortality of end-stage liver disease because of the shortage of donated livers. It had been validated subsequently as an accurate predictor of survival among different populations of patients with advanced liver disease and was adopted for organ allocation for liver transplantation instead of the older Child-Pugh score in the USA since 2002. Liver transplantation is generally recommended for patients with MELD score of > 15, if possible.

The goal of the present study is to investigate whether the MELD score is higher in the macrocytic anemia group in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.

### Role of proteinuria in the anemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cFErz]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The most important contributors to the anemia of patients with chronic kidney disease are insufficient erythropoietin production and erythropoietin hyporesponsiveness, decreased red blood cell half-life, iron deficiency, and inflammation. However, in contrast to the role of kidney failure, that of proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome is less clear. Bissinger et al. now provide evidence in mouse models and patients with chronic kidney disease that heavy proteinuria alters erythrocyte metabolism and increases erythrocyte death.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^1161wz8n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A reduced erythrocyte mass can be the consequence of haemolytic anaemia, resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hereditary or acquired diseases can be the cause of intrinsic abnormalities in the structure and membrane of RBSs, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, enzymatic disorders (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] and pyruvate synthesis), sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. Regarding extrinsic factors of anaemia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation represent mechanical processes with the destruction of RBCs. Furthermore, antibody‐mediated destruction of RBCs can also be considered an extrinsic disorder.

The morphology of anaemia is described by RBC size, shape and colour. Using this classification system, anaemias are classified as hypochromic microcytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 fL), macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL) and normocytic normochromic anaemia (MCV: 80–100 fL). Main causes of microcytic anaemia include IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, with impaired iron absorption due to tissue inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively. Inflammation through cytokine‐mediated mechanisms may trigger an increase in hepcidin and a decrease in circulating iron levels, but not ferritin, hence in the presence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of inflammation, ACD should be diagnosed if serum ferritin levels are increased and transferrin saturation is decreased.

Finally, anaemia can also be classified according to the form of clinical presentation as acute (usually due to bleeding or haemolysis) or chronic.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to consider measuring red cell zinc protoporphyrin concentration as an alternative to indices of RBC hypochromia or reticulocyte hemoglobin content for assessing functional iron deficiency, recognizing that the former is less sensitive than the latter to acute changes in iron availability. Obtain measurements on washed cells, with the use of appropriate reference limits, when used in the assessment of functional iron deficiency in patients with CKD.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Redefining iron deficiency in patients with chronic heart failure [^112C2KYL]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Because the treatment of iron deficiency in HF does not depend on characterization of its pathogenesis, efforts to distinguish between absolute and functional iron deficiency at one particular point in time in a patient's clinical course have little therapeutic relevance. There is no rationale for identifying the relative contribution of specific pathophysiologic mechanisms for iron deficiency in clinical practice, and there is no reliable noninvasive means of achieving this goal. Nevertheless, the finding of meaningful hypoferremia together with a hypochromic microcytic anemia might prompt a diagnostic workup for a gastrointestinal malignancy.

### 2002 E. mead Johnson award for research in pediatrics lecture: the molecular biology of the anemia of chronic disease: a hypothesis [^115LoZnQ]. Pediatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease is a common disorder that afflicts patients with a wide variety of inflammatory conditions including arthritis, malignancies, infections, and inflammatory bowel disease. It results in significant morbidity and may be severe enough to require blood transfusions. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease is not fully understood, but poor maintenance of red blood cell mass has been observed at three levels: 1) iron is not efficiently recycled from reticuloendothelial macrophages to erythroid precursors, 2) erythroid precursors respond poorly to erythropoietin, and 3) red blood cell survival is decreased. Whether each of these changes is related to the same effector of the inflammatory process is unknown. We have had the opportunity to investigate severe anemia of chronic disease in an unusual group of patients with glycogen storage disease type 1a. We found that anemia was directly related to the presence of large hepatic adenomas that inappropriately produced a new peptide hormone, hepcidin. Hepcidin has recently been identified as part of the innate immune response and is a key regulator of cellular iron egress. Based on our findings in this patient group, we propose a central role for hepcidin in anemia of chronic disease, linking the inflammatory process with iron recycling and erythropoiesis. We present a hypothesis based on our findings.

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease? [^112UTSei]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially taken to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality ignores the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations point to overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, as the likely culprit. This Review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. I have focused on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

### Is there an established hemoglobin target range for patients undergoing chronic dialysis? [^111JNYV2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) remains a common approach in managing anemia of CKD. The 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in CKD suggests avoiding ESA therapy use to maintain Hb level above 11.5 g/dL. However, optimal Hb target range in adult patients undergoing chronic dialysis remains unknown. Clinical studies suggest risks associated with normalization of Hb levels in adult patients with CKD. In this article, we briefly review some of these studies and the concerns associated with higher Hb targets in this patient population. We also suggest a target Hb range for adult chronic dialysis patients receiving ESAs. It is currently undetermined if this target Hb range would apply to newer agents that are being studied for anemia management in this population.

### Abstract… [^112mPFoX]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Decreased Red Blood Cell Production ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease is the most common normocytic anemia and the second most common form of anemia worldwide. 7 The MCV may be low in some patients with this type of anemia. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease is multifactorial and is related to hypo-activity of the bone marrow, with relatively inadequate production of erythropoietin or a poor response to erythropoietin, as well as slightly shortened red blood cell survival. ENDOCRINE DEFICIENCY RENAL FAILURE Anemia occurs in acute and chronic renal failure. The anemia is usually normocytic but may be microcytic. In renal failure, anemia occurs in part because uremic metabolites decrease the lifespan of circulating red blood cells and reduce erythropoiesis.

Anemia secondary to uremia is characterized by inappropriately low erythropoietin levels, in contrast to the normal or high levels that occur with most other causes of anemia. To further confuse the presentation, serum iron levels and the percentage of iron saturation are often low, apparently because of negative acute-phase reactions. 3, 9, 10 The corrected reticulocyte index, along with the white blood cell and platelet counts, indicates whether the bone marrow is functioning appropriately. The corrected reticulocyte index should be elevated in patients with an acute anemia but a competent bone marrow. Anemia of renal disease is associated with a relative underproduction of erythropoietin, and inappropriate erythropoietin levels appear to contribute significantly to anemia of chronic disease.

With the development of recombinant human erythropoietin, there has been considerable interest in finding out whether exogenous erythropoietin administration would improve anemia. The effects of r-HuEPO administration have been studied in a variety of disorders. In a trial conducted in 1990, 22 all 11 patients with anemia related to rheumatoid arthritis reached a normal hematocrit after 24 weeks. Since then, r-HuEPO has been tested in patients with anemia of chronic disease secondary to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, renal disease and other disorders. 23, 24 Quality-of-life parameters in responders improved significantly.

### Novel potential therapeutics to modify iron metabolism and red cell synthesis in diseases associated with defective erythropoiesis [^117H13Xf]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Diseases associated with abnormal red cell synthesis and their pathophysiology

Erythropoiesis can be altered by genetic mutations that impair red cell production, such as in congenital anemias or polycythemia vera (PV), or by conditions that perturb normal iron metabolism, such as iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Conditions associated with chronic inflammation, such as chronic kidney disease, are also characterized by reduced red cell production and survival. In this review, we focus on diseases that illustrate key pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for altered red cell production, the role of iron metabolism, and strategies targeting these mechanisms that may serve as potential novel treatment approaches. Anemia is a consequence of inadequate functional red cells in circulation, which can result from reduced red cell production, increased red cell destruction, or a combination of these two processes. Diseases associated with genetic mutations that directly alter red cell production are generally characterized by defects at the erythroid cell-differentiation stage at which the mutated genes exert their functions. These mutations may also affect the quality and lifespan of surviving mature red cells.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^113oMRJM]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

A final consideration is that macrocytosis may be a manifestation of altered hematopoiesis. In one study of non-dialysis elderly patients, 25/49 with unexplained macrocytosis had dysplastic changes or findings consistent with MDS on bone marrow biopsy. Alternatively, altered hematopoiesis may be due to high doses of ESAs. Macrocytosis due to suspected abnormal rapid cellular maturation in states of massive erythropoietic stimulation has been observed in rat models, and we did observe an association between darbepoetin alfa dose and MCV > 102 fl. However, altered hematopoiesis was not confirmed with bone marrow biopsy in this study. Furthermore, bone marrow dysplasia was not identified in an earlier study of dialysis patients treated with recombinant erythropoietin for 24 months who subsequently underwent bone marrow biopsy. In addition, macrocytosis in dialysis patients has been identified prior to the introduction of ESAs.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Red blood cell physiology in critical illness [^116ebL2Y]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Reduction in red blood cell mass, as well as structural and functional alterations of erythrocytes, occurs in critical illness. This review discusses these changes in red blood cell physiology, emphasizing the pathogenesis of anemia in intensive care unit patients.

Data Source

Studies published in biomedical journals.

Data Synthesis and Conclusion

Anemia in intensive care unit patients resembles the anemia of chronic disease, being characterized by diminished erythropoietin production relative to decreased hematocrit, altered iron metabolism, and impaired proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. Inflammatory mediators play a major role in the development of insufficient erythropoiesis and altered iron metabolism. Furthermore, a proinflammatory milieu promotes structural and functional alterations of erythrocytes, impairing their deformability and possibly impairing microvascular perfusion. Collectively, these changes in red blood cell physiology can impair oxygen transport to tissues and, thereby, might contribute to the development of multiple organ failure in critical illness.

Anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Algorithms for red cell transfusion use outline entry conditions and transplant-related risk stratification. Acute clinical situations include acute severe hemorrhage, unstable coronary artery disease, and when rapid preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) correction is required. Chronic clinical situations include when chronic anemia exists and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are ineffective due to hemoglobinopathies, bone marrow failure, or ESA resistance. A special chronic clinical situations branch specifies chronic severe symptomatic anemia with a relative contraindication to an ESA (for example, current or previous malignancy or previous stroke). The algorithm then asks "Potential transplant recipient?" and evaluates "Risk of allosensitization" with a High group (previous transplant[s], previous pregnancies, previous transfusions) versus a Low group (untransfused males, untransfused females, nulliparous females), concluding with the directive to assess the balance of risks and benefits before transfusing.

### Erythrocyte indices and response to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in chronic kidney disease patients with renal anemia: a retrospective study [^1159aZnC]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Erythrocyte indices are the simple and useful indicators that represent the size and quality of red blood cells, and several lines of evidence indicate that HIF-PHIs affect these indices. For example, it has been shown that HIF-PHIs increase mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH) levels in hemodialysis patients, an effect that has not been observed in patients receiving ESAs. However, it is currently uncertain how the changes in erythrocyte indices are associated with the effectiveness of HIF-PHIs in improving anemia in CKD patients. Given that erythrocyte indices deliver information on erythrocyte quality and can reflect multiple factors involved in erythropoiesis, appropriate evaluation of these indices may provide valuable information for guiding the selection between HIF-PHIs and ESAs. In addition, there are studies to suggest that low MCV levels, even within the reference range, are associated with the increased risk of CKD progression. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate whether erythrocyte indices, as well as their changes in response to treatment, are associated with the effectiveness of anti-anemic treatments (ESAs and HIF-PHIs) in CKD patients with renal anemia.

- sudden rapid decrease in hemoglobin concentration (at the rate of 0.5–1.0 g/dL per week, or requirement for transfusions at the rate of approximately 1–2 per week)

- normal platelet and white cell counts

- absolute reticulocyte count < 10, 000/mL.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111V71Fg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

For Children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA Therapy. (ungraded)

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^1114iuj8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^116ZGeYj]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

As a predictor of increased mortality, macrocytosis does have advantages over other laboratory markers commonly used in dialysis patients. In our study, macrocytosis was a strong predictor of mortality evidenced by a high hazard ratio. In addition, as it is included in the routine CBC, measurement of the MCV requires no additional laboratory tests and is cheaper compared to conventional laboratory markers of mortality.

There are limitations to this study. With only 23 outcomes, we were unable to do extensive multivariate analyses without risk of over-fitting. Therefore, there is the possibility of residual confounding. However, this is primarily a pilot study and the main purpose is to stimulate hypothesis generation for future analyses. Another limitation is that the lack of serum B12 and red cell folate levels in all patients makes it difficult to completely exclude vitamin deficiency as a cause of macrocytosis. In addition, only a few patients had reticulocyte levels measured at baseline (a known cause of macrocytosis). However, 93 and 100% of patients with an MCV > 102 fl were on multivitamin and folate supplementation, and at six months, RBC folate and serum B12 levels were normal in over 90% of macrocytic patients (data not shown). In addition, a reanalysis at six months revealed comparable reticulocyte counts between macrocytic and normocytic patients, and an absolute reticulocytosis in only a few macrocytic patients (data not shown). Finally, as this is a single-centre study, we acknowledge that the findings of this study cannot necessarily be generalized to other dialysis populations. A recent study in a larger cohort of dialysis patients identified a lower mean MCV than our cohort, and did not find an association between MCV and mortality. However, our study is unique as we analyzed MCV both as a continuous and categorical variable. Furthermore, our population is not unlike other dialysis cohorts with respect to its identified predictors of mortality. These predictors include age, stroke, cancer, albumin and ferritin. Nonetheless, our population may be unique with respect to a high prevalence of macrocytosis and validation with another dialysis population may increase the strength of our findings. In addition, if macrocytosis is associated with higher comorbidity it would fluctuate based on patient clinical status. Thus, a study using marginal structural models that adjust for time dependent confounding would be clinically relevant.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117SGuKh]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in patients with diseases that cause prolonged immune activation, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list has grown to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity. Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis. In addition, shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern. Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, the diagnosis of AI patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more difficult. In addition to treatment of the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in many patients. In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may offer additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, finding the appropriate indications for the specific treatment of AI will require improved understanding and a balanced consideration of the contribution of anemia to each patient's morbidity and the impact of anemia treatment on the patient's prognosis in a variety of disease settings.

Anemia is a common feature of CKD associated with poor outcomes. The current management of patients with anemia in CKD is controversial, with recent clinical trials demonstrating increased morbidity and mortality related to erythropoiesis stimulating agents. Here, we examine recent insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of CKD. These insights hold promise for the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies that directly target the pathophysiologic processes underlying this form of anemia.

### New treatment approaches for the anemia of CKD [^114ECGvt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Normocytic normochromic anemia is a common complication in chronic kidney disease and is associated with many adverse clinical consequences. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and adjuvant iron therapy represent the primary treatment for anemia in chronic kidney disease. The introduction of ESAs into clinical practice was a success story, mediating an increase in hemoglobin concentrations without the risk for recurrent blood transfusions and improving quality of life substantially. However, recombinant ESAs are still expensive and require a parenteral route of administration. Moreover, concern has arisen following randomized clinical trials showing that higher hemoglobin targets and/or high ESA doses may cause significant harm. This, together with changes in ESA reimbursement policy in some countries, has resulted in a significant reduction in ESA prescribing and the hemoglobin level targeted during therapy. Several attempts are being made to develop new drugs with improved characteristics and/or easier manufacturing processes compared with currently available ESAs, including new treatment approaches that may indirectly improve erythropoiesis. We give an update on the new investigational strategies for increasing erythropoiesis, examining in depth their characteristics and possible advantages in the clinical setting and the caveats to be aware of at the present stage of development.

### Understanding anemia of chronic disease [^111Jj3JM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The anemia of chronic disease is an old disease concept, but contemporary research in the role of proinflammatory cytokines and iron biology has shed new light on the pathophysiology of the condition. Recent epidemiologic studies have connected the anemia of chronic disease with critical illness, obesity, aging, and kidney failure, as well as with the well-established associations of cancer, chronic infection, and autoimmune disease. Functional iron deficiency, mediated principally by the interaction of interleukin-6, the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, and the iron exporter ferroportin, is a major contributor to the anemia of chronic disease. Although anemia is associated with adverse outcomes, experimental models suggest that iron sequestration is desirable in the setting of severe infection. Experimental therapeutic approaches targeting interleukin-6 or the ferroportin-hepcidin axis have shown efficacy in reversing anemia in either animal models or human patients, although these agents have not yet been approved for the treatment of the anemia of chronic disease.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^115y47Jv]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as the kidney disease progresses.
- **Pathophysiology**: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in EPO (EPO) production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.
- **Disease course**: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased QoL, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48–5.26).

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

Red blood cell indices:
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]
Mean corpuscular volume [MCV]
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

Diagnostic work-up of iron deficiency in IBD

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit (Table 2).

Table 2
Minimum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels used to define anemia in people living at sea level

The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate ID, as the presence of ACD can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

Iron stores: serum ferritin
Iron transport: transferrin saturation
Iron utilization: erythropoiesis: i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be low even in cases of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Its role in the work-up of iron deficiency therefore, obsolete.

### Hemoglobin variability in anemia of chronic kidney disease [^111WT8w7]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin levels in individuals with chronic kidney disease fluctuate frequently above or below the recommended target levels within short periods of time even though the calculated mean hemoglobin remains within the target range of 11 to 12 g/dl. Both pharmacologic features and dosing of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may lead to cyclic pattern of hemoglobin levels within the recommended range. Several longitudinal studies highlight the complexity of maintaining stable hemoglobin levels over time. As a consequence, patients may risk increased hospitalization and mortality, because both low and high hemoglobin levels are associated with increased cardiovascular events and death. The duration of time that hemoglobin remains higher or lower than the target thresholds may be important to adverse outcomes. It is not clear whether adverse effects of hemoglobin variability are because of the therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and/or iron or despite such a therapy. Several factors affect hemoglobin variability, including those that are drug related, such as pharmacokinetic parameters, patient-related differences in demographic characteristics, and factors affecting clinical status, as well as clinical practice guidelines, treatment protocols, and reimbursement policies. Strategies that consider each of these factors and reduce hemoglobin variability may be associated with improved clinical outcomes.

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### Conjugated bilirubin triggers anemia by inducing erythrocyte death [^113dXR33]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver failure and fibrosis are commonly associated with anemia, a phenomenon which remains ill-defined due to the heterogeneous nature of anemia's pathogenesis. During liver disease, anemia can occur after blood loss, infection, cancer, or nutritional imbalances. Bleeding through esophageal varices can result in rapid blood loss and consequently anemia in patients with liver failure. Additionally, chronic viral infections can reduce the number of circulating erythrocytes by depletion of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Hepatitis B and C infections and their treatment regimens are similarly associated with reduced erythrocyte counts.–Furthermore, as folate and vitamin B 12 are critical for erythrocyte development, nutritional imbalances may result in reduced erythrocyte production and consequently anemia. Moreover, expression of ferroportin-1 in the liver can impact the development of anemia, as ferroportin-1 is critical for iron metabolism and hematopoiesis during an iron-deficient diet. Although many conditions are associated with anemia, the impact of liver damage on erythrocytes and the associated underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider suspecting CKD as a possible cause of anemia when the GFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², especially if < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (or < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² in patients with diabetes) and no other cause such as blood loss, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency is identified.

Urgent treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — 4.2: In certain acute clinical situations, "we suggest patients are transfused when the benefits of red cell transfusions outweigh the risks; these include (2C):" when rapid correction of anemia is required to stabilize the patient's condition (e.g., acute hemorrhage, unstable coronary artery disease) and when rapid pre-operative Hb correction is required; additionally, "we suggest that this treatment be considered if the Hb is < 7 g/dl (< 70 g/l)".

### Association of anaemia in primary care patients with chronic kidney disease: cross sectional study of quality improvement in chronic kidney disease (QICKD) trial data [^113hVcVp]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may improve outcomes. However, little is known about the scope to improve primary care management of anaemia in CKD.

Methods

An observational study (N = 1,099,292) with a nationally representative sample using anonymised routine primary care data from 127 Quality Improvement in CKD trial practices (ISRCTN5631023731). We explored variables associated with anaemia in CKD: eGFR, haemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), iron status, cardiovascular comorbidities, and use of therapy which associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, oral iron and deprivation score. We developed a linear regression model to identify variables amenable to improved primary care management.

Results

The prevalence of Stage 3–5 CKD was 6.76%. Hb was lower in CKD (13.2 g/dl) than without (13.7 g/dl). 22.2% of people with CKD had World Health Organization defined anaemia; 8.6% had Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 3% Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 1% Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. Normocytic anaemia was present in 80.5% with Hb ≤ 11; 72.7% with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 67.6% with Hb ≤ 9 g/dl; microcytic anaemia in 13.4% with Hb ≤ 11 g/dl; 20.8% with Hb ≤ 10 g/dl; and 24.9% where Hb ≤ 9 g/dl. 82.7% of people with microcytic and 58.8% with normocytic anaemia (Hb ≤ 11 g/dl) had a low ferritin (< 100 ug/mL). Hypertension (67.2% vs. 54%) and diabetes (30.7% vs. 15.4%) were more prevalent in CKD and anaemia; 61% had been prescribed aspirin; 73% non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); 14.1% warfarin 12.4% clopidogrel; and 53.1% aspirin and NSAID. 56.3% of people with CKD and anaemia had been prescribed oral iron. The main limitations of the study are that routine data are inevitably incomplete and definitions of anaemia have not been standardised.

Conclusions

Medication review is needed in people with CKD and anaemia prior to considering erythropoietin or parenteral iron. Iron stores may be depleted in over > 60% of people with normocytic anaemia. Prescribing oral iron has not corrected anaemia.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

Comparison of FDA information for Epogen and KDOQI Guidelines — maintenance hemoglobin targets advises to individually titrate to achieve and maintain the lowest Hb level sufficient to avoid the need for RBC transfusion and not to exceed 12 g/dl; KDOQI specifies that the selected Hb target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL and notes potential harms at Hb targets > 13 g/dL.
