## Question

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, with a focus on explicit self-verification and a clear plan of care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and how severity, subtype, and SLE status guide therapy. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of photoprotection and lifestyle. Next, I will consider localized disease and first-line topical options, followed by systemic first-line therapy for widespread or refractory disease. After that, I will examine escalation to conventional immunosuppressants and then targeted biologics, followed by specialized and refractory options. I also need to ensure pregnancy-specific considerations are addressed, define monitoring and outcomes, and finally review cosmetic management and key limitations, including the evidence gap and regulatory constraints.

> Let me first confirm the framework for assessment, because treatment selection hinges on it: I need to classify CLE subtype (ACLE, SCLE, CCLE/DLE), estimate disease extent and severity using CLASI where possible, determine whether there is isolated CLE or concurrent SLE, and document risk factors for scarring and patient priorities, since scarring prevention is a high-value patient goal in visible areas and should influence early escalation decisions [^1143Fzyb] [^113h597b] [^116uB75q].

> I need to ensure the universal foundation is laid before medications: optimized photoprotection is mandatory for all patients, with daily broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF ≥ 50–70, protective clothing/hats, and sun avoidance, alongside smoking cessation counseling, as smoking worsens outcomes and reduces remission chances. This applies regardless of subtype or SLE status [^111P6Vwa] [^112a7Tsc] [^112TdWdX] [^113dWqyA].

> For localized, mild disease, I should double-check first-line topical strategies: very potent/potent topical corticosteroids can be used short term (often ≤ 4 weeks) on non-facial sites, with a plan to taper frequency or potency to minimize atrophy. On the face, I should favor non-fluorinated agents and keep courses brief to avoid steroid-induced sequelae, aligning with BAD and ACR guidance on potency, duration, and facial precautions [^114r8m2Z] [^115qCf8s]. Calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus 0.03%–0.1% or pimecrolimus 1%) are preferred alternatives on the face or when steroid adverse effects are a concern, and they can be used for longer durations; small series also suggest benefit of a tacrolimus lotion in alcohol for scalp/scarring DLE, though I should acknowledge this is off-label and limited to case reports [^113QH2uu] [^111BH2mD] [^115szjjR] [^117J3GA5].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to widespread or moderate-to-severe disease: antimalarials are the first-line systemic therapy, with hydroxychloroquine dosed at 200–400 mg/day and not exceeding 5 mg/kg actual body weight to mitigate retinopathy risk. I should confirm ocular risk factors and schedule baseline and annual retinal screening, and consider chloroquine (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/day) as an alternative when HCQ is unavailable or not tolerated, with heightened retinal vigilance given its higher toxicity risk [^1166kMYP] [^113XdHm7] [^111mBAc7] [^1164rVY4]. I should also remember that, in mild persistent disease despite HCQ/topicals, modifying antimalarial therapy by adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine is reasonable before escalating immunosuppression, recognizing quinacrine's lack of retinopathy risk but limited availability in some regions [^113nV9KM] [^1164rVY4].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation steps for refractory disease after antimalarials and topicals: conventional immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and mycophenolate are appropriate next-line options, with EULAR 2024 and ACR 2025 supporting their use when cutaneous disease remains active. I should also confirm that MTX showed superiority to placebo for complete response in a small RCT and that MMF is commonly favored in practice when rapid steroid-sparing control is needed, while aligning choices with comorbidities and reproductive plans [^112vfbKG] [^116uB75q] [^112Sxet4] [^111otGZd].

> Let me consider targeted therapies carefully, because this is where expectations can be inflated: belimumab and anifrolumab are FDA-approved for SLE and may benefit refractory cutaneous manifestations, though high-quality head-to-head CLE-specific data are lacking. Case series and expert opinion suggest anifrolumab can improve refractory CLE via type I interferon blockade, and litifilimab (BDCA2-targeting pDCs) has shown promising CLE-specific signals in LILAC, with a dedicated phase III CLE trial underway, which could mark the first CLE-specific biologic approval if successful [^112vfbKG] [^112Vhzvh] [^114fcGiN] [^113BF4Jk].

> I should double-check the role of JAK inhibitors and other agents for highly refractory disease: JAK/STAT blockade is mechanistically attractive given interferon and cytokine signaling in CLE, and deucravacitinib and other JAK inhibitors are being studied. For truly recalcitrant disease, thalidomide or lenalidomide can be considered, with EADV and ACR noting efficacy in selected cases but emphasizing teratogenicity, neuropathy, and REMS requirements for lenalidomide, which should be reserved as a last resort after careful risk–benefit counseling [^113QxCrn] [^111pe7Eg] [^1164cre7].

> But wait, what about special situations and subtypes: I need to ensure I tailor therapy to morphology and depth. For hypertrophic/verrucous DLE, topical retinoids can be considered as second-line adjuncts, and lupus panniculitis generally requires systemic therapy because topicals do not reach the fat. For alopecia/scalp DLE, intralesional triamcinolone and topical tacrolimus in lotion form have supportive case-level evidence, and surgical excision with grafting may be a fourth-line option for localized, cosmetically unacceptable scarring after medical failure, ideally coordinated with ongoing medical therapy [^115u74zi] [^115qCf8s] [^117J3GA5] [^114jn866].

> I will now examine pregnancy-specific considerations, because safety profiles shift: methotrexate and mycophenolate are contraindicated, so azathioprine and antimalarials are preferred when systemic therapy is necessary, with hydroxychloroquine favored and chloroquine acceptable with retinal monitoring. Topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors can be used judiciously, and systemic glucocorticoids may be used short term for flares, balancing maternal–fetal risks and coordinating with obstetrics and rheumatology [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and outcomes to ensure I can quantify response: baseline and serial CLASI assessments capture activity and damage and correlate with quality-of-life improvements. CLASI50 is a commonly used threshold for clinically meaningful improvement in trials, though regulatory endpoints still hinge on stringent IGA criteria that may miss patient-meaningful partial improvements, underscoring the need for harmonized CLE-specific outcomes and ongoing work on a core outcome set to standardize trials and practice [^114n5pF7] [^111N3AV4] [^1111frmA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cosmetic repair: once inflammation is controlled, I should address damage cautiously. Laser and other cosmetic procedures are generally avoided on active lesions due to koebnerization and photodamage risk, but for inactive DLE with telangiectasia or scarring, pulsed dye laser or carefully selected procedures may be offered by experienced dermatologists. For disfiguring scarring alopecia or atrophy, options include hair transplantation, fillers, fat grafting, or camouflage, acknowledging limited evidence and the need to reactivate medical control peri-procedurally [^115J8hKv] [^111G1UuS] [^111nMrWZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure we confront the evidence gaps and access issues: there are no FDA-approved therapies for isolated CLE, and many effective agents are used off-label with insurance barriers. CLASI is widely adopted academically but not yet a regulatory endpoint, and SLE-focused trials often exclude CLE-only patients, delaying targeted approvals. Until dedicated CLE trials with standardized outcomes mature, care remains guideline- and expert-opinion driven, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and close follow-up [^113Yve7W] [^114n5pF7] [^1111frmA].

Treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) centers on **photoprotection and antimalarials** [^1162Xdu1] as first-line therapy [^113nV9KM], with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors for localized disease [^114uRuYj] [^113QH2uu]. For refractory or widespread disease, add **methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or systemic corticosteroids** [^112vfbKG]; consider belimumab or anifrolumab in refractory SLE-associated CLE [^116uB75q]. Thalidomide or lenalidomide are options for severe, refractory cases, with strict monitoring [^111pe7Eg] [^1164cre7]. Avoid UV phototherapy; use pulsed dye laser only for inactive lesions [^117DfC1T] [^111G1UuS]. Management should be individualized, with regular monitoring for adverse effects and disease progression [^116uB75q].

---

## General measures and lifestyle modifications

- **Photoprotection**: Essential for all patients; use broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF ≥ 50), protective clothing, and avoid sun exposure [^111QA31y] [^111P6Vwa].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended; smoking worsens CLE and reduces treatment response [^112TdWdX].
- **Patient education**: Teach self-examination, trigger avoidance, and adherence [^114hcSAJ].

---

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are **first-line for localized CLE**, with corticosteroids favored initially and calcineurin inhibitors as alternatives, especially on the face.

| **Topical agent** | **Indication** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids (superpotent) | Localized CLE (excluding face) | First-line; up to 4 weeks, then taper [^114r8m2Z] |
| Calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) | Localized CLE, especially face | First-line; up to 12 weeks, then maintenance [^113QH2uu] [^111BH2mD] |
| Topical retinoids (tazarotene) | Hyperkeratotic or verrucous lesions | Second-line; limited evidence [^116otTfW] [^115u74zi] |

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapy is indicated for **widespread, refractory, or scarring CLE**.

- **Antimalarials**: Hydroxychloroquine (200–400 mg/day) is first-line; monitor retinopathy [^1166kMYP] [^1143FXaB].
- **Methotrexate**: 15–25 mg/week; effective for refractory CLE.
- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: 1–3 g/day; useful for refractory or scarring disease.
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Short courses for flares; long-term use avoided due to toxicity [^113nV9KM].

---

## Biologic and targeted therapies

Biologics are **considered for refractory CLE**, particularly with SLE.

- **Belimumab**: Anti-BAFF; consider in refractory SLE-associated CLE [^112vfbKG] [^116uB75q].
- **Anifrolumab**: Anti-IFNAR; promising for refractory CLE, especially with high IFN signature [^112Vhzvh] [^112pTKEa].
- **Lenalidomide**: Effective for refractory CLE; monitor for teratogenicity and thrombosis [^1164cre7] [^116m3ZA4].

---

## Physical and procedural therapies

- **Phototherapy**: Generally contraindicated due to photosensitivity; avoid UV exposure [^117DfC1T].
- **Pulsed dye laser**: Consider for inactive telangiectatic lesions; avoid active disease [^111G1UuS] [^115J8hKv].
- **Surgical excision**: For refractory localized lesions; combine with medical therapy [^114jn866].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** is essential to assess efficacy and adverse effects:

- **Clinical assessment**: Use CLASI to track activity and damage [^114hcSAJ] [^1157oSo8].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, renal function, and drug-specific tests (e.g. retinopathy screening for antimalarials) [^1164rVY4].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Track quality of life and symptom burden [^111N3AV4].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **JAK inhibitors**: Potential for refractory CLE; trials ongoing [^113QxCrn].
- **Plasmacytoid dendritic cell inhibitors**: Litifilimab shows promise in phase II trials [^114fcGiN].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring therapy to molecular phenotypes and biomarkers [^111a9rCq].

---

Treatment of CLE requires a **stepwise approach**, starting with photoprotection and antimalarials, escalating to systemic agents for refractory disease, and considering biologics or procedural options when indicated. Regular monitoring and individualized care are essential for optimal outcomes [^1162Xdu1].

The time to improvement or resolution of disease activity for a particular manifestation often depends on disease phenotype. The length of trials may be too short to observe meaningful effects, and researchers may need more than 1 year for given endpoints (eg, a significant reduction in proteinuria for patients with lupus nephritis, especially because the speed of recovery from proteinuria is slow). However, the length of trials for patients with dermal or musculoskeletal manifestations can be shortened, especially if GCS are omitted or tapered and stopped very early. Trials involving patients with mild skin/musculoskeletal manifestations can also be shortened both by omitting the use of GCS and using partial recovery as an endpoint instead of complete recovery.

Treatment and Future Directions

Based on the aforementioned pathophysiology of CLE, treatment mainly relies on the avoidance of typical triggers and dampening of the effects of key immunologic reactions. We briefly recapitulate commonly used substances and reflect on developments that are more recent.

Conventional Treatments

A variety of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs are in use for CLE (see Table 2 for an overview). There is a striking lack of licensed drugs both in Europe and the United States (US). Being a chronic-relapsing inflammatory skin disease, long-term remissions are rare in CLE and many patients require continued treatment. In a longitudinal cohort study, factors associated with a lower chance of long-term remission were smoking and discoid CLE.

Topical Treatment

Optimal broad-spectrum sunscreen is mandatory for all patients. Topical corticosteroids (TCS), especially more potent agents such as fluocinonide, are the first-line options for circumscribed CLE. Intralesional application with triamcinolone suspension may also be suitable in specific localizations such as the scalp. However, use is limited by typical adverse effects (skin atrophy) and lack of efficiency in widespread disease. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI; pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) may be used (off-label) for sustaining remissions, especially in facial lesions, but they often fail to control flares of the disease. The response varies among clinical subtypes. Some authors argue for off-label use of topical retinoids (tazarotene, tretinoin) in hypertrophic lesions. Topical treatment is also a mainstay as adjunct to systemic treatments.

Discussion

This report demonstrates strong consensus among an international cohort of CLE experts endorsing the use of the working COS proposed by Guo et al for the much-needed standardisation of outcome measures used in CLE research. This effort is part of a wider effort by the lupus research community to develop organ-specific endpoints to combat the regulatory and trial design challenges of demonstrating treatment efficacy and safety in a complex, heterogeneous disease with highly variable manifestations across organ systems.

CLE is a lupus manifestation for which an organ-specific approach to measuring treatment success is particularly needed. CLE often occurs without features of SLE and extrapolating CLE treatment effects from SLE clinical trials that fail to include CLE-specific measurement can be problematic. For example, measures such as the SLE Disease Activity Index only capture presence or absence of inflammatory rash, thus missing the granular detail required to detect meaningful therapeutic effects on skin disease.

The working COS proposed by Guo et al and endorsed by experts during the Fifth ICCLE specifically serves as a direct response to the pressing need for more precise evaluation of CLE outcomes. It accomplishes this by standardising the assessment of multiple relevant domains of disease, including skin-specific disease activity and damage, investigator global assessment of disease activity, CLE symptoms, health-related quality of life and patient global assessment of disease activity. Adopting the proposed working COS should minimise heterogeneity in CLE outcome reporting in clinical trials which has historically hindered regulatory approval in CLE.

While consensus about measuring outcomes in CLE has been achieved, there is still disagreement regarding preferred CLASI endpoint as a per cent change from baseline. Multiple large clinical trials have used CLASI50 as a cut-off representing clinically meaningful improvement in patients with at least moderate skin involvement at baseline, and there is evidence that a 6-point or a 50% reduction in CLASI score reflects meaningful improvement in patients' quality of life. This may explain why CLASI50 was preferred by more experts than more stringent endpoints, CLASI70 and CLASI90. Future studies may seek to clarify why some experts prefer more stringent CLASI endpoints.

This report establishes evidence of expert support for the working COS, which serves as timely, practical guidance for CLE researchers and regulators. A noted limitation of these findings is the lack of representation from patients, industry and other CLE stakeholders. Next steps include the development of a formal CLE COS following COMET Initiative methodology, which involves a wider range of stakeholders. The working COS may serve as a much-needed stopgap while more rigorous COS research is underway, including in the context of an ongoing IDEOM Initiative.

### Response criteria for cutaneous SLE in clinical trials [^112M4uCV]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex phenotype characterized by a wide variety of clinical manifestations but the skin is involved in 70–80% of patients. Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions, like other organ manifestations of SLE wax and wane with other manifestations of active disease and quantifying it is a useful a "signal" to screen new therapies in SLE and pre- and post-treatment biopsies can be additionally informative. The ACR has recommended a priori response criteria for SLE Activity Measures (2) and that these be used along with organ specific response criteria in clinical trials. We review the literature on evaluation of skin manifestations in lupus erythematosus (LE) and propose the parameters of evaluating responsiveness and criteria for minimal clinically important changes in skin manifestations. The Committee presents two options for grading skin manifestations. These recommendations add to the tools of SLE trials.

### Treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus: current approaches and future strategies [^113Yve7W]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease. No specific Federal Drug Administration-approved therapies for CLE-alone are available, and resistance to conventional treatments is common. This review will summarize current treatment approaches and pending treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

Research into the pathogenesis of CLE is accelerating. A skewed type I interferon production and response contribute to CLE lesions. The pathophysiology of lesions may be similar among the lesional subtypes, and patients with a more TLR9-driven disease mechanism may have more benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Case reports continue to support the use of dapsone for CLE, especially bullous lupus erythematosus. Rituximab and Belimumab have efficacy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and severe active CLE. The significant role for type I interferons in CLE and encouraging clinical data suggest anifrolumab as a very promising agent for CLE. Dapirolizumab, BIIB059, Ustekinumab and Janus kinase inhibitors also have supportive early data as promising new strategies for CLE treatment.

Summary

Continued research to understand the mechanisms driving CLE will facilitate the development and approval of new targets. The pipeline for new treatments is rich.

### Monoclonal antibodies for the management of cutaneous lupus erythematosus: an update on the current treatment landscape [^113BF4Jk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a complex autoimmune disease often characterized by a multitude of skin findings. CLE is generally classified into three main categories: acute CLE, subacute CLE and chronic CLE. The current therapeutic guidelines for CLE include counselling patients on general measures and medication regimens. Treatment options include optimized photoprotection, avoidance of environmental triggers, corticosteroids, topical and systemic immunomodulators, and antimalarials. To date, no biologic medications (i.e. monoclonal antibodies, mAbs) are approved for CLE. The first mAb for the treatment of both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and active lupus nephritis was belimumab, and was approved for these diseases in 2011 and 2020, respectively. Belimumab is a specific inhibitor of B-lymphocyte stimulator. Anifrolumab, a type I interferon receptor antagonist, was approved in 2021 for SLE. Other mAbs with different targets, including a novel biologic that inhibits blood dendritic cell antigen 2, are currently under investigation for CLE. This review will describe the general treatment landscape for CLE. Selected studies related to these various mAbs will be discussed, as well as their safety profiles and efficacies demonstrated in clinical trials. Biologic medications can potentially augment the number of treatment options for patients living with CLE.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a potentially disfiguring skin disease that substantially impacts quality of life (QoL).CLE can occur independently or as a manifestation of SLE. While some treatments are effective for CLE, many patients remain refractory or cannot tolerate current therapies, thus there is a need for new, safe and effective treatments. Unfortunately, no medications have been approved for CLE in over 50 years. A major driver of this has been the lack of validated CLE outcome measures and a focus on SLE for new drug development. The lupus research communities have worked for years to reach a consensus on how to measure lupus disease severity outcomes, and a valid, reliable and clinically meaningful disease severity measure for CLE trials now exists — the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), which has been implemented in most recent lupus trials.

However, clinical and outcomes research in CLE remains challenging. First, other measures of CLE disease severity have been used in CLE trials, leading to significant heterogeneity in outcome reporting. Furthermore, other aspects of CLE beyond clinician-reported disease severity may be important to investigators and patients, which have also been variably included in trials, further obfuscating interpretation of findings and comparisons of efficacy across CLE studies. More broadly, clinical trial design and regulatory approval of new therapeutics is difficult without clear guidelines regarding which outcomes are important and appropriate to measure. This has already held up and is actively holding up the development of products. Consequently, there is a need for consensus regarding the relevant outcomes and corresponding instruments to implement in CLE clinical research. These same issues have been raised and addressed in other disease states through the development of core outcome sets (COS), which consist of a minimum set of outcomes to be measured and reported in all clinical trials for a given disease. They encompass both the outcomes (core domain set) and instruments to measure those outcomes or domains.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: an update on pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114hcSAJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes a broad range of dermatologic manifestations, which may or may not be associated with systemic disease. Recent studies in this area continue to shape our understanding of this disease and treatment options. Epidemiologic studies have found an incidence of CLE of 4.30 per 100,000, which approaches similar analysis for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although there have been extensive efforts to define SLE, the classification of CLE and its subgroups remains a challenge. Currently, diagnosis relies on clinical and laboratory findings as well as skin histology. The Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index™ (CLASI™) is a validated measure of disease activity and damage. CLE pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes genetic contributions as well as effects of ultraviolet (UV) light. Immune dysregulation and aberrant cell signaling pathways through cytokine cascades are also implicated. Patient education and avoidance of triggers are key to disease prevention. Antimalarials and topical steroids continue to be the standard of care; however, immunosuppressants, thalidomide analogs and monoclonal antibodies are possible systemic therapies for the treatment of recalcitrant disease.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: a review [^114QrSL7]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

This article will review and update information about the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Lupus erythematosus (LE) can present as a skin eruption, with or without systemic disease. Cutaneous LE is subdivided into chronic cutaneous LE, subacute cutaneous LE and acute LE. The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is 17–48/100,000 population worldwide. Skin disease is one of the most frequent clinical complaints of patients suffering from SLE. It has been found to occur in up to 70% of patients during the course of the disease. The most frequent mucocutaneous manifestations of SLE are malar rash (40%), alopecia (24%), and oral ulcers (19%). It has been suggested that risk factors that are more likely to signal transition of cutaneous into systemic LE are high ANA titers (> 1:320) and the presence of arthralgias. CLE patients who exhibit these symptoms should be monitored closely, since they may be at increased risk to develop SLE.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^113nV9KM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus cutaneous/mucocutaneous disease — Good practice statements specify that people with SLE should be advised on the use of sunscreen and other sun-protection measures to reduce risk of rash and potential disease flare, and that initial therapy for cutaneous lupus rash — in addition to HCQ — should be topical, including glucocorticoid and/or calcineurin inhibitors; initial therapy may also include a course of intralesional glucocorticoid with dermatology and/or a brief, limited course of oral glucocorticoid. For mild, ongoing skin-predominant lupus despite treatment with HCQ and/or topical therapies, we conditionally recommend modifying antimalarial therapy (adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine) over adding an immunosuppressive agent (Conditional; Very low; P50.1, P50.2, P51.1, P51.2).

### Interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus: summary of a cochrane review [^113oERsm]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the efficacy of interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs)?

Bottom Line

Available RCT evidence on the management of cutaneous disease in SLE is sparse and of limited quality. Among traditional options, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine have the strongest evidence compared with placebo in the end points of complete clinical response and number of clinical flares, respectively, while chloroquine appears noninferior to methotrexate in achieving complete clinical response.

### An update on clinical trials for cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^113xUCGL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) comprises dermatologic manifestations that may occur independently or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite advancements in refining CLE classification, establishing precise subtype criteria remains challenging due to overlapping presentations and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Current treatments encompass preventive measures, topical therapies, and systemic approaches. Hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids are the sole US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for CLE, with numerous off-label treatments available. However, these treatments are often not covered by insurance, imposing a significant financial burden on patients. The exclusion of most CLE patients, particularly those without concurrent SLE, from trials designed for SLE has resulted in a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. To develop effective CLE treatments, validated outcome measures for tracking patient responsiveness are essential. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index is widely utilized for its reliability, validity, and ability to differentiate between skin activity and damage. In contrast, the FDA mandates the use of the Investigator's Global Assessment, a five-point Likert scale related to lesion characteristics, for skin-related therapeutic trials. It requires the disease to resolve or almost completely resolve to demonstrate improvement, which can be difficult when there is residual erythema or incomplete clearance that is meaningfully improved from a patient perspective. Various classes of skin lupus medications target diverse pathways, allowing tailored treatment based on the patient's lupus inflammatory profile, resulting in improved outcomes. Promising targeted therapeutic drugs include anifrolumab (anti-type 1 interferon), deucravacitinib (allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor), litifilimab (plasmacytoid dendritic cell-directed therapy), iberdomide (cereblon-targeting ligand), and belimumab (B-cell directed therapy). Despite the significant impact of CLE on quality of life, therapeutic options remain inadequate. While promising treatments for cutaneous lupus are emerging, it is crucial to underscore the urgency for skin-focused treatment outcomes and the implementation of validated measures to assess therapeutic effectiveness in clinical trials.

Abstract

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) comprises dermatologic manifestations that may occur independently or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite advancements in refining CLE classification, establishing precise subtype criteria remains challenging due to overlapping presentations and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Current treatments encompass preventive measures, topical therapies, and systemic approaches. Hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids are the sole US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved medications for CLE, with numerous off‐label treatments available. However, these treatments are often not covered by insurance, imposing a significant financial burden on patients. The exclusion of most CLE patients, particularly those without concurrent SLE, from trials designed for SLE has resulted in a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. To develop effective CLE treatments, validated outcome measures for tracking patient responsiveness are essential. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index is widely utilized for its reliability, validity, and ability to differentiate between skin activity and damage. In contrast, the FDA mandates the use of the Investigator's Global Assessment, a five‐point Likert scale related to lesion characteristics, for skin‐related therapeutic trials. It requires the disease to resolve or almost completely resolve to demonstrate improvement, which can be difficult when there is residual erythema or incomplete clearance that is meaningfully improved from a patient perspective. Various classes of skin lupus medications target diverse pathways, allowing tailored treatment based on the patient's lupus inflammatory profile, resulting in improved outcomes. Promising targeted therapeutic drugs include anifrolumab (anti‐type 1 interferon), deucravacitinib (allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor), litifilimab (plasmacytoid dendritic cell‐directed therapy), iberdomide (cereblon‐targeting ligand), and belimumab (B‐cell directed therapy). Despite the significant impact of CLE on quality of life, therapeutic options remain inadequate. While promising treatments for cutaneous lupus are emerging, it is crucial to underscore the urgency for skin‐focused treatment outcomes and the implementation of validated measures to assess therapeutic effectiveness in clinical trials.

### Anifrolumab for treatment of refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112Vhzvh]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a spectrum of skin changes related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a family of autoimmunity manifesting characteristic multisystem inflammation and damage. Treatment of CLE continues to evolve, especially for patients with moderate to severe disease. Type 1 interferon (IFN-1) plays a significant role in CLE pathogenesis. Anifrolumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody, selectively binds and inhibits the IFN-α receptor 1. Evidence from multiple Phase II and III randomized trials resulted in approval for anifrolumab for treatment of moderate to severe SLE. We present a case series of three patients with refractory CLE significantly improved with anifrolumab. The patients were recruited via clinic interaction and treated with anifrolumab from January 2021 to April 2022. Each patient received at least 12weeks of therapy. Treatment and follow-up is ongoing. Patients were eligible for the study if they were a patient of the UNC Hospital System with resistant CLE, defined as having received inadequate disease control with standard therapies, including antimalarials, disease-modifying agents and biologics. Outcome measures were improvement in patient-reported symptoms and physician observation of erythema and pigmentary changes. All cases demonstrated significant improvement in disease appearance, cutaneous involvement, and symptomology after treatment with 2months of anifrolumab infusions. Anifrolumab shows great potential for improving CLE in patients who have failed standard of care and multiple treatment options, including those that have failed belimumab or those who smoke. This report highlights the value of anifrolumab in managing patients with refractory CLE.

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^114oeUK7]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Final remarks

Antimalarials have played a central role in the treatment of CLE over the past several decades. Quinacrine, in particular, has been an important adjuvant therapy when a single antimalarial agent is unable to control CLE. Unfortunately, this medication has become increasingly scarce and is currently unavailable in the USA. While there are other local and systemic medications available from several different medication classes, the quality of evidence for these medications can vary, making it difficult for the provider to choose an optimal treatment plan for patients with CLE. In addition, there are new targeted therapies being studied in clinical trials that may one day become available as effective treatment options for CLE. Ultimately, it would greatly benefit patients with CLE to have access to quinacrine as a potential treatment again. However, until this option is available, alternative therapies should be used to maintain control of the disease and prevent any flares or gaps in treatment.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and management [^115apVZv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) includes a variety of lupus erythematosus (LE)-specific skin lesions that are subdivided into three categories - chronic CLE (CCLE), subacute CLE (SCLE) and acute CLE (ACLE) - based on clinical morphology, average duration of skin lesions and routine histopathologic examination. This paper describes our personal experience in the management of CLE over the last 30 years, with details on preferential therapeutic options related to clinical, histologic and immunopathologic aspects of each clinical subset of the disease. Effective sunscreening and sun protection are considered the first rule in the management of CLE because of the high degree of photosensitivity of the disease. Antimalarial agents are crucial in the treatment of CLE and are the first-line systemic agents, particularly in discoid LE (DLE) and SCLE. Dapsone is the drug of choice for bullous systemic LE (BSLE) as well as for LE in small dermal vessels (e.g. leukocytoclastic vasculitis). Retinoids, known as second-line drugs for systemic therapy, are sometimes used to treat chronic forms of CLE and are particularly successful in treating hypertrophic LE. Systemic immunosuppressive agents are required to manage the underlying systemic LE disease activity in patients with ACLE. These drugs, especially azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine, together with corticosteroids, constitute third-line systemic therapy of CLE. In our experience, oral prednisone or parenteral 'pulsed' methylprednisolone are useful in exacerbations of disease activity. Thalidomide provides one of the most useful therapeutic alternatives for chronic refractory DLE, although its distribution is limited to a few countries because of the risk of teratogenicity and polyneuropathy. However, medical treatment with local corticosteroids remains the mainstay of CLE treatment, especially for DLE. Patient education regarding the disease is also important in the management of CLE, because it helps relieve undue anxiety and to recruit the patient as an active participant in the treatment regimen.

### Expert perspective: an evidence-based approach to refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^113MPCKG]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can present with a variety of skin manifestations and have a dramatic effect on a patient's quality of life. Effective treatment options for this disease are limited, and the efficacy of these treatments is often supported by low levels of evidence. This makes the treatment of refractory disease especially challenging, as it is difficult to achieve a consensus on the appropriate progression of treatment beyond first- and second-line treatment options. The treatment of refractory CLE often involves some degree of immunosuppression, which carries some risk for patients and requires a thoughtful approach to the selection of medications. Some treatments that have proven to be effective in systemic disease may not be as effective in cutaneous disease, making it difficult to extrapolate from the available evidence on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ultimately, the increased use of objective skin measurements in SLE clinical trials is necessary to understand drug efficacy in CLE and develop new treatments for this challenging disease. Here, we provide clinical examples of the challenges involved in treating refractory CLE, examine the evidence currently available for treatment options, and provide an algorithmic approach to the treatment of refractory disease based on this evidence. Novel therapies under development for CLE are also discussed, as they may soon be part of the accepted treatment regimen for refractory CLE.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a heterogeneous autoimmune condition that can significantly impact quality of life. Treatment is focused on reducing clinical inflammation and preventing scarring. The choice of treatment should be guided based on the severity of disease. Mild or localized disease can be treated with sun protection and topical agents. Antimalarials are the initial treatment of choice if systemic therapy is required. Patients with severe or unresponsive disease can also be treated with a number of other immunomodulating or immunosuppressive agents. Clinicians should be aware of their potential adverse effects and appropriate dosing.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: updates on pathogenesis and associations with systemic lupus [^114mNoxB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a common manifestation among systemic lupus patients. There are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved therapies for CLE, and these lesions are frequently disfiguring and refractory to treatment. The present review will cover the recent inroads made into understanding the mechanisms behind CLE lesions and discuss promising therapeutic developments.

Recent Findings

The definition of cutaneous lupus is being refined to facilitate diagnostic and research protocols. Research into the pathogenesis of CLE is accelerating, and discoveries are now identifying genetic and epigenetic changes which may predispose to particular disease manifestations. Furthermore, unique features of disease subtypes are being defined. Murine work supports a connection between cutaneous inflammation and systemic lupus disease activity. Importantly, human trials of type I interferon blockade hold promise for improving our treatment armamentarium for refractory CLE lesions.

Summary

Continued research to understand the mechanisms driving CLE will provide new methods for prevention and treatment of cutaneous lesions. These improvements may also have important effects on systemic disease activity, and thus, efforts to understand this link should be supported.

### Expert consensus achieved on a working core outcome set for cutaneous lupus erythematosus research in survey following the 5th international conference on cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ICCLE) [^1178D1fG]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a potentially disfiguring and debilitating manifestation of lupus erythematosus, a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with a broad spectrum of organ system involvement and clinical presentations. Despite CLE's demonstrated impact on patients' quality of life, no drugs for treatment of CLE have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. One proposed driver of this gap is a focus on SLE rather than its cutaneous counterpart in therapeutic development programmes. Another challenge is the lack of regulatory acceptance of and clarity on existing endpoints, which has inhibited some expansion into this area of the field.

To address an urgent unmet need for guidance around a standardised outcome measurement set in CLE research, a steering committee comprised of dermatologists and rheumatologists proposed a working core outcome set (COS) for randomised controlled trials and longitudinal observational studies. A COS comprises outcomes that must be assessed and documented in every clinical trial related to a specific medical condition. This ensures uniformity in assessing and reporting outcomes across different clinical studies.

Following the Outcome Measures In Rheumatology (OMERACT) Filter 2.1 Onion framework, the steering committee first classified candidate outcomes as 'core domains' (ie, relevant domains and subdomains that should be measured in every study for a given disease), 'important but optional' domains and 'research agenda' domains. Subsequently, they recommended candidate outcome measures for each core domain based on review of the literature (table 1). The proposed COS (ie, core domain set and corresponding outcome measurement set) represents a 'working' set to bridge an urgent need while allowing more rigorous methodological approaches to continue in parallel via COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative and OMERACT standards, with ongoing work by groups such as the International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) Initiative. This study aimed to assess the endorsement of the working COS by an international sample of CLE leaders and experts

The aim of this prospective, cross-sectional, multicentre study performed by the European Society of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (EUSCLE) was to investigate different therapeutic strategies and their efficacies in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) throughout Europe. Using the EUSCLE Core Set Questionnaire, topical and systemic treatment options were analysed in a total of 1002 patients (768 females and 234 males) with different CLE subtypes. The data were correlated with the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) and the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus. Sunscreens were applied by 84.0% of the study cohort and showed a high efficacy in preventing skin lesions in all disease subtypes, correlating with a lower CLASI activity score. Topical steroids were used in 81.5% of the patients, with an efficacy of 88.4%, whereas calcineurin inhibitors were applied in 16.4% of the study population and showed an efficacy of 61.7%. Systemic agents including antimalarials and several immunomodulating/-suppressive drugs, such as systemic steroids and methotrexate, were applied in 84.4% of the 1002 patients. The CLASI activity and damage score was higher in treated CLE patients compared to untreated patients, regardless of therapy with topical or systemic agents. In summary, preventive and therapeutic strategies of 1002 patients with different subtypes of CLE were analysed in this prospective, multicentre, Europe-wide study. Sunscreens were confirmed to be successful as preventive agents, and topical steroids showed a high efficacy, whereas antimalarials were used as first-line systemic treatment.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune-mediated skin disease under the family of lupus erythematosus. Systemic immunosuppressants and topical treatments have been used to manage CLE; however, these treatments tend to be moderately efficacious and leave patients with unmet therapeutic needs. There is a need for medications that target pruritus, scarring, dyspigmentation, and other symptoms of chronic CLE that contribute to decreased quality of life. The introduction of new biologics and other systemic medications has expanded dermatologists' and rheumatologists' ability to manage CLE. This article discusses new pharmaceuticals and guidelines providing an updated overview of the clinical management of CLE.

The cutaneous manifestations of lupus, especially chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, are a source of significant morbidity and can negatively impact patient quality of life. While the active inflammatory component of the disease may be adequately treated, patients are frequently left with residual skin damage and disfiguring aesthetic deficits. Dermatologists lack guidelines regarding the use and safety of various reconstructive and cosmetic interventions in this patient population. Laser treatments are largely avoided in the lupus population because of the possible photodamaging effects of ultraviolet and visible light. Similarly, given the autoimmune nature of this disease, some physicians avoid injectable treatment and grafts because of the concern for disease reactivation via antigenic stimulation. In the second article in this continuing medical education series we compile available data on this topic with the goal of providing evidence-based guidance on the cosmetic treatment of patients with lupus erythematosus with a focus on chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

### An update on clinical trials for cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^112pTKEa]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the approval of anifrolumab in SLE, various case studies and case series have supported its effectiveness for refractory CLE and mucocutaneous manifestations in SLE. However, additional studies are necessary to optimize dosing, characterize response rates, and ascertain long‐term effects. Although these studies demonstrate progress in treating CLE in SLE patients, it remains necessary to show trial data that establishes efficacy in patients with CLE alone. Furthermore, patients suffering from CLE in the absence of SLE may encounter barriers in accessing these novel therapies due to strict insurance policies that require evidence of systemic involvement for coverage approval. Ultimately, while the success of anifrolumab paved the way for development of new treatments targeting the IFN‐I pathway, further investigation is needed to include CLE patients. Planning for such a study is now underway.

In the first part of the review, topical agents and first-line systemic treatment options for cutaneous lupus erythematosus were discussed whereas in the second part, recent information on efficacy, dosage, and side effects for further systemic treatment options are described in detail. In contrast to other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, methotrexate has recently received more attention in the treatment of the disease. Further second-line treatment includes retinoids, dapsone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Because of severe side effects or high costs, other agents, such as thalidomide or high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins, are reserved for severe recalcitrant CLE. Biologics, ie, rituximab, have been used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus; however, in CLE, most biologics have only been applied in single cases. In addition to successful treatment, induction of CLE subtypes by biologics has been reported. In conclusion, many treatment options exist for CLE, but not many are supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Cutaneous lupus — topical therapy selection and dermatology evaluation — lists options in "Table 6. Suggested topical therapies for cutaneous lupus", noting that "Body location guides the choice of topical agents" and "Solutions are favored for scalp; creams or ointments for elsewhere (patient preference)". The guideline advises "Generally, avoid use of fluorinated glucocorticoids on the face except for a few days if severe flare", and that "More potent topicals are generally used for up to 2 weeks duration (not on the face however) and then switched to less potent topical agents". For nonsteroidal options, the table specifies calcineurin inhibitors with "No limit to duration of use". Evaluation guidance states "Dermatology evaluation in people with significant skin disease is encouraged; lesional skin biopsy is suggested when needed to guide therapy or to rule out other diagnoses and should ideally be interpreted by a dermatopathologist". Scope notes include "There is no significant difference in which topical options should be used for different cutaneous lupus subtypes, except for lupus panniculitis (topical glucocorticoids will not reach the fat, the area of inflammation in panniculitis)", and patient priorities highlight "Prevention of skin scarring was a high priority for the Patient Panel, especially in visible areas such as the face".

### Treatment of alopecia in chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus… [^117J3GA5]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Three patients with treatment-refractory, biopsy-proved DLE were prescribed a novel, off-label preparation of tacrolimus lotion, 0. 3%, in an alcohol base as an adjunct to oral antimalarial therapy. All 3 patients demonstrated improvement in lesion severity and hair regrowth with the use of this regimen after 3 months and continued improvement thereafter. We report a retrospective analysis of these 3 cases. Although DLE is often managed successfully by topical or intralesional corticosteroids and/or oral antimalarials, some cases are refractory to these first-line therapies. Alternative therapies, such as methotrexate sodium, oral corticosteroids, thalidomide, and dapsone, may also be ineffective and/or limited by their risks and adverse effects. Among the topical therapies, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are most commonly used.

Topical and intralesional corticosteroids, however, have well-known adverse effects, including atrophy, telangiectasia, and rosacealike dermatitis. Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, calcineurin inhibitors are often used to treat cutaneous lupus erythematosus variants. 1–10 Commercially available preparations include pimecrolimus cream, 1%, and tacrolimus ointment, 0. 03% or
0. 1%. No lotions are commercially available for topical use. Targeting the calcineurin signaling pathways ultimately limits lymphocyte proliferation, which is a predominant feature of the scarring alopecia in DLE. In general, cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions demonstrate a state of proinflammation, with increased expression of cytokines such as IL-2, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor noted in biopsy samples.

11 In contrast to corticosteroids — which nonselectively affect epidermal and dermal cells — topical tacrolimus spares keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, precluding the more robust adverse effects seen with corticosteroids.
12. The successful regrowth of hair among our 3 patients may be owing to enhanced delivery of tacrolimus to the site of inflammation and a subsequent reduction in disease activity mitigated by calcineurin inhibition. Thus, tacrolimus may prevent the lesions from entering a final scarred stage, thereby allowing an opportunity for the hair to regrow.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease with a wide spectrum of clinical and immunopathological features. Cutaneous and articular manifestations are the most common signs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We here review the pathogenesis and the new classification of cutaneous lupus erythemathosus with a discussion of the significance of the various cutaneous signs. The lesions are classified according to the level of the cellular infiltrate and tissue damage in the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutis. Furthermore, cutaneous lesions pointing to the presence of a thrombotic vasculopathy and those due to a distinct inflammatory, neutrophilic-mediated reaction pattern are highlighted. Particular attention will be given in describing the histology of skin manifestation. Treatment options for cutaneous lupus erythemathosus have increased with the introduction of new biological therapies. However, the majority of the patients still benefit from antimalarials, which remain the cornerstone of treatment. The evaluation and management of cutaneous lupus erythemathosus patients depend on the clinical findings and associated symptoms.

Conclusion

Skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can add valuable data to help with accurate diagnosis in some patients with SLE who develop rashes. An important next step for individual clinicians is to determine what specific clinical scenarios would warrant a biopsy; we suggest biopsies for cases in which the clinical appearance of a rash is ambiguous. It is worth performing a biopsy of clinically ambiguous rashes in patients with SLE as a significant percentage may show discordant results between clinical and histopathological diagnosis, which may impact subsequent treatment choices. This data further support the importance of the involvement of dermatologists in the care of patients with SLE with cutaneous abnormalities.

### Treatments for disease damage in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: a narrative review [^111nMrWZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune photosensitive disorder that affects the skin. CLE lesions can have signs of skin damage including dyspigmentation, scarring, atrophy and/or alopecia. Disease damage secondary to CLE can be cosmetically disfiguring and causes patients significant distress. While many current treatments for CLE focus primarily on reducing inflammation, there are few options for managing disease damage. Providers currently lack strong guidance on managing CLE damage due to the paucity of literature on this topic. Because of this knowledge gap, we aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about the pathogenesis and management of signs of disease damage in CLE. In this narrative review, Pubmed, Ovid Medline, and Google scholar were searched for relevant articles assessing pathogenesis and treatment of disease damage. Therapeutic options for CLE damage, including hyperpigmentation (laser and camouflage), hypopigmentation (melanocyte grafting and camouflage), scarring (laser, dermabrasion, and camouflage), atrophy (filler, fat transplantation, and flap procedures), and scarring alopecia (hair transplantation and camouflage) were identified. We found that investigations of therapeutics for CLE disease damage primarily consist of case reports and small case series. Reported adverse events due to treatment for CLE disease damage range from temporary erythema and discomfort to disease reactivation and pigmentary defects. There are various treatments for disease damage for each sign of disease damage. However, more robust investigations are needed to assess disease pathogenesis and improve treatments of disease damage due to CLE.

### Robust measurement of clinical improvement in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^1149ZfNd]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin disorder, which can occur in the context of SLE or independent of other organ involvement. Its clinical manifestations, severity and course are highly variable. This variability confounds the development of appropriate outcome measures that are reproducible, reflect the range of patient experience and reliably distinguish meaningful clinical improvement from fluctuation intrinsic to the natural history of the disease. As a result, studies have differed on defining clinical improvement in CLE. Outcomes have been measured using subjective assessments of improvementand different semiquantitative severity scoring systems. In the absence of clear outcome measures, assessing the effectiveness of different therapies and selecting the most appropriate treatments for individual patients has been challenging. While a variety of treatment options are available for CLE, treatment selection remains largely based on expert opinion rather than objective data.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

Question 3: What is the best first-line treatment for nodular cutaneous lupus mucinosis?
A. Sun avoidance and protection
B. Topical steroids
C. Antimalarials
D. Immunosuppressants
E. Isotretinoin

Answers:
A. Sun avoidance and protection – Incorrect. Sun avoidance and protection should be discussed with all patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus; however, these are only preventive measures.
B. Topical steroids – Incorrect. It is unlikely that topical steroids alone will treat the nodules and papules associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus; however, they can be combined with systemic therapies.
C. Antimalarials – Correct. Antimalarials are the first-line systemic therapy for the prevention and treatment of cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this patient, the papulonodular lesions cleared after 2 months on hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice a day).
D. Immunosuppressants – Incorrect. Immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, and prednisone, are effective second-line systemic therapies selected in concordance with comorbidities.
E. Isotretinoin – Incorrect. Isotretinoin is used for the treatment of acne.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: an update on pathogenesis and future therapeutic directions [^111a9rCq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary and Outlook

CLE is a complex disease with many facets, which might be reflected partly by a varying dominance of specific immune cell subsets and cytokine profiles. Still, a given clinical or histological pattern fails to reliably predict cytokine or gene expression. A better comprehension of molecular pathways and individual disease-perpetuating factors will render the way forward to personalized treatment options. The advent of targeted treatment options licensed for SLE might also pave the way to more precise therapeutic interventions in CLE. Entering an era of precision medicine in CLE will be of benefit for both patients and treating physicians, and upcoming data of active clinical trials and real-world data will help to further delineate the underlying multidimensional interrelations. A close interdisciplinary exchange with rheumatologists and nephrologists is mandatory for optimal treatment of lupus patients to define the best therapeutic strategy.

3 OUTCOME MEASURES

A critical review of the clinical trial methodologies used in CLE lupus therapeutic development reveals significant gaps, particularly in the outcome measures used to evaluate SLE and their applicability to CLE. The primary outcome measures, including the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index (BILAG), are primarily designed for systemic manifestations. BILAG captures partial change over time with some skin measures like skin eruption and alopecia, while SLEDAI documents presence or absence of organ involvement, including skin features such as new rash and mucosal ulcers. In response to these limitations, composite outcome measures such as the SLE Responder Index (SRI) and BILAG‐Based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) were developed. However, these too rely heavily on systemic disease measures, perpetuating a clear inadequacy in addressing the specific needs of CLE patients.

The minimization of skin concerns is further compounded by SLE trial entry criteria. Historically, SLE clinical trials have framed inclusion guidelines based on criteria from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC), which do not require positive serology. However, the 2019European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/ACR classification criteria necessitate a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) for diagnosis, excluding a significant portion of CLE patients, particularly the 18% with a negative ANA, who would have qualified under previous criteria. This reliance on serology, coupled with the poor standardization of ANA testing, makes entry into clinical trials problematic for many CLE patients.

This systematic exclusion is not just a matter of classification but has real‐world implications. The majority of CLE patients, who may not have concomitant SLE, are excluded from the trials designed for SLE, leading to a lack of targeted treatments for CLE. Despite the considerable impact of CLE on patients' quality of life, the therapeutic options remain inadequate. It is imperative that we establish targeted investigations to address and alleviate the unique challenges faced by CLE patients.

This article focuses on the management of discoid lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus erythematosus when the usual therapeutic arsenal such as oral antimalarial drugs and topical/oral steroids fail or provide insufficient treatment efficacy. Many of the treatments listed are the same or similar to each other because of similarities in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of cutaneous lupus. The clinical challenge is to determine the indications for topical versus systemic therapy, and to also identify the scenarios when combined therapy is necessary.

1 CLINICAL LANDSCAPE

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin disease with dermatologic manifestations that can occur with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CLE lesions typically involve sun‐exposed areas secondary to photosensitivity. Disease chronicity coupled with the potential for long‐lasting secondary sequelae can significantly impact quality of life for affected individuals. CLE patients are screened at diagnosis with clinical and laboratory tests and continue to be monitored at least annually.

The Gilliam and Sontheimer classification system for CLE was established in 1982 and describes three major subtypes as umbrella categories for more specific categorizations: acute CLE (ACLE), subacute CLE (SCLE), and chronic CLE (CCLE) which includes discoid LE (DLE). While subtypes are often distinguishable by clinical features, absolute subtype criteria can be challenging due to overlap in presentation and difficulty in distinguishing morphology. Distinguishing features, such as atrophy and scarring in DLE, may present later in the disease course and can be difficult to discern clinically.

Despite the clinical variation among different subtypes, the strategies for management often overlap. Existing treatments target disease through prevention, topical therapies, and systemic measures. Preventative strategies primarily focus on avoidance of common triggers through SPF sun protection greater than 70, smoking cessation, and minimizing exposure to photosensitizing medications. For cases with limited dermatologic involvement, topical therapies such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors directly target active lesions with minimal risk for systemic effects.

Remarkably, there have been no new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved systemic treatments for CLE in over 60 years. The only FDA‐approved medications for CLE are hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids, which were accepted under previous regulations before implementation of the current standards for clinical trials. Off‐label therapies include other antimalarials such as chloroquine and quinacrine as well as immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. Additional treatment options include dapsone, retinoids (acitretin, isotretinoin, and alitretinoin), thalidomide, and lenalidomide. Treatments approved for SLE are sometimes used for CLE treatment. Because they are considered off‐label treatments, these medications are not usually covered by insurance companies, placing a significant burden on the patient. This category includes medications such as rituximab, belimumab, and anifrolumab.

### Interventions for cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112Sxet4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Cutaneous disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common. Many interventions are used to treat SLE with varying efficacy, risks, and benefits.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Wiley Interscience Online Library, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (Virtual Health Library). We updated our search in September 2020, but these results have not yet been fully incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for cutaneous disease in SLE compared with placebo, another intervention, no treatment, or different doses of the same intervention. We did not evaluate trials of cutaneous lupus in people without a diagnosis of SLE.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete and partial clinical response. Secondary outcomes included reduction (or change) in number of clinical flares; and severe and minor adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Sixty-one RCTs, involving 11,232 participants, reported 43 different interventions. Trials predominantly included women from outpatient clinics; the mean age range of participants was 20 to 40 years. Twenty-five studies reported baseline severity, and 22 studies included participants with moderate to severe cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE); duration of CLE was not well reported. Studies were conducted mainly in multi-centre settings. Most often treatment duration was 12 months. Risk of bias was highest for the domain of reporting bias, followed by performance/detection bias. We identified too few studies for meta-analysis for most comparisons. We limited this abstract to main comparisons (all administered orally) and outcomes. We did not identify clinical trials of other commonly used treatments, such as topical corticosteroids, that reported complete or partial clinical response or numbers of clinical flares. Complete clinical response Studies comparing oral hydroxychloroquine against placebo did not report complete clinical response. Chloroquine may increase complete clinical response at 12 months' follow-up compared with placebo (absence of skin lesions) (risk ratio (RR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 2.61; 1 study, 24 participants; low-quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between methotrexate and chloroquine in complete clinical response (skin rash resolution) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 1 study, 25 participants; low-quality evidence). Methotrexate may be superior to placebo with regard to complete clinical response (absence of malar/discoid rash) at 6 months' follow-up (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.63 to 7.84; 1 study, 41 participants; low-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be little to no difference between azathioprine and ciclosporin in complete clinical response (malar rash resolution) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.52; 1 study, 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Partial clinical response Partial clinical response was reported for only one key comparison: hydroxychloroquine may increase partial clinical response at 12 months compared to placebo, but the 95% CI indicates that hydroxychloroquine may make no difference or may decrease response (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16; 20 pregnant participants, 1 trial; low-quality evidence). Clinical flares Clinical flares were reported for only two key comparisons: hydroxychloroquine is probably superior to placebo at 6 months' follow-up for reducing clinical flares (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 study, 47 participants; moderate-quality evidence). At 12 months' follow-up, there may be no difference between methotrexate and placebo, but the 95% CI indicates there may be more or fewer flares with methotrexate (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.83; 1 study, 86 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events Data for adverse events were limited and were inconsistently reported, but hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and methotrexate have well-documented adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver problems, and retinopathy for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and teratogenicity during pregnancy for methotrexate.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence supports the commonly-used treatment hydroxychloroquine, and there is also evidence supporting chloroquine and methotrexate for treating cutaneous disease in SLE. Evidence is limited due to the small number of studies reporting key outcomes. Evidence for most key outcomes was low or moderate quality, meaning findings should be interpreted with caution. Head-to-head intervention trials designed to detect differences in efficacy between treatments for specific CLE subtypes are needed. Thirteen further trials are awaiting classification and have not yet been incorporated in this review; they may alter the review conclusions.

### The role of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus: a review [^113QxCrn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), a manifestation of the chronic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (LE), showcases diverse clinical, immunologic, and histologic attributes. CLE can be further categorized into subtypes — acute (ACLE), subacute (SCLE), or chronic (CCLE) — with each class characterized by distinct features, including the degree of cutaneous involvement, lesion duration, and associated laboratory findings. While conventional treatments, including photoprotective strategies, topical corticosteroids, and antimalarial agents, have proven effective for some, recent immunomodulatory therapies offer alternative avenues. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, in particular, have gained attention due to their demonstrated efficacy in the management of various autoimmune disorders. Dysregulation of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CLE, further underscoring the promise of JAK inhibitors as an adjunctive therapy alongside systemic immunosuppression. This systematic review aims to discuss the diagnosis and categorization of CLE and its subtypes, elucidate the intricacies of intracellular signaling within the JAK/STAT pathway, and discuss the current applications of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of autoimmune disease. Supported by cases, randomized control trials, basic science articles, and other reviews in the literature, this review provides evidence for the use of the JAK/STAT pathway as a therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the role of JAK inhibitors and their therapeutic properties warrant further scrutiny through rigorous investigation and comprehensive randomized control trials to ascertain safety and efficacy.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus-from pathogenesis to targeted therapy [^114hpSs9]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a complex inflammatory skin disease that presents either in isolation or as a frequent manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CLE subtypes show clinical heterogeneity and varying associations with SLE. Histologically, CLE is characterized by interface dermatitis, a reaction pattern that involves immune-cell infiltration of the dermo-epidermal junction. In-depth characterization of both non-lesional and lesional lupus skin has reshaped our understanding of pathogenesis. Non-lesional and lesional lupus skin exhibits early and chronic upregulation of type I interferons, which drive photosensitivity, myeloid-cell recruitment and amplification of cytokine responses in both immune and non-immune cells. This detailed understanding of CLE biology has enabled the development of targeted therapies. Ongoing research to identify key pathogenic mechanisms will create opportunities for prevention of CLE and CLE-to-SLE transition.

5 CONCLUSION

The current treatment options for CLE are notably inadequate, often necessitating treatment escalation without sufficient control of disease activity. This gap in management significantly impacts quality of life for CLE patients, underscoring a critical need for more optimal treatments. Our existing therapeutic armamentarium consists primarily of broad‐spectrum immunosuppressive agents that carry a significant risk of systemic side effects. A crucial ongoing objective is establishment of clinical trials dedicated to CLE for properly tailored inclusion criteria and endpoints focused on cutaneous parameters. Differentiation of CLE from SLE will enable precise skin assessment and improve medication accessibility for patients with exclusively dermatologic disease. Despite historical challenges, recent phase II and III trials for CLE have shown encouraging results for treatments targeting the IFN, pDC, and TLR pathways.

Anifrolumab, an anti‐IFNAR1 monoclonal antibody, has shown optimistic outcomes in phase II and III SLE trials, although its efficacy in CLE necessitates further research. Initial improvements occurred as early as week 8 and were sustained through week 52. Smaller‐scale studies have implicated its utility in treatment‐resistant CLE patients, although a trial specific to CLE patients is essential for comprehensive evaluation. The ongoing phase III trial (NCT04877691) is of particular interest in the exploration of subcutaneous administration instead of monthly intravenous infusions.

Litifilimab, which blocks BDCA2 receptors on pDCs, has marked a significant milestone in CLE research in the LILAC Part B study. This study sets a precedent for future CLE research by evaluating therapeutic results separately in CLE and SLE, and by modeling skin‐specific design. This trial included two major CLE subtypes, SCLE and CCLE, utilized rigorous photovalidation for characterizing subtypes and severity, and employed the CLASI as a validated outcome measure for its primary endpoint. The ongoing phase III CLE trial (NCT05531565) is being closely monitored as a potential candidate for the first biologic approval for CLE.

Given the efficacy of litifilimab, daxdilimab, which also targets pDCs but through a different mechanism of action by binding to the ILT7 receptor, is anticipated to yield comparable positive outcomes. Daxdilimab has shown promise in early trials with a favorable safety profile and is currently in a phase II CLE trial.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus… [^113h597b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In this autoimmune disease, the body's immune system attacks healthy skin. There are 3 main types: Acute cutaneous lupus; Subacute cutaneous lupus; and Chronic cutaneous lupus. All patients with skin lupus need to be monitored for disease inside of the body, which can affect the joints, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. Acute skin lupus almost always involves more than just the skin, whereas both subacute and discoid lupus often occur only in the skin. This is important because while all patients with skin lupus need to be monitored, many patients with either subacute lupus or discoid lupus go through life without significant disease inside their bodies. Discoid lupus starts out as a red to purple scaly rash on the scalp, face, ears, and other sun-exposed areas. Over time, discoid lupus may heal with discolored scarring and even hair loss when the scalp is involved. Sometimes patients may feel pain or itch. Diagnosis.

Your physician will look at all of your skin, ask questions about your medical and family history, take blood and urine samples, and may do a skin biopsy. Yearly blood and urine testing is needed to screen for lupus affecting the joints or internal organs. Your physician may recommend seeing a rheumatologist if there is concern that your lupus may affect the joints or organs. Treatment The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of the skin, limit scarring, and prevent new skin lesions. Therapy begins with protecting your skin carefully from the sun by wearing sunscreen every day. Sunscreen should have a sun protection factor of at least 50, and the label should indicate that it protects against both types of sunlight. It is also important to wear sun-protective clothing and a broad-brimmed hat. People with skin lupus or systemic lupus should try to stop smoking because smoking may worsen their disease.

Medical treatment for lupus affecting the skin begins with creams or ointments and an oral medication called hydroxychloroquine. If your skin lupus is still active after using these treatments, your physician may consider other medications. Treatments help to control the disease, but there is no permanent cure for skin lupus, so it is important to see your physician regularly.

### Pragmatic approaches to therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus [^115BzZ1w]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with substantial clinical heterogeneity. Current treatments for SLE are effective at reducing morbidity and mortality but fail to provide a cure, and they frequently have adverse effects. Traditional treatments include NSAIDs and antimalarial agents, which are the first-line therapies for mild SLE. In addition, glucocorticoids and cytotoxic or immunosuppressive agents — such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and methotrexate — are used for SLE with organ involvement. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of SLE have led to the development of targeted immunotherapies, such as the anti-BAFF antibody belimumab, which has been approved as an add-on therapy for patients who have active disease despite receiving standard therapy. This Review presents an overview of the current therapies and nonpharmacological management approaches for SLE, and discusses the best approaches for treating specific disease manifestations such as lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Mucocutaneous manifestations — GPS state that people with SLE should be educated on the use of sunscreen and other sun-protection measures to reduce risk of rash and potential disease flare, and that initial therapy for cutaneous lupus rash — in addition to HCQ — should be topical, including glucocorticoid and/or calcineurin inhibitors; initial therapy may also include a course of intralesional glucocorticoids and/or a brief course of oral glucocorticoids. Sunscreens should block both UVB and UVA light, with Sun Protection Factors of ≥ 70 for chemical and ≥ 50 for physical blocker-based sunscreens recommended, and physical blocker sunscreens may be preferable in allergy-prone people.

### Novel biological therapeutic approaches to cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^1148MkMZ]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) encompasses a spectrum of dermatologic manifestations which can occur with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Treatment of CLE is challenging as the traditional treatments are off label and often fail and there is no drug specifically approved for CLE. The knowledge gained from the emerging trials on biologic therapy in SLE has provided insight into the utility of biologic therapy for CLE.

Areas Covered

An overview is provided on the biological agents studied for CLE discussing their immunological target, their efficacy in treating the various CLE manifestations and the outcome measures used.

Expert Opinion

There is a paucity of trials dedicated to the biologic treatment of CLE. Several of the described biological treatments' efficacy suggests that different clinical phenotypes of CLE may require different immunological targeted therapies. Recently published and ongoing trials of SLE focusing on novel agents for CLE using the Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI) as the outcome measure have shown promising results. Further trials designed specifically to study the efficacy of biologic treatment in CLE subgroups with or without systemic involvement using specific metrics for assessing cutaneous involvement are needed and will aid in illuminating the role of biologic therapy in CLE.

### An update on clinical trials for cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^1157oSo8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

To develop effective CLE treatments, validated outcome measures to track patient responsiveness are essential. The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) stands out as a comprehensive tool, widely used for its reliability, validity, and ability to differentiate between skin activity and damage. It captures the granularity of CLE activity across anatomical distribution and correlates with improvements in quality of life. Despite its extensive application in SLE trials and in lupus literature, the CLASI has yet to be endorsed by the FDA as a primary endpoint.

Instead, the FDA mandates use of a 5‐point Likert scale, the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), for skin‐related therapeutic trials. However, its application to CLE is met with challenges due to the need to define a successful outcome as clear or almost clear skin, which is often an unrealistic goal for CLE patients, when residual erythema may not resolve quickly and patients are meaningfully improved with lesser degrees of improvement. Emerging evidence suggests that a 50% reduction in the CLASI score from baseline, known as CLASI‐50, correlates with significant quality of life improvements. The CLE‐IGA's stringent criteria may not capture these changes, which can result in a failed clinical trial even if a medication has a meaningful impact from the patient perspective. At the current time, the dermatology community agree that the CLASI is best as a primary outcome, with other outcomes such as CLE‐IGA and quality of life measures being important secondary outcomes that require further validation.

### Changing paradigms in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^111otGZd]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, the choice of the suitable IS drug for a given patient will depend on the severity of the disease, the prevailing organ manifestations, patient age and childbearing potential (including possible wish for pregnancy) and physician experience. More important than the choice of a specific drug (see also below, strategy for treating SLE) is the realisation that initiation of an IS drug should have a low threshold in a newly diagnosed patient, in order to pursue prevention of flares and avoidance of long-term GC treatment. In our practice, we tend to use IS early in the disease course, that is, from the first severe or the second mild/moderate flare. Drugs we use most commonly as first-line GC-sparing agents are MMF, AZA and methotrexate (MTX). Given the results of the aforementioned RCT, MMF may work better especially in cases of multisystem disease. However, the choice should take into account its higher cost and absolute contraindication in pregnancy (MTX is also contraindicated); in most countries, prescription of MMF also requires approval from local drug regulatory agencies, a cumbersome procedure which may act as a deterrent for some physicians.

In cases with a single dominant organ manifestation, there are no high-quality comparative data to guide therapeutic decisions (possibly with the exception of skin disease, where data on drug efficacy are extrapolated from studies in cutaneous lupus erythematosus). As an example, we favour MTX when arthritis and cutaneous involvement are the predominant manifestations, and AZA or CsA in haematological disease or when pregnancy is contemplated. We reserve CYC for severe, organ-threatening disease manifestations (particularly neuropsychiatric, renal), or as «rescue» therapy when other options have failed.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: update of therapeutic options part I [^117UCi36]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), it is important to provide instructions concerning methods of protection from sunlight and artificial sources of ultraviolet radiation. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for patients with CLE; however, they are of limited value because of their well-known side effects. Recently, calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to be efficient as topical therapy in various CLE subtypes. The first-line treatment for severe and widespread skin manifestations is antimalarials; hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine can each be combined with quinacrine in refractory CLE. Systemic steroids can be used additionally in exacerbations of the disease. In the first part of this review, recent information on topical and first-line systemic treatment is described in detail while providing the reader with up-to-date information on efficacy, side effects, and dosage for the various agents. In the second part, additional systemic agents for the treatment of CLE will be discussed.

### Drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus [^116KCnnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, which can cause scarring. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some (such as thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) are potentially toxic. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009. We wanted to update the review to assess whether any new information was available to treat DLE, as we were still unsure of the effectiveness of available drugs and how to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual with DLE.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to 22 September 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to treat people with DLE in any population group and of either gender. Comparisons included any drug used for DLE against either another drug or against placebo cream. We excluded laser treatment, surgery, phototherapy, other forms of physical therapy, and photoprotection as we did not consider them drug treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers independently extracted data onto a data extraction sheet, resolving disagreements by discussion. We used standard methods to assess risk of bias, as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Five trials involving 197 participants were included. Three new trials were included in this update. None of the five trials were of high quality'.isk of bias' assessments identified potential sources of bias in each study. One study used an inappropriate randomisation method, and incomplete outcome data were a concern in another as 15 people did not complete the trial. We found most of the trials to be at low risk in terms of blinding, but three of the five did not describe allocation concealment. The included trials inadequately addressed the primary outcome measures of this review (percentage with complete resolution of skin lesions, percentage with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions, and improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures). One study of fluocinonide cream 0.05% (potent steroid) compared with hydrocortisone cream 1% (low-potency steroid) in 78 people reported complete resolution of skin lesions in 27% (10/37) of participants in the fluocinonide cream group and in 10% (4/41) in the hydrocortisone group, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (risk ratio (RR) 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08, 1 study, n = 78, low-quality evidence). The other primary outcome measures were not reported. Adverse events did not require discontinuation of the drug. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone, and one person developed acne. Burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide (moderate-quality evidence). A comparative trial of two oral agents, acitretin (50 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily), reported two of the outcomes of interest: complete resolution was seen in 13 of 28 participants (46%) on acitretin and 15 of 30 participants (50%) on hydoxychloroquine (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 58, low-quality evidence). Clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions was reported in 10 of 24 participants (42%) on acitretin and 17 of 25 (68%) on hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06, 1 study, n = 49, low-quality evidence). This comparison did not assess improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures. Participants taking acitretin showed a small increase in serum triglyceride, not sufficient to require withdrawal of the drug. The main adverse effects were dry lips (93% of the acitretin group and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin group and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group). Four participants on acitretin withdrew due to gastrointestinal events or dry lips (moderate-quality evidence). One trial randomised 10 people with DLE to apply a calcineurin inhibitor, pimecrolimus 1% cream, or a potent steroid, betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream, for eight weeks. The study reported none of the primary outcome measures, nor did it present data on adverse events. A trial of calcineurin inhibitors compared tacrolimus cream 0.1% with placebo (vehicle) over 12 weeks in 14 people, but reported none of our primary outcome measures. In the tacrolimus group, five participants complained of slight burning and itching, and for one participant, a herpes simplex infection was reactivated (moderate-quality evidence). Topical R-salbutamol 0.5% cream was compared with placebo (vehicle) over eight weeks in one trial of 37 people with DLE. There was a significant improvement in pain and itch in the salbutamol group at two, four, six, and eight weeks compared to placebo, but the trial did not record a formal measure of quality of life. None of the primary outcome measures were reported. Changes in erythema did not show benefit of salbutamol over placebo, but we could not obtain from the trial report the number of participants with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions. There were 15 events in the placebo group (experienced by 12 participants) and 24 in the salbutamol group (experienced by nine participants). None of the adverse events were considered serious (moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Fluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in clearing DLE skin lesions. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse effects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions occurred less often in participants applying acitretin. Moderate-quality evidence found adverse events were minor on the whole. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat DLE. Overall, the quality of the trials and levels of uncertainty were such that there is a need for further trials of sufficient duration comparing, in particular, topical steroids with other agents.

Recommendation development and voting — consensus thresholds and statement types: Per ACR policy, consensus required ≥ 70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. A recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel was very confident that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweighed its harms, or vice versa, a conditional recommendation expresses uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harm due to low-quality evidence, or that the decision is particularly sensitive to individual patient preferences or cost constraints, and good practice statements (GPS) were also generated; these are actionable statements where the desirable effects clearly outweigh the undesirable effects of an intervention.

### Lupus erythematosus: management of cutaneous manifestations during pregnancy [^112ZrX4V]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that often affects the skin. Cutaneous manifestations are generally subdivided into different subtypes, including acute, subacute, and chronic courses. Management of lupus erythematosus cutaneous manifestations during pregnancy remains a clinical challenge until nowadays. To date, no recommendations have been published specifically for the treatment of this condition in pregnant women, so therapeutic strategies are mainly based on recommendations for general population and other rheumatologic and dermatologic diseases during pregnancy. This challenge is compounded by a lack of evidence-based studies, as clinical trials in pregnant women are considered unethical in many circumstances, so data are often extrapolated from low-evidence sources. The aim of this article consists in review currently evidence of treatment of lupus erythematosus cutaneous lesion in pregnant women.

### Review of treatment for discoid lupus erythematosus [^112q2PVb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic cutaneous disease characterized by inflammatory plaques that, in the absence of prompt diagnosis and treatment, may lead to disfiguring scarring and skin atrophy. However, there is limited evidence for which treatments are most effective. Currently, no medications have been approved specifically for the treatment of DLE. Many of the drugs described in the literature were developed for use in other immune disorders. This review will summarize current therapeutic options for DLE and their supporting evidence with discussion of prevention, topical measures, physical modalities, and systemic therapies, including newer potential therapies.
