## Question

Can inhaled budesonide be used to treat pulmonary edema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inhaled budesonide can be used to treat pulmonary edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the types and pathophysiology of pulmonary edema and the standard recommended management for each. Then, I should verify budesonide's pharmacology and FDA-labeled indications and contraindications. Next, I should review the direct clinical evidence, if any, for inhaled budesonide in pulmonary edema or ARDS. After that, I need to assess mechanistic plausibility, including drug delivery to flooded alveoli and fluid clearance biology. Then, I should review authoritative guidelines for any role of inhaled corticosteroids here and weigh safety concerns and dosing guidance. Finally, I will grade the evidence quality and provide a practical, clinically aligned recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework so I don't jump to conclusions: pulmonary edema can be cardiogenic from elevated hydrostatic pressure or non-cardiogenic from increased permeability (e.g. ARDS, inhalational injury, negative pressure pulmonary edema), and standard care differs accordingly, with cardiogenic edema often benefiting from oxygen and noninvasive ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) and afterload/diuresis as appropriate, while ARDS care emphasizes low tidal volume ventilation, adequate PEEP, conservative fluids, and etiologic treatment rather than airway anti-inflammatory inhaled therapies [^112Sgy3C] [^113crMig].

> Wait, let me verify the nuanced point about negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) before I assume diuretics are routine; I initially thought diuretics were standard, but hold on, the NPPE review emphasizes airway maintenance, oxygen with PEEP/NIV, and notes diuretics are often used despite no evidence and potential to worsen hypovolemia and hypoperfusion, with typical rapid resolution in 12–48 hours when treated supportively, which cautions against unnecessary pharmacologic additions like inhaled steroids for fluid removal [^notfound].

> I should confirm budesonide's pharmacology and labeled indications: budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid for maintenance therapy in asthma and COPD, not for acute respiratory crises or primary treatment of status asthmaticus, with FDA labeling explicitly restricting its acute use and outlining systemic steroid-type risks such as adrenal suppression and immunosuppression; there is no labeled indication or dosing guidance for pulmonary edema or ARDS [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds] [^114wqEgL] [^114rtRgU].

> Next, I should review whether there is direct clinical evidence for inhaled budesonide in pulmonary edema or ARDS; let me check the provided literature carefully: I find no clinical trials in adults or children testing inhaled budesonide as treatment for cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or for established ARDS, only a case report of nitric acid fume inhalation lung injury where "hormones" were adjusted without specifying agent, and otherwise neonatal studies of intratracheal budesonide mixed with surfactant for RDS/BPD prevention that do not translate to adult pulmonary edema treatment, along with animal VILI models using prophylactic budesonide at nonclinical ventilatory settings, which are hypothesis-generating but not practice-changing [^1116WXKp] [^113sJp1V] [^114Wn8Bx] [^116aLwcX] [^117BX46V] [^113BryHS] [^115BwQ3s] [^111KAHFg] [^114GPcdR] [^113ftowD] [^1128Jx7c] [^114DVGCD] [^112eoNgR].

> Hold on, I should double-check mechanistic plausibility before dismissing it entirely: pulmonary edema is primarily about hydrostatic forces and alveolocapillary permeability and secondarily about alveolar fluid clearance; inhaled budesonide targets airway inflammation rather than directly mobilizing alveolar edema fluid, and delivered dose to the lower respiratory tract via nebulization in infants/children can be as low as 1–20% of the nominal dose under ideal bench conditions, which would likely be even less with flooded alveoli and severe V/Q mismatch, making an acute decongestive effect implausible physiologically [^117NbpnU] [^115Q87cp].

> But wait, what if corticosteroids more broadly have a role in ARDS; I need to check guidelines carefully: the 2024 ATS ARDS guideline issues only a conditional recommendation for systemic corticosteroids due to heterogeneity in trials and uncertainty about agent, timing, dose, and safety, and it does not address inhaled steroids; similarly, ERS/ATS NIV guidance for cardiogenic edema and ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension guidance mention other classes of inhaled agents (e.g., vasodilators, inhaled treprostinil in ILD-PH) but do not endorse inhaled corticosteroids for edema syndromes, underscoring the absence of a guideline-supported role for inhaled budesonide here [^113crMig] [^112Sgy3C] [^117FwEcN].

> I will now examine whether any adjacent evidence might be misconstrued to support this use; let me be careful: trials of inhaled budesonide in acute asthma or pediatric wheeze show mixed or modest effects on asthma outcomes when added to systemic steroids and bronchodilators and are disease-specific, not extrapolatable to edema physiology; likewise, outpatient COVID-19 trials of inhaled steroids address viral inflammatory illness, not alveolar flooding, and do not establish a role in pulmonary edema management [^111SLUMp] [^1125YdSA] [^111Qu2oE] [^116fd37B] [^112dKSrG].

> Let me consider counterexamples so I don't miss anything: alveolar fluid clearance can be upregulated by beta-agonists, and prophylactic salmeterol reduced high-altitude pulmonary edema incidence, but that mechanism is distinct from corticosteroid anti-inflammation and still does not support using inhaled budesonide to treat established edema in general clinical practice, which keeps the mechanistic rationale weak for ICS in pulmonary edema treatment [^112DWWQY].

> I should confirm safety and feasibility before making a recommendation: beyond the lack of efficacy data, budesonide carries corticosteroid class risks (adrenal suppression, infection risk, growth effects in children, ocular effects) and has explicit labeling against use as primary therapy for acute respiratory crises, with no dosing guidance for edema syndromes, so empiric use risks harm without proven benefit [^114rtRgU] [^1169PsR4] [^112VJcM6] [^114wqEgL].

> Let me now grade the evidence quality and ensure I'm not overstating: the evidence supporting inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema is absent for human treatment trials, limited to low-credibility animal VILI prevention studies and neonatal intratracheal surfactant-steroid work for RDS/BPD prevention, with no high-quality trials in the target adult/pediatric edema populations; guidelines do not recommend this practice, making the overall evidence indirect, low quality, and not clinically actionable [^114GPcdR] [^113ftowD] [^116aLwcX] [^113crMig] [^112Sgy3C].

> Putting this together clinically, I need to ensure the recommendation aligns with standards of care: for cardiogenic pulmonary edema, prioritize oxygen and NIV/CPAP with afterload reduction and diuresis as indicated; for ARDS and other non-cardiogenic causes, use lung-protective ventilation with adequate PEEP, conservative fluids, and treat the precipitant; inhaled budesonide should not be used to treat pulmonary edema, although it can be continued for its labeled indications in comorbid asthma or COPD if clinically appropriate [^112Sgy3C] [^113crMig] [^114b4gds] [^116xo9Uk].

> Final take: Inhaled budesonide is not an appropriate or evidence-based therapy for pulmonary edema; absent supportive clinical trials, lacking mechanistic plausibility for acute fluid removal, and not endorsed by guidelines, its use in this context should be avoided in favor of condition-specific, guideline-concordant management, with systemic corticosteroids considered only when indicated by the underlying ARDS etiology and in line with conditional guidance [^113crMig] [^112Sgy3C].

---

Inhaled budesonide is **not recommended** for pulmonary edema due to a **lack of clinical evidence** supporting its use. Pulmonary edema management relies on **oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support** — not inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C] [^117AJhfg]. Budesonide is indicated for asthma and COPD; its use in pulmonary edema is **unsupported by guidelines or trials** [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds] [^113crMig]. Animal data suggesting reduced lung injury [^114GPcdR] do not justify clinical use, and potential risks include delayed wound healing, immunosuppression, and adrenal suppression [^114rtRgU]. Clinicians should use **established therapies** and avoid inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema.

## Pharmacological properties of budesonide

Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid with strong anti-inflammatory activity [^117NbpnU] and minimal mineralocorticoid effect, with predominantly local pulmonary effects and low systemic absorption [^114JUsuY]. It is approved for asthma and COPD maintenance therapy, **not for acute pulmonary edema** [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds] [^114wqEgL].

---

## Evidence for inhaled budesonide in pulmonary edema

There is **no clinical evidence** to support inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema [^113crMig]. Management of pulmonary edema, including ARDS, focuses on supportive care, oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory strategies — not inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C] [^117Fosao]. Although animal studies suggest budesonide may reduce lung injury and edema in ventilator-induced lung injury models, these findings are **not validated in humans** and do not support clinical use [^112eoNgR] [^114GPcdR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend** inhaled budesonide for pulmonary edema. Management of ARDS and pulmonary edema emphasizes supportive care, oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support, with no role for inhaled corticosteroids [^112Sgy3C].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Inhaled budesonide **carries risks**, including:

- **Delayed wound healing**: Use caution in all patients [^114rtRgU].
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk, especially with active or latent infections [^114rtRgU] [^1169PsR4].
- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk of adrenal insufficiency, particularly with prolonged use [^114rtRgU] [^1169PsR4].
- **Growth restriction**: Use caution in pediatric patients [^114rtRgU] [^117W3BAJ].

These risks **outweigh any unproven benefit** in pulmonary edema.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard treatments for **pulmonary edema** include:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Improves oxygenation and reduces hypoxemia.
- **Diuretics**: Reduces fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.
- **Ventilatory support**: NIV or mechanical ventilation for severe cases [^112Sgy3C].

Inhaled budesonide does not address the underlying pathophysiology of pulmonary edema and is **not supported by evidence or guidelines** [^113crMig].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Inhaled budesonide is **not recommended** for pulmonary edema due to a lack of evidence and guideline support. Management should rely on established therapies, such as oxygen, diuretics, and ventilatory support [^112Sgy3C]. Budesonide remains indicated for asthma and COPD, not pulmonary edema [^116xo9Uk] [^114b4gds].

### Understanding negative pressure pulmonary edema [^117AJhfg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of NPPE generally includes maintaining a patent airway and oxygen supplementation with the addition of positive end-expiratory pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV), as guided by physical examination and arterial blood gas analysis. Mechanical ventilation should be reserved for severe patients who do not respond to NIV. Diuretics are often used; however, there is no evidence of their utility, and they may exacerbate hypovolemia and hypoperfusion. Ultimately, NPPE usually has a rapidly resolving clinical course in 12–48 hours when recognized early and treated immediately.

Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to PE can help in distinguishing NPPE from other causes of noncardiogenic PE, thus preventing the use of inappropriate and potentially dangerous treatments for patients with NPPE.

### Intravenous methylprednisolone versus intravenous methylprednisolone combined with inhaled budesonide in acute severe pediatric asthma [^1125YdSA]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are an important part of acute severe asthma (ASA) management in pediatric intensive care units. Few studies examine the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in critical care settings. We aimed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of ICS when added to intravenous corticosteroids in pediatric patients with ASA admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

- **Methods**: This was a randomized controlled trial involving pediatric patients aged 1–21 years admitted to PICU with ASA. Patients were randomized into two groups using block randomization. Patients in Group A received intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) alone, and patients in Group B received intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) plus budesonide nebulization (0.5 mg every 12 hours). The main outcomes were the duration of continuous albuterol treatment, PICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and the need for and duration of respiratory support. Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis, in which a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Results**: The duration of continuous albuterol treatment was not different between the two groups, median (IQR) 30 (18–51) vs. 25 (14–49) [p = 0.38]. PICU and hospital LOS between the two groups was similar, median (IQR) 44 (30–64) vs. 46 (30–62) [p = 0.75] and 78 (65–95) vs. 72 (58–92) [p = 0.19]. The number of patients requiring respiratory support was 22 (58%) in Group A and 25 (64%) in Group B [p = 0.19].

- **Conclusions**: In critically ill children with ASA, intravenous methylprednisolone combined with inhaled budesonide did not show significant differences in the measured outcomes compared to intravenous methylprednisolone alone.

### In vitro delivery of budesonide from 30 jet nebulizer/compressor combinations using infant and child breathing patterns [^115Q87cp]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

An aerosol of budesonide inhalation suspension is delivered when used with various jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations. The constant introduction of new nebulizer/compressor combinations raises the question of whether the performance of these matches the performance of existing devices. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro the inhaled mass and aerosol characteristics of budesonide inhalation suspension from a selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations presently marketed in the United States, Europe, and Japan.

- **Methods**: The in vitro characterization was performed using standardized and published methods. Each nebulizer was charged with 1 vial (2 mL) of budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg/mL (0.5 mg budesonide) and run until the end of aerosol formation. Droplet size and distribution were determined using a cooled impactor at an airflow of 15 L/min. The inhaled mass of budesonide (i.e. mass on the inhalation filter) was collected using a breathing simulator that mimicked the breathing patterns of an infant and a child. The aerosol was collected on filters placed between the nebulizer mouthpiece and the breathing simulator. Budesonide was quantified via standard high-performance liquid chromatography.

- **Results**: The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol measured with the cooled impactor ranged between 4.8 μm and 9.9 μm, and the geometric standard deviation ranged between 1.7 μm and 2.1 μm. The inhaled mass of budesonide expressed as a percentage of the nebulizer charge ranged from 1% to 9% (infant) and from 4% to 20% (child).

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^117BX46V]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Over the past two decades, the administration of intratracheal surfactant has proven to be the most effective therapeutic intervention for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This treatment has significantly reduced the occurrence of pneumothorax and improved overall survival rates. By reducing complications associated with RDS in preterm infants, surfactant treatment has played a crucial role in decreasing mortality rates, especially among those who require mechanical ventilation. The advancements in surfactant therapy have had a significant positive impact on the outcomes of preterm infants with RDS. Postpartum steroid use has been shown to decrease the severity of BPD in infants. However, it is important to note that high doses of steroids can potentially result in developmental and neurological defects.

A combination of inhaled steroids and surfactants has recently been used in some studies. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of inhaled steroids and surfactants is safe and associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in very low birth weight infants. In a study comparing the concomitant administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide with surfactant alone in preterm infants with RDS, it was found that the combination of budesonide and surfactant led to improved pulmonary status and reduced mortality and morbidity due to chronic lung disease, specifically BPD. However, it is important to note that conflicting results have also been reported in other studies. The studies primarily focused on very premature babies.

### Surfactant and budesonide for respiratory distress syndrome: an observational study [^116aLwcX]. Pediatric Research (2020). High credibility.

In preterm infants on moderately high ventilator support, the addition of budesonide to surfactant lowered bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) rates by 20% without increasing morbidity or mortality. The aim of this cohort comparison was to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination in infants with milder respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

- **Methods**: In August 2016, we began administering budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) mixed with surfactant (Survanta 4 mL/kg) to all infants weighing ≤ 1250 g who failed CPAP and required intubation. Infants were compared to a historical cohort (2013–2016) who received surfactant alone.

- **Results**: BPD or death did not change between the historical surfactant cohort (71%, n = 294) and the budesonide cohort (69%, n = 173). Budesonide was associated with a decrease in the need for continued mechanical ventilation, severe BPD type II or death (19–12%), grade III BPD or death (31–21%), and the median gestational age at discharge was 1 week earlier. Histologic chorioamnionitis was associated with decreased budesonide effects. Secondary morbidities (NEC, IVH, ROP, sepsis) were similar.

- **Conclusion**: Overall BPD rates remained unchanged with the addition of budesonide. Budesonide was associated with decreased severity of BPD, decreased mechanical ventilation use, earlier discharge, and similar short-term outcomes.

### Budesonide inhalation suspension reduces the need for emergency intervention in pediatric asthma: A named-patient case series [^1156EZTh]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This report describes 15 children aged 10–35 months frequently hospitalized with uncontrolled asthma, who were monitored for a mean of 26.9 months to assess the efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension (AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, DE) in reducing emergency interventions. Budesonide inhalation suspension had previously been shown to relieve asthma symptoms, improve pulmonary function, and reduce rescue medication use in children as young as 6 months with mild to severe persistent asthma. We now show that ≥ 1 year of treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension at doses between 0.25 and 1.5 mg/d decreased the burden of asthma.

The mean number of hospitalizations caused by asthma or respiratory illness decreased from 1.8 ± 1.37 before the initiation of treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension to 0.33 ± 0.62 during treatment. Similarly, the mean number of oral prednisone courses decreased from 8.1 ± 13.7 to 1.8 ± 2.1, and the mean number of acute respiratory illnesses requiring additional therapy decreased from 2.7 ± 2.3 before treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension to 0.87 ± 0.74 during treatment.

The number of emergency department visits decreased or remained the same after the initiation of budesonide inhalation suspension treatment in all but two children. There was no effect on the growth rate in this group of children with moderate to severe asthma. In this case series, budesonide inhalation suspension represents a safe, effective treatment option to prevent emergency intervention for patients under 3 years of age with poorly controlled asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^113q9nZJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist, not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update, provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and offered ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop evidence to decision (EtD) tables, and write recommendation statements.

- **Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes**: The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision-making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or inadequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes, such as asthma control. In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome, like asthma symptoms.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^113ftowD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, rats were ventilated with a tidal volume of 30 ml/kg, which is substantially higher than volumes used in clinical applications. Our preliminary study showed that a lower tidal volume (10–15 ml/kg) did not cause a decline in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Therefore, we increased the tidal volume to 30 ml/kg and successfully established the significantly decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio and mild acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is consistent with the study by Li et al, who also used the 30 ml/kg tidal volume to induce acute lung injury. Second, in this study, budesonide was administered at the onset of VILI, supporting its use as a preventative treatment. Clinically, however, patients need mechanical ventilation support before dysfunction or injury to the lung occurs. Third, we did not evaluate the purity of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which may influence the assessment of budesonide's effects on neutrophils in VILI. We will address these limitations in future studies.

### Nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension compared with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution for asthma in young children: Results of a randomized outcomes trial [^113F7rBo]. Pediatrics (2002). High credibility.

The availability of anti-inflammatory asthma medications for infants and young children has been limited. This study aimed to compare the effects of nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution on asthma-related health outcomes in young children with asthma.

We conducted a randomized, parallel-group, 52-week, open-label study at 36 US clinical sites. Patients included 335 children aged 2 to 6 years with persistent asthma who had been treated with at least one long-term control medication. Of these, 287 children (86%) completed the study. Patients received budesonide inhalation suspension, 0.5 mg daily (n = 168), or cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution, 20 mg four times daily (n = 167), for 8 weeks, followed by dose titration at the investigator's discretion. The main outcome measure was the rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks. Secondary measures included times to first asthma exacerbation and first use of additional asthma therapy, asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and health care resource utilization.

The budesonide group had a mean (median) asthma exacerbation rate of 1.23 (0.99) per year compared with 2.41 (1.85) for the cromolyn group. Budesonide produced significantly longer times to first exacerbation and first use of additional long-term asthma medication, greater improvements in asthma symptom scores, reduced use of rescue medication, and fewer urgent care visits. Both treatments were well tolerated.

In conclusion, budesonide inhalation suspension was more effective than nebulized cromolyn sodium in young children with asthma.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^114GPcdR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study found that budesonide ameliorated lung injury probably by improving epithelial permeability, decreasing edema, inhibiting local and systemic inflammation, and reducing apoptosis in VILI. We speculate that inhalation of budesonide reduces lung injury and edema via inhibition of NF-kB phosphorylation and decreased secretion of adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory factors, which reduces local and systemic inflammation. Budesonide inhalation may be a potential approach for ARDS therapy in clinical practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1144behQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma, published in 2007, proposed intermittent ICS dosing schedules for certain settings. However, the evidence at the time was insufficient to formally recommend this treatment beyond expert consensus.

"Intermittent" ICS dosing involves using ICS treatment for short periods, typically in response to symptoms or as an add-on therapy, possibly alongside a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). It does not refer to a single regimen; instead, its definition varies across recommendations. Providers can prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. The decision to use intermittent ICS could be based on an individual's needs (also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index indicating worsening asthma, or another criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The term "ICS-LABA" refers to an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2-agonist combination.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^11355Tty]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

This recommendation is for children aged 0 to 4 years who have had three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in their lifetime, or who have had two such episodes in the past year and are asymptomatic between respiratory tract infections. For this population, the Expert Panel recommends a short (7–10-day) course of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) daily, along with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick-relief therapy starting at the onset of signs and symptoms indicating a respiratory tract infection. Respiratory tract infections were not confirmed by culture or PCR in the studies, and no further details on wheezing were provided.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in children aged 0 to 4 years:

- **Budesonide inhalation suspension regimen**: One regimen used in two studies is budesonide inhalation suspension, 1 mg, twice daily for 7 days at the first sign of respiratory tract infection–associated symptoms.

- **Efficacy and monitoring**: Although the efficacy of intermittent ICS dosing has high certainty of evidence, data regarding effects on growth are conflicting. Clinicians should carefully monitor length or height in children treated with the recommended regimen.

- **Caregiver initiation and instructions**: Caregivers can initiate intermittent ICS treatment at home without a visit to a health care provider when they have clear instructions. Clinicians should give caregivers written instructions on how to implement the recommended action plan at the onset of a respiratory infection. In addition, clinicians should review the plan with the caregiver at regular intervals.

### Role of budesonide as maintenance therapy for children with asthma [^113zw4iz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Inhaled corticosteroids are recognized as the preferred long-term control medication for persistent asthma based on their anti-inflammatory properties and significant evidence of efficacy. Inhaled budesonide is the most carefully characterized inhaled corticosteroid for childhood asthma. It is available for administration in children as young as six months of age and, at the time of writing, has an excellent safety profile.

### Pulmicortflexhaler [^117NbpnU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid exhibiting potent glucocorticoid activity combined with weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency compared to cortisol, as observed in the rat croton oil ear edema assay. When considering systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally, as demonstrated in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be fully understood.

The effect of Pulmicort Flexhaler is attributed to the parent drug, budesonide. Glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies revealed that the 22R form of budesonide is two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies have shown that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.

The exact mechanism by which corticosteroids mediate their effects on inflammation in asthma remains unclear. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids exhibit broad inhibitory activities against various cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, as well as mediators such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines, all of which are involved in allergic and non-allergic mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in treating asthma.

Research conducted on asthmatic patients has demonstrated a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a broad range.

### Are inhaled vasodilators useful in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Fosao]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled vasodilators can result in important physiological benefits, such as improved hypoxemia, lower pulmonary arterial pressure, improved right-ventricular function, and enhanced cardiac output, without systemic hemodynamic effects. Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) and aerosolized prostacyclins are currently the most frequently used inhaled vasodilators. Inhaled prostacyclins are as effective physiologically as INO and cost less.

Randomized controlled trials of INO in the treatment of ARDS have shown short-term physiological benefits but no benefit in long-term outcomes. No outcome studies have been reported on the use of prostacyclin in patients with ARDS. There is no role for the routine use of inhaled vasodilators in patients with ARDS. However, the use of inhaled vasodilators as a rescue therapy for severe refractory hypoxemia in patients with ARDS may be reasonable, though it remains controversial.

### Pulmonary ultrasound-guided management of delayed pulmonary edema secondary to nitric acid fumes inhalation: A case report [^1116WXKp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Concentrated nitric acid can form nitrogen oxides through a spontaneous redox reaction. After inhalation, it has a stimulating effect on the respiratory tract and can cause inhalation lung injury. This lung injury is mainly manifested as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in imaging, and pulmonary ultrasound can dynamically monitor the severity of pulmonary edema at the patient's bedside.

- **Case presentation**: This article describes a 52-year-old female case who experienced chest tightness and dyspnea 8 hours after inhaling nitric acid fumes and was sent to the emergency room. Chest CT suggested diffuse exudation in both lungs, and dynamic B-lines could be seen by bedside pulmonary ultrasound. During the treatment of this patient, we adjusted the dosage of hormones and the oxygen therapy plan in a timely manner according to the evolution of B-lines under ultrasound. After treatment, her clinical symptoms gradually improved, and the re-examination of chest CT showed that the exudation in both lungs was gradually absorbed.

- **Conclusion**: This case reminds clinicians to be alert to the occurrence of delayed pulmonary edema when treating patients who inhale nitric acid fumes. At the same time, dynamic examination of bedside pulmonary ultrasound is of great value in the treatment of such patients.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^114DVGCD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) are significant contributors to morbidity in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). The use of budesonide has demonstrated potential in mitigating lung injury associated with large volume ventilation. Key mechanisms involve the reduction of inflammatory markers such as interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

- **Study overview**: Lung injury reduction was measured using several markers, including the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was employed to assess lung tissue histopathology.

- **Mechanisms**: Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were explored to understand budesonide's protective effects. Additionally, the nuclear factor (NF) pathway and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) levels were evaluated for their roles in the inflammatory response.

- **Biochemical analysis**: The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was used for detecting apoptotic cells. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was utilized in preparing samples for analysis, ensuring consistent biochemical conditions across experiments.

- **Results**: Findings highlighted reduced wet/dry weight (W/D) ratios in budesonide-treated groups, indicating attenuated edema and injury severity.

This study underscores budesonide's therapeutic potential in the context of VILI, contributing valuable insights into pulmonary medicine despite the low credibility score of this specific report.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113crMig]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

- **Implementation considerations**: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials may be considered.

### Pulmicort respules [^114JUsuY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid exhibiting potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol, as evidenced by the rat croton oil ear edema assay. As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally, according to the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

The activity of Pulmicort Respules is attributed to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.

The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not well known. Inflammation is a crucial component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have exhibited a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, as well as mediators such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines involved in allergic- and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activities and systemic corticosteroid effects.

### Nebulized budesonide added to standard pediatric emergency department treatment of acute asthma: A randomized, double-blind trial [^111SLUMp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The goal was to determine if adding inhaled budesonide to standard asthma therapy improves outcomes of pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma.

The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a tertiary care, urban pediatric ED. Patients 2 to 18 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma were randomized to receive either a single 2-mg dose of budesonide inhalation suspension (BUD) or normal sterile saline (NSS) placebo, added to albuterol, ipratropium bromide (IB), and systemic corticosteroids (SCS). The primary outcome was the difference in median asthma scores between treatment groups at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes included differences in vital signs and hospitalization rates.

A total of 180 patients were enrolled. Treatment groups had similar baseline demographics, asthma scores, and vital signs. A total of 169 patients (88 BUD, 81 NSS) were assessed for the primary outcome. No significant difference was found between groups in the change in median asthma score at 2 hours (BUD -3, NSS -3, p = 0.64). Vital signs at 2 hours were also similar between groups. Fifty-six children (62%) were admitted to the hospital in the BUD group and 55 (62%) in the NSS group (difference 0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -14% to 14%). Neither multivariate adjustment nor planned subgroup analysis by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use prior to the ED significantly altered the results.

For children 2 to 18 years of age treated in the ED for acute asthma, a single 2-mg dose of budesonide added to standard therapy did not result in improved clinical outcomes compared with placebo.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^115BwQ3s]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The covariate adaptive randomization method was utilized in this study to allocate participants into two groups. The researchers identified gestational age and birth weight as important factors that needed to be balanced across groups to mitigate potential confounding effects. To achieve this, a randomization algorithm was employed that took into account the values of these covariates for each participant, adaptively allocating participants to treatment groups and ensuring a balanced distribution of gestational age and birth weight across the groups.

In this study, a random sequence of numbers was created using random table numbering by a person not involved in the research team. The created numbers were recorded on cards, and the cards were placed in letter envelopes. As soon as eligible participants entered the study, one of the envelopes was opened in order, revealing the participant's allocated group.

### Expert panel consensus recommendations on the utilization of nebulized budesonide for managing asthma and COPD in both stable and exacerbation stages in Thailand [^1127m94H]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated the utilization of nebulized budesonide for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations as well as for maintenance therapy in adults.

- **Data sources**: We conducted a search on PubMed for nebulized budesonide treatment.

- **Selected studies**: English-language papers were selected using MeSH terms "asthma", "COPD", "budesonide", "nebulized", "adult", "exacerbation", and "maintenance" without temporal restrictions. The selection was narrowed to clinical research such as RCTs, observational studies, and real-world studies.

- **Results**: Analysis of 25 studies was conducted to assess the effectiveness of nebulized budesonide in asthma (n = 10) and COPD (n = 15). The panel in Thailand recommended incorporating nebulized budesonide as an additional or alternative treatment option to the standard of care and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) based on the findings.

- **Conclusion**: Nebulized budesonide is effective and well-tolerated in treating asthma and COPD, with fewer systemic adverse effects compared to systemic corticosteroids. High-dose nebulized budesonide can enhance clinical outcomes for severe and mild exacerbations with slow systemic corticosteroid response. Nebulized budesonide can substitute systemic corticosteroids in some situations.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^116fd37B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are well established for the long-term treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They have been investigated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The anti-inflammatory action of inhaled corticosteroids might have the potential to reduce the risk of severe illness resulting from hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of COVID-19 and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies up to 7 October 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating inhaled corticosteroids for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, sex, or ethnicity. We included the following interventions: any type or dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We included the following comparison: inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with or without placebo). We excluded studies examining nasal or topical steroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. For risk of bias assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: A review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Use of systemic corticosteroids, along with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for managing acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefits in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways, which likely reduces systemic exposure and, consequently, the rates of unwanted systemic effects. To evaluate the role of budesonide in managing acute asthma exacerbations, we conducted a literature review and critically evaluated the rationale for using ICS in this setting. Studies involving adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefits for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in emergency department, hospital, and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma in adults and children [^114Gs1T5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) are commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a newer agent with greater potency in in-vitro assays.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of fluticasone to beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register (January 2004) and reference lists of articles. We contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies for additional studies and searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings (1997 to 2003).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials in children and adults comparing fluticasone to either beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using RevMan analyses 1.0.1.

- **Main results**: Fifty-six studies (12,119 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable. Dose ratio 1:2: FP produced a significantly greater FEV1 (0.14 liters, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.22), morning PEF (11.10 L/min, 95% CI 3.12 to 19.09 L/min) and evening PEF (9.31 L/min, 95% CI 5.12 to 13.5 L/min). This applied to all drug doses, age groups, and delivery devices. No difference between FP and BDP/BUD was seen for trial withdrawals. Symptoms and rescue medication use were widely reported but few trials provided sufficient data for analysis.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^115SBJAj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

MV is a life-saving treatment for patients with ARDS, but even minimal MV can induce VILI. Thus, it is imperative to develop therapies that can attenuate VILI. In the study, we found that budesonide improves alveolocapillary permeability, increases the W/D weight ratio and total protein in BALF, inhibits inflammation, attenuates histological changes, and inhibits apoptosis in VILI. Our data support that budesonide may reduce VILI. Although several studies have indicated that budesonide or systemic glucocorticoids can reduce lung injury in various models and systemic glucocorticoids can ameliorate VILI, this is the first study to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide on VILI. VILI is a serious and common problem in patients who need long-term and large volume ventilation. The major injury is found in their lungs. In this study, we administered budesonide through inhalation to avoid the systemic effect of glucocorticoids and strengthen its local efficacy.

During large volume ventilation, overstretching of epithelial cells activates NF-kB and promotes NF-kB phosphorylation. Under the stimulation of mechanical ventilation, many chemoattractant and proinflammatory factors, including IL-8, ICAM-1, and MIP-2, are released, and pulmonary macrophages are activated and recruit neutrophils. The activated macrophages and neutrophils release pro-inflammatory factors and elastase, contributing to lung injury and leading to lung edema. In the study, we found that budesonide improved the oxygen index and reduced histological injury in the lung.

### Salmeterol for the prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^112DWWQY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema results from a persistent imbalance between forces that drive water into the air space and the physiological mechanisms that remove it. Among these mechanisms, the absorption of liquid driven by active alveolar transepithelial sodium transport plays an important role; a defect in this mechanism may predispose patients to pulmonary edema. Beta-adrenergic agonists up-regulate the clearance of alveolar fluid and attenuate pulmonary edema in animal models.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the effects of prophylactic inhalation of the beta-adrenergic agonist salmeterol on the incidence of pulmonary edema during exposure to high altitudes (4559 m, reached in less than 22 hours) in 37 subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema. We also measured the nasal transepithelial potential difference, a marker of the transepithelial sodium and water transport in the distal airways, in 33 mountaineers who were prone to high-altitude pulmonary edema and 33 mountaineers who were resistant to this condition.

- **Results**: Prophylactic inhalation of salmeterol decreased the incidence of high-altitude pulmonary edema in susceptible subjects by more than 50 percent, from 74 percent with placebo to 33 percent (P = 0.02). The nasal potential-difference value under low-altitude conditions was more than 30 percent lower in the subjects who were susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema than in those who were not susceptible (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic inhalation of a beta-adrenergic agonist reduces the risk of high-altitude pulmonary edema.

### A follow-up study of preterm infants given budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle to prevent chronic lung disease in preterm infants [^111KAHFg]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Our study of early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle showed a significant decrease in death or chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We now report the long-term outcome at about 2 to 3 years of age.

- **Study design**: Of the 75 potential survivors, 67 (90%) were studied (35 budesonide-treated, 32 control). All infants had a birth weight of less than 1500 g and severe RDS requiring intermittent mechanical ventilation shortly after birth. The treated group received a mixture of budesonide and surfactant every 8 hours, while the control group received only surfactant.

- **Results**: The physical growth and neurological examinations were comparable between the groups at follow-up. Infants in the group treated with budesonide tended to have higher PDI and MDI scores than those in the control group (79 ± 20 vs. 74 ± 18 and 80 ± 19 vs. 75 ± 20, respectively), but these differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment was 31% (11 infants) in the treated group and 40% (13 infants) in the control group (P = 0.367).

- **Conclusions**: Early intratracheal instillation of budesonide using surfactant as a vehicle significantly improved pulmonary outcomes without causing long-term adverse effects.

### Efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116xmmh2]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler were compared with placebo, budesonide, and formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This was a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study involving 812 adults (mean age 64 years, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36% predicted normal). Patients received two inhalations twice daily of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) 160/4.5 µg (delivered dose), budesonide 200 µg (metered dose), formoterol 4.5 µg, or placebo.

- **Primary variables and results**: Severe exacerbations and FEV1 were the primary variables. Budesonide/formoterol reduced the mean number of severe exacerbations per patient per year by 24% versus placebo and 23% versus formoterol. FEV1 increased by 15% versus placebo and 9% versus budesonide.

- **Peak expiratory flow (PEF)**: Morning PEF improved significantly on day 1 versus placebo and budesonide; after 1 week, morning PEF was improved versus placebo, budesonide, and formoterol. Improvements in morning and evening PEF versus comparators were maintained over 12 months.

- **Other outcomes**: Budesonide/formoterol decreased all symptom scores and the use of reliever beta2-agonists significantly versus placebo and budesonide, and improved HRQL versus placebo.

All treatments were well tolerated. These results suggest a role for budesonide/formoterol in the long-term management of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants [^113hGRey]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a serious and common problem among very low birth weight infants, despite the use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant therapy to decrease the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, corticosteroids have been widely used to treat or prevent CLD. However, the use of systemic steroids has been associated with serious short- and long-term adverse effects. Administration of corticosteroids topically through the respiratory tract might result in beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with fewer undesirable systemic side effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator-dependent preterm neonates with birth weight < 1500 g or gestational age < 32 weeks after two weeks of life for the treatment of evolving CLD.

- **Search strategy**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), EMBASE (1980 - June 2007), CINAHL (1982 - June 2007), reference lists of published trials, and abstracts published in Pediatric Research or electronically on the Pediatric Academic Societies website (1990 - April 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing inhaled versus systemic corticosteroid therapy (irrespective of the dose and duration of therapy) starting after the first two weeks of life in ventilator-dependent, very low birth weight preterm infants.

### The impact of combined administration of surfactant and intratracheal budesonide compared to surfactant alone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality rate in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome: a single-blind randomized clinical trial [^117NmT8v]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Infants exhibiting the common clinical indications of respiratory distress syndrome, such as grunting, retraction of the intercostal, subcostal, and substernal areas, nasal flaring, cyanosis, increased oxygen demand, and a respiratory rate exceeding 60 breaths per minute, along with typical radiological findings of RDS including a diffuse reticulonodular pattern, classic ground-glass appearance in both lungs, and a significant increase in air bronchograms shortly after birth, were categorized based on severity using the Downes scoring system. Infants falling into the Moderate or Severe group were included in the study.

Infants meeting the following criteria were included in the study: gestational age less than 37 weeks, birth weight less than 2500 g, requirement for mechanical ventilation within 4 hours after birth, requirement for FiO2 greater than 30% for infants with a gestational age less than 28 weeks, and greater than 40% for infants with a gestational age above 28 weeks, and being a surfactant prescription candidate with expert doctor's opinion.

Infants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: weight less than 700 g, severe congenital anomalies, fatal cardiopulmonary disease, or other causes of respiratory distress, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, that could be identified through x-ray or echocardiography.

### Symbicort [^113rDVjF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

The selection of budesonide 80 mcg is supported by a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 304 pediatric patients (152 budesonide, 152 placebo) aged 6 to less than 12 years with asthma. Results showed that budesonide 80 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily) provided statistically significantly greater improvement compared to placebo for the primary endpoint: change from baseline to the treatment period average in pre-dose morning PEF, and the key secondary endpoint: change in pre-dose morning FEV1.

The selection of the formoterol dose is supported by a randomized, single-dose, placebo-controlled, active-controlled (Foradil Aerolizer 12 mcg), 5-way cross-over study in which doses of 2.25, 4.5, and 9 mcg formoterol were administered in combination with budesonide in 54 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years with asthma. Results showed a dose response of formoterol compared to placebo for the primary endpoint of FEV1 averaged over 12 hours post-dose, and the 9 mcg group showed numerically similar results compared to the active control.

The confirmatory efficacy study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in which Symbicort 80/4.5 was compared with budesonide pMDI 80 mcg, each administered as 2 inhalations twice daily, in 184 pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years with a documented clinical diagnosis of asthma. At trial entry, the children had a requirement for daily medium-dose range inhaled corticosteroid therapy or fixed combination of inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy, and exhibited symptoms despite treatment.

### Safety profile of budesonide inhalation suspension in the pediatric population: Worldwide experience [^117CfwEY]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

To review the worldwide safety data for budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules) and provide a pediatric tolerability profile, clinical study data were obtained from AstraZeneca safety databases. These databases are also used by the US Food and Drug Administration to support the approval of budesonide inhalation suspension, along with postmarketing surveillance reports from January 1, 1990, through June 30, 2002.

- **Study selection**: Completed parallel-group studies of patients with asthma 18 years and younger.

- **Results**: Safety data for budesonide inhalation suspension were pooled from three US, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (n = 1,018). Data from their open-label extensions (n = 670) were combined with data from a fourth US open-label study (n = 335). Additionally, data for 333 patients 18 years and younger enrolled in five non-US studies were analyzed. No posterior subcapsular cataracts were reported in any study. The frequencies of oropharyngeal events and infection with budesonide inhalation suspension were comparable to those of reference treatments. No increased risk of varicella or upper respiratory tract infection was evident, and budesonide inhalation suspension did not cause significant adrenal suppression in studies assessing this variable. There were small differences in short-term growth velocity between children who received budesonide inhalation suspension and those who received reference treatment in two of five trials that evaluated this variable. No increased risk of adverse events was apparent from postmarketing data.

### Inhaled corticosteroids use before hospitalization may be protective in children with direct lung injury [^113wSj7L]. Chest Critical Care (2024). Low credibility.

Respiratory illness is the most common reason for both hospitalization and ICU admission in children. Treatment for direct lung injury (DLI) is primarily supportive. Systemic corticosteroids may be used if DLI progresses to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with studies yielding mixed results.

- **Steroids have numerous anti-inflammatory effects**: These include decreasing extravasation of fluid through intracellular junctions, limiting pulmonary edema, inhibiting neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, exerting anti-inflammatory effects via glucocorticoid receptors, and enhancing adrenergic receptors and effect. Studies of systemic corticosteroids in ARDS have shown benefits in oxygenation, lung mechanics, and hemodynamics. However, conflicting results on mortality and clinically relevant outcomes have been noted, possibly due to potential off-target side effects and inconsistencies in timing of initiation.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have a localized and direct site of action for DLI, with minimal systemic absorption. ICS use in DLI may be beneficial prophylactically and in preventing progression to respiratory failure, because drug delivery in later and more severe illness may be variable and may be affected by pulmonary edema and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Studies in animal models suggest that ICSs can attenuate inflammation and improve oxygenation, hemodynamics, and lung mechanics, particularly when ICSs are administered before or early after lung injury. Two retrospective studies in adults suggest that prior ICS use in patients at risk of ARDS may protect against progression to actual ARDS, and this was most evident in patients who received ICSs before hospitalization.

### Budesonide inhalation suspension: a nebulized corticosteroid for persistent asthma [^112RKAUi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines for managing asthma in pediatric patients published by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the management of persistent asthma in infants and young children. When these guidelines were published, pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers were the only delivery devices available for inhaled corticosteroids in the United States. These devices can be difficult for young children to use correctly. Furthermore, no inhaled corticosteroid was approved in the United States for the treatment of children younger than 4 years.

Budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules; AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, Del) was developed to meet the medication delivery needs of infants and young children with persistent asthma. Pulmicort Respules is the first inhaled corticosteroid approved for administration by means of a nebulizer and the only inhaled corticosteroid approved in the United States for infants as young as 12 months. Budesonide has been studied extensively worldwide. In the United States, the tolerability and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension were confirmed in three placebo-controlled multicenter trials. These studies demonstrated that both once- and twice-daily dosing of budesonide inhalation suspension (0.25–1 mg) improved pulmonary function and ameliorated asthma symptoms in infants and young children with persistent asthma. Budesonide inhalation suspension was well tolerated, and the incidences of reported adverse events were similar among trials.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in obstructive airway disease [^114pHVQC]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids play an important role in the management of obstructive airway disease by suppressing airway inflammation, which is central to the pathophysiology of these conditions. In asthma, there is strong clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids in mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and prevent death. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations. They should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation who have persistent symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Although the adverse effects of corticosteroids are less when given via inhalation than when given systemically, these effects are nevertheless important and need to be considered. Newer inhaled corticosteroids with better pharmacologic properties are being developed and will probably be available in the near future.

### Pulmicort flexhaler [^117W3BAJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different Pulmicort dry-powder inhaler, in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day), or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day), to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known.

The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including Pulmicort Flexhaler, should be monitored (e.g. via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that they are particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including Pulmicort Flexhaler, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls their asthma [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Geriatric use**: Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n = 11 treated with Pulmicort Flexhaler) were 65 years of age or older, and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114ZApJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Most individuals aged 18 years and older with uncontrolled, moderate to severe, persistent asthma should not undergo bronchoscopy with thermoplasty (BT) to treat asthma because the benefits are small, the risks are moderate, and the long-term outcomes are uncertain. Some individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have troublesome symptoms may be willing to accept the risks of BT and, therefore, might choose this intervention after shared decision-making with their health care provider. Clinicians should offer the procedure in the setting of a clinical trial or a registry study to enable the collection of long-term data on the use of BT for asthma.

The Expert Panel does not recommend BT for individuals aged 18 years and older as part of routine asthma care, even if these individuals have uncontrolled asthma despite using multicomponent medical therapy, because of the small benefit-to-risk ratio. The risks of BT include asthma exacerbations, hemoptysis, and atelectasis during the treatment period. Recognizing, however, that BT is currently being used, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for its safe use:

- **BT should not be used** in individuals with low lung function (FEV1 that is < 50% or 60% predicted) and life-threatening asthma.

- **BT has not been studied** in individuals younger than age 18 years.

- **In the opinion of the Expert Panel**, when BT is implemented, it should be used in settings that enroll participants in registries, ongoing clinical trials, or studies that track BT's long-term safety and effectiveness.

### Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma [^1162gwBy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) are commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a newer agent with greater potency in in-vitro assays.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of fluticasone to beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles. We contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies for additional studies and searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings (1997 to 2003).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials in children and adults comparing fluticasone to either beclomethasone or budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer extracted data. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using RevMan analyses 1.0.1.

- **Main results**: 48 studies (11,479 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was variable. When compared at a FP:BUD/BDP dose ratio of 1:2, fluticasone produced a significantly greater FEV1 (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 0.11 litres, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.20 litres), morning PEF (WMD 13 L/min, 95% CI 5 to 22 L/min), and evening PEF (WMD 11 L/min, 95% CI 1 to 20 L/min). This applied to all drug doses, age groups, and delivery devices, although subgroup analyses suggested that the relative benefit of FP may be greater in more severe patients treated with.

### Budesonide ameliorates lung injury induced by large volume ventilation [^112eoNgR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is indispensable for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is required for about 39% of patients in intensive care units. However, MV can damage injured lungs in ARDS patients. Studies have shown that about 24% of ARDS patients treated with MV developed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), resulting in a 40–50% mortality rate. MV with a large volume may lead to alveolar overstretching, increase alveolar-capillary permeability, and cause pulmonary edema and lung focal inflammation. Small tidal volume MV can reduce lung injury and lower the mortality of ARDS; however, ARDS remains a major problem still associated with a mortality rate of 25–45% in intensive care units. Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternative therapies to attenuate VILI.

Studies have shown that the imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of VILI. During VILI, cytokines are released, leucocytes are recruited to the lung, and lung permeability is increased, resulting in lung edema and deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange. Moreover, cytokines released from injured endothelial and epithelial cells can enter the blood and cause systemic inflammation and injury to other organs.

Glucocorticoids can ameliorate VILI. However, the systemic use of glucocorticoids may cause immunosuppression and steroid resistance. In addition, systemic use of glucocorticoids was not found to improve the outcome of ARDS, but instead led to neuromuscular weakness and increased mortality risk.

### Inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic lung disease in ventilated very low birth weight preterm infants [^112bGebR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease (CLD) remains a serious and common problem among very low birth weight infants despite the use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant therapy to decrease the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome. Corticosteroids have been widely used to treat or prevent CLD due to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, the use of systemic steroids has been associated with serious short- and long-term adverse effects. Administration of corticosteroids topically through the respiratory tract might result in beneficial effects on the pulmonary system with fewer undesirable systemic side effects.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effectiveness of inhaled versus systemic corticosteroids administered to ventilator-dependent preterm neonates with birth weight ≤ 1500 grams or gestational age ≤ 32 weeks after two weeks of life for the treatment of evolving CLD.

- **Search strategy**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 - September 2002), EMBASE (1980 - September 2002), CINAHL (1982 - September 2002), reference lists of published trials, and abstracts published in Pediatric Research (1990 - April 2002) from the Society for Pediatric Research/Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing inhaled versus systemic corticosteroid therapy (irrespective of the dose and duration of therapy) starting after the first two weeks of life in ventilator-dependent very.

### Oral fluvoxamine with inhaled budesonide for treatment of early-onset COVID-19: A randomized platform trial [^112dKSrG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study TOGETHER (fluvoxamine plus inhaled budesonide) was published by Gilmar Reis and colleagues in 2023 in the journal *Annals of Internal Medicine*. This study is related to COVID-19 infection.

In the TOGETHER (fluvoxamine plus inhaled budesonide) study, the trial question was: what is the role of oral fluvoxamine plus inhaled budesonide in high-risk outpatients with early COVID-19? The study employed a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and involved 1,476 patients, of whom 898 were female and 578 were male.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Symptomatic adult patients with COVID-19 and a known risk factor for progression to severe disease.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Acute respiratory symptoms due to other causes; diagnostic test for negative COVID-19 associated with acute flu symptoms; dyspnea secondary to other acute and chronic respiratory causes or infections.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Fluvoxamine-budesonide group**: An oral dose of fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily plus inhaled budesonide 800 mcg twice daily for 10 days (n = 738).
	- **Placebo group**: Matching placebos (n = 738).

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in emergency setting for COVID-19 for more than 6 hours or hospitalization due to COVID-19 (1.8% vs. 3.7%; RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in health.

### Pulmonary ultrasound-guided management of delayed pulmonary edema secondary to nitric acid fumes inhalation: a case report [^114Wn8Bx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In past clinical work, chest X-ray and CT are routinely used to evaluate pulmonary edema. However, it should not be overlooked that bedside pulmonary ultrasound may be more convenient and accurate in identifying pulmonary edema. In pulmonary ultrasound, if B-lines formed by the interface reflection of the coexistence of gas and liquid can be seen, pulmonary edema can be judged to a certain extent. Relevant data show that when three or more B-lines are observed between the bilateral intercostal spaces, the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing pulmonary edema are much higher than those of physical examination and chest X-ray.

Picano et al. have studied and concluded that performing pulmonary ultrasound exploration on the anterior and lateral chest of the patient allows the total number of B-lines to reflect the degree of pulmonary edema. Based on the observation of this case, the patient's condition continued to worsen in the first two days of the onset, and the lung images of the two CT examinations were similar, suggesting that the progression of the clinical symptoms is not completely synchronized with the CT changes. However, the number of B-lines seen by ultrasound increased. Therefore, in the dynamic evaluation of pulmonary edema, the pulmonary ultrasound examination may be more sensitive in reflecting the changes in the condition than a CT examination, which is worthy of further verification and application in clinical practice.

This case suggests that the use of pulmonary ultrasound technology not only enables a rapid diagnosis but also semi-quantitatively assesses the patient's non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.#

### Budesonide reduces hospital admission rates in preschool children with acute wheezing [^111Qu2oE]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). High credibility.

The object of this study was to determine whether high doses of inhaled budesonide provide additional benefits to a standardized treatment regimen that includes systemic steroids and salbutamol in preschool patients presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute wheezing attacks. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial was conducted in children aged 6 months to 6 years with moderate or severe acute wheezing episodes, as determined based on a pulmonary index score (PIS) of 7–13 points. We compared the addition of budesonide 3mg versus placebo to standard acute asthma treatment, which included salbutamol and a single 1mg/kg dose of methylprednisolone given at the beginning of therapy.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was differences in hospitalization rates within 4 hours. The secondary outcome was the difference in median PIS between treatment groups at 2 hours.

- **Results**: One hundred patients were enrolled. Cumulative hospitalization rates at 120, 180, and 240 minutes were 0.72, 0.62, and 0.58 in the placebo group, and 0.44, 0.30, and 0.24 in the budesonide group. The discharge rate in the budesonide group was significantly higher than the placebo group (log-rank = 12.407, P < 0.001). Expected mean discharge times were 200.4 minutes (95% CI = 185.3–215.5) in the placebo group and 164.4 minutes (95% CI = 149.4–179.4) in the budesonide group. Median (25–75%) PIS at the 120th minute was significantly lower in the budesonide group than the placebo group (5 [4–8] vs. 8 [5–9], respectively, P = 0.006).

Conclusions: The addition of budesonide nebulization may decrease the admission rate of preschool children who have acute wheezing episodes.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of nebulized beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide in severe persistent childhood asthma [^116mbTaE]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Inhaled steroids are recommended for long-term control of asthma, but their use may be limited in young children because of difficulties in using the associated inhaler device. The use of nebulizers may help to overcome this issue without compromising therapeutic efficacy or safety. This 14-week, multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and safety of nebulized corticosteroids in paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 6 years) with severe persistent asthma. Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) 800 microg day(-1) suspension for nebulization and budesonide (BUD) 750 microg day(-1) given by nebulization in a twice-daily regimen, and when used in addition to the usual maintenance therapy, resulted in comparable clinical efficacy across all parameters.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of patients who did not experience any major exacerbation. This was 40.4% and 51.7% in the BDP and BUD groups respectively in the ITT population (P = 0.28), and the mean number of global exacerbations (major plus minor) decreased respectively by -37.5% in the BDP group and -23.3% in the BUD group. Both treatments were also associated with marked reductions in the number of nights with wheezing and the number of days of oral steroid use. Moreover, the two treatment groups had a similar adverse-event incidence and profile. Only 11 adverse events were reported, and no serious adverse events were related to treatment. Urinary cortisol and the time course of height and weight were unaffected by both treatments, and BDP was confirmed to have a neutral impact.
