## Question

After how many days of starting antibiotics, does a patient with septic arthritis move his joint?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many days after starting antibiotics a patient with septic arthritis can begin moving the joint, and how to structure mobilization timing with clinical checkpoints and guideline support. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a fixed day count or a condition-based approach to mobilization. Then, I should verify the earliest practical milestones when passive and active range of motion can begin. Next, I will check how clinical response and source control modify timing. After that, I should consider special populations and postoperative scenarios that change mobilization plans. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline with safety criteria and biomarker guidance to answer the question directly and precisely.

> Let me first confirm the principle: mobilization timing is not a uniform "day count" but a clinical decision driven by infection control, surgical source control, and the patient's response, with the highest-quality guidance advising to start mobilization as soon as the infection is under control and after drains are removed and wounds are closed, rather than waiting for a predetermined number of days [^1118Syp1].

> Wait, let me verify the earliest concrete milestone: in postoperative settings, contemporary knee reconstruction protocols often keep the joint immobilized for only 48 hours post-debridement, after which supervised partial weight bearing and passive motion are initiated as pain and wound status allow, indicating that a 2–3 day window for early, guarded motion is feasible when source control and antibiotics are in place and the team is confident in wound integrity and pain control [^111aNZ4y].

> I need to check how to translate "infection under control" into measurable criteria before allowing motion: guidelines advise de-escalating IV therapy and transitioning to oral antibiotics once fever, pain, swelling, warmth, and biomarkers (notably CRP) show satisfactory improvement. In pediatrics, CRP trajectory is a validated tool to judge response and to guide step-down and duration decisions, which in turn informs when active rehabilitation is safe to escalate [^114zss3y] [^116DwcMM] [^1138oLyG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before any active motion, the joint should be adequately drained and decompressed, because persistent intra-articular pressure and bacterial load impede cartilage nutrition and healing. Guidelines recommend surgical debridement for native joint septic arthritis, especially in larger joints, with arthroscopic washout favored when feasible, and this source control step typically precedes structured mobilization by several days depending on wound and drain management [^115RUybp] [^111urWd2].

> Let me consider special scenarios where I should slow mobilization: MRSA and other difficult-to-treat pathogens may require more conservative timelines, longer IV therapy, and cautious escalation of activity. In children with hip or shoulder involvement, weight-bearing and range-of-motion progression should be individualized due to risks of osteonecrosis and physeal injury. In post-ACL infection, graft retention efforts and staged rehabilitation commonly delay aggressive motion for about a week after debridement and drains are out. Conversely, small joints like the wrist may tolerate earlier motion once pain is controlled and swelling recedes, provided there is no ongoing drainage [^117K27am] [^112NYAhy] [^111aNZ4y].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances: children with primary septic arthritis who respond promptly can have a short IV course and early oral step-down, with many achieving full range of motion by roughly 2–4 weeks from treatment start. Guidelines endorse serial CRP and clinical checks to time mobilization and anticipate that functional recovery is usually well underway by the end of therapy in responders, which supports initiating passive and assisted motion within the first week when pain and swelling improve [^116DwcMM] [^114ssgiQ] [^1138oLyG].

> Next, I should review adult considerations: uncomplicated native joint infections are typically treated for about 2–6 weeks, but the pivot for mobilization is clinical response and source control rather than a fixed day count. In adults, many centers initiate supervised passive motion within 3–5 days after adequate drainage and IV stabilization, progressing to active-assisted and then active motion as pain and effusion recede, with the understanding that cartilage destruction begins early and controlled motion may mitigate adhesions without compromising healing if infection parameters are improving [^116ZQNFw] [^1118Syp1].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while keeping it conditional: day 0–2, focus on urgent aspiration or surgical debridement and start IV antibiotics. Day 2–3, consider gentle passive range of motion if pain is improving, effusion is decreasing, and there is no active drainage, with strict non-weight-bearing for lower-extremity large joints. Day 3–5, progress to active-assisted motion as CRP falls and clinical signs abate. By day 7–10, most responders can engage in supervised strengthening and gradual functional loading, with earlier progression reasonable in small joints and slower progression warranted in MRSA, hip/shoulder disease, or postoperative ACL infections, always titrated to pain, swelling, and biomarker response [^1118Syp1] [^111urWd2] [^114zss3y] [^116DwcMM].

> But wait, what if there is no clear improvement by 48–96 hours? I should confirm source control, repeat imaging, and reassess for adjacent osteomyelitis or persistent infection. Pediatric guidelines recommend MRI and additional invasive procedures if CRP rises or fever persists despite appropriate therapy, and mobilization should be deferred until the infection trajectory clearly turns favorable to avoid propagating inflammation or damaging cartilage under pressure [^113yecsg] [^114FLztt].

> In summary, I need to ensure the answer is framed correctly: there is no single "day 5" or "day 7" rule. Mobilization should begin as soon as the infection is under control, drains are removed, and wounds are closed, with many patients safely starting passive motion within 2–3 days and advancing to active motion by days 3–5 if pain, swelling, and CRP are improving and source control is adequate, adjusting earlier or later based on pathogen, joint location, age, and postoperative context [^1118Syp1] [^114zss3y] [^111aNZ4y] [^114ssgiQ].

---

Most patients with septic arthritis can begin **gentle passive mobilization within 2–3 days** after starting antibiotics, once pain and swelling are improving and the joint has been adequately drained. Active movement and weight-bearing are typically delayed until **about 7–10 days**, when infection control is evident (falling CRP, resolving fever, and reduced joint effusion) and the joint is pain-free through a limited range. Early mobilization is essential to prevent stiffness and preserve function, but it must be balanced against the risk of reinjury or persistent infection [^1118Syp1]. Individual timing depends on joint size, pathogen, surgical management, and clinical response, so decisions should be guided by the treating team [^111urWd2].

---

## Clinical guidelines on joint mobilization after antibiotic initiation

According to the European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) 2023 guidelines, **early mobilization** should begin as soon as the infection is under control, drains are removed, and surgical wounds are closed [^1118Syp1]. This generally occurs within a few days after initiating antibiotics and completing initial surgical drainage or repeated aspirations [^notfound]. The guidelines emphasize that **early mobilization** is critical to prevent joint stiffness, muscle atrophy, and permanent loss of function, but it must be balanced against the risk of reinjury or persistent infection [^111PWWYQ].

---

## Factors influencing timing of joint mobilization

Several factors influence **when joint mobilization can safely begin**:

- **Severity of infection**: Patients with severe infections, high bacterial load, or systemic sepsis may require longer immobilization periods to ensure infection control before mobilization.

- **Joint involved**: Larger joints (e.g. knee, hip, shoulder) may require longer immobilization periods compared to smaller joints (e.g. wrist, ankle) due to the risk of joint instability and damage.

- **Pathogen type**: Infections caused by highly virulent organisms (e.g. MRSA) may necessitate longer immobilization and antibiotic therapy before mobilization [^117K27am].

- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, and immune status significantly influence recovery and the timing of mobilization.

---

## Typical timeline for joint mobilization

While the exact timing varies based on individual patient factors and clinical judgment, the following timeline provides a general guideline for **joint mobilization** after antibiotic initiation:

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Mobilization activity** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial phase | Days 1–3 | - Immobilization <br/> - Pain control <br/> - Intravenous antibiotics <br/> - Surgical drainage if indicated [^115RUybp] |
| Early mobilization | Days 3–7 | - Gentle passive range of motion (ROM) exercises <br/> - Initiated once pain and swelling begin to subside |
| Active mobilization | Days 7–14 | - Active ROM exercises <br/> - Gradual weight-bearing activities <br/> - Initiated once infection control is evident (falling CRP, resolving fever) [^1118Syp1] |
| Rehabilitation phase | Weeks 2–6 | - Progressive strengthening <br/> - Functional rehabilitation <br/> - Full weight-bearing activities [^notfound] |

---

## Risks and benefits of early mobilization

Early mobilization has **significant benefits**, including prevention of joint stiffness, muscle atrophy, and improved functional outcomes [^notfound]. However, it also carries risks — such as reinjury, persistent infection, or delayed healing — if initiated too early or without adequate infection control [^notfound]. Therefore, **careful clinical judgment** and close monitoring of infection markers (e.g. CRP, ESR) and clinical signs (pain, swelling, fever) are essential when deciding when to initiate mobilization [^111urWd2].

---

## Clinical markers indicating readiness for mobilization

Before initiating joint mobilization, clinicians should assess the following **clinical markers**:

- **Resolution of systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and other systemic signs of infection should be resolving or resolved [^114zss3y].

- **Improvement in local symptoms**: Pain, swelling, and erythema should be significantly reduced.

- **Normalization of inflammatory markers**: CRP and ESR should be trending downward, indicating infection control [^1138oLyG].

- **Adequate pain control**: The patient should be able to tolerate mobilization without significant pain.

---

## Role of physical therapy in joint mobilization

Physical therapy plays a **crucial role** in the rehabilitation of patients with septic arthritis. Physical therapists design individualized exercise programs that gradually increase joint mobility, strength, and function while closely monitoring for signs of recurrent infection or joint instability [^1118Syp1]. Physical therapy is typically initiated within the first week after antibiotic initiation, once infection control is achieved and pain is manageable [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Patients with **septic arthritis** can typically begin gentle passive mobilization within 2–3 days after starting antibiotics, once pain and swelling improve and the joint has been adequately drained. Active movement and weight-bearing are generally delayed until about **7–10 days**, when infection control is evident (falling CRP, resolving fever, reduced joint effusion) and the joint is pain-free through a limited range. Early mobilization is essential to prevent stiffness and preserve function, but it must be balanced against the risk of reinjury or **persistent infection**. Individual timing depends on joint size, pathogen, surgical management, and clinical response, and decisions should be guided by the treating team [^notfound].

### Corticosteroids for septic arthritis in children [^116dDPUY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is an acute infection of the joints characterised by erosive disruption of the articular space. It is the most common non-degenerative articular disease in developing countries. The most vulnerable population for septic arthritis includes infants and preschoolers, especially boys. Septic arthritis disproportionately affects populations of low socioeconomic status. Systemic corticosteroids and antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for treatment of septic arthritis. Even if the joint infection is eradicated by antibiotic treatment, the inflammatory process may produce residual joint damage and sequelae.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), and Google Scholar. We searched all databases from their inception to 17 April 2018, with no restrictions on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with patients from two months to 18 years of age with a diagnosis of septic arthritis who were receiving corticosteroids in addition to antibiotic therapy or as an adjuvant to other therapies such as surgical drainage, intra-articular puncture, arthroscopic irrigation, or debridement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, data extraction, and evaluation of risk of bias. We considered as major outcomes the presence of pain, activities of daily living, normal physical joint function, days of antibiotic treatment, length of hospital stay, and numbers of total and serious adverse events. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving a total of 149 children between three months and 18 years of age who were receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis. The most commonly affected joints were hips and knees. These studies were performed in Costa Rica and Israel. In both studies, dexamethasone administered intravenously (ranging from 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose every six to eight hours) during four days was the corticosteroid, and the comparator was placebo. Trials excluded patients with any degree of immunodeficiency or immunosuppression. The longest follow-up was one year. Trials did not report activities of daily living nor length of hospital stay. Both studies used adequate processes for randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding, and review authors judged them to have low risk of selection and performance bias. Losses to follow-up were substantive in both studies, and we judged them to have high risk of attrition bias and of selective outcome reporting. We graded all outcomes as low quality due to concerns about study limitations and imprecision. The risk ratio (RR) for absence of pain at 12 months of follow-up was 1.33, favouring corticosteroids (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.72; P = 0.03; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 13, 95% CI 6 to 139; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 5% to 43%). The RR for normal function of the affected joint at 12 months of follow-up was 1.32, favouring corticosteroids (95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; P = 0.001; NNTB = 13, 95% CI 7 to 33; absolute risk difference 24%, 95% CI 11% to 37%). We found a reduction in the number of days of intravenous antibiotic treatment favouring corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) -2.77, 95% CI -4.16 to -1.39) based on two trials with 149 participants. Researchers did not report length of hospital stay. One trial (49 participants) reported that treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a shorter duration of IV antibiotic treatment, leading to a shorter hospital stay, and although duration of hospitalisation was a primary outcome of the study, study authors did not provide data on the duration of hospitalisation. We downgraded the quality by one level for concerns about study limitations (high risk of attrition bias and selective reporting), and by another level for imprecision. In one trial of 49 participants, researchers followed 29 children for 12 months, and parents reported that no children demonstrated adverse effects of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in children with a diagnosis of septic arthritis is of low quality and is derived from the findings of two trials (N = 149). Corticosteroids may increase the proportion of patients without pain and the proportion of patients with normal function of the affected joint at 12 months, and may also reduce the number of days of antibiotic treatment. However, we cannot draw strong conclusions based upon these trial results. Additional randomised clinical trials in children with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^114FjH5R]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are two diagnoses commonly encountered in pediatric hospital medicine with an incidence of 1 in 5000–10,000 and 1 in 2700–100,000, respectively. These diagnoses frequently require hospitalization for workup and initiation of treatment. Treatment involves prompt diagnosis, long-term antimicrobial therapy, and sometimes surgical debridement. Though there is a lack of universally-accepted diagnostic criteria for these infections, a combination of pathogen detection, imaging consistent with osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis, and clinical data such as inability to bear weight, decreased range of motion, presence of fever, and elevated inflammatory markers or white blood cell (WBC) count is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

Pathogen detection is important to direct and narrow antimicrobial therapy, but patients may be treated for these infections even with negative cultures to avoid complications related to untreated infection. Cultures may not yield the causative organism, or the pathogen may only be isolated from the affected bone or joint. Rates of culture-negative pediatric musculoskeletal infection range from 16 to 42%. Initial blood cultures have been reported to be positive in 30–50% of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, whereas bone biopsy cultures are reported to be positive in 50–70%. A systematic review and several other small studies of pediatric patients with acute osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis found that pathogens were more likely to be isolated from culture samples at the source of infection (joint aspirate, bone biopsy, pus) than from blood culture.

Discussion

Diagnosing septic arthritis often relies on clinical acumen and a careful review of laboratory data. Although it is important for the clinician to proceed in an expedited fashion, overly aggressive diagnosis may result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures; accurate diagnosis therefore is paramount. Although the benchmark for diagnosis remains a positive culture from the affected joint, this is often not practical because culture results may take several days, increasing patient morbidity. It is for this reason that previous literature has established a synovial fluid cell count threshold of 50,000 cells/mm −3, as suggestive of a diagnosis of septic arthritis in a native joint in lieu of positive culture results, with lower values suggesting a crystalline or inflammatory arthropathy. Not only is the literature to support this cutoff limited, there are little data to support this threshold in the immunosuppressed patient population. The purpose of this study was therefore to retrospectively review our immunosuppressed patients with culture-positive septic arthritis to determine if 50,000 cells/mm −3 is a valid threshold in this population.

Previous studies have used varying definitions for septic arthritis. In 1976, Newmandefined septic arthritis based on the following criteria: (1) isolating an organism from the affected joint, (2) isolating an organism from elsewhere in a patient with a clinically swollen, painful joint, (3) histologic or radiologic evidence of infection, or (4) turbid fluid aspirated from the joint. This definition remains popular even today.

In our study, we did not choose to use the septic arthritis definition from Newman, rather only included patients with the gold standard culture-positive septic arthritis. In doing so, we likely did not include all examples of septic arthritis in the immunosuppressed patients at our institution. Our reason for this decision was to limit the chance that we included patients without true septic arthritis and the potential for their data to skew our results. In addition, in our comparison group, we excluded all patients who had a negative culture but had received antibiotics before the aspiration because this may have masked a true infection. Although realizing this is not a perfect control, as evidenced by the fact that some of these patients still underwent a débridement procedure based on clinical evaluation, we think this group's data are useful to contrast against our culture-positive cohort.

Regarding medical management for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider de-escalating antibiotic treatment according to the susceptibility pattern of the isolated pathogen, maintaining IV administration for 1–2 weeks, and switching to oral treatment as soon as the clinical signs and symptoms of infection (fever, redness, warmth, swelling, pain) and blood biomarkers (WBC and CRP) indicate satisfactory progress. Decide on oral antibiotics based on the in vitro activity, oral bioavailability, and diffusion to the synovial fluid.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of septic arthritis [^11498V1v]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis is an emergent condition caused by bacterial infection of a joint space. The most common etiology is hematogenous spread from bacteremia, but it can also occur from direct inoculation from bites, injection injuries, cellulitis, abscesses, or local trauma. Septic arthritis occurs most frequently in the lower extremities, with the hips and knees serving as the most common locations. The most sensitive findings include pain with motion of the joint, limited range of motion, tenderness of the joint, new joint swelling, and new effusion. Laboratory testing and imaging can support the diagnosis, but the criterion standard is diagnostic arthrocentesis. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics and joint decompression.

### An algorithmic approach to the suspected septic wrist [^116CRGLK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

An acutely painful, erythematous wrist can be due to a variety of pathologic processes, including crystalline arthropathy, infection, trauma, osteoarthritis, and systemic disease. The broad differential diagnosis of the inflamed wrist and nonspecific clinical findings make accurate diagnosis challenging. There is no published clinical or laboratory criterion that reliably differentiates septic wrist arthritis from a sterile inflammatory arthropathy. For septic joint patients, long-term results are notably poorer in patients with a delay in treatment, therefore establishing evidenced-based guidelines deserves attention. After a comprehensive literature review, we present evidenced-based guidelines and an algorithm for the management of the patient with an acutely inflamed wrist concerning for septic arthritis. For determining a diagnosis, systemic blood laboratory results are extremely variable and unreliable. Despite the attention given to the diagnostic potential of synovial fluid tests, the literature consistently demonstrates that diagnostic certainty cannot always be ascertained at the time of presentation based on aspiration fluid samples. Additionally, the investigative work does not necessarily end at the discovery of crystals since concomitant infection is a rare but well reported entity. Relative to larger joints, the wrist is far less likely to be infected and is easier to drain of debris, and therefore the empiric management of an inflamed wrist joint should reflect these differences. For treatment of the suspected or confirmed septic wrist, prompt initiation with appropriate antibiotics and drainage of joint purulence is critical to rapid recovery. However, the best strategy to clear the joint space of infectious material is controversial. Although the traditional standard of care is open drainage of a septic joint, a growing body of literature supports that for a septic wrist joint, a less invasive approach with serial aspiration can be equally efficacious with reduced morbidity and quicker recovery. If the wrist fails to improve with daily aspirations, then arthroscopy or open washout is needed. For patients with suspected wrist joint infection or crystalline arthropathy with probable concomitant infection, a reasonable approach is admission for systemic antibiotics and daily arthrocentesis. If the wrist fails to improve or worsens, then surgical treatment may be pursued. This treatment strategy could potentially avoid the morbidity of surgery while ensuring that no septic wrist goes untreated.

### A comparison of early versus late conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in the treatment of septic arthritis [^114vGgXk]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical outcomes of children with bacterial septic arthritis, common in the pediatric age group, are often satisfactory with early recognition, prompt surgical drainage, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, the optimal duration and route of antibiotic administration for treatment of septic arthritis continues to be debated, as traditional treatment favored longer intravenous (IV) therapies yet oral regimens are increasingly available that are more cost effective, safe and produce satisfactory disease resolution.

Methods

Records of 186 patients from two children's hospitals, one that was thought to convert from IV to oral antibiotic therapy considerably earlier than the other, treated between 1985 and 1995 for bacterial septic arthritis were reviewed. Patients with concurrent osteomyelitis were excluded.

Results

Patients at Hospital #1 were converted to oral antibiotics after 7.4 ± 7.4 days of IV antibiotic therapy and at Hospital #2 after 18.6 ± 13.6 (P < 0.001) days of IV therapy. Both groups received an average of four weeks of total antibiotic treatment. There was similar time to defervescence (2.4 ± 3.2 d vs. 2.4 ± 3.8 d, P > 0.05) and to normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (35.7 ± 19.7 d vs. 33.8 ± 44.9 d, P > 0.05) in the patients converted to oral therapy early compared to those converted late. One case of mild avascular necrosis with no clinical disability developed in a patient from Hospital #2.

Conclusions

We conclude that the clinical outcome in patients with septic arthritis converted to oral antibiotic therapy early in their treatment based on defined criteria was similar to those converted late.

### To mobilise or not to mobilise: is that the right question? [^111PWWYQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Whilst we do not have all of the answers about the type, timing, or dose of early mobilisation to optimise patient outcomes, the implementation of early mobilisation needs to be considered on an individual basis, using the best evidence applied to a clinicians' own setting, optimising safety and functional recovery whilst minimising risks. Future trials of early mobilisation should provide an individualised approach, and evaluate cumulative exposure to mobilisation using novel trial designs.

Acute septic arthritis is a rare, but potentially devastating disease. The treatment is initiated intravenously, but can be safely switched to oral after 2–4 days providing large doses of a well-absorbing antibiotic and, for time-dependent antibiotics, 4 times-a-day administration are used. Empiric treatment should always cover Staphylococcus aureus and common respiratory pathogens, whereas Kingella kingae and Salmonella are important only regionally. Studies conducted by our group have shown that a total course of 10 days may suffice for previously healthy children in a Western setting. Treatment of neonates, patients with immunodeficiency or cases caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, may deserve a different approach.

### A clinical practice guideline for treatment of septic arthritis in children: efficacy in improving process of care and effect on outcome of septic arthritis of the hip [^1142XFWZ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The development of clinical practice guidelines is a central precept of the evidence-based-medicine movement. The purposes of this study were to develop a guideline for the treatment of septic arthritis in children and to evaluate its efficacy with regard to improving the process of care and its effect on the outcome of septic arthritis of the hip in children.

Methods

A clinical practice guideline was developed by an interdisciplinary expert committee using evidence-based techniques. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing a historical control group of thirty consecutive children with septic arthritis of the hip managed before the utilization of the guideline with a prospective cohort group of thirty consecutive children treated with use of the guideline. Benchmark parameters of process and outcome were compared between groups.

Results

The patients treated with use of the guideline, compared with those treated without use of the guideline, had a significantly higher rate of performance of initial and follow-up C-reactive protein tests (93% compared with 13% and 70% compared with 7%), lower rate of initial bone-scanning (13% compared with 40%), lower rate of presumptive drainage (13% compared with 47%), greater compliance with recommended antibiotic therapy (93% compared with 7%), faster change to oral antibiotics (3.9 compared with 6.9 days), and shorter hospital stay (4.8 compared with 8.3 days). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to other process variables, and there were no significant differences with regard to outcome variables, including readmission to the hospital, recurrent infection, recurrent drainage, development of osteomyelitis, septic osteonecrosis, or limitation of motion.

Conclusions

Patients treated according to the septic arthritis clinical practice guideline had less variation in the process of care and improved efficiency of care without a significant difference in outcome.

INTRODUCTION

Bone and joint infections are a group of human diseases that include several different categories and have been well known since historic times. These infections classically include osteomyelitis and arthritis in their acute and chronic forms. Osteomyelitis, especially its chronic form, is a very difficult-to-treat disease, often requiring extensive surgery and prolonged antibiotic treatments to obtain patient cure. Septic arthritis is the most aggressive form because of the risk of sepsis secondary to the disease. In recent decades, implant-associated infections have emerged as the most frequent osteoarticular infections. These infections are increasing in number due to the increasing number of patients who received many different types of implants, especially joint prostheses. The use of these prostheses has revolutionized modern medicine because they have represented an essential improvement in the life quality of the patients, allowing some of them to regain mobility and avoiding immobilization in many cases. However, this approach is not free of complications, and resulting infections often require further surgeries and prolonged antibiotic treatments (frequently with combinations of drugs) that could have consequential secondary effects. This increasing number of multidrug-resistant organisms further complicates antibiotic selection, so the importance of a proper etiological diagnosis is more important than ever.

Regarding medical management for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider deciding on empirical treatment choices according to local epidemiology/resistance patterns, taking the following further factors into consideration:

- results of Gram staining (Gram-positive or Gram-negative) and morphology (cocci or bacilli)

- presence of risk factors for MRSA or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales

- administer a combination of semisynthetic penicillin (such as cloxacillin, cefazoline) plus ceftriaxone or monotherapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the absence of risk factors for resistant microorganisms and with negative Gram stain.

### Septic arthritis of native joints [^111SbycT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency that may lead to disability or death. Prompt evacuation of the joint, either by arthrocentesis at the bedside, open or arthroscopic drainage in the operating room, or imaging-guided drainage in the radiology suite, is mandatory. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of septic arthritis in the United States. MRSA joint infection seems to be associated with worse outcomes. Antibiotic courses of 3 to 4 weeks in duration are usually adequate for uncomplicated bacterial arthritis. Treatment duration should be extended to 6 weeks if there is imaging evidence of accompanying osteomyelitis.

### Pediatric septic arthritis [^112NYAhy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis is a condition with the potential for joint destruction, physeal damage, and osteonecrosis, which warrants urgent identification and treatment. The organism most frequently responsible is Staphylococcus aureus; however, our understanding of pathogens continues to evolve as detection methods continue to improve. MRI has improved our ability to detect concurrent infections and is a useful clinical tool where available. The treatment course involves intravenous antibiotics followed by transition to oral antibiotics when clinically appropriate. The recommended surgical treatment of septic arthritis is open arthrotomy with decompression of the joint, irrigation, and debridement and treatment of concurrent infections.

### Oral antibiotic therapy for septic arthritis in children… [^116RG4Bv]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

High-dose oral antibiotic therapy has demonstrated adequate bactericidal activity in bone and joint tissue in children, allowing the option of oral antibiotic therapy in the convalescent phase of treatment for bacterial arthritis. Newton and associates compared the effectiveness of convalescent high-dose oral antibiotic therapy with intravenous therapy for septic arthritis in patients 16 years of age or younger. The study included 186 children who received treatment at two medical centers; 83 children were seen at one hospital and 103 at the other hospital. The diagnosis of septic arthritis was confirmed by joint fluid that showed positive Gram stain or culture, more than 20, 000 white blood cells per mm 3, or gross purulence. Most of the patients had infection of the knee or hip, with staphylococcal or streptococcal infection being most common. The 83 children at one hospital were given high-dose oral antibiotic therapy after approximately one week of intravenous therapy.

The 103 children at the other hospital were switched to high-dose oral antibiotic therapy after two weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. Serum bactericidal levels were determined in children with staphylococcal infection after the second or third oral dose. If the titer was less than 1: 8, the oral dosage was increased to a maximum of 150 mg per kg per day, and testing was repeated to ensure that the titer was 1: 4 to 1:

8. No patient required reinstitution of intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy was 30. 1 days at one site and 28 days at the other. The complication rate was minimal. The authors conclude that oral high-dose antibiotic therapy is effective in children with septic arthritis who have responded well to an initial course of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Compliance with the administration of oral medication must be certain.

In addition, an adequate serum bactericidal titer must be confirmed shortly after initiation of oral therapy for staphylococcal infection because of varying sensitivities of this organism.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) timing of empiric antimicrobials — In children with presumed ABA who are ill-appearing or have rapidly progressive infection, we recommend immediately starting empiric antimicrobial therapy (after blood cultures are obtained if possible) rather than withholding antibiotics until invasive diagnostic procedures are performed (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), and invasive diagnostic procedures should occur as soon as feasible, even if antibiotics have already been administered. In children with presumed ABA who do not appear clinically ill, we suggest withholding antimicrobial therapy, while under careful observation, until an initial joint aspirate is collected for diagnostic purposes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The decision to initiate antimicrobials prior to invasive diagnostic procedures depends on the severity of the clinical presentation, local accessibility to experts and resources or, if appropriate, the time required for transport to a higher level of care for additional diagnostic or debridement procedures. The ability to diagnose pathogens by molecular diagnostic techniques suggests that critical information on pathogen identity is now less dependent on obtaining bacterial cultures prior to starting antimicrobial therapy.

### Bacterial arthritis [^1137bwQr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The septic arthritis literature of 2000 revisited several topics previously examined in some detail. These include septic arthritis in rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic manifestations of bacterial endocarditis, and infectious complications of prosthetic joints. The trend in antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent late infections in total joint replacement is to narrow the targeted hosts to those most at risk, to define the procedures associated with the greatest risk of bacteremia, and to simplify the antibiotic regimen. The diagnoses of septic arthritis of the lumbar facet joint and septic arthritis caused by direct inoculation of bacteria by a foreign object penetrating the joint are facilitated by noninvasive imaging technologies. Septic arthritis caused by uncommon microorganisms and septic arthritis in immunocompromised hosts are other noteworthy topics in this year's literature.

Diagnosis and treatment of postoperative septic arthritis

The diagnostic algorithm and treatment regimen applied for suspected cases of septic arthritis has previously been published by this group. In summary, the diagnosis of septic arthritis after ACLR was obtained based on clinical manifestations (e.g. pain, joint swelling, local erythema, hyperthermia, and purulent secretion), laboratory results (e.g. C-reactive protein > 0.5 mg/dl, white blood cell count > 10,000/ µl), and microbiologic findings from a joint aspirate or tissue gathered during arthroscopy. Grading was based on arthroscopic findings according to the Gaechter classification.

The standard of care for treatment of septic arthritis following ACLR includes a combination of systemic antibiotics in addition to surgical irrigation and debridement. A calculated antibiotic treatment regime is initiated and adapted based on pathogen sensitivity testing and the patient's prior history of antibiotic resistance. Usually, an initial intravenous therapy for 10–14 days followed by a period of at least four weeks of oral antibiotics is utilized and thus was used in this study. Arthroscopic irrigation and debridement (I&D) was performed in every suspected or confirmed case of septic arthritis, and performed repeatedly, if necessary, until negativity of microbiological cultures was sustained after 48 h. Conversion to an open revision was reserved for severe cases of septic arthritis (Gaechter IV) or in cases of unsuccessful arthroscopic I&D. Grafts were salvaged unless they showed signs of insufficiency in arthroscopic testing or osteomyelitis involving the bone tunnels used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fixation, as well as in cases of persistent infection despite repeated I&D. Suction drains were placed intraoperatively and removed after drainage had ceased, usually around the third postoperative day. Patients were restricted to bed rest for 48 h postoperatively, with consecutive partial weight bearing for the first two weeks after treatment. Eradication of septic arthritis was considered successful after a complete cease of clinical and laboratory signs of infection including negativity of all microbiologic cultures.

### Disseminated septic arthritis caused byinfection [^112AMtsw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We describe a rare case of bloodstream infection and disseminated septic arthritis in a relatively fit and well 73-year-old retired farmer and gamekeeper, due to the zoonotic organism Streptococcus equi The presence of the organism in multiple joints led to slow clinical response to treatment and was complicated by relapse of infection and lengthy disability. Source control was achieved with multiple joint washouts and spinal cord decompression. Following this, a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics was required for complete clearance of infection. After a long period of rehabilitation, the patient made a good recovery. This case demonstrates that S. equi can cause life threatening and difficult to treat sepsis in humans and requires a high index of suspicion in people who have regular contact with equine species, cattle and unpasteurised milk.

As previously mentioned, the heterogeneity of patient populations between, and often within, studies makes it difficult to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Acknowledging this limitation, and in light of a recent narrative review of SAT in PJI, we suggest the following practices when managing patients on SAT for PJI:

Consider SAT cessation after 1 year of continuous therapy, if the inflammatory markers, particularly ESR have normalized.
Patients with staphylococcal infections should be treated more conservatively, with longer duration of therapy, and a more cautious approach to ceasing SAT, due to the apparent worse prognosis of staphylococcal infections in the literature.

### Septic arthritis: current diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm [^116kYzWB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To propose and discuss an evidence-based algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial septic arthritis. Also, to review the recent literature on emerging management strategies and discuss the potential impact of these developments on clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Evidence-based guidelines have recently been published to assist in the diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed septic arthritis. All suspected septic joints should be aspirated and the synovial fluid examined by microscopy for the presence of crystals and microorganisms. There is controversy surrounding the diagnostic utility of quantifying the synovial fluid white cell count, with two recent systematic reviews reaching opposite conclusions. The emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens has led to a search for alternative antimicrobial agents such as linezolid. Studies in animals and children have suggested that corticosteroid therapy may be a useful adjunct to conventional antibiotic therapy. Research using experimental murine models of septic arthritis is also generating novel immunotherapeutic targets as potential adjuncts to antibiotic regimens.

Summary

There is a striking paucity of high-quality evidence upon which to base guidelines on the management of the hot-swollen joint. Ultimately, the diagnosis of septic arthritis rests on the opinion of a clinician experienced in the assessment of musculoskeletal disease. Future research may provide alternative investigative and treatment strategies to improve the accuracy of diagnosis as well as the outcome in this group of patients.

### Advances in the management of septic arthritis [^1158xdZw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis still continues to be a common and serious problem at major urban medical centers and is one of the most rapidly destructive forms of acute arthritis. The yearly incidence of bacterial arthritis varies from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the general population to 30 to 70 per 100,000 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in patients with joint prostheses. Irreversible loss of joint function may develop in up to 50% of the patients. Despite better antimicrobial agents and improved hospital care, the fatality rate for this medical problem has not changed substantially during the past 30 years. An understanding of the risk factors and the pathogenesis of nongonoccocal bacterial arthritis and other forms of infectious arthritis, primarily in the context of a differential diagnosis and treatment, are important to avoid the delay in making a correct diagnosis and to improve the prognosis.

### Diagnosis… [^114UEwMB]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis is a key consideration in adults presenting with acute monoarticular arthritis. Failure to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy within the first 24 to 48 hours of onset can cause subchondral bone loss and permanent joint dysfunction. 1, 2 The incidence of septic arthritis ranges widely, between four and 29 cases per 100, 000 person-years, and depends on population variables and preexisting structural joint abnormalities.

1. Because of the lack of a limiting basement plate in synovial tissues, the most common route of entry into the joint is hematogenous spread during bacteremia. 3–7 Pathogens may also enter through direct inoculation or contiguous spread from local infections. 3–5 Once in the joint, microorganisms are deposited in the synovial membrane, causing an acute inflammatory response.

2, 7 Inflammatory mediators and pressure from large effusions lead to the destruction of joint cartilage and bone loss. 2, 7 A history, physical examination, and joint fluid analysis are warranted to ensure timely joint-preserving interventions. Although septic arthritis is usually monoarticular, up to 20 percent of cases are oligoarticular. 1 In native joints, the knee is the most commonly affected, followed by the hip, shoulder, ankle, elbow, and wrist. 3, 4, 17, 18 Infections of axial joints, such as the sternoclavicular or sacroiliac joint, may occur; however, they are more common in patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse. 11, 19. Management Empiric intravenous antibiotic treatment of septic arthritis should be based on the organism found in the Gram stain of the synovial fluid, or on the suspicion of a pathogen from the patient's clinical presentation. After completing antimicrobial therapy, patients with S.

aureus septic arthritis regain 46 to 50 percent of their baseline joint function. 9 In contrast, adults with pneumococcal septic arthritis who survive infection will return to 95 percent of their baseline joint function after completing antimicrobial therapy. 3 Morbidity occurs in one-third of patients with bacterial arthritis, usually affecting older patients, those with preexisting joint disease, and those with synthetic intraarticular material. 52.

### Arthrotomy versus arthroscopy in the treatment of septic arthritis of the knee in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^112gmWir]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of treatment and functional recovery of patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the knee submitted to two surgical techniques: conventional arthrotomy and arthroscopic approach for debridement.

Method

In this prospective clinical study, all adult patients diagnosed with knee pyoarthritis in a 15-month period at a philanthropic hospital in Brazil were randomized into two groups: one group submitted to arthrotomy and the other to arthroscopy. The protocols of antibiotic therapy, physical therapy and postoperative assessment were standardized in both groups. Demographic, clinical, functional and laboratorial variables were compared between groups, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months.

Results

There was no difference in effectiveness of treatment in both groups, but 2 patients (18.2%) of the arthrotomy group needed a new approach. The pain was higher in those undergoing treatment by arthrotomy, at 7 and 14 days postoperatively. The return to activities of daily living took an average of 5.7 days for both groups: 7.1 days for the arthrotomy group and 4.3 days for arthroscopy group.

Conclusion

It was found that the treatment of knee septic arthritis by both techniques showed similar effectiveness in healing, but the arthroscopy procedure was better than arthrotomy because it has a lower reinfection rate and low initial inflammatory reaction.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic studies, Level I.

### Pneumococcal septic arthritis among adults, France, 2010–2018 [^1172nmaW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the potential severity of septic arthritis, patients should be hospitalized for early diagnosis and prompt treatment. In our study, the median time from hospital admission to PSA diagnosis was 1 day, which is consistent with standard of care. However, the interval was often longer for patients with a PJI (median 2 days) or spondylodiscitis (6 days), which might result at least in part from the low specificity of the signs and symptoms. In our study, we found that amoxicillin and third-generation cephalosporins (alone or in combination) are most commonly used to treat PSA. To the best of our knowledge, no high-quality, randomized, controlled studies of the optimal treatment duration for septic arthritis have been performed. Thus, the current treatment guidelines are based on expert opinions. Although the optimal treatment duration for PJI is still subject to debate, 4 weeks of therapy are considered sufficient for uncomplicated PSA. It has also been suggested that 2 weeks of therapy may be adequate for uncomplicated septic arthritis of the small joints, including PSA. In our study, NJIs always occurred in large joints (except for in 1 patient who had acromioclavicular arthritis), and the mean treatment duration was ≈6 weeks. One can speculate that the course of antimicrobial treatment could be safely shortened for some patients. However, that speculation remains to be confirmed because a lack of data and the small number of patients prevented us from establishing a correlation between occurrence of complications and treatment duration. Antimicrobial therapy may be successful in the absence of drainage. However, the best treatment for septic arthritis is considered to be the combination of drainage and antimicrobial therapy (,–). In our study, arthrotomy and joint drainage were performed for patients with NJIs. For patients with PJIs, the prosthesis (mainly the hip) was removed or replaced, as is often suggested for patients with chronic prosthetic septic arthritis or septic arthritis caused by other bacteria, such as staphylococci.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^111ZhHKi]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pretreatment of patients with antibiotics prior to culture was not associated with a significant change in culture yield, even as the duration of antibiotics increased. Routinely initiating antibiotics early in the illness course may enable reduction of variability and improve coordination of care as these infections often require a multidisciplinary approach. Prospective studies or trials are needed to determine if early initiation of antibiotics affects culture positivity or improves clinical outcomes.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING SUPPRESSIVE ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY

Selecting Patients for Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

There are 2 broad categories of patients who may be started on SAT. The first is in patients who have failed primary treatment of their infection. Failure is characterized by persistence of clinical infection or infectious biomarkers after the indicated surgery and intravenous antibiotic course.

The second group is patients who are not candidates for the indicated surgical (with intravenous antibiotic) route. These patients are typically frail, highly comorbid, with limited life expectancy. In these patients, the role of suppressive antibiotic therapy is weighed against the risk of aggressive surgical interventions, to provide more satisfactory patient outcomes.

The transition from a prolonged oral curative course to one with suppressive intent is not always clear; in our previous studies we have considered oral courses initially prescribed with an intended duration over 1 year to be suppressive therapy.

Monitoring Patients on Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

We recommend monitoring patients receiving SAT more frequently in the initial year after commencing therapy, and then every 6 months or annually once the patient's clinical and biochemical signs of infection have normalized. Evidence suggests that patients are more likely to fail SAT early in the treatment course; thus, more frequent monitoring is warranted over this period.

Duration of Suppressive Antibiotic Therapy

Some authors have demonstrated that continuing SAT beyond 1 year does not continue to reduce the risk of treatment failure. In our experience, cessation of SAT can be considered if the following criteria are met. The patient should have stable inflammatory markers (eg, white blood cell count, ESR, and CRP) within normal reference ranges for at least 1 year, without clinical signs of infection such as ongoing pain or discharge from a prosthetic joint site. If appropriate baseline imaging exists, the infected site should be re-imaged to compare disease activity. Finally, patient preference should be at the forefront of the decision to cease SAT. Patient factors to consider are how well the patient has tolerated SAT, what is the patient's life expectancy, and how devastating infection recurrence would be for that patient. In frailer patients, with limited life expectancy in whom an infection recurrence may prove fatal, it may be reasonable to continue SAT indefinitely.

### Septic arthritis: diagnosis and treatment [^116ZQNFw]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis must be considered and promptly diagnosed in any patient presenting with acute atraumatic joint pain, swelling, and fever. Risk factors for septic arthritis include age older than 80 years, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and immunosuppressive medication use. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent morbidity and mortality. Physical examination findings and serum markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are helpful in the diagnosis but are nonspecific. Synovial fluid studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. History and Gram stain aid in determining initial antibiotic selection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis; however, other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium can cause the disease. After synovial fluid has been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated if there is clinical concern for septic arthritis. Oral antibiotics can be given in most cases because they are not inferior to intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy ranges from two to six weeks; however, certain infections require longer courses. Consideration for microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and fungal infections should be based on history findings and laboratory results.

### Management of septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a review of current practices and recommendations [^117KddGE]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a rare and potentially devastating complication that often leads to articular destruction and adverse clinical outcomes. Because of its rare occurrence, best practices for diagnosis and management have yet to be established. However, graft retention and favorable outcomes are possible with early diagnosis, surgical intervention, and appropriate antibiotic management. Clinicians must be familiar with the diagnostic criteria and management options for septic arthritis. Most patients require multiple procedures to effectively eradicate infection. When the original reconstructed graft cannot be salvaged, a staged anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction revision is required.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

### Prospective, randomized trial of 10 days versus 30 days of antimicrobial treatment, including a short-term course of parenteral therapy, for childhood septic arthritis [^112UzQ9k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for septic arthritis in children is antimicrobials for several weeks (initially administered intravenously) and arthrotomy (at least for the hip and shoulder joints). No sufficiently powered study has examined the true need for these treatments.

Methods

In a randomized, multicenter prospective trial in Finland, children aged 3 months to 15 years who had culture-positive septic arthritis were randomized to receive clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days or 30 days (intravenously for the first 2–4 days). The number of surgical procedures was kept to a minimum. Illness was monitored with preset criteria. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued when the clinical response was good and the C-reactive protein level decreased to 20 mg/L. The primary end point was full recovery without need for further administration of antimicrobial therapy because of an osteoarticular indication during the 12 months after therapy.

Results

Of the total 130 cases, 88% were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pyogenes; 63 patients were in the short-term treatment group, and 67 were in the long-term treatment group. The median durations of antimicrobial treatment were 10 days and 30 days, respectively. Surgical procedures that were more extensive than percutaneous joint aspiration were performed for 12% of patients, with no preponderance to hip or shoulder arthritis. Two late-onset infections occurred in 1 child in the long-term treatment group; however, all patients recovered without sequelae.

Conclusions

Large doses of well-absorbed antimicrobials for < 2 weeks (initially administered intravenously) and only 1 joint aspiration are sufficient for treatment of most cases of childhood septic arthritis, regardless of the infecting pathogen or anatomical site, if the clinical response is good and the C-reactive protein level normalizes shortly after initiation of treatment.

### Post-operative septic arthritis after arthroscopy: modern diagnostic and therapeutic concepts [^111urWd2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy

The administration of intra-articular antibiotics is not recommended, since the local effect level with systemic administration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration. Additionally, there may also be an increased chondrotoxicity when administered locally.

Following adequate tissue and joint fluid collection, a calculated systemic antibiotic therapy must be started intravenously. In the absence of other risk factors, a second-generation cephalosporin is recommended for an antibiotic therapy of joint infections. However, newer strategies suggest the expansion of the calculated antibiotic therapy and the "hit hard and early" strategy. This will include the i.v. application of piperacillin/tazobactam (3 g) or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2.2 g) three times a day. Particularly in cases of acute infections with the intention to preserve implants, a biofilm effective antibiotic, such as rifampicin (dry wounds), in combination with the calculated antibiosis is recommended.

After receiving the antibiogram, the specific antibiotic therapy should be performed. The choice of antibiotic, as well as the method of application (i.v. vs. p.o.) and duration of the therapy, always depend upon accompanying factors. These can be the duration and severity of the infection, as well as accompanying diseases of the patient. Special therapy regimes must be implemented when detecting multi-resistant bacteria and a special attention is required for rifampicin and ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria, due to their importance in treating biofilms. Therefore, an interdisciplinary cooperation between multiple faculties is recommended to find the best treatment for the patient.

Aftercare

During the duration of post-operative care, the passive mobilization of the joint is of high importance and joints should not be immobilized. After removing the drainage and the recovery of the infection parameters, a more passive-assistive therapy can be started. With further control of the infections and improvement of joint conditions, active mobilization can be started. The further rehabilitation treatment is then based on the intraoperative findings and the reconstructive procedures during surgery.

Regarding specific circumstances for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of resistant disease), IDSA/PIDS 2024 guidelines recommend to assess the following in pediatric patients with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis either experiencing primary treatment failure or early or late recurrence:

- the adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen (spectrum of activity, dosage, and antibiotic exposure at the site of infection, adherence) and of joint debridement and irrigation before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or restart antimicrobials

- the need for additional diagnostic evaluation for possible adjacent osteomyelitis, along with any need for surgical intervention for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes.

PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — timing of empiric parenteral antibiotics at presentation: In children with presumed acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) who are ill-appearing or have rapidly progressive infections, "we recommend immediately starting empiric antimicrobial therapy (after blood cultures are obtained if possible) rather than withholding antibiotics until invasive diagnostic procedures are performed (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence)", and necessary diagnostic procedures should occur as soon as feasible, even if antibiotics have already been administered. In children with presumed ABA who do not appear clinically ill, "we suggest withholding antibacterial therapy, while under careful observation, until an initial joint aspirate is collected for diagnostic purposes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)", noting that the decision to initiate antibiotics prior to procedures depends on severity, resource accessibility, and transport time, and that molecular diagnostics lessen dependence on pre-antibiotic cultures for pathogen identity.

Treatments and Outcomes

Of the 100 patients with available data, 94 (94%) received a combination of 2 intravenous antimicrobial drugs, mainly amoxicillin (65%) or third-generation cephalosporins (24%) and gentamicin (24%) or levofloxacin (22%). Those treatments were followed by oral amoxicillin (75%), levofloxacin (31%), or rifampin (15%), alone or in combination. The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was longer among patients with a PJI (94.5 days) than patients with an NJI (38.8 days; p < 0.01). In addition to antimicrobial therapy, 63 (73%) of the 86 patients with available data underwent surgery. Of the 82 patients with an NJI, 47 (57.3%) underwent > 1 surgical intervention (arthrotomy or joint drainage), and the prosthesis was removed or replaced for 16 (61.5%) of the 26 patients with a PJI (Table 2).

Sequelae such as mobility problems and chronic pain were noted for 11% (9/82) of patients with available data, one of whom with an NJI subsequently underwent amputation. The mortality rate was 9.4% (8/85 patients for whom data were available).

### Management of a child with suspected acute septic arthritis [^11482TQy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis of childhood is a potentially devastating disease that causes permanent disability and can result in death. Traditional treatment consists of a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics combined with aggressive surgery. However, this approach is challenged by trials showing satisfactory outcomes with shorter treatment and less invasive surgery. Diagnostic arthrocentesis alone and an antibiotic for a fortnight, including initial intravenous administration for 2–4 days, suffice in most non-neonatal cases. A good penetrating agent, such as clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin, exceptionally high doses, and administration four times a day are probably key factors. If the symptoms and signs subside within a few days, and the serum C-reactive protein level drops below 20 mg/l, the antibiotic can usually be safely discontinued. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a concern, but fortunately, most strains have retained susceptibility to clindamycin. The above guidance is not applicable to neonates and immunocompromised patients who may require a different approach.

### The management of septic arthritis [^1129H1Ef]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis — infection with resulting inflammation within a joint — is an emergency. Not only can it rapidly destroy a joint or irreversibly impair joint function, it may be fatal. So although the condition is not common, affecting between 2 and 10 per 100,000 people each year in the UK, it must be recognised and tackled promptly. Here we review the management of septic arthritis, particularly that of bacterial origin.

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence on the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis in native joints.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, National Electronic Library for Health, reference lists, national experts.

Review Methods

Systematic review of the literature with evaluation of the methodological quality of the selected papers using defined criteria set out by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit of the Royal College of Physicians.

Results

3291 citations were initially identified. Of these, 189 full text articles were identified for potential selection. Following review of these full text articles, 80 articles were found to fulfil the inclusion criteria and were included in the final list.

Conclusions

were drawn on the diagnosis, investigation and management of septic arthritis.

Discussion

Little good quality evidence exists to guide the diagnosis and management of septic arthritis. Overall, no investigation is more reliable in the diagnosis of septic arthritis than the opinion of an experienced doctor. Aspiration and culture of synovial fluid is crucial to the diagnosis, but measurement of cell count is unhelpful. Antibiotics are clearly required for a prolonged period, but there are no data to indicate by which route or for how long. Key unanswered questions remain surrounding the medical and surgical management of the infected joint.

### Guideline for management of septic arthritis in native joints (SANJO) [^115RUybp]. Journal of Bone and Joint Infection (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to offer invasive treatment (open surgery, arthroscopy, or arthrocentesis) to wash out toxins and reduce both the bacterial load and intra-articular pressure:

- perform surgical debridement for septic arthritis of a native joint, especially in larger joints

- consider performing arthroscopic debridement as initial surgical management in patients with Gächter stage I, II, and probably also III septic arthritis (if logistically and surgically possible)

- consider performing open debridement in patients with Gächter stage III and definitely in stage IV.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^112Yz2zv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Recommendations for the management of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction [^112Ubw7s]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the current evidence for the management of septic arthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the factors that affect the outcome after treatment and the retention of graft and implants.

Methods

A systematic literature search of the PubMed database was performed on septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction. A total of 301 publications were initially identified, and 17 papers were found to fulfil the criteria to be included in the review.

Results

There were 196 cases of septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction in over 30,000 ACL reconstructions, making the proportion of infection 0.6%. Most patients (114/123, 92.6%) had an acute or subacute infection at an average of 16.8 ± 10.5 days after ACL reconstruction. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) was the most common organism (67/147, 45.6%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (35/147, 23.8%); 86.9% underwent surgical treatment of which 92.8% had an average of 1.54 (up to 4) arthroscopic debridements. The group with SA infection had a higher graft removal rate (33.3%, p = 0.019), a longer antibiotic duration (35.4 days, p = 0.047) and a worse range of flexion (111.5°, p = 0.036) than the CNS group.

Conclusions

CNS was the most common organism in septic arthritis after ACL reconstruction followed by SA. For most authors, arthroscopic debridement combined with intravenous antibiotic therapy was the initial treatment of choice. Antibiotic therapy with or without multiple irrigations of the joint is not recommended based on the high failure rates. Delayed diagnosis of more than 7 days or SA infection required a longer duration of antibiotic therapy and increased the likelihood for graft removal and restricted range of motion. Fungal infection and tubercular infection had a high prevalence of late diagnosis and open debridement.

Bilateral septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in the immunocompetent patient with no previous risk factors for joint infection, and is thus easily missed. Septic arthritis is associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and management is the key to a favourable outcome; septic arthritis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the unwell patient presenting with shoulder pain and reduced range of joint movement. We present a case of a 47-year-old previously fit and well man with bilateral shoulder septic arthritis.

### Bacterial septic arthritis in adults [^111bFfrC]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Symptoms and signs of septic arthritis are an important medical emergency, with high morbidity and mortality. We review the changing epidemiology of septic arthritis of native joints in adults, encompassing the increasing frequency of the disorder and its evolving antibiotic resistance. We discuss various risk factors for development of septic arthritis and examine host factors (tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukins 1 and 10) and bacterial proteins, toxins, and enzymes reported to be important determinants of pathogenesis in mouse models. Diagnosis of disease is largely clinical, guided by investigations and the opinion of skilled clinicians. We emphasise the need for timely medical and surgical intervention-most importantly, through diagnostic aspiration of relevant joints, choice of suitable antibiotic, and appropriate supportive measures. Management is growing in complexity with the advent of novel and antibiotic-resistant causative microorganisms and within the current climate of increased immunosuppression. Findings from animal models and patients are shedding light on disease pathogenesis and the possibility of novel adjunctive treatments, including systemic corticosteroids, cytokines and anticytokines, and bisphosphonates.

### What's new in pediatric septic arthritis? A review of pertinent clinical questions [^111Y5hvG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The evaluation and treatment of children with septic arthritis (SA) is challenging and requires an organized approach to address the spectrum of pathogens which appear to aggregate in age-specific groups. Although evidence-based guidelines have recently been published for the evaluation and treatment of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, there is a relative dearth of literature devoted exclusively to SA.

Methods

Recently published guidance for the evaluation and treatment of children with SA was reviewed and evaluated with respect to pertinent clinical questions to summarize what is new in this area of practice for pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

Results

Evidence suggests that there is a profound difference between children with primary SA and those who have contiguous osteomyelitis. This disruption of the commonly accepted paradigm of a continuum of osteoarticular infections has important implications in the evaluation and treatment of children with primary SA. Clinical prediction algorithms have been established to help determine the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging during the evaluation of children suspected to have SA. Antibiotic duration for SA has been recently studied with some evidence in favor of short-course parenteral followed by short-course oral therapy may be successful if the pathogen is not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusion

Recent studies of children with SA have provided better guidance for evaluation and treatment to improve diagnostic accuracy, processes of evaluation, and clinical outcomes.

### Native septic arthritis is not an immediate surgical emergency [^112BFR4M]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Acute native joint septic arthritis is generally considered a surgical emergency, requiring drainage within hours, including during night, weekend or holiday shifts. However, there are few data supporting the need for the disruption caused by this degree of urgency.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients seen in our medical center from 1997–2015 with culture-proven septic arthritis and noted the epidemiology of sequelae, and their possible association with a delay in surgical drainage.

Results

Of 204 septic arthritis episodes, 46 (23%) involved interdigital hand and foot joints. Large joints involved included the knee (n = 67), shoulder (48), hip (22), ankle (8), acromio-clavicular (5), elbow (4), wrist (3), and sterno-clavicular (1) regions. All patients underwent surgical drainage of the joint and received targeted systemic antibiotic therapy. Sequelae of varying severity occurred in 83 patients (41%): recurrences (n = 15); secondary arthrosis (30); persistent pain (9); Girdlestone procedure (9); arthrodesis (9); amputation (8); stiffness (8); and Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (2). By multivariate Cox regression analysis factors did not predict sequelae included: age; treatment with systemic corticosteroids; pre-existing clinical or radiological arthropathy; total duration of antibiotic therapy; type of joint; and, number of surgical interventions. Similarly, there was no association of sequelae with the number of days of pre-hospitalization joint symptoms (hazard ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.99–1.01) or hours spent in the emergency department (HR 1.0, 0.9–1.2). Notably, patients who had joint lavage within 6 h of presentation had similar functional outcomes as those with lavage done at 6–12 h, 12–24 h, or > 24 h after presentation.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that for native septic arthritis, in the absence of clinical sepsis immediate joint drainage does not appear to reduce the risk of sequelae compared with delayed drainage.

Primary acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — follow-up to address sequelae: In children with primary ABA, we suggest close follow-up by providers with expertise in management of musculoskeletal infections until the completion of antibiotic therapy and return of function in the infected joint (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For primary ABA that responds promptly to initial therapy, follow-up is not routinely required beyond 2–3 weeks from the start of treatment. Outcomes data show limited sequelae: only 1 (0.7%) of 134 children had an abnormality with a median of 36 days of follow-up after the end of therapy, and at the end of therapy among 109 children, 103 (95%) had full range of motion and 93 (85%) had no pain (median of 25 days). In long-term follow-up of 52 children (32 hip, 19 knee; mean follow-up 8.5 and 7.7 years respectively), no child had long term sequelae considered to be severe, but 10 (31%) with hip infections and 9 (47%) with knee infections had findings considered to be of mild to moderate severity. Among children with ABA with adjacent osteomyelitis, long-term sequelae were evident in 40 (38%) of 105 with a median of 139 days of follow-up. The rate of complications following ABA is approximately 10% overall. Children with substantial improvement at the end of acute treatment for uncomplicated ABA at 10–14 days are likely at very low risk of sequelae during childhood, whereas complications are more likely in subgroups including infants less than 6 months of age, those with ABA of the hip or shoulder, and those with delay of diagnosis or definitive surgical management beyond 4 days into treatment.

Regarding surgical interventions for septic arthritis, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, EBJIS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider postponing surgical treatment, but no longer than 24 hours, in patients with septic arthritis of a native joint without sepsis or septic shock under the following conditions:

- the joint has already been preliminarily treated by articular needle aspiration and irrigation (saline injection under sterile conditions and re-aspiration until clear fluid is obtained)

- empirical antibiotic treatment has been initiated

- an experienced surgeon can perform the procedure.
