## Question

No other symptoms though

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach a situation where a patient reports "no other symptoms", and how to interpret and act on that information. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "no other symptoms" actually means and how to verify it. Then, I should review the diagnostic value of symptom absence versus presence and the risk of anchoring bias. Next, I will consider red flags that mandate action despite minimal symptoms. After that, I need to outline a structured approach to history, examination, and testing. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and provide concrete next steps tailored to common scenarios where "no other symptoms" is often asserted, such as chest pain, headache, and abdominal complaints.

> Let me first confirm what "no other symptoms" truly represents, because patients often underreport or forget symptoms, and clinicians may not elicit them effectively. I should double-check by using a systematic review of systems and clarifying exactly what the patient means by "symptom", since vague complaints lose discriminative power and can degrade diagnostic reasoning if not translated into precise medical terms [^1139kQ6b] [^115x9PX9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the diagnostic value of symptom absence. I need to check whether the absence of associated symptoms meaningfully lowers the likelihood of disease, and the evidence shows that absence of typical features often does not reliably rule out serious conditions, for example dysuria and incontinence absence does not exclude UTI in older adults, and the absence of the classic triad does not exclude pheochromocytoma, so I should be cautious about using "no other symptoms" to lower pretest probability too much [^113r1RCg].

> Wait, let me verify the risk of anchoring on "no other symptoms". It can prematurely close the diagnostic loop and lead to missed serious disease, so I should actively counter anchoring by maintaining a broad differential, considering diagnoses of exclusion only when appropriate, and remembering that many patients ultimately leave without a definitive organic diagnosis, which underscores the need for careful follow-up rather than premature reassurance [^114gPPDx] [^113MW8U1].

> I will now examine red flags that mandate action even when the patient reports minimal symptoms. Let me think about features like exertional chest pain, focal neurologic deficits, abnormal vital signs, weight loss, or objective abnormalities on exam or testing, because these can signal high-risk disease even in the absence of a rich symptom complex, and guideline-based pathways often hinge on such features rather than symptom count alone [^114N3xxx] [^1136nf6u].

> Next, I should review a structured approach to history that transforms vague denials into precise data. I need to ensure I characterize the primary complaint with onset, location, quality, severity, timing, and aggravating or relieving factors, then systematically elicit associated symptoms using a checklist to reduce recall bias, clarify what the patient means by "no other symptoms", and document temporal relationships, because history and physical examination contribute the vast majority of diagnostic information in symptom-based encounters [^1139kQ6b].

> Let me consider the physical examination next. I should confirm vitals, targeted organ system findings, and any objective abnormalities that contradict the patient's assertion of "no other symptoms", because subtle signs can pivot the pretest probability substantially, and in some conditions like primary angle-closure disease or radiologically isolated syndrome, patients may be entirely asymptomatic yet harbor clinically significant disease on exam or imaging [^113Zpk4j] [^114iDvpM].

> I need to check the role of testing when symptoms are sparse. Selective testing should be driven by pretest probability, red flags, and time course, and I should remember that repeating or broadening tests without a change in pretest probability can cause harm, so I will align testing with guideline-directed thresholds, for example migraine diagnostic features can obviate neuroimaging in many cases, whereas certain headache features or abnormal neurologic findings lower the threshold for imaging, and in suspected COVID-19, a single NAAT is generally sufficient rather than routine repeat testing absent new symptoms or exposure concerns [^114N3xxx] [^112mfMGv].

> But wait, what if the absence of symptoms reflects a high-risk silent condition? I should double-check for entities like asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, silent ischemia, or early COVID-19, where patients can be infectious or at risk of complications despite minimal symptoms, which means I must integrate epidemiology, risk factors, and objective data rather than relying on symptom denial alone to guide disposition or treatment [^112hDSUH] [^1117Gp1M].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework. If the patient truly has no other symptoms and no red flags, watchful waiting with clear return precautions and reliable follow-up is reasonable, but if red flags are present, I should escalate to targeted testing or referral regardless of symptom count, and if uncertainty persists, I should schedule a short-interval reassessment to catch evolving disease, documenting the rationale for deferring tests to avoid premature closure [^113MW8U1].

> I should confirm that I also address functional and psychosocial contributors when no organic cause is found. Multiple physical symptoms commonly co-occur with mood disorders, and treating depression to remission can improve both psychological and physical symptom outcomes, so I will screen for depression and anxiety, consider somatic symptom disorder when appropriate, and avoid unnecessary procedures that may cause iatrogenic harm while offering evidence-based behavioral therapies [^111oKYzp] [^112B6Jw7].

> Let me reconsider common scenarios to ensure the approach is concrete. For chest pain with "no other symptoms", I should verify exertional features, risk factors, and ECG findings because absence of classic angina equivalents does not exclude ACS, and for headache with "no other symptoms", I should apply POUNDing and neurologic screening to decide on imaging, while for abdominal pain with "no other symptoms", I should maintain a broad differential and avoid anchoring on functional labels too early, using time and safety netting to guide next steps [^114N3xxx] [^114gPPDx].

> In summary, I need to ensure that "no other symptoms" is not the end of the diagnostic conversation but a cue to refine the history, examine carefully, and apply guideline-based thresholds for testing and follow-up, recognizing that symptom absence rarely rules out disease and that disciplined, reference-aware reasoning prevents both missed diagnoses and unnecessary interventions [^1139kQ6b].

The phrase "no other symptoms" means the patient has **only the reported symptom** and no additional complaints such as fever, pain, fatigue, nausea, or neurological changes. This matters because it **narrows the differential** and guides testing and management toward causes that present in isolation [^113vGfCJ]. However, absence of other symptoms **does not exclude serious disease** [^114N3xxx]; some conditions are silent or have subtle early features, so clinicians should still assess risk, perform a focused exam, and order targeted tests as indicated [^1117Gp1M].

---

## Clinical significance of "no other symptoms"

- **Narrowing the differential diagnosis**: Fewer symptoms often point to localized or early disease, such as isolated headache (migraine, tension) [^114N3xxx], isolated cough (upper respiratory infection, mild bronchitis), or isolated rash (contact dermatitis, viral exanthem).

- **Risk stratification**: Absence of systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats) lowers the likelihood of systemic or severe disease but does not eliminate it, especially in early or indolent conditions [^111hoTQ2].

- **Guiding diagnostic testing**: Minimal symptoms may reduce the need for broad testing; clinicians can use focused tests based on the single symptom and risk assessment [^113vGfCJ].

- **Patient reassurance**: Patients may be reassured when no other symptoms are present, but clinicians should explain that absence of other symptoms does not guarantee absence of disease [^112hDSUH].

---

## Conditions that may present with minimal or no other symptoms

Several conditions can present with **minimal or no other symptoms**, including:

| **Condition** | **Example** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Asymptomatic hypertension [^notfound] <br/> - Silent ischemia [^113Zb6X8] <br/> - Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^112hDSUH] |
| Neurological | - Early Parkinson's disease <br/> - Mild cognitive impairment <br/> - Absence seizures [^notfound] |
| Infectious | - Asymptomatic COVID-19 [^1117Gp1M] <br/> - Latent tuberculosis <br/> - Chronic hepatitis B/C |
| Endocrine | - Early diabetes mellitus <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Hyperlipidemia |
| Oncological | - Early-stage cancers (e.g. prostate, breast, colon) <br/> - Indolent lymphomas |
| Psychiatric | - Early depression [^notfound] <br/> - Anxiety disorders <br/> - Somatic symptom disorder [^112B6Jw7] |

---

## Limitations and risks of "no other symptoms"

- **False reassurance**: Serious diseases can initially present with minimal or no other symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis if clinicians rely solely on symptom count [^112hDSUH].

- **Patient underreporting**: Patients may omit symptoms due to poor recall, stoicism, or lack of awareness, especially for subtle or chronic symptoms [^1139kQ6b].

- **Diagnostic error**: Overreliance on absence of other symptoms can cause missed diagnoses; clinicians should integrate history, exam, and risk factors with judicious testing [^114nkNVS].

- **Need for ongoing monitoring**: Even when no other symptoms are present, clinicians should advise follow-up to detect evolving disease [^1142fW2Y].

---

## Clinical approach to patients with "no other symptoms"

A **structured approach** helps balance reassurance with vigilance:

- **Detailed history**: Clarify the primary symptom, onset, duration, severity, and any subtle associated features; use open-ended questions and review systems to uncover overlooked symptoms [^113vGfCJ].

- **Focused physical examination**: Look for subtle signs that may suggest underlying disease (e.g. murmur, lymphadenopathy, skin changes) [^114N3xxx].

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate patient-specific risk factors (age, comorbidities, family history, occupational exposures) to guide testing and follow-up [^1112maUS].

- **Targeted diagnostic testing**: Order tests based on the single symptom, risk factors, and clinical judgment; avoid unnecessary broad panels [^113vGfCJ].

- **Patient education**: Explain the significance of the absence of other symptoms, potential risks, and the importance of follow-up if new symptoms arise [^113MW8U1].

- **Follow-up and monitoring**: Arrange reassessment to detect emerging symptoms or disease progression [^113vGfCJ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Children may have difficulty articulating symptoms; clinicians should use observation, parental input, and age-appropriate questioning [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Older adults may have atypical presentations or underreport symptoms; clinicians should maintain a low threshold for investigation [^notfound].

- **Chronic conditions**: Patients with chronic diseases may adapt to symptoms and underreport new or changing symptoms; regular review and comparison to baseline are essential [^notfound].

---

"No other symptoms" means the patient reports only one complaint, which can help focus the differential but **does not exclude serious disease**. Clinicians should use a structured approach — detailed history, focused exam, risk assessment, and targeted testing — while planning follow-up to catch evolving conditions.

Scenario resolution

Case 1

As the essential hypertension is most commonly seen in middle aged population, the presence of paroxysmal hypertension in a young patient leads us to pathological conditions such as pheochromocytoma. The presence of classic triad of headache, palpitation and sweating raises the clinical suspicion 6 times. The other symptoms (dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea) are not independent. So we cannot simply multiply them to calculate the final LR. By considering the value of signs and symptoms, we decided to move forward in our evaluation. The level of urine catecholamines was increased. Imaging showed a 3 cm mass in left adrenal gland. The patient was referred to surgeon for left adrenalectomy. The pathologist reported chromaffin cells and the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was proved. The attacks of the patient subsided after surgery and the blood pressure became stable during 2 years of follow up.

Case 2

The patient was a known hypertensive patient from 5 years ago on anti-hypertensive drugs. Symptoms of emergent hypertension were asked from the patient (chest pain, blurred vision, hematuria, and headache) and a complete physical exam was done. Then, he was given oral anti-hypertensive drugs and observed for 4 h. He was discharged from the Emergency department and was recommended to visit his family physician. The absence of classic triad and other parts of the history made pheochromocytoma less probable.

American Thoracic Society workshop — symptom definition and assessment assumptions in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients emphasize that a symptom is an individual's dynamic, multidimensional distressing sensory and emotional experience incorporating biological, cognitive, psychosocial, social, and environmental elements, with patient self-report recognized as the gold standard; assessment should be patient-centered and obtained using self-report whenever possible; unless a symptom is assessed as absent, presume the patient is experiencing the most common symptoms reported by patients receiving MV; assessment should be dynamic and adjusted to degree of consciousness, illness severity, underlying conditions, and individual personality or behavioral characteristics or traits; and goals aim to alleviate suffering, reduce illness burden, improve patient comfort, and remove barriers that obstruct meaningful activities.

### Defining success after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse [^113Ar83P]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe pelvic organ prolapse surgical success rates using a variety of definitions with differing requirements for anatomic, symptomatic, or re-treatment outcomes.

Methods

Eighteen different surgical success definitions were evaluated in participants who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy within the Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts trial. The participants' assessments of overall improvement and rating of treatment success were compared between surgical success and failure for each of the definitions studied. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to identify significant differences in outcomes between success and failure.

Results

Treatment success varied widely depending on definition used (19.2–97.2%). Approximately 71% of the participants considered their surgery "very successful", and 85.2% considered themselves "much better" than before surgery. Definitions of success requiring all anatomic support to be proximal to the hymen had the lowest treatment success (19.2–57.6%). Approximately 94% achieved surgical success when it was defined as the absence of prolapse beyond the hymen. Subjective cure (absence of bulge symptoms) occurred in 92.1% while absence of re-treatment occurred in 97.2% of participants. Subjective cure was associated with significant improvements in the patient's assessment of both treatment success and overall improvement, more so than any other definition considered (P < .001 and < .001, respectively). Similarly, the greatest difference in symptom burden and health-related quality of life as measured by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire scores between treatment successes and failures was noted when success was defined as subjective cure (P < .001).

Conclusion

The definition of success substantially affects treatment success rates after pelvic organ prolapse surgery. The absence of vaginal bulge symptoms postoperatively has a significant relationship with a patient's assessment of overall improvement, while anatomic success alone does not.

### Impact of depressive symptoms on worklife expectancy: a longitudinal study on Danish employees [^117AC7Xr]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Depressive symptoms and WLE

Figure 2 shows the sex-specific WLE for the 7762 employees without the ERP scheme, expressed as time in work, unemployment and sickness absence (in years). The WLE is shown by depressive symptom level for age 40–60 years. Table 2 shows the corresponding WLE estimates.

Table 2
WLE in years of employees without the ERP scheme, by depressive symptom level (MDI ≥ 21), sex and age

The WLE results in table 2 show that, for example, a 40-year-old man without depressive symptoms has a total WLE of 21.6 years, of which 19.9 years were in work, 1.3 years in unemployment and 0.7 year in sickness absence. For a woman of the same age with depressive symptoms, the WLE is 2.3 years shorter in work (12%), while the time in unemployment and sickness absence is 0.9 years (69%) and 0.6 year (53%) longer, respectively. Overall, the WLE is on average 5% shorter for women and 1% shorter for men reporting depressive symptoms. When looking at the separate labour market states, women and men with depressive symptoms showed an average shorter time in work of 16% and 13%, respectively. The expected time in unemployment was 60% longer for women and 66% longer for men with depressive symptoms, and the expected time in sickness absence was 58% longer for women and 72% longer for men, respectively. The shorter expected time in work is significant, when comparing the confidence limits of women with and without depressive symptoms for the age of 40 years. For other ages and sex, the confidence limits in table 2 show no significant differences in the expected time in work, unemployment and sickness absence. Overall, the results show a stable tendency of shorter time in work, longer time in unemployment and longer time in sickness absence for all analysed age groups.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112mfMGv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113ZRK5C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination in tinnitus — core elements to document — are specified as follows. "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL". "The characteristics of the tinnitus should be detailed, including laterality and pulsatile nature". "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded". "Symptoms of hearing loss,44 disequilibrium, or other neurologic deficits should be documented". "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus". "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications should be discussed". "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use should be elicited". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties". Finally, "Although most tinnitus patients will have few relevant positive physical findings, the examination should be directed to identifying secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^116ycKh2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive guidance — symptom correlation, monitoring, and site of block: In patients who have second-degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or 2:1 atrioventricular block but with symptoms that do not temporally correspond to the episode of atrioventricular block, it is unclear whether permanent pacing will improve symptoms or alleviate them, and if the symptoms do not correlate with the episodes of first-degree or second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block, a pacemaker would not be indicated; given the procedural and long-term risks of PPMs, for such patients further monitoring and follow up should be implemented. First- and second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular blocks (or 2:1 atrioventricular block, if the level of block is at the atrioventricular node) are typically benign, treatment with a pacemaker are typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect QOL, and occasionally second-degree Mobitz type I atrioventricular block is infranodal, in which instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms; ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful, improvement in atrioventricular conduction suggests the site of block is at the atrioventricular node whereas worsening suggests infranodal block, and if symptoms do not clearly correspond the overall risk-benefit ratio is unfavorable; in patients with long-standing persistent or permanent AF who have a near and appropriate chronotropic response, in the absence of symptoms, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported as a significant driver of COVID-19 outbreaks. Our hospital ward outbreak analysis suggests that comprehensive symptoms and signs assessment, in combination with adequate follow-up, allows a more precise determination of COVID-19 symptoms. Asymptomatic infection was quite uncommon among adults in this setting.

### XsGastrointestinal symptoms are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and mortality and outcomes in COVID-19 [^114r4dUU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GI symptoms are commonly reported among COVID-19 patients. In our study, GI symptoms decreased the risk of COVID-19-related mortality (but not hospitalization) in the total population. This protective effect was found to be highly significant among non-hospitalized patients while not among hospitalized cases. We also observed that further respiratory symptoms increased the risk of mortality among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.

In this study, we found that 26.5% of the patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 reported at least 1 GI symptom. Generally, the results of our investigation demonstrated that having GI symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms (Group 1) decreased the chance of mortality compared to Group 4 (crude odds ratio: 0.80). However, the differences were not statistically significant. Having respiratory symptoms in the absence of GI symptoms increased the chance of mortality compared to Group 4 (crude odds ratio: 1.60) which was statistically significant. And patients with both GI and respiratory symptoms had the highest chance of mortality (crude odds ratio:2.04) and hospitalization (crude odds ratio:2.20).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Alport syndrome, more specifically with respect to hearing assessment, ERA/ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a hearing evaluation at diagnosis or upon reaching adulthood in female patients with X-linked alport syndrome, and then every 5 years in the absence of hearing loss symptoms.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^1144R8ed]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Evaluating Patients in the Absence of Documented SARS Activity Anywhere in the World

In the absence of any documented SARS transmission worldwide, the overall likelihood that a given patient has SARS-CoV infection will be exceedingly low unless there are both typical clinical findings and some accompanying epidemiologic evidence for SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, one approach would be to consider the diagnosis only among patients with both 1) unexplained severe pneumonia and 2) epidemiologic evidence that could suggest SARS, including a link to a cluster of cases of unexplained pneumonia, a history of recent travel (or close contact to an ill traveler) to a previously SARS-affected area, or employment as a healthcare worker with direct patient care responsibilities (Table 2). For persons who are healthcare workers or who have traveled to previously SARS-affected areas, evidence of clustered pneumonia cases would further increase the index of suspicion.

Table 2
Combination of clinical and epidemiologic factors that raise suspicion for SARS among patients with community-acquired illness a

a The possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) should be considered for any patient with both the clinical and epidemiologic features described, depending upon the level of worldwide SARS activity. Final decisions on the need for SARS isolation precautions or testing for SARS-associated coronavirus infection should be made in conjunction with local health authorities. Examples of epidemiologic factors that may raise a higher index of suspicion for SARS, even in the absence of known SARS activity, include clusters of pneumonia among healthcare workers, or exposure to persons with pneumonia while traveling in a previously SARS-affected area. b Previously SARS-affected areas include areas in Southeast Asia in which SARS may originate and neighboring areas that may be at risk for early spread because of importations, including China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. c Healthcare worker defined as one who has direct patient care responsibilities.

In the absence of pneumonia, history of travel to a previously SARS-affected area is likely to have an extremely low positive predictive value for detecting SARS among patients with respiratory illness and, if used as a screening tool, would likely result in an unacceptable burden on the public health system. (U.S. travelers alone make almost 5 million trips to Asia every year, and respiratory symptoms are common among returning travelers.)

Clinicians practicing within previously SARS-affected areas may have to adopt a different approach to detecting SARS among patients with pneumonia, such as requiring both evidence of clustering and a typical combination of laboratory and radiologic findings. Clinical algorithms that use more stringent criteria are being developed and will require further validation.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116uhdf3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

General principles — supportive considerations for nodal atrioventricular block: First‑ and second‑degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) AV blocks (or 2:1 AV block at the AV node) are typically benign in that they do not progress significantly to complete heart block, and treatment with a pacemaker is typically reserved for significant symptoms that affect quality of life (QOL); occasionally second‑degree Mobitz type I block is infranodal and in those instances a pacemaker may be considered even in the absence of symptoms. Although a narrow QRS suggests nodal block, infranodal disease can be revealed during an electrophysiology study (EPS), and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or a treadmill exercise test may be useful to correlate symptoms. If symptoms do not clearly correspond to episodes of AV block, the risks associated with a pacemaker in the absence of clear benefit make the overall risk‑benefit ratio unfavorable; in long‑standing persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) with a low heart rate and appropriate chronotropic response, pacing for rate support is unlikely to be beneficial, and although PPM implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and leads have long‑term management implications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — permanent pacemaker implantation recommendations are as follows: Class I, permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for SND with documented symptomatic bradycardia, including frequent sinus pauses that produce symptoms; is indicated for symptomatic chronotropic incompetence; and is indicated for symptomatic sinus bradycardia that results from required drug therapy for medical conditions. Class IIa, permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for SND with heart rates less than 40 bpm when a clear association between significant symptoms consistent with bradycardia and the actual presence of bradycardia has not been documented, and is reasonable for syncope of unexplained origin when clinically significant abnormalities of sinus node function are discovered or provoked in electrophysiological studies. Class IIb, permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered in minimally symptomatic patients with chronic heart rate less than 40 bpm while awake. Class III, permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for SND in asymptomatic patients, is not indicated for SND in patients for whom the symptoms suggestive of bradycardia have been clearly documented to occur in the absence of bradycardia, and is not indicated for SND with symptomatic bradycardia due to nonessential drug therapy.

### Virginity testing: recommendations for primary care physicians in Europe and north America [^1177xHav]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

In this case, a meeting with the patient and her fiancé was successful, and both partners were satisfied that virginity testing was not necessary.

If the clinician chooses to perform an evaluation and/or provide a certificate, box 2 provides recommendations for how to conduct an evaluation and document clinical findings.

Box 2
Recommendations for evaluation of women requesting 'virginity' testing

Ensure a safe and confidential setting, with adequate time for examination and counselling.
Obtain informed consent; be aware of the regulations related to consent by and on behalf of minors in the country or state where you practice.
Use a professional interpreter (not family), if needed.
Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment (interpersonal or domestic violence, mental health, self-harm, suicide, forced marriage, risk of honor-based killing).
Use the opportunity to obtain a full health history (gynaecological, menstrual, sexual).
Query the woman about her definition of 'virginity', that is, penile-vaginal penetration, digital-vaginal penetration, penile-anal penetration, penile-oral penetration or other.
Ask about vulvar/vaginal/oral/anal/penile/object or digital sexual contact and assess the need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. Women may engage in anal intercourse to avoid 'losing virginity'.
Use the opportunity to discuss sexual health issues such as contraception, STIs and sexuality.
Ask about the woman's knowledge about and expectation of bleeding at first intercourse, and dispel any misconception that if bleeding does not occur, the woman is not a 'virgin'.
Use the opportunity to counsel about respectful, consensual and safe relationships and inquire about sexual and gender identity.
Have a robust referral pathway if the patient needs a mental health evaluation or social services referral.
Use a chaperone to serve as an advocate during the examination.
If necessary, visually and gently inspect the external genitalia. Do not insert a speculum or fingers, unless medically necessary.
Describe only what you see (eg, 'normal external genitalia for age'), do not interpret. Never use the term 'virgin' or 'virginity' to describe physical exam findings.
Confirm, based on her history, her marital status, and sexual history. Note clinical observations, that is, normal external genital anatomy for her age, absence of tearing, abrasions, bruising. Do not mention the hymen, its morphology or analyse its appearance and structure.
Write a summary statement correlating her social status (unmarried) with her medical evaluation. Example summary statement: The patient denies a history of vaginal intercourse and examination reveals normal external genitalia consistent with history and age.
Arrange follow-up with the woman for a few days after the visit to ensure that she is safe, to assess further needs and to answer questions.

### Is this patient clinically depressed? [^116vz5g2]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the general population, but recognition and accurate diagnosis are made difficult by the lack of a simple confirmatory test.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of depression questionnaires and the clinical examination for diagnosing clinical depression.

Data Sources

We searched the English-language literature from 1970 through July 2000 using MEDLINE, a specialized registry of depression trials, and bibliographies of selected articles.

Study Selection

Case-finding studies were included if they used depression questionnaires with easy to average literacy requirements, evaluated at least 100 primary care patients, and compared questionnaire results with accepted diagnostic criteria for major depression. Eleven questionnaires, ranging in length from 1 to 30 questions, were assessed in 28 published studies. Reliability studies for the clinical examination required criterion-based diagnoses made by at least 2 clinicians who interviewed the patient or reviewed a taped examination. Fourteen studies evaluated interrater reliability.

Data Extraction

Pairs of authors independently reviewed articles. For case-finding studies, quality assessment addressed sample size and whether patients were selected consecutively or randomly, the criterion standard was administered and interpreted independently of and blind to the results of the case-finding instrument, and the proportion of persons receiving the criterion standard assessment was less than or more than 50% of those approached for criterion standard assessment. For reliability studies, quality assessment addressed whether key patient characteristics were described, the interviewers collected clinical history independently, and diagnoses were made blinded to other clinicians' evaluations.

Data Synthesis

In case-finding studies, average questionnaire administration times ranged from less than 1 minute to 5 minutes. The median likelihood ratio positive for major depression was 3.3 (range, 2.3–12.2) and the median likelihood ratio negative was 0.19 (range, 0.14–0.35). No significant differences between questionnaires were found. For mental health care professionals using a semistructured interview, agreement was substantial to almost perfect for major depression (kappa = 0.64–0.93). Nonstandardized interviews yielded somewhat lower agreement (kappa = 0.55–0.74). A single study showed that primary care clinicians using a semistructured interview have high agreement with mental health care professionals (kappa = 0.71).

Conclusions

Multiple, practical questionnaires with reasonable performance characteristics are available to help clinicians identify and diagnose patients with major depression. Diagnostic confirmation by mental health care professionals using a clinical interview or by primary care physicians using a semistructured interview can be made with high reliability.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^1169dtwi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Combining Clinical and Epidemiologic Features

Since patients may transmit the virus early in the clinical course, the goal of diagnostic strategies should be to detect patients with SARS as early in the illness as possible to prevent potential transmission. A practical approach to evaluating patients with fever or respiratory symptoms is needed, which requires an assessment of the strength of the evidence of exposure to other SARS-CoV–infected persons. This assessment is directly related to the level of documented SARS activity in the surrounding community and the world.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^113d4q14]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Mental status examination signs of depression — In the mental status examination, signs of depression can include poor eye contact, poor engagement/uncooperativeness, disheveled appearance, downcast faces, tearfulness, psychomotor agitation or retardation, sad mood, angry outbursts, poor frustration tolerance, distractibility, poverty of speech, perseverative or ruminative thought processes, guilt- or self-loathing- or self-blame–laden thought content, and poor insight and judgment. Because these signs are nonspecific to depression and may be absent, they are largely adjunctive to other diagnostic information but should be documented when present.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113r1RCg]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Summary ROC plots

Both urinary incontinence and dysuria were predictors of UTI [+ ve LR: 1.96 (95% CI 1.48–2.60) and + ve LR: 1.70 (95% CI 1.12–2.57), respectively]. Absence of these symptoms did not help to rule out a diagnosis of UTI (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 shows that urinary incontinence and dysuria were quite specific, but not sensitive for UTI.

Summary ROC plots for both urinary frequency and nocturia revealed high heterogeneity and so we did not calculate pooled estimates for these symptoms (See supplementary file 2).

Dumbbell plots

Urinary tract specific symptoms

Estimates for UTI specific symptoms were divided into seven broad categories, with gender specific estimates given when possible (Fig. 3). Much variation was found in the way that symptoms were described by studies. For example, incontinence was defined in six different ways, dysuria in five different ways, and urinary frequency was described in six different ways (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 shows that when both sexes were assessed together, incontinence and a change in the character of urine were found to be predictors of UTI. One of the three estimates for dysuria produced a significant result. In women, of the four estimates for urinary incontinence, only one predicted UTI. This was also true of urinary frequency, where one of four estimates produced a significant result. Of the six estimates for nocturia in women, only one was significant in predicting UTI. None of the eight estimates for dysuria and urgency in women were significant, and absence of these symptoms did not help rule out UTI. Cloudy urine was a significant predictor of UTI in women, but not foul smelling urine or haematuria.

In men, there was only a single estimate for both urinary incontinence and frequency, but both produced significant results. Nocturia was not a predictor of UTI. However, unlike in women, dysuria was helpful in diagnosing UTI. Cloudy urine, foul smelling urine and haematuria were all predictors of UTI in men. Of note, all of the estimates in men came from a single studythat was assessed as low risk against six of the seven QUADAS-2 domains (Fig. 2 b).

### Familial Q fever clustering with variable manifestations imitating infectious and autoimmune disease [^116TCSUx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, can present as an outbreak of acute disease ranging from asymptomatic disease, pneumonia, hepatitis or fever of unknown origin, which can progress to a chronic disease, most frequently endocarditis. The occurrence of Q fever within families is rarely described, and in most cases presents with uniform acute disease manifestations. Here we present a familial cluster of Q fever presenting as highly variable synchronous manifestations in four of five family members, including prolonged fever of unknown origin, asymptomatic carrier state, hepatitis, and chronic endocarditis developing in the absence of previous symptoms. This case series highlights the possibility of Q fever developing in cohabitated individuals with highly variable symptoms masking the common disease etiology. Screening of all exposed individuals, even those not clinically suspected to be infected, may enable to better identify, treat and prevent progression to chronic disease.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^111qm5Tz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^115Y1TTr]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Are existing clinical classifications and divisions of UCTS substantiated?

We assessed whether the diagnostic and descriptive divisions outlined table 4 correspond to substantiable clinical phenotypes or populations, separable by defined clinical criteria, investigation findings or biopsychosocial factors. Our literature review summarised in tables 4 and 5 revealed poor performance and specificity of current symptom-centric, mechanism-centric and disease-centric labels, with considerable overlapping symptom profiles and clinical features across the common diagnostic categories for UCTS. Furthermore, symptoms were found to rarely occur in isolation, despite their division through varying diagnostic concepts. Present taxonomic approaches and related terminology were therefore found to reflect a dualistic, 'all-or-nothing' diagnostic paradigms, which appeared not to recognise the extensive clinical heterogeneity and shared multifactorial biopsychosocial influences. The absence of clear structural pathology diminishes the predictive power of symptom indicators, which, in tandem with variations in clinician approach, specialty perspectives and symptom interpretations, complicates the establishment of uniform assessment and management protocols. Our review has highlighted a consequent divergence in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches across specialties. This may contribute to fragmented care, patient dissatisfaction and anxiety, and increased healthcare resource use as clinicians' resort to repeated and often overlapping investigations in pursuit of diagnostic or treatment direction.

### Intracranial tuberculoma presenting as an isolated oculomotor nerve paresis [^111hoTQ2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of isolated oculomotor nerve paresis ranges from benign to potentially lethal pathologies. Intracranial tuberculosis (TB), as in the case of this patient, carries a high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is crucial to improve patient outcomes.

Case Report

We present the case of a 46-year-old man with a chief complaint of 5 days of diplopia. His examination was remarkable for right inferolateral exotropia and weakness of the right medial rectus. Due to the neurologic findings, we obtained a computed tomography brain scan, which revealed a ring-enhancing lesion within the central midbrain with vasogenic edema causing mass effect on the cerebral aqueduct. Further evaluation revealed tuberculosis (TB) as the underlying etiology. He was placed on steroids and a four-drug anti-TB regimen with resultant improvement of his symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Intracranial tuberculoma can present with an isolated oculomotor nerve paresis in the absence of pulmonary or systemic symptoms. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential when investigating isolated oculomotor nerve paresis.

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^115tMYGp]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic cases.

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, where patients test positive for the virus yet remain clinically well (Figure 1), constitute a large proportion of COVID-19 cases. As such, a population screening strategy based on clinical symptoms alone will miss these cases, increasing transmission risk. Estimates suggest that up to 40–80% of people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic. In a proportion of individuals who are initially asymptomatic, a clinical illness will subsequently develop, classifying this group as presymptomatic. A proportion of these patients may have early identifiable pathology with studies of clinically well SARS-CoV-2–positive patients finding that 50–67.3% had lung abnormalities on CT at admission and a proportion of these later developed clinical illness. Among those without initial CT changes, only 11% later developed clinical illness. Presymptomatic cases have also comprised most of the positive results when testing was performed in nursing facilities, with these cases likely contributing to transmission. Numerous cases of presymptomatic transmission have been reported, and reports from China suggest that 12.6% of cases in China were transmitted asymptomatically. These findings raised questions as to whether most of the patients who were classified as "presymptomatic" (Figure 1) may have had mild symptoms that went unreported, – and what the extent and transmission risk is of true asymptomatic cases.

However, there remains a proportion of patients who will be asymptomatic throughout their illness course. The distribution of asymptomatic cases varies with age, with infected children more likely to be asymptomatic compared to adults. While the degree of infectivity of asymptomatic patients compared to those with clinical illness remains uncertain, there are documented cases of transmission from asymptomatic individuals. These individuals have a median of 9.5 days in which they are able to transmit the virus, and such transmissions are able to cause severe COVID-19 disease. Asymptomatic carriers with SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a great threat to COVID-19 control efforts.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

Depression is a recurrent, often chronic disease consisting of psychological and physical symptoms that are frequently undiagnosed or inadequately treated. While psychological symptoms have been shown to respond to current antidepressants, physical symptoms may not be as responsive. Treating both psychological and physical symptoms of depression may lead to a higher percentage of patients reaching remission.

### Role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in COVID-19 pandemic [^114tTjdW]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance of control and prevention

Although asymptomatic people may be less infectious than those with symptoms, asymptomatic infections account for a large proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, asymptomatic people may have more contacts than people with symptoms, as those who are unwell will isolate. Therefore, the role of asymptomatic cases in covid-19 community transmission should not be neglected.

One model estimated that transmission from asymptomatic individuals accounts for over half of all covid-19 transmissions, after considering scenarios with multiple covid-19 infectious periods and varying rates of transmission from those who never displayed symptoms. Several prediction models have indicated that the identification and isolation of all infected individuals, including those who are asymptomatic, is important for controlling the spread of covid-19. In a worst scenario of unmitigated growth, researchers estimated that testing asymptomatic people may identify the virus five to eight days earlier than it would be detected in symptomatic people, a significant difference. During the five day delay, disease prevalence would have the potential to increase 10-fold. Thus, in order to control the pandemic, the identification of asymptomatic infections is critical. One model estimated that if 45% of asymptomatic people could be identified and isolated, complete lockdown would not be needed.

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections have different implications with regard to control and prevention policies. Although the proportion of total infections that are asymptomatic depends on the biological features of the virus, the proportion of pre-symptomatic infections can be influenced by control interventions. Control of asymptomatic infection requires mass testing, whereas pre-symptomatic infection requires early and effective case detection. The more rapidly a diagnosis is made, the higher the proportion of infections detected while pre-symptomatic. The proportion of pre-symptomatic infections is therefore an indicator of the speed and effectiveness of covid-19 patient identification and diagnosis. The proportion of infections identified in pre-symptomatic people tends to be low during the peak of a large epidemic, when medical resources are scarce, and higher during small outbreaks in which medical resources are sufficient.

Identification of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections is more feasible in low incidence setting, and becomes much more difficult after infection rates climb beyond small, isolated, pockets of community transmission. As such, it has considerable value for preventing outbreaks in previously unexposed communities or among the general population in settings where the virus has been eliminated and outbreaks become smaller and more easily contained.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### A refined symptom-based approach to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis in children [^114K8f2M]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis control programs place an almost exclusive emphasis on adults with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis, because they are most infectious. However, children contribute a significant proportion of the global tuberculosis caseload and experience considerable tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality, but few children in endemic areas have access to antituberculosis treatment. The diagnostic difficulty experienced in endemic areas with limited resources has been identified as a major factor contributing to poor treatment access. In general, there is a sense of scepticism regarding the potential value of symptom-based diagnostic approaches, because current clinical diagnostic approaches are often poorly validated. The natural history of childhood tuberculosis demonstrates that symptoms may offer good diagnostic value if they are well defined and if appropriate risk stratification is applied. This study aimed to determine the value of well-defined symptoms to diagnose childhood pulmonary tuberculosis in a tuberculosis-endemic area.

Methods

A prospective, community-based study was conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. Specific well-defined symptoms were documented in all children < 13 years of age reporting a persistent, nonremitting cough of > 2 weeks' duration; study participants were thoroughly evaluated for tuberculosis. In addition, all of the children who received antituberculosis treatment during the study period were reviewed by the investigator, irrespective of study inclusion. This concurrent disease surveillance provided a comprehensive overview of all of the childhood tuberculosis cases, allowing accurate assessment of the possible disadvantages associated with this symptom-based diagnostic approach. In the absence of an acceptable gold standard test, optimal case definition is an important consideration. Children were categorized as "bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis", "radiologically certain tuberculosis", "probable tuberculosis", or "not tuberculosis". Bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis was defined as the presence of acid-fast bacilli on sputum microscopy and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultured from a respiratory specimen. Radiologically certain tuberculosis was defined as agreement between both independent experts that the chest radiograph indicated certain tuberculosis in the absence of bacteriologic confirmation. Probable tuberculosis was defined as the presence of suggestive radiologic signs and good clinical response to antituberculosis treatment in the absence of bacteriologic confirmation or radiologic certainty. Good clinical response was defined as complete symptom resolution and weight gain of ≥ 10% of body weight at diagnosis, within 3 months of starting antituberculosis treatment. Not tuberculosis was defined as spontaneous symptom resolution or no response to antituberculosis therapy in the absence of bacteriologic confirmation or radiologic signs suggestive of tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was defined as a symptomatic child with: (1) bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis, (2) radiologically confirmed tuberculosis, or (3) probable tuberculosis (as defined), excluding isolated pleural effusion.

Results

In total, 1024 children were referred for evaluation. Resolving symptoms were reported in 596 children (58.2%); 428 (41.8%) children with persistent, nonremitting symptoms at evaluation were investigated for tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 197 children; 96 were categorized as bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis, 75 as radiologically certain tuberculosis, and 26 as probable tuberculosis. Combining a persistent nonremitting cough of > 2 weeks' duration, documented failure to thrive (in the preceding 3 months), and fatigue provided reasonable diagnostic accuracy in HIV-uninfected children (sensitivity: 62.6%; specificity: 89.8%; positive predictive value: 83.6%); the performance was better in the low-risk group (≥ 3 years; sensitivity: 82.3%; specificity: 90.2%; positive predictive value: 82.3%) than in the high-risk group (< 3 years; sensitivity: 51.8%; specificity: 92.5%; positive predictive value: 90.1%). In children with an uncertain diagnosis at presentation, clinical follow-up was a valuable diagnostic tool that further improved diagnostic accuracy, particularly in the low-risk group. Symptom-based approaches offered little diagnostic value in HIV-infected children. Three (15%) of the 20 HIV-infected children diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis failed to report symptoms of sufficient duration to warrant study inclusion, whereas 25% reported persistent, nonremitting symptoms in the absence of tuberculosis. In addition, the tuberculin skin test was positive in < 20% of HIV-infected children diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Discussion

The combined presence of 3 well-defined symptoms at presentation (persistent, nonremitting cough of > 2 weeks' duration; objective weight loss [documented failure to thrive] during the preceding 3 months; and reported fatigue) provided good diagnostic accuracy in HIV-uninfected children ≥ 3 years of age, with clinical follow-up providing additional value. The approach performed less well in children < 3 years. However, the presence of a persistent, nonremitting cough together with documented failure to thrive still provided a fairly accurate diagnosis (sensitivity: 68.3%; specificity: 80.1%; positive predictive value: 82.1%), illustrating the importance of regular weight monitoring in young children. Clinical follow-up also offered additional diagnostic value, but caution is required, because very young children have an increased risk of rapid disease progression. The approach performed poorly in HIV-infected children. Recent household contact with an adult index case seemed to provide more diagnostic value than a positive tuberculin skin test, but novel T-cell-based assays may offer the only real improvement in sensitivity to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected children. The variable diagnostic value offered by this symptom-based diagnostic approach illustrates the importance of risk stratification, as demonstrated by the fact that 11 (91.7%) of 12 children with severe disease manifestations who failed to meet the entry criteria were < 3 years of age or HIV infected. Particular emphasis should be placed on the provision of preventive chemotherapy after documented exposure and/or infection in these high-risk children. Study limitations include the small number of HIV-infected children, but on the positive side, the large number of HIV-uninfected children permitted adequate evaluation in this important group. It is often forgotten that HIV-uninfected children constitute the majority of child tuberculosis cases, even in settings where HIV is endemic. This study demonstrates the importance of ascertaining a child's HIV status before symptom-based diagnosis is attempted. Because children were recruited at both the clinic and hospital level, some selection bias may have been introduced; however, the only significant difference between the 2 groups was the proportion of HIV-infected children. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed with different levels of certainty, but no significant differences were recorded between these groups.

Conclusions

Pulmonary tuberculosis can be diagnosed with a reasonable degree of accuracy in HIV-uninfected children using a simple symptom-based approach. This offers the exciting prospect of improving treatment access for children, particularly in resource-limited settings where current access to antituberculosis treatment is poor.

### Almotriptan malate (Axert) [^113Zb6X8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with Risk Factors for CAD

It is strongly recommended that AXERT®not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history, electrocardiographic or other investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, AXERT®should not be administered [see Contraindications (4.1)].

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of AXERT®take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received AXERT®. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an ECG during the interval immediately following AXERT®, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of AXERT®and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use AXERT®.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to AXERT®. The ability of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect all cardiovascular diseases or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest at best. Cardiovascular events associated with triptan treatment have occurred in patients with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease.

### ACC / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^116j35h6]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 — permanent pacing for sinus node dysfunction (SND) lists graded indications as follows: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for SND with documented symptomatic bradycardia, including frequent sinus pauses that produce symptoms. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for symptomatic chronotropic incompetence. Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for symptomatic sinus bradycardia that results from required drug therapy for medical conditions. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for SND with heart rate less than 40 bpm when a clear association between significant symptoms consistent with bradycardia and the actual presence of bradycardia has not been documented. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for syncope of unexplained origin when clinically significant abnormalities of sinus node function are discovered or provoked in electrophysiological studies. Permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered in minimally symptomatic patients with chronic heart rate less than 40 bpm while awake. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for SND in asymptomatic patients. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for SND in patients for whom the symptoms suggestive of bradycardia have been clearly documented to occur in the absence of bradycardia. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for SND with symptomatic bradycardia due to nonessential drug therapy.

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^1112maUS]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, evaluation of the effect of single and multiple symptoms separately indicates that the presence of multiple symptoms is a poor predictor of stage IV disease. The nature of the symptom appears to be more important than the number of reported symptoms. This observation is reassuring, given that public health education campaigns typically do not focus on symptom combinations.

Symptom awareness and appraisal by patients and doctors is an important determinant of timely presentation and investigation, but the optimal design of early diagnosis interventions aimed at earlier recognition of possible cancer symptoms by members of the public and health-care professionals remains unclear. Alongside considerations such as cancer site incidence, psychosocial barriers to presentation, and the predictive value of symptoms, evidence about the associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis can help to guide the design of early diagnosis interventions. Our findings provide support for such interventions, and counter concerns that they simply expedite the detection of advanced-stage disease.

### Sickness absence indicating depressive symptoms of working population in south Korea [^112AvFsB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickness absence has been regarded as an important indicator of workers' health and work productivity. This study is aimed to evaluate the association between depressive symptoms and sickness absence in workers of South Korea.

Methods

We used nationwide cross-sectional survey data from 2889 individuals in the working population aged over 19 years in South Korea. Depressive symptoms were measured using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Those respondents who scored above 10 on PHQ-9 were regarded as having depressive symptoms. Sickness absence was considered a binary variable with an absence of at least 1 day in the past month. The survey instrument contained questions about sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, work-related factors, and chronic illnesses. Logistic regression models were used to find odds ratios and confidence intervals.

Results

The prevalence of sickness absence was found to be overall 4.6%. The adjusted odds ratio of sickness absence with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) was 3.63 (Confidence Interval: 2.13–6.20) after controlling of possible confounders. Compared to minimal depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 5), the differences between other types of severity of depressive symptoms (mild, moderate, and moderately severe) in terms of mean of all sickness absences were more significant.

Limitation

The sickness absence based on the memory of the respondent in this study may result in a recall bias.

Conclusions

Incidence of at least 1 day of sickness absence per month increased the risk of depressive symptoms after controlling for the possible confounding factors in general working population. It may be necessary to consider strategies for assessing depression in the workers who take sick leaves.

### Absence of gargling affects topical adverse symptoms caused by inhaled corticosteroids in females [^111UcyW8]. The Journal of Asthma (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Topical adverse events caused by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are suspected to be more common in females. Although gargling or mouth washing after inhalation is recommended as the gold standard for preventing adverse events due to ICS, the preventive effects of this method have not been confirmed in real-world studies. This study aimed to examine the association between gargling or mouth washing and the incidence of topical adverse symptoms in males and females in daily practice.

Methods

We analyzed a subpopulation of participants in the Drug Event Monitoring (DEM) project of the Japan Pharmaceutical Association. An anonymous survey was performed in February 2010, to assess the self-perception of topical adverse symptoms during ICS use by conducting interviews of pharmacists using structured questionnaires.

Results

A total of 412 males and 480 females were included. The patients used a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) (71.2%), pressurized meter-dose inhaler (pMDI) with (7.5%) or without (16.6%) a spacer or inhalation solution (4.7%) as the delivery device. Topical adverse symptoms occurring after previous prescriptions were reported by 41 (4.6%) subjects. The common symptoms were hoarseness, stomatitis and dry mouth (1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1%, respectively). In the multiple regression model, the presence of symptoms was found to be significantly associated with the absence of gargling or mouth washing after inhalation [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 3.75, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.33–10.59, p = 0.012]. When stratified by gender, the absence of gargling or mouth washing was identified to be a risk factor in females only (OR: 4.32, 95%CI: 1.11–16.87, p = 0.035) and not in males (OR: 3.26, 95%CI: 0.65–16.33, p = 0.151). Furthermore, the association between the absence of gargling or mouth washing and the incidence of topical adverse symptoms was significant in the patients using DPI (OR: 4.85, 95%CI: 1.66–14.14, p = 0.004), but not in those using the other devices.

Conclusions

In this study, the absence of gargling or mouth washing after ICS use was associated with topical adverse symptoms, especially in females. To achieve good adherence to treatment and improve the quality of life, female patients with asthma should strictly practice the gargling or mouth washing method.

### Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin treatment in COVID-19 is associated with faster resolution of symptoms: a randomized pilot clinical trial [^117Ab7Vo]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Effective treatment to prevent hospitalization and death in people with COVID-19 exists, but people still need interventions that alleviate symptoms without drug interactions. Oral serum-derived bovine immunoglobulins (SBI) may reduce symptoms and time-to-improvement in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. In this randomized, open-label, single-site study, participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 received SBI 5.0g bis in die (BID)+Standard of Care (SOC) or SOC alone (2:1) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, 78.8% of hospitalized participants on SBI+SOC improved by World Health Organization (WHO) scale of ≥ 3 compared to 61.1% on SOC alone (odds ratio: OR = 2.4; p = 0.0663), with older participants (> 57 years) showing more significant differences between the arms (OR = 6.1; p = 0.0109). Further, more participants on SBI+SOC reported absence of COVID-19 symptoms at Week 2 (74.2%) compared to SOC alone (43.6%; OR = 3.7; p = 0.0031), most notably the absence of dyspnea on exertion (OR = 4.4; p = 0.0047), with women exhibiting the most significant eradication of all symptoms (OR = 5.8; p = 0.0080). No difference in change of IL-6 between arms was observed. Overall, participants with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 on SBI+SOC had a shorter time-to-recovery than on SOC alone, with a significantly higher rate of complete resolution of symptoms. Dyspnea on exertion was the symptom most significantly impacted. For people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, oral SBI could be a safe and effective intervention, devoid of drug interactions.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

When to consider added imaging in suspected pericardial absence — this condition is an exceedingly rare, incidental finding, typically in an asymptomatic often young person, and while diagnosis can be confirmed with clinical imaging modalities, pitfalls and overdiagnoses need to be avoided; the need for dedicated cardiac imaging should be carefully considered in asymptomatic persons because the diagnosis typically has no clinical consequences. Confirmatory testing should be reserved for symptomatic patients or those at risk for complications and only when patients are considered candidates for surgical options, and surgical management is based on small, uncontrolled observations, limiting any definitive recommendations.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^114nkNVS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic criteria — multidisciplinary discussion and phenotype-specific patterns: The diagnosis of HP requires integration of multiple domains that are ideally considered in the context of a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), and fibrotic HP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for all patients with a fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), with an identifiable exposure absent in up to 50% of patients with fibrotic HP. No individual feature is sufficient in isolation, nor are any mandatory, and although a single diagnostic algorithm may be applied to both fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP, these populations have frequent differences in their underlying features; nonfibrotic HP more often has an acute and identifiable exposure, rapid onset of both pulmonary and systemic symptoms, centrilobular nodularity on chest computed tomography (CT) scans, and lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis, whereas fibrotic HP is less likely to have an identified exposure and more frequently has an insidious and chronic onset of isolated pulmonary symptoms, fibrotic changes on chest imaging, and a nonspecific differential cell profile on BAL analysis.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117WYbtY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

DSM-IV-TR 300.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic criteria require either obsessions or compulsions, with obsessions involving intrusive, inappropriate thoughts, impulses, or images that are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems, attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize them, and recognition that they are a product of one's own mind; compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at preventing or reducing distress or a dreaded event but not realistically connected or clearly excessive. Additional criteria are that the person has recognized the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (note: this does not apply to children), symptoms cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with routine, functioning, or relationships, content is not restricted to another Axis I disorder, and the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition; specify With Poor Insight when for most of the time during the current episode the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.

### Management of anxiety and depression in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114dPk5U]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Recommendations on assessment of depressive symptoms in adult cancer survivors — Specific concerns such as risk of harm to self and/or others, severe depression or agitation, or the presence of psychosis or confusion (delirium) require immediate referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist, physician, or equivalently trained professional. Assessments should be a shared responsibility of the clinical team, and patients should first be assessed for depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). If moderate to severe or severe symptomatology is detected through screening, individuals should have further diagnostic assessment to identify the nature and extent of the depressive symptoms and the presence or absence of a mood disorder, and medical or substance-induced causes of significant depressive symptoms should be determined and treated. As a shared responsibility, the clinical team must decide when referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or equivalently trained professional is needed, including all patients with a PHQ-9 score in the severe range or those in the moderate range with pertinent history/risk factors, and assessment should identify signs and symptoms of depression, the severity of cancer symptoms, possible stressors, risk factors, and times of vulnerability.

### Somatic symptom disorder: a diagnostic dilemma [^112B6Jw7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a diagnosis that was introduced with publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. It eliminated the diagnoses of somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis and pain disorder; most of the patients who previously received these diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with SSD. The main feature of this disorder is a patient's concern with physical symptoms for which no biological cause is found. It requires psychiatric assessment to exclude comorbid psychiatric disease. Failure to recognise this disorder may lead the unwary physician or surgeon to embark on investigations or diagnostic procedures which may result in iatrogenic complications. It also poses a significant financial burden on the healthcare service. Patients with non-specific abdominal pain have a poor symptomatic prognosis with continuing use of medical services. Proven treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness therapy and pharmacological treatment using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. The authors describe the case of a 31-year-old woman with an emotionally unstable personality disorder and comorbid disease presenting to the emergency department with a 3-week history of left-sided abdominal and leg pain. Despite a plethora of investigations, no organic cause for her pain was found. She was reviewed by the multidisciplinary team including surgeons, physicians, neurologists and psychiatrists. A diagnosis of somatoform symptom disorder was subsequently rendered. As patients with SSD will present to general practice and the emergency department rather than psychiatric settings, this case provides a cautionary reminder of furthering the need for appropriate recognition of this condition.

Exertional tolerance and aerobic exercise interventions — mode, progression, and symptom monitoring guidance note limited evidence for best protocols; studies have used treadmill, bicycling, elliptical, and multimodal training with variable progressions (some guided by heart rate or ratings of perceived exertion, others time based). A common assertion from experts has been that aerobic training interventions should be guided by symptoms, such that significant exacerbation of symptoms beyond a mild degree should result in exercise termination for the session, an absence of symptom exacerbation can provide support for progressing exercise intensity and duration, and symptom exacerbations may occur with aerobic activity, but they should be mild and temporary in nature.

### Diagnoses of exclusion in the workup of abdominal complaints [^114gPPDx]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, comprising 8.8% of all visits. Despite advances in medicine and imaging, 20% to 30% of patients still leave the department without a definitive diagnosis, whichhis can be both distressing for patients and unsatisfying for providers. Diagnoses of exclusion can be perilous, and their application should be carefully considered in order to not overlook more emergent complaints. However, a working knowledge of diagnoses of exclusion can guide therapeutics and specialty referrals that can ultimately provide answers and relief to a patient population often at odds with available information and expectations.

### Role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in COVID-19 pandemic [^1117Gp1M]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission seems to be one of the most important features of covid-19. People without symptoms can transmit the virus, but estimating their influence on outbreaks is challenging. Whether asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections (box 1) act as "silent triggers" of covid-19 transmission remains controversial. In the UK, for example, a failure to integrate testing programmes into clinical care has made it difficult to evaluate the role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.

Box 1
Definitions of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic

In contrast to many other countries, China has been releasing data on new asymptomatic cases of covid-19 and those who eventually developed symptoms since 31 March 2020. This has facilitated assessment of the role of asymptomatic infections in disease transmission. We examine the proportion and infectivity of people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections, and how their management can contribute to controlling covid-19 transmission.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115CCHb3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Screening and case-finding — indications and approaches: The role of screening spirometry for the diagnosis of COPD in the general population is controversial. In asymptomatic individuals without any significant exposures to tobacco or other risk factors, screening spirometry is probably not indicated; whereas in those with symptoms or risk factors (e.g., > 20 pack-years of smoking, recurrent chest infections, early life events), the diagnostic yield for COPD is relatively high and spirometry should be considered as a method for early case finding. Both FEV1 and FVC predict all-cause mortality independent of tobacco smoking, but data to support that population-based screening spirometry is effective in directing management decisions or in improving COPD outcomes in patients who are identified before the development of significant symptoms is weak. An randomized controlled trial (RCT) using community case-finding reported that symptomatic individuals with undiagnosed COPD who received treatment by a pulmonologist and an educator had fewer respiratory events over one year and showed improvements in symptoms, lung function, and disease-specific quality of life, and these results suggest that such an approach, leading to early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic COPD results in better clinical outcomes. GOLD advocates active case finding, i.e., performing spirometry in patients with symptoms and/or risk factors, but not screening spirometry, and systematic active case-finding in a primary care setting via mail-out of a screening questionnaire was also found to be an effective way to identify undiagnosed COPD patients.

Primary angle-closure disease diagnosis — patients may or may not have symptoms of PACD. Primary angle-closure suspect is a diagnosis based on the presence of ITC on gonioscopy only, without elevated IOP or PAS and no optic nerve damage, whereas primary angle closure is based on a combination of the presence of ITC on gonioscopy with either elevated IOP or PAS, but no glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Patients may be asymptomatic when presenting for routine eye care, or they may present with sudden onset of symptoms and signs typical of AACC (such as pain, nausea, redness, congestion, decreased vision, corneal edema, very high IOP), and the initial history and ophthalmic examination includes the components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation with special attention to those elements that specifically bear on primary and secondary causes of angle closure.

### Evidence supporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 while presymptomatic or asymptomatic [^111pAgz2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop). SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious. Critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission, and the question of whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protective immunity.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^1126TPAX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Early recognition and rapid initiation of infection control precautions are currently the most important strategies for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). No rapid diagnostic tests currently exist that can rule out SARS among patients with febrile respiratory illnesses. Clinical features alone cannot with certainty distinguish SARS from other respiratory illnesses rapidly enough to inform early management decisions. A balanced approach to screening that allows early recognition of SARS without unnecessary isolation of patients with other respiratory illnesses will require clinicians not only to look for suggestive clinical features but also to routinely seek epidemiologic clues suggestive of SARS coronavirus exposure. Key epidemiologic risk factors include 1) exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented, or 2) in the absence of such exposure, epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia (i.e., pneumonia clusters), or 3) exposure to healthcare settings. When combined with clinical findings, these epidemiologic features provide a possible strategic framework for early recognition of SARS.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^112hccmP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Ruling out SARS

The only currently available laboratory method for excluding the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is to obtain a negative result on serologic testing of a convalescent-phase serum sample obtained > 28 days after onset of symptoms. For patients without evidence of pneumonia at the initial evaluation, serial observations over time may be helpful in identifying those in whom isolation precautions can be safely discontinued. Resolution of symptoms and lack of development of radiographic evidence of pneumonia by the 2nd week of illness argue against the diagnosis of SARS. Some patients with mild illness may be missed when this approach is used, but if that is the case, they likely will not play an epidemiologically important role in transmission.

Patients with documented pneumonia who have been given the provisional diagnosis of SARS should be treated as if they have SARS-CoV infection, unless there is convincing evidence for an alternative diagnosis or new epidemiologic information excludes the possibility that the patient was exposed to SARS

### Somatic symptom disorders without known physical causes: one disease with many names? [^115DL4kH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients complaining of pain or fatigue in the absence of known physical diseases constitute a high percentage of those seeking general medical care. Depending upon the type of physician/specialist consulted, those individuals may receive disease labels that range from an implied psychological origin such as somatoform or psychosomatic disease, or to a presumed physical disease such as fibromyalgia. Although all these conditions are regularly associated with fatigue, we have provided a new label suggesting another disease category, "systemic exertion intolerance disease", which replaces the previous "chronic fatigue syndrome". All these conditions have common, overlapping features that usually consist of both fatigue and pain, and, in the absence of definitive objective confirmation, might be best classified under one heading such as somatic symptom disorder. Management of these disorders is challenging, but suggestions for proper identification and treatment are presented.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1115MzgA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Abbreviations and definitions of common terms — Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external source of the sound. Primary tinnitus is tinnitus that is idiopathic and may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss, whereas secondary tinnitus is tinnitus that is associated with a specific underlying cause (other than sensorineural hearing loss) or an identifiable organic condition. Recent onset tinnitus is less than 6 months in duration (as reported by the patient), and persistent tinnitus is 6 months or longer in duration. Bothersome tinnitus is a distressed patient with affected quality of life and/or functional health status who is seeking active therapy and management strategies to alleviate tinnitus, while nonbothersome tinnitus does not have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life but may result in curiosity about cause or concern about natural history and change over time.

### Studying symptoms: sampling and measurement issues [^1139kQ6b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, but the specific causes and treatments of many common symptoms are frequently not well established. Because clinical research has primarily targeted specific diseases, symptoms-based research is still an emerging field of scientific inquiry, and optimal methods are still being developed. This paper considers eight important issues in sampling and measurement. First, recognition of the exceptionally high base rates of many symptoms is an essential primary step in selecting appropriate case-patients and controls. Second, the type of population studied (community, primary care clinic, subspecialty clinic, or symptom clinic) can greatly influence the severity and other characteristics of the symptom being evaluated. Third, symptom detection relies on three types of symptoms: documented, elicited, and volunteered. Fourth, temporal factors include recency of onset, episodicity, and duration. Fifth, severity can be assessed with single- or multiple-item symptom-specific scales as well as evaluation of generic functional status and health-related quality-of- life measures. Sixth, recognition of a symptom's cause can be strengthened by explicit criteria, uniform assessment protocols, and multiple raters. Seventh, comorbidity that should be assessed includes medical disorders, psychiatric disorders, and other symptoms. And eighth, since death and serious illness are uncommon, alternative outcomes that might be measured include symptom alleviation, health-related quality of life, patient and provider satisfaction, and health care costs.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction — permanent pacemaker implantation recommendations: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for SND with documented symptomatic bradycardia, including frequent sinus pauses that produce symptoms; is indicated for symptomatic chronotropic incompetence; and is indicated for symptomatic sinus bradycardia that results from required drug therapy for medical conditions. Permanent pacemaker implantation is reasonable for SND with heart rate less than 40 bpm when a clear association between significant symptoms consistent with bradycardia and the actual presence of bradycardia has not been documented, and is reasonable for syncope of unexplained origin when clinically significant abnormalities of sinus node function are discovered or provoked in electrophysiological studies. Permanent pacemaker implantation may be considered in minimally symptomatic patients with chronic heart rate less than 40 bpm while awake. Permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for SND in asymptomatic patients, is not indicated for SND in patients for whom the symptoms suggestive of bradycardia have been clearly documented to occur in the absence of bradycardia, and is not indicated for SND with symptomatic bradycardia due to nonessential drug therapy.

### Management and prevention of hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: a consensus statement from the American college of radiology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^113ikShF]. Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast media (ICM) — diagnostic and treatment guidance states that anaphylaxis to ICM should be considered when the acute onset of illness occurs within minutes after intravenous ICM administration and in the absence of other known allergens or triggers, and anaphylaxis is considered likely if any two or more of the following criteria are met: involvement of skin/mucosal tissue or both, respiratory compromise, reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (Severe hypotension may preclude the manifestation of any other anaphylaxis symptoms and anaphylaxis should be considered when there is no other source for the acute onset of severe hypotension within minutes of intravenous ICM administration such as shock, sepsis, or vasovagal reaction.), and significant or persistent vomiting and/or severe diarrhea (These gastrointestinal symptoms in isolation do not meet criteria for anaphylaxis and should be significantly more severe than the typically quickly resolving vomiting that can be a side effect of ICM); epinephrine is recommended as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and H1 antihistamines should not be administered as the primary and only treatment for anaphylaxis.

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^114iXcmk]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chest radiographs demonstrating absent, minimal, or atypical findings in a pediatric patient with symptoms of respiratory infection can suggest the possibility of unusual lung infection. Once unusual lung infection is suspected either clinically or radiographically, a thorough review of the patient's clinical manifestations, exposure risk factors, and laboratory workup test results is necessary to narrow the diagnostic possibilities and determine the appropriate next steps in management. In these cases, chest CT can be a valuable diagnostic tool. CT provides greater anatomic detail and is more sensitive for detection of infection than chest radiography. Therefore, the indications for chest CT in these pediatric patients may be broader than just the depiction of pulmonary complications. As microbiologic isolation of unusual microorganisms can be challenging and clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, a multifactorial approach that combines environmental exposure information, risk factors, and CT findings can enhance diagnostic accuracy, enable earlier initiation of proper treatment, and prevent potential complications.

### Translating vague complaints into precise symptoms: the implications of a poor medical history [^115x9PX9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

A medical history serves to record the patient's complaints and translate them into clear-cut, medically defined symptoms. A poorly defined symptom loses most of its discriminative power as a diagnostic test for a medical work-up. If physicians are uncertain about the exact meaning of a symptom, they have to account for the possibility of multiple competing interpretations for the identical set of complaints. Multiple possible interpretations of a single symptom diminish its value as a diagnostic test and result in test degeneracy. A modified Bayes' formula is used to quantify the influence of test degeneracy on post-test probability. The physician needs to help his patients to phrase their complaints in a fashion that limits the number of possible interpretations. A poor medical history diminishes the opportunity to establish a diagnostic suspicion with a high probability early on. The subsequent medical work-up has to rely on many more tests to confirm the presence of a diagnosis. The poor medical history exposes the patient, therefore, to more test-related risks, and prolongs the diagnostic process. All these downsides of a poor history ultimately increase medical resource utilization and healthcare expenditures.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging? [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

In assessing the patient with headache, clinicians are often faced with 2 important questions: Is this headache a migraine? Does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

Objective

To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination that distinguish patients with migraine from those with other headache types and that identify those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All 4 of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if 3 or 4 criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized by the mnemonic POUNDing (Pulsating, duration of 4–72 hOurs, Unilateral, Nausea, Disabling). If 4 of the 5 criteria are met, the likelihood ratio (LR) for definite or possible migraine is 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–388); if 3 are met, the LR is 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3–9.2), and if 2 or fewer are met, the LR is 0.41 (95% CI, 0.32–0.52). For the neuroimaging question, several clinical features were found on pooled analysis to predict the presence of a serious intracranial abnormality: cluster-type headache (LR, 10.7; 95% CI, 2.2–52); abnormal findings on neurologic examination (LR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.4–12); undefined headache (ie, not cluster-, migraine-, or tension-type) (LR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0–7.1); headache with aura (LR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.6); headache aggravated by exertion or a valsalva-like maneuver (LR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.8); and headache with vomiting (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2–2.6). No clinical features were useful in ruling out significant pathologic conditions.

Conclusions

The presence of 4 simple historical features can accurately diagnose migraine. Several individual clinical features were found to be associated with a significant intracranial abnormality, and patients with these features should undergo neuroimaging.

### Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: what do we need to know? [^113WKM62]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was officially declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, and it has imposed unprecedented, far-reaching impacts upon public health and the global ecomony. As of April 30, 2020, > 3 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, including > 210,000 deaths. Meanwhile, a growing body of are reporting that many COVID-19 infections might present no or only mild symptoms, with a much higher proportion of asymptomatic infections than previously expected. – Asymptomatic COVID-19 includes asymptomatic infected persons and presymptomatic infected persons. Those with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results who never develop any signs or clinically symptoms of COVID-19 are considered asymptomatic infected persons. Those with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results who fail to show any signs or clinically symptoms of COVID-19 at testing but eventually developed symptoms are considered presymptomatic infected persons. Approximately 60% of COVID-19 cases may have no symptoms or mild symptoms, according to an article published online in Nature on March 20. In fact, as of April 14, 2020, some 6,764 asymptomatic infections have been recognized in mainland China, including 588 imported infections and 1,297 cases that had been recategorized as confirmed cases. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can not only damage human lungs but can also attack many other organs, including the gut and blood vessels, kidneys, etc, thus presenting different symptoms and signs. So, why do some infected persons still show no symptoms or only mild symptoms?

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113zud3H]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Scope of the problem — diagnostic features of major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder are defined: Major depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood (or irritability in children) and/or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) of listed symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years along with at least two specified symptoms; in children and adolescents, the duration is at least one year, and the mood can be irritable. The text further specifies that there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months and that symptoms are not better explained by another disorder, cause significant impairment in functioning or distress, and are not due to a different medical condition or a substance.

### Suspected cases of COVID-19: study protocol for reporting characteristics and the outcomes [^112N7KW6]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While research and reporting on COVID-19 disease focused on laboratory-confirmed cases, many suspected COVID-19 cases are advised to home isolate based on symptoms and risk factors and not on laboratory test findings. While guidance suggests that primary care physicians must rely on their clinical judgement for evaluation of those cases, there has been no risk stratifying tool that has been reported or validated in this cohort of patients. This reflection note reviews current guidance, identifies gaps in our knowledge and clinical practice and finally provides a rationale for research in this cohort of patients. We propose a research design with detailed descriptions of variables that would be feasible to examine in primary care settings. Primary care research in the characteristics and the outcomes of suspected cases of COVID-19 may provide a different view on the COVID-19 epidemic. We hypothesise that most of the patients with suspected diagnosis and home isolation will have good outcomes. Reporting on the characteristics and the outcomes in this cohort of patients may provide hope to patients and to the international community that receives daily updates on confirmed cases and mortality rates but none on the recovery counts.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) virus is a member of the coronaviruses, which is closely related to SARS-CoV virus. Common signs on presentation include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment with no specific antiviral treatment. While the disease could be asymptomatic or mild in many cases, moderate cases require hospitalisation, and severe cases need the support of vital organ functions.

WHO advised suspecting COVID-19 in patients with acute fever and ≥ 1 sign or symptom of the respiratory disease combined with a risk factor for exposure. Exposure risk factors included recent travel to infected areas or those who had direct contact with cases within 14 days of the start of their symptoms. The term 'Probable case' recently expanded to include a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 'Confirmed cases' is a term that is reserved only for those with laboratory confirmation irrespective of the presence or absence of clinical symptoms.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^115qw9UT]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

In all, 1009 patients above 18 years were detected in the database. Of these, 99 were excluded due to a lack of a final or a non‐movement disorder clinical diagnosis, and 36 due to more than one diagnosis (an FMD plus non‐FMD). A total of 874 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study, of whom 554 (63%) had a non‐FMD, including tremor 131 (24%), myoclonus 51 (10%), dystonia 257 (46%) and others 115 (20%). The remaining 320 (37%) were diagnosed with an FMD. In this group, the key symptom was tremor in 66 patients (21%), myoclonus in 102 patients (32%), dystonia in 82 patients (26%) and others (21%). In the non‐FMD group, 224 patients (40%) had more than one motor phenotype including dystonic tremor in 36%, myoclonus‐dystonia in 10%, medication‐induced movement disorders in 9%, and in the remaining 45% several other combinations were detected. In our FMD group 70 (24%) of the patients had more than one hyperkinetic movement disorder. All patients were diagnosed by an experienced movement disorder specialist. In more than 50% of the patients with functional tremor or myoclonus the diagnosis was supported by electrophysiological testing. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of age at onset and the frequency of the associated categorical features for patients with FMDs versus non‐FMDs. It was assumed that clinical characteristics, such as medical history or family history, were reported properly by the attending physician and therefore these items were scored as absent when they were not reported. In the case of unreported associated features, such as pain or fatigue, these missing values were replaced by absent. The percentage of missing values that were replaced is reported in the last column of the table. In FMD patients, symptoms had a significantly higher age of onset than in non‐FMD patients. The features sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day were more common (P < 0.01) in patients with FMDs, whilst more than one motor phenotype and positive family history were more prevalent in patients with non‐FMDs (P < 0.01). The frequency of cognitive symptoms and medical history did not significantly differ between our two groups.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112JvcES]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Background — depressive disorder definitions across ages — Major depression is the second leading cause of disability as of 2013, and major depressive disorder is characterized by depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder (DSM-5) is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years with at least two additional symptoms; in children and adolescents the duration is at least 1 year, and there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months. For presentations that do not meet full criteria, DSM-5 Other Specified Depressive Disorder includes recurrent episodes of depressed mood with at least four other symptoms for 2–13 days (recurrent brief depression) and a depressive episode for 4–13 days (short-duration depressive episode).

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

OBJECTIVE. This article will review the typical and atypical imaging features of sarcoidosis, identify entities that may be mistaken for sarcoidosis, and discuss patterns and clinical scenarios that suggest an alternative diagnosis. CONCLUSION. Radiologists must be familiar with the characteristic findings in sarcoidosis and be attentive to situations that suggest alternative diagnoses. The radiologist plays a major role in prompt diagnosis and one that may help reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

### Evaluation and management of amenorrhea [^114u1MGk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amenorrhea:

- **Definition**: Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstrual periods in women.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of amenorrhea is complex and multifactorial. It can be caused by hormonal disorders such as pituitary dysfunction and absent ovarian function. It can also be caused due to chromosomal abnormalities and impairment of GnRH pulsatile secretion.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence rates of primary and secondary amenorrhea in the general population are estimated at 0.3% and 3–4%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, amenorrhea presents as the absence of menstrual periods. In primary amenorrhea, there is also an absence of secondary sexual characteristics in phenotypic women aged ≥ 14 years. In secondary amenorrhea, there may be other associated symptoms depending on the underlying cause. For example, patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may present with severe bradycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, and/or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is reversible, and normal menstrual function can be restored with appropriate treatment. Amenorrhea due to chromosomal abnormalities or primary ovarian insufficiency may not be reversible.

### Are multiple physical symptoms a poor prognostic factor or just a marker of depression severity? Secondary analysis of the genPod trial [^114TkLjF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

6 Conclusions

Multiple baseline physical symptoms appear to predict poor response to antidepressants, but not after adjustment for depression severity. Multiple physical symptoms may represent severe depression rather than a poor prognostic factor. Clinicians should ask about mood symptoms and explore psychosocial issues in patients with multiple physical symptoms. If considering a diagnosis of depression in someone with multiple physical symptoms, clinicians should treat it as a moderate to severe depression. This is essential in order to avoid inappropriate investigation and treatment of physical symptoms, which could lead to iatrogenic harm. Reboxetine does not confer any advantage over citalopram in this group, and it is less well tolerated. Since there is no evidence that physical symptoms are a moderator of treatment in patients with multiple physical symptoms when a clinician chooses an antidepressant they should take account of the side effect profile, rather than depend on physical symptoms.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^112DbCsS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare disorder, diagnosis of ES has been increasing since it is primarily regarded as an incidental finding on brain imaging scans like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly, Computed Tomography (CT), or rarely plain X-ray. However, very often the patient may present with various symptoms which are attributed to PES in the absence of any other likely causation. The clinical significance related to the incidental finding is ambiguous and some studies elucidate it to more than a mere incidental finding. Several isolated case reports and case series have been published over the last three decades and statistics collectively from single-centerr or multicenter retrospective studies have reported prevalence as low as 2.3% to as high as 38% in autopsy studies with large predominance in the female gender.

Studies from the Saudi Arabian region are scanty except a report from the western region documenting a brief description of 537 patients with PES without exploring further details on clinical significance, the symptoms and hormonal assessments Moreover, no specific guidelines or recommendations exist in the diagnosis and management of PES, resulting in the majority of the cases being managed without a referral to an endocrinologist. However, experts in the field have advised endocrine assessment of even the asymptomatic cases and a multi-disciplinary approach in the management of PES. The objective of the present study is to report a 10-year retrospective review of primary empty sella from a single-center registry, aiming to determine the epidemiology, clinical presentation and management of PES, and to identify the differences in investigations and diagnosis of PES between endocrinologists and non endocrinologists in a tertiary care setting".

### Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^112hDSUH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant cause of morbidity and health care expenditures. Patients with AF suffer a variety of symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Some patients have no symptoms, a condition referred to as asymptomatic or "silent" AF. Asymptomatic AF has significant clinical implications. Patients with unrecognized AF may present with devastating thromboembolic consequences or a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. The incidence of asymptomatic AF is greater than previously perceived. This manuscript provides an overview of the clinical entity of asymptomatic AF including the epidemiology, clinical significance, and the implications it has on the daily management of patients suffering from AF.

Alzheimer's Association DETeCD-ADRD — cognitive assessment tools: In a patient being evaluated for cognitive or behavioral symptoms, clinicians should use validated tools to assess cognition (Strength of Recommendation A), noting that while no single instrument fits all circumstances, the use of a validated instrument to detect cognitive impairment is an invaluable step for identifying potentially clinically significant impairment; interpretation should use the individual's cognitive test score profile, and performance on a validated brief cognitive test should not be interpreted in isolation but integrated with the patient's overall risk profile, history of presenting illness, and other examination and diagnostic findings; when concern exists and a brief test may not be sufficiently informative or may not capture mild but clinically significant impairments, clinicians should strongly consider referral to a neuropsychologist or specialist.

### Brexpiprazole (Rexulti) [^1145A5qi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8	Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in this class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of REXULTI at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue REXULTI in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with obstructive coronary lesions in the absence of coronary calcification: an evaluation by coronary CT angiography [^115JYXZh]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Multidetector CT allows detection of coronary artery calcium and, after contrast injection, visualisation of the coronary artery lumen. It is commonly assumed that the absence of coronary calcification makes the presence of obstructive coronary lesions highly unlikely. This study evaluates the clinical characteristics of patients with at least one symptomatic, high-grade coronary artery stenosis in both computed tomography and invasive angiography but absence of any coronary calcification and compares the results with patients with stenoses in the setting of detectable coronary calcium

Patients and Methods

The study retrospectively identified 21 consecutive patients with symptoms in whom a high-grade coronary artery stenosis had been identified in 64-slice or dual-source CT coronary angiography (Siemens Sensation 64 or Siemens Definition, 120 kV, 50 to 85 mL of intravenous contrast at 5 ml/s) in the absence of coronary calcium and in whom that finding had been confirmed by invasive coronary angiography. Clinical presentation ("unstable": all forms of acute coronary syndrome versus "stable": stable chest pain or dyspnoea on exertion) and standard cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, and the results were compared with 42 consecutive patients with symptoms in whom both coronary calcium and coronary stenoses had been identified in computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography.

Results

The majority of patients with coronary stenoses in the absence of coronary calcium presented with "unstable" symptoms (non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina), significantly more frequently than patients with detectable calcification (71% vs 26%, p = 0.001). The age range of patients without calcium was 33 to 76 years, their mean age was younger (53 (SD 13) vs 63 (8) years, p < 0.001), but none of the risk factors showed any significant difference compared with patients with calcification.

Conclusion

The presence of significant coronary artery stenosis in the absence of coronary calcium is possible. It is more likely in the setting of unstable angina or NSTEMI than in stable chest pain and occurs more frequently in younger patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and prognosis in conduction disease — monitoring can "be used to document clinically significant arrhythmias in asymptomatic patients as well", with modern systems that "automatically store clinically abnormal rhythms in addition to patient-triggered recordings", and "Selected patients with conduction system disease may benefit from such screening, even in the absence of significant symptoms such as syncope". Progression of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and bifascicular block to atrioventricular block and bradycardia "is low, approximately 1% per year", with presentations split between syncope and other symptoms, and "Most studies have reported that LBBB is associated with higher mortality than other forms of conduction disorders".
