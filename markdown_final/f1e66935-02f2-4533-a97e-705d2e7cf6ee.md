Transfuse cirrhotic patient

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about transfusion strategy in cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle of rebalanced hemostasis and why conventional tests mislead us. Then, I should verify red blood cell transfusion thresholds in acute GI bleeding and the physiologic rationale for restriction. Next, I will examine platelet transfusion thresholds in active bleeding versus prophylaxis and the role of thrombopoietin receptor agonists. After that, I need to check when, if ever, to correct INR with plasma or PCC and what to do about fibrinogen. I will then review procedure-specific risk stratification and the role of viscoelastic testing. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, summarize a practical algorithm, and close with key takeaways and caveats anchored to guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concept: patients with cirrhosis have rebalanced hemostasis, so prolonged INR and low platelets do not reliably predict bleeding, and routine correction worsens portal hypertension via volume expansion. I should double-check that this is consistently reflected across high-credibility sources, which it is in AGA, AASLD, and EASL guidance, with viscoelastic testing outperforming conventional assays for transfusion decisions [^117DpAmT] [^115fgUR9] [^1173i9Ua] [^117CA1gd].

> Now, red blood cells: I need to ensure the restrictive threshold is truly evidence-based. The pivotal RCT in acute upper GI bleeding supports initiating transfusion at hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL and maintaining 7–9 g/dL, with improved survival and less rebleeding versus a liberal strategy, and this benefit was pronounced in cirrhosis subgroups, so I should anchor PRBC decisions to this threshold unless there is massive hemorrhage or severe cardiopulmonary disease [^116rRgF6] [^111TbqKu] [^111N2vCi] [^112aGja8].

> Wait, let me verify the physiologic rationale for restriction: volume expansion from liberal transfusion increases portal pressure and can precipitate rebleeding. I should confirm that this has been demonstrated in trials and translational work, which it has, reinforcing the need to avoid over-resuscitation while maintaining tissue oxygen delivery [^116rRgF6] [^117HoYkC].

> Next, platelets: I should confirm that in active bleeding a pragmatic threshold of about 50 × 10⁹/L is commonly used, even though high-quality evidence is limited. BSG and major hemorrhage frameworks endorse this target, and AGA suggests platelets above 50,000 support adequate thrombin generation, but I need to emphasize that this is based on low-to-very low certainty evidence and should be individualized [^117Pbyc4] [^116qgYkF] [^117DpAmT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prophylactic platelets before procedures. I should double-check guideline positions: AGA and AASLD advise against routine preprocedural platelet transfusion for common GI procedures, reserving correction for high-risk scenarios or active bleeding, and viscoelastic testing can safely reduce unnecessary platelet use without increasing bleeding, which I should prioritize when available [^111uLA6D] [^116xTvdg] [^117CA1gd] [^113eKbaj].

> I will now examine alternatives for elective thrombocytopenia: thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as avatrombopag and lusutrombopag reduce platelet transfusion needs and can raise counts above 50,000 within days. I should confirm safety signals, noting eltrombopag's portal vein thrombosis risk and the more favorable profiles of newer agents, and align with ACG's strong recommendation for preoperative use in severe thrombocytopenia [^116DSJjx] [^114azXrV] [^115Rdk1s].

> Let me think about INR and plasma: INR does not reflect bleeding risk in cirrhosis, and prophylactic FFP is not recommended because large volumes minimally improve thrombin generation while raising portal pressure. If correction is needed in active bleeding, low-volume options like cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen or 4-factor PCC for warfarin reversal are preferred, and I should confirm that recombinant factor VIIa lacks supportive data and carries thrombotic risk, so it should be avoided outside trials [^115fgUR9] [^117EUKKT] [^117DpAmT] [^116aKyBE].

> I need to check fibrinogen thresholds: maintaining fibrinogen above about 120 mg/dL (1.2 g/L) is reasonable in active bleeding or high-risk procedures, and cryoprecipitate is favored over FFP for repletion due to lower volume. I should confirm that this aligns with AGA and liver biopsy guidance, which it does [^117DpAmT] [^1111Wj1a].

> Next, I should review procedure risk stratification and testing: low-risk procedures such as paracentesis, thoracentesis, routine upper endoscopy with banding, and many colonoscopies do not require routine preprocedural correction. High-risk procedures like transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, percutaneous liver biopsy, and certain surgeries warrant individualized assessment, and viscoelastic testing can reduce transfusions without increasing bleeding. I should confirm that AGA advises against routine preprocedural testing in stable cirrhosis, which it does [^111uLA6D] [^114opEBK] [^113eKbaj] [^117CA1gd].

> But wait, what if viscoelastic testing is unavailable? I should double-check fallback strategies: if TEG/ROTEM are not available, it is reasonable to consider platelet correction for severe thrombocytopenia below 50,000/μL before major surgery and to target fibrinogen above 120 mg/dL when low, while avoiding routine FFP for INR correction. This balances risks and benefits when functional testing cannot guide care [^114Gt31E] [^117DpAmT].

> I will now examine special scenarios: in acute variceal hemorrhage, restrictive PRBC transfusion remains foundational alongside vasoactive agents, antibiotics, and early endoscopic therapy. In decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF, consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenemia may necessitate earlier correction, and I should remember that TEG-guided strategies reduce transfusions even in coagulopathic patients. For massive hemorrhage, local massive transfusion protocols should be activated, but I need to ensure we avoid over-resuscitation that worsens portal hypertension [^111N2vCi] [^1136d48s] [^114hQrtp] [^116qgYkF].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines: for stable cirrhosis without active bleeding, do not transfuse PRBC above 7 g/dL, do not correct INR with FFP, and do not give prophylactic platelets before low-risk procedures. For active bleeding, transfuse PRBC to 7–9 g/dL, give platelets if below about 50 × 10⁹/L, and replete fibrinogen if below 120 mg/dL using cryoprecipitate. For elective high-risk procedures with severe thrombocytopenia, consider TPO receptor agonists to reach above 50,000/μL and use viscoelastic testing when available to guide any transfusions. Throughout, minimize volume expansion and reassess hemodynamics continuously [^115rHthy] [^111N2vCi] [^116DSJjx] [^117CA1gd].

> Hold on, I should verify key caveats: over-transfusion increases portal pressure and rebleeding risk, so restraint is as important as timely intervention. Immunologic and volume-related complications of transfusion are more common in cirrhosis and can impair transplant candidacy. And despite robust guidance, real-world practice often overuses plasma and platelets, underscoring the need for education and protocolized approaches aligned with viscoelastic testing where feasible [^1111Wj1a] [^117Fng2t] [^113eKbaj].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach remains anchored to three principles: rebalanced hemostasis means conventional coagulation tests mislead. Restrictive PRBC transfusion improves outcomes in acute GI bleeding. And viscoelastic testing or carefully selected pharmacologic strategies can safely reduce unnecessary transfusions while maintaining hemostasis, with all decisions individualized to bleeding severity, procedure risk, and cardiopulmonary comorbidity [^117DpAmT] [^116rRgF6] [^117CA1gd].

Transfuse cirrhotic patients only when clinically indicated, using a **restrictive RBC strategy** (transfuse at Hb 7–8 g/dL, target 7–9 g/dL) to reduce rebleeding and mortality [^116rRgF6] [^111TbqKu] [^111N2vCi]. Avoid routine **FFP or platelet transfusion** for prophylaxis; reserve platelets for active bleeding with platelets < 50×10⁹/L or for high-risk procedures after case-by-case review [^111uLA6D] [^117Pbyc4] [^117DpAmT]. Use **cryoprecipitate** only if fibrinogen < 1.0–1.5 g/L with active bleeding. Prefer **TEG/ROTEM** to guide transfusion; minimize blood products to limit portal hypertension, transfusion-related complications, and alloimmunization [^1136d48s] [^113eKbaj] [^117DpAmT].

## Indications for transfusion in cirrhotic patients

### Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion

- **Restrictive strategy**: Transfuse when Hb < 7–8 g/dL, targeting 7–9 g/dL; higher thresholds increase portal pressure and rebleeding [^116rRgF6] [^111TbqKu] [^111N2vCi].
- **Active variceal bleeding**: Maintain Hb 7–9 g/dL; liberal transfusion worsens outcomes [^116rRgF6] [^111TbqKu] [^111N2vCi].
- **Massive hemorrhage**: Use local massive transfusion protocols, balancing hemostasis and volume [^116qgYkF].

---

### Platelet transfusion

- **Active bleeding**: Platelets < 50×10⁹/L [^117Pbyc4] [^116qgYkF].
- **High-risk procedures**: Consider if platelets < 50×10⁹/L after individualized risk–benefit assessment [^111uLA6D] [^117DpAmT].
- **Low-risk procedures**: Do not transfuse prophylactically [^111uLA6D] [^112bKesV].

---

### Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)

Avoid **routine FFP**; **do not use it for prophylaxis** in stable cirrhosis [^111uLA6D] [^117EUKKT]. Use **active bleeding** with INR > 1.5 only if there is concurrent active bleeding and after careful consideration of risks [^114fAU1m] [^117EUKKT].

---

### Cryoprecipitate

Use only for **fibrinogen < 1.0–1.5 g/L** with active bleeding or high-risk procedures [^117DpAmT] [^1111Wj1a].

---

## Risks associated with transfusion in cirrhosis

Transfusion in cirrhosis carries **unique risks**:

- **Portal hypertension**: Volume expansion increases portal pressure and rebleeding risk [^116rRgF6] [^114ViXsS].
- **Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)**: Higher risk with plasma-containing products [^114ViXsS].
- **Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)**: Common in cirrhosis [^notfound].
- **Alloimmunization**: Impairs future transfusions and transplantation [^114ViXsS] [^11558Wrf].
- **Infection risk**: Increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections [^112S9q2a].

---

## Alternative strategies to minimize transfusion

Several strategies can **reduce transfusion needs**:

- **Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM)**: Guides targeted therapy and reduces unnecessary transfusions [^1136d48s] [^113eKbaj].
- **Thrombopoietin receptor agonists**: Avatrombopag or lusutrombopag can raise platelets pre-procedure, reducing transfusion needs [^116DSJjx] [^114azXrV].
- **Local hemostatic measures**: Endoscopic therapy, fibrin sealants, and compression reduce bleeding without systemic transfusion [^117HoYkC].

## Summary of transfusion thresholds and recommendations

| **Blood product** | **Indication** | **Threshold** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RBC | Active bleeding or anemia | Hb 7–8 g/dL | Restrictive strategy (target 7–9 g/dL) [^116rRgF6] [^111TbqKu] [^111N2vCi] |
| Platelets | Active bleeding or high-risk procedure | < 50×10⁹/L | Transfuse selectively [^117Pbyc4] [^111uLA6D] [^117DpAmT] |
| FFP | Active bleeding with INR > 1.5 | INR > 1.5 | Use selectively, avoid prophylaxis [^114fAU1m] [^111uLA6D] [^117EUKKT] |
| Cryoprecipitate | Active bleeding with low fibrinogen | < 1.0–1.5 g/L | Use selectively [^117DpAmT] [^1111Wj1a] |

---

Transfuse cirrhotic patients only when clearly indicated, favoring a **restrictive RBC strategy** and selective platelet/FFP/cryoprecipitate use. Use **TEG/ROTEM** and pharmacologic platelet augmentation to minimize transfusions and their risks.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^116uzRgN]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for select patient populations have been published in some jurisdictions, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The British Society for Gastroenterology published guidelines on the management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. They recommend albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The French Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and the French Association for the Study of the Liver jointly released guidelines for the management of liver failure in critical care. They recommend the use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (with terlipressin), large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines from 2021recommend the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis, severe muscle cramps, severe hyponatremia (sodium < 120 mEq/L), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology guidelines update from 2020 include the use of albumin for ascites requiring moderate doses of diuretics as an outpatient treatment. This was an update from their 2016 guidelines that also recommended the use of albumin in patients requiring large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or with hepatorenal syndrome. Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines detailing the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis recommended albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with acute kidney injury without known cause, or with hepatorenal syndrome. The ICTMG guidelines are concordant with these guidelines for recommending albumin for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but report insufficient evidence to support its use in other settings. The use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, in conjunction with terlipressin, was recommended commonly in prior guidelines, likely based on both expert opinion and the fact that randomized trials used albumin in both treatment arms (albumin vs albumin plus terlipressin). We elected to refrain from making a recommendation without clinical trial evidence to support its use and highlight that this indication needs further study.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^111uLA6D]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Preprocedural blood product transfusion in stable cirrhosis — For patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing common gastrointestinal procedures (eg, paracentesis, thoracentesis, variceal banding, colonic polypectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP], and liver biopsy), the AGA suggests against the routine use of blood products (eg, fresh frozen plasma [FFP] or platelets [PLTs]) for bleeding prophylaxis. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). This recommendation applies to the majority of patients with stable cirrhosis who usually do not have severe thrombocytopenia or severe coagulopathy, and in those with severe derangements in coagulation or thrombocytopenia undergoing a high-risk procedure, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include discussion about potential benefits and risks (including transfusion reactions and delay of procedures) in consultation with a hematologist.

### Clinical application of thromboelastography in patients with cirrhosis: a single center experience [^116iFVJg]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thromboelastography (TEG) is a functional test of coagulation used to guide transfusions. Despite literature supporting its utility, its use remains limited to select populations. In patients with cirrhosis, conventional coagulation tests are notoriously inaccurate, and TEG may be a better measure of coagulopathy. We aimed to assess the utilization of TEG in patients with cirrhosis to steward blood transfusions in this high-risk group.

Methods

A single-center retrospective chart review of all patients ≥ 18 y old with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis who had TEG results documented in the electronic medical record from January 1 to November 1, 2021.

Results

There were 277 TEG results on 89 patients with cirrhosis. Overall, 91% of the TEGs performed were associated with a clinical indication for transfusion. However, of the patients who were transfused, abnormal TEG values, including elevated R time and reduced maximum amplitude, did not correspond to transfusion of indicated blood products (fresh frozen plasma and platelets). A reduction in alpha angle showed a statistically significant association with transfusion of cryoprecipitate (P < 0.05). When assessing conventional coagulation tests, abnormal values were not significantly associated with transfusion (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Despite TEG suggesting that transfusions could be avoided in many cirrhotic patients, patients are still being transfused platelets and fresh frozen plasma in the absence of evidence of coagulopathy on TEG. Our finding suggests the need for education about appropriate utilization of TEG. More research is needed to understand the role of these tests to guide transfusion practices in patients with cirrhosis.

### TEG® and ROTEM® in trauma: similar test but different results? [^116A11Uv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulation is a complex, dynamic, highly regulated and interwoven process involving a myriad of cells, molecules and structures. Only recently, the unique changes in coagulation caused by trauma are starting to be understood, but remain mostly unknown. Trauma patients are among the largest consumers of blood and blood products and the decision of what, when and how much blood and blood product to transfuse is often empiric or based on traditional coagulation lab tests such as INR/PT, PTT and platelet count. However, traditional lab tests have been heavily criticized for their limitations in assisting the physicians with the clinical decision to transfuse, and alternatives are warranted.

The traditional laboratorial evaluation of coagulation evolved initially to quantify specific cellular, molecular or factor deficiencies. Numeric values (quantity) of individual elements do not necessarily indicate how well hemostasis is functioning. As an example, a cirrhotic patient with low platelet count and an abnormal INR of 2 does not necessarily bleed and probably can tolerate minor invasive procedures. In contrast, a hypothermic trauma patient with normal platelet count and INR might bleed to death. Another limitation of traditional lab tests is the prolonged time to obtain the results or turnaround time. Dealing with rapid changes as frequently occurs in massively bleeding trauma patients, is challenging. In such situations, any delay in obtaining the lab results can lead to inadequate transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality. Thus in trauma, global, functional and immediately available laboratorial evaluation of hemostasis can improve both patient management and outcome.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of variceal hemorrhage, blood product transfusion, AASLD 2017 guidelines recommend to administer packed RBC transfusion when the hemoglobin level reaches a threshold of around 7 g/dL, with the goal of maintaining hemoglobin 7–9 g/dL.

These guidelines also suggest that the most effective pharmacotherapy is propranolol at a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, increasing to 80 mg twice daily if necessary. 9If propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated, isosorbide mononitrate at a dosage of 20 mg twice daily is the treatment of choice. 9Studies conducted since these guidelines have titrated the dosage of propranolol based on a reduction of the pulse rate by 25 percent. 15, 16. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding. 9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9.

9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.
17. Liver Transplantation When standard medical and procedural therapy has failed to control the complications of cirrhosis, liver transplantation should be considered. Unnecessary surgical procedures should be avoided and risks versus benefits weighed before any surgical procedure is performed in patients with cirrhosis.

Since the first successful liver transplant in 1967, there has been a growing disparity between the number of potential candidates and the number of donors. INDICATIONS Potential candidates for liver transplantation include any patient with documented fulminant hepatic failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or a hepatocellular carcinoma with no single lesion greater than 5 cm or no more than three lesions with the largest being 3 cm or smaller.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114vCwNZ]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evidence-base guiding the use of intravenous albumin was largely instigated by the Cochrane Injuries Group Albumin systematic review in 1998, which raised the concern for harm from albumin. Subsequent to this publication, RCTs comparing albumin with other fluid treatments in multiple patient populations were completed. These trials failed to confirm the concerns for higher mortality rates in albumin-treated patients. The ICTMG undertook these evidence-based albumin guidelines because no comprehensive evidence-based guidelines had been published yet. The goal of the guidelines is to provide clinicians with recommendations and evidence summaries for common indications for albumin, information on ongoing clinical trials, and areas in need of additional research. The ICTMG guidelines group suggested that albumin should not be used routinely for neonatal, pediatric, and adult patients in critical care; for patients experiencing intradialytic hypotension; for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery; for admitted patients with cirrhosis for treatment (or correction) of hypoalbuminemia or extraperitoneal infections; or for outpatients with ascites. The ICTMG guidelines conditionally recommended the use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One of 14 recommendations was a strong recommendation based on more definitive clinical trial evidence, but most of the recommendations were conditional based on low- or very low-quality evidence because of the paucity or conflicting RCT evidence, highlighting the need for ongoing research. The implementation of the guidelines will help to reduce the unnecessary transfusion of albumin and the variability between hospitals.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^116PaW3b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with cirrhosis frequently have complex alterations in their hemostatic system. Although routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis (platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen level) are suggestive of a bleeding tendency, it is now widely accepted that these tests do not reflect hemostatic competence in this population. Rather, patients with cirrhosis appear to have a rebalanced hemostatic system with hypercoagulable elements. Therefore, routine correction of hemostasis laboratory values, for example by fresh frozen plasma or platelet concentrates, with the aim to avoid spontaneous or procedure‐related bleeding is not indicated as is outlined in recent clinical guidance documents. However, little guidance on how to manage patients with cirrhosis that are actively bleeding is available. Here we present three common bleeding scenarios, variceal bleeding, post‐procedural bleeding and bleeding in a critically ill cirrhosis patient, with specific management suggestions. As patients with cirrhosis generally have adequate hemostatic competence and as bleeding complications may be unrelated to hemostatic failure, prohemostatic therapy is not the first line of management in bleeding patients with cirrhosis, even in the presence of markedly abnormal platelet counts and/or prothrombin times. We provide a rationale for the restrictive approach to prohemostatic therapy in bleeding patients with cirrhosis.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^1173i9Ua]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Cirrhosis and ACLF — coagulation assessment and venous thromboembolism (VTE) management: INR, although strongly linked with liver function in the absence of vitamin K deficiency, does not measure coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, whereas thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are viscoelastic tests that are more physiologic than standard testing. Normal TEG or ROTEM measurements in compensated or decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF can avoid blood product transfusion for procedures even with elevated INR, and TEG-guided assessment decreases transfusions without changing rebleeding risk. When TEG/ROTEM are unavailable, fibrinogen and platelet levels should be evaluated, and no data support prophylactic transfusions in the absence of bleeding or need for invasive procedures. In patients with cirrhosis without ACLF, a rebalancing in coagulation occurs but hypercoagulability can be found; one cannot justify therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) chronically without a thrombus, whereas full-dose anticoagulation should be used for acute thromboembolic events, especially symptomatic acute portal vein thrombosis in the absence of contraindications. Hospitalized cirrhotic patients are at higher VTE risk than noncirrhhotics; pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to increase bleeding overall, but patients with recent bleeding and significant thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 50 × 10⁹/L) are not optimal candidates for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116rqMVX]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute VH coagulopathy management notes that RCTs of recombinant factor VIIa have not shown a clear benefit, and therefore correcting the international normalized ratio (INR) by fresh frozen plasma or factor VIIa is not recommended, particularly because INR is not a reliable indicator of coagulation status in cirrhosis; no recommendations can be given regarding platelet transfusion in patients with VH.

### Should patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3 receive higher priority for liver transplantation? [^1146jmuS]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this debate, the authors consider whether patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3 (ACLF-3) should receive higher liver transplant priority, with reference to the following clinical case: a 62-year-old male with a history of decompensated alcohol-associated cirrhosis, with recurrent ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, and metabolic comorbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and a BMI of 31 kg/m²). A few days following evaluation for liver transplantation (LT), the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed on mechanical ventilation for neurological failure, FiO₂ of 0.3 with a SpO₂ of 98%, and started on norepinephrine at 0.62 μg/kg/min. He had been abstinent since the diagnosis of cirrhosis a year prior. Laboratory results at admission were: leukocyte count 12.1 G/L, international normalised ratio 2.1, creatinine 2.4 mg/dl, sodium 133 mmol/L, total bilirubin 7 mg/dl, lactate 5.5 mmol/L, with a MELD-Na score of 31 and a CLIF-C ACLF score of 67. On the 7 th day after admission, the patient was placed on the LT waiting list. On the same day, he had massive variceal bleed with hypovolemic shock requiring terlipressin, transfusion of three red blood cell units, and endoscopic band ligation. On day 10, the patient was stabilised with a low dose of norepinephrine 0.03 μg/kg/min, with no new sepsis or bleeding. However, the patient was still intubated for grade 2 hepatic encephalopathy and on renal replacement therapy with a lactate level of 3.1 mmol/L. The patient is currently categorised as having ACLF-3, with five organ failures (liver, kidney, coagulation, circulation, and respiration). Based on the severity of his liver disease and multiorgan failure, the patient is at an exceedingly high risk of death without LT. Is it appropriate to perform LT in such a patient?

### Recommendations on the use of recombinant activated factor VII as an adjunctive treatment for massive bleeding – a European perspective [^112r3Feh]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Our aim was to develop consensus guidelines for use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in massive hemorrhage.

Methods

A guidelines committee derived the recommendations using clinical trial and case series data identified through searches of available databases. Guidelines were graded on a scale of A-E according to the strength of evidence available. Consensus was sought among the committee for each recommendation.

Results

A recommendation for use of rFVIIa in blunt trauma was made (grade B). rFVIIa might also be beneficial in post-partum hemorrhage (grade E), uncontrolled bleeding in surgical patients (grade E) and bleeding following cardiac surgery (grade D). rFVIIa could not be recommended for use: in penetrating trauma (grade B); prophylactically in elective surgery (grade A) or liver surgery (grade B); or in bleeding episodes in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis (grade B). Efficacy of rFVIIa was considered uncertain in bleeding episodes in patients with Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis (grade C). Monitoring of rFVIIa efficacy should be performed visually and by assessment of transfusion requirements (grade E), while thromboembolic adverse events are a cause for concern. rFVIIa should not be administered to patients considered unsalvageable by the treating medical team.

Conclusions

There is a rationale for using rFVIIa to treat massive bleeding in certain indications; however, only adjunctively to the surgical control of bleeding once conventional therapies have failed. Lack of data from randomized, controlled clinical trials, and possible publication bias of the case series data, limits the strength of the recommendations that can be made.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^116Lp7es]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Volume resuscitation and blood products

Intravenous access (two 16–18G cannulae) should have been secured on admission with a reported GI bleed. Further intravenous access may be necessary. In patients with poor venous access, advanced liver disease, or renal failure associated with their liver disease, central venous access may be helpful with guiding fluid infusions. However, the drawbacks include the risk of the procedure and a potential source of infection. Therefore, there is no absolute requirement for a central line, and no evidence of unequivocal benefit. Intravenous fluid resuscitation should be initiated with plasma expanders aiming to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. Care with monitoring is paramount in this group of patients.

Overtransfusion has been shown to have a deleterious effect on outcome. In a recent single-centre RCT, a restrictive transfusion policy of maintaining haemoglobin between 70 and 80 g/L improved the control of variceal bleeding (11% vs 22%, p = 0.05), and lowered HVPG compared with a liberal transfusion policy without effect on 45-day survival. However, it should be noted that these results were from a single Spanish centre, which was a tertiary unit for variceal bleeding, where all patients underwent endoscopy within 6 h. Nonetheless, a restrictive transfusion policy has been recommended for some timeand there is now good evidence to support not transfusing a stable patient with a haemoglobin of ≥ 80 g/L. However, under-resuscitation should also be avoided and while goal-oriented fluid replacement has generally not been useful in an intensive therapy unit setting, a venous saturation > 70% remains an easily measurable target with some evidence to support it.

Interpretation and management of clotting profile is challenging in liver disease, where there is usually a balanced deficiency of both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. The NICE guidelines recommend activation of a hospital's massive transfusion policy when there is major haemorrhage, and platelet support when the value is < 50, and clotting factor support when the international normalised ratio (INR) is > 1.5 times normal. There is no evidence for the use of 'prophylactic' clotting or platelet support to reduce the risk of rebleeding. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of transexamic acid, or recombinant factor VIIa.

### Blood transfusion for upper gastrointestinal bleeding: is less more again? [^113DVewj]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red blood cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy.

Objective

The objective was to prove that the restrictive threshold for red blood cell transfusion in patients with acute upper GI bleeding (UGIB) was safer and more effective than a liberal transfusion strategy.

Results

In total, 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%) and 65 assigned to the liberal strategy (15%) did not receive transfusions (P < 0.001). The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% versus 91%; hazard ratio (HR) for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92; P = 0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group and in 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85) but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P = 0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy.

Conclusions

Compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute UGIB.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^116Pg8B2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

The concept of rebalanced hemostasis in patients with liver disease has, to some extent, led to changes in prophylactic hemostatic management. For example, in patients undergoing liver transplant surgery many centers have changed from a protocol driven preoperative correction of thrombocytopenia and a prolonged PT, to an on‐demand strategy in which abnormal laboratory values are accepted and prohemostatic therapy is only given when intraoperative bleeding complications occur. Similarly, prophylactic correction of abnormal laboratory values is discouraged for other invasive procedures by societal guidance documents. Nevertheless, implementation of a much more restrictive approach to prophylactic prohemostatic therapy is not universal due to the lack of randomized trial evidence, and a continued belief that abnormal laboratory tests require correction.

Although there is extensive literature describing expert opinion on best practices for prophylactic prohemostatic therapy in patients with cirrhosis, there is very little literature on how to manage active bleeding in these patients. Given that bleeding in patients with cirrhosis may not be directly related to hemostatic failure and hemostatic balance in patients with cirrhosis is generally maintained despite thrombocytopenia and prolongations in the PT and APTT, strategies to manage active bleeding in these patients are not straightforward and may not necessarily involve prohemostatic interventions. Here, we will present three cases of bleeding complications in patients with cirrhosis with considerations on how to best manage these bleeds.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^111NuKVG]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Correction of prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not recommended, even for high-risk procedures — in some cases plasma expansion can exacerbate PHTN and increase bleeding risk. Platelet infusion/thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists are not recommended if platelets are > 50×10⁹ or if bleeding can be treated by local haemostasis. For people with a platelet count < 50×10⁹ undergoing high-risk procedures platelet transfusion/TPO-R agonists should not be required routinely but should be considered on a case-by-case basis, particularly if platelet count < 20×10⁹.TPO-R agonist should be used with caution in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and dose adjustments may be required. Consider discussing with haematology and refer to local protocols. If possible, haemoglobin, iron, folic acid and B 12 should be optimised prior to high-risk procedures.

### Comparison of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of central lines in patients with thrombocytopenia [^116ppfmV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require the insertion of central lines (central venous catheters (CVCs)). CVCs have a number of uses; these include: administration of chemotherapy; intensive monitoring and treatment of critically-ill patients; administration of total parenteral nutrition; and long-term intermittent intravenous access for patients requiring repeated treatments. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to CVC insertion, in order to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended prior to CVC insertion varies significantly from country to country. This indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians of the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding after a central line insertion appears to be low if an ultrasound-guided technique is used. Patients may therefore be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a central line in patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 23 February 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in patients of any age with thrombocytopenia requiring insertion of a CVC.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

One RCT was identified that compared different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of a CVC in people with chronic liver disease. This study is still recruiting participants (expected recruitment: up to 165 participants) and is due to be completed in December 2017. There were no completed studies. There were no studies that compared no platelet transfusions to a platelet transfusion threshold.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from RCTs to determine whether platelet transfusions are required prior to central line insertion in patients with thrombocytopenia, and, if a platelet transfusion is required, what is the correct platelet transfusion threshold. Further randomised trials with robust methodology are required to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for such patients. The one ongoing RCT involving people with cirrhosis will not be able to answer this review's questions, because it is a small study that assesses one patient group and does not address all of the comparisons included in this review. To detect an increase in the proportion of participants who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100 would require a study containing at least 4634 participants (80% power, 5% significance).

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115aWaGu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Best practice advice on perioperative hemostasis in cirrhosis — There are no established preoperative safety thresholds for common laboratory values related to bleeding and clotting, and the INR is not predictive of procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis. In vitro studies suggest that a platelet count > 50,000/μL is adequate to generate thrombin and provide stable clot formation, and clinical studies show an increased bleeding tendency in patients with a platelet count lower than this threshold; critically ill patients with plasma fibrinogen levels < 100 mg/dL may have more bleeding events. Handle coagulation management on a case-by-case basis preferably using viscoelastic testing directed therapy and avoid needless transfusions or volume overload.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^1136d48s]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — procedural bleeding risk and transfusion strategies in cirrhosis/ACLF: Bleeding rates for paracentesis (0%–3.3%) and thoracentesis (2%) in patients with cirrhosis are low and do not require routine preprocedural coagulation assessment in decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF. Reported bleeding rates for liver biopsy are higher in patients with < 50 platelets/L, and transjugular liver biopsy is relatively safe even with decreased platelet counts or prolonged INR. When correction is needed, transfusion of low volume cryoprecipitate or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate are preferred to high-volume fresh frozen plasma. TEG-guided strategies resulted in fewer blood transfusions compared with standard of care without differences in failure to control bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality; in a randomized trial of 60 patients undergoing invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion (fresh frozen plasma trigger: reaction time > 40 min; platelet trigger: maximum amplitude < 30 mm) decreased transfusions (16.7% vs. 100%; p < 0.0001) with no difference in bleeding or 90-day mortality.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115VHNcY]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A 2021 systematic review of RCTs evaluating outpatient hyperoncotic albumin for patients with cirrhosis and ascites identified five trials (N = 716). The systematic review found no difference in mortality at 12 to 36 months (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67–1.14) or any other outcome, with the exception of reducing the need for paracentesis (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.48–0.67). Two large randomized trials were included in the review. The first unmasked trial randomized 440 patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated, persistent ascites despite diuretic therapy to albumin (40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks and then 40 g weekly for up to 18 months) or no albumin. Patients randomized to albumin experienced longer time to first paracentesis; required fewer paracenteses; were less likely to demonstrate hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, nonperitonitis infections, hyponatremia, or episodes of kidney dysfunction; experienced fewer days in hospital; and showed lower all-cause mortality (77% vs 66% survival at 18 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.95). The most important limitation of this study is that the albumin-treated patients underwent weekly health care interactions and the control group did not, raising the concern that the observed differences may have been the result of increased health care exposure. The second trial randomized 196 outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites awaiting liver transplantation to oral midodrine and albumin as compared with placebo tablets and a 0.9% saline infusion and found no difference in patient outcomes. The dose of albumin given as part of the intervention was lower (40 g every 15 days). The study improved on the methodology of the first trial by achieving masking to treatment assignment and ensuring the same health care exposure in both study groups.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — preemptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) before surgery — notes that only a few case reports and uncontrolled case series have assessed the benefit of preemptive TIPS before surgery; although a decrease in intraoperative transfusions is claimed, the available studies have been uncontrolled and the frequency of complications is not reported; in a retrospective study comparing patients with preoperative TIPS to controls, there was no difference in red blood cell or plasma transfusion requirements between the 2 groups; additionally, misplacement into the right atrium, inferior vena cava, or mesenteric veins may adversely affect future liver transplantation.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG)-led multisociety consensus care bundle for the early clinical management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116qgYkF]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

We recommend that patients with AUGIB with ongoing haemodynamic instability are referred for critical care review

Level of evidence: Very low

Level of recommendation: Strong

Agreement: 100%

Bundle recommendation: If haemodynamically unstable, consider activating major haemorrhage protocol and arranging critical care review (added as standalone statement in bundle)

The study by Baradarian et al associated intensive monitoring and management of haemodynamic instability with improved outcomes. Patients with AUGIB may also suffer complications caused by non-hypovolaemic causes of shock, for example, sepsis in patients with cirrhosis. Haemodynamic instability per se should not be the sole determinant for critical care admission. In cases of ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate resuscitative efforts, activation of the major haemorrhage protocol should be considered in addition to early referral to a critical care specialist in order to optimise circulatory management.

We suggest that platelets should be given in active AUGIB with a platelet count ≤ 50 × 10⁹/L, as per major haemorrhage protocols

Level of evidence: Very low

Level of recommendation: Weak

Agreement: 90%

Bundle recommendation: Keep platelet count > 50 (included as part of major haemorrhage protocol, therefore no separate statement required)

No RCTs have assessed the role of platelet transfusions or platelet transfusion thresholds. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of platelet transfusions or the optimal dose when a patient with a thrombocytopenia is actively bleeding. In patients without pre-existing thrombocytopenia, acquired thrombocytopenia may be a late event in major haemorrhage, occurring after blood loss of at least 1.5 total blood volumes. Guidance for a platelet transfusion threshold in major bleeding is based on expert opinion only, and is consistently recommended by NICEand the British Society for Haematology. Due to the limited evidence and its coverage within the major haemorrhage protocol, a separate bundle statement for thrombocytopaenia correction was not included.

### Pre-procedural use of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists in cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114azXrV]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis can preclude invasive procedures. Platelet transfusion is recommended if platelet count pre-procedure is potential alternative to platelet transfusion is thrombopoietin-receptor (TPO) agonists.

Aim

Evaluate TPO-agonist efficacy and safety in cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures.

Methods

Randomized control trials (RCT) from electronic reference databases were searched from inception till December 2019. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Primary outcome was platelet transfusion avoidance. Secondary outcomes were weighted mean difference (WMD) in platelet count from baseline to pre-procedure and rates of major adverse events (AE). Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Six RCTs with 1,229 patients were included. All studies had low risk of bias. Compared with placebo, those treated with TPO-agonists had a pooled OR of 0.12(0.08–0.17), P < 0.01 for platelet transfusion avoidance, and WMD in platelet count (×10³/µL) of 35.6(28.6–42.7), P < 0.01. Major AE did not differ between groups [Pooled OR: 0.87(0.47–1.62), P = 0.66].

Conclusion

Compared to placebo, TPO-agonists used in cirrhotic patients with severe thrombocytopenia prior to elective invasive procedures had 88% reduced odds of requiring peri-procedural platelet transfusion and increased platelet count pre-procedure, with no difference in AE rates.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^117VDHfy]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently have complex alterations in their hemostatic system. Although routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis in cirrhosis (platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen level) are suggestive of a bleeding tendency, it is now widely accepted that these tests do not reflect hemostatic competence in this population. Rather, patients with cirrhosis appear to have a rebalanced hemostatic system with hypercoagulable elements. Therefore, routine correction of hemostasis laboratory values, for example by fresh frozen plasma or platelet concentrates, with the aim to avoid spontaneous or procedure-related bleeding is not indicated as is outlined in recent clinical guidance documents. However, little guidance on how to manage patients with cirrhosis that are actively bleeding is available. Here we present three common bleeding scenarios, variceal bleeding, post-procedural bleeding and bleeding in a critically ill cirrhosis patient, with specific management suggestions. As patients with cirrhosis generally have adequate hemostatic competence and as bleeding complications may be unrelated to hemostatic failure, prohemostatic therapy is not the first line of management in bleeding patients with cirrhosis, even in the presence of markedly abnormal platelet counts and/or prothrombin times. We provide a rationale for the restrictive approach to prohemostatic therapy in bleeding patients with cirrhosis.

### Procedural bleeding risk, rather than conventional coagulation tests, predicts procedure related bleeding in cirrhosis [^112DyC4Z]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard coagulation parameters are used to guide prophylactic blood product transfusion prior to invasive procedures in cirrhotic patients despite limited high-quality evidence.

Aims

We aimed to describe coagulation parameters and prophylactic blood product use in cirrhotic patients having invasive procedures, and the influence of both on periprocedural bleeding.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study of cirrhotic patients undergoing invasive procedures at a referral hospital. Procedures were classified into low or moderate-high bleeding risk. Prophylactic blood component was defined as fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or platelet transfusion prior to procedures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with procedure-related bleeding.

Results

We identified 566 procedures in 233 cirrhotic patients. Prophylactic blood product was given before 16% of high-risk and 11% of low-risk procedures (P = 0.18). Eight (8.3%) high-risk procedures were complicated by postprocedural bleeding, six of which occurred in patients without significant coagulopathy. The bleeding rate for low-risk procedures was 0.4%. For patients with international normalized ratio > 1.5, platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L, or both, the rate of bleeding was comparable between those given and not given prophylactic blood products (3.1 vs. 1.9%; P = 0.63). After adjusting for age, sex, platelet count, international normalized ratio, acute kidney injury, sepsis and model of end-stage liver disease, the only factor significantly predicting procedure-related bleeding was the procedural bleeding risk category (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Procedure-related bleeding in cirrhotic patients cannot be accurately predicted by INR or platelet count, nor prevented by blood component prophylaxis using these parameters. Procedure-related bleeding is best predicted by the bleeding risk status of procedures.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^116PEqqq]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Procedural bleeding risk mitigation in cirrhosis prioritizes hemostatic targets including platelets ≥ 50,000 by infusion or with TPO agonist if elective, with rechecking platelets recommended when bleeding risk is assessed as greater than minimal, and fibrinogen ≥ 120 mg/dL best achieved with cryoprecipitate; weight-based dosing usually raises fibrinogen level by 50 mg/dL. Superimposed renal failure is associated with uremic platelet dysfunction, volume issues, and changes in hemostatic cascade, and a hematocrit of ≥ 25% is suggested because it improves platelet margination. The need for prophylactic measures depends on procedure risk assessment, and minor procedures like paracentesis/thoracentesis and upper endoscopy with banding do not require prophylaxis.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114Gt31E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Management of hemostatic derangements — perioperative care in cirrhosis: If available, viscoelastic testing such as TEG may be considered to guide management of coagulopathy in the perioperative setting for patients with cirrhosis rather than reliance on traditional hemostatic markers alone to minimize periprocedural bleeding risk; if viscoelastic testing is not available, it is reasonable to correct severe thrombocytopenia (< 50 K/mm³) prior to major surgery. Use of vitamin K or blood products to correct elevated INR prior to major surgery has not been demonstrated to reduce bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis, and vitamin K administration has not been studied in the preoperative setting, with routine use not reducing the risk of bleeding in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. In one study of invasive procedures, a PLT count of < 75 K/mm³ was independently associated with periprocedural bleeding in the setting of significant coagulopathy (INR > 1.5). Several randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis showed reduced utilization of blood product transfusions without increased incidence of bleeding when TEG was evaluated in cirrhosis, including an RCT of 58 patients where only 31% received preprocedural blood products with TEG vs 100% with standard care, with no patients in either group developing periprocedural bleeding; although TEG has not been studied in patients with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery.

### Prediction and limitation of hepatic tumor resection without blood transfusion in cirrhotic patients… [^1169PC8R]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

LIVER RESECTION in cirrhotic patients is usually associated with large amounts of operative blood loss and blood transfusion. 1–3 However, cirrhotic patients do not tolerate homologous blood transfusion well. 1–4 Adverse effects of blood transfusion, such as transmission of infectious diseases, reduction in immunity, and poor prognosis of malignant diseases, are more apparent in cirrhotic patients than in noncirrhotic patients, even when the transfusion amount is minimal. 5–9. Operative blood loss was estimated as the sum of the blood absorbed from gauzes and from suctionings. 1, 3, 10 The need for blood transfusion was determined by the anesthesiologists under intraoperative monitoring of blood loss, hematocrit, vital signs, urinary output, and blood gas analysis. Operative morbidity and mortality were defined as complications and deaths that occurred within 30 days after operation or during the same hospitalization.

These leaked body fluids may be counted as blood loss by conventional estimation methods. 3, 7, 10 Because cirrhotic patients may tolerate some degree of anemia, 3, 7it is unnecessary to replace all of the estimated blood loss by homologous blood transfusion, if the hemodynamic condition and peripheral tissue oxygen concentration are stable. 3, 6, 7 We found that no blood transfusion was needed in some patients even when estimated blood loss exceeded 2000 mL. Due to difficulties in estimating the actual operative blood loss during resection of cirrhotic liver, blood transfusion was carried out on a case-by-case basis by monitoring intraoperative vital signs and hematocrit. The causes of 2 deaths in this series were unrelated to our blood transfusion strategy. By discriminant analysis, about 90% of cirrhotic patients did not require blood transfusion during hepatectomy when estimated blood loss was less than 1685 mL.

As in other reports, 6, 7, 9 hepatectomy in cirrhotic patients who receive a blood transfusion was associated with higher morbidity rate and longer hospital stay. From our study, the need for blood transfusion in cirrhotic liver resection can be predicted; thus, suitable management can be selected for cirrhotic patients with liver tumor. Prediction of blood transfusion requirement is useful for particular groups of patients, such as Jehovah's Witnesses17 or those with rare blood types, in whom liver resection should be performed without blood transfusion.

### Thromboelastography-guided versus standard-of-care or on-demand platelet transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia undergoing procedures: a randomized controlled trial [^114RoZqz]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the rate of platelet transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 50 × 10⁹/L) undergoing high-risk invasive procedures when prescribed by thromboelastography (TEG) compared with empirical and on-demand transfusion strategies.

Materials and Methods

This was a single-center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures were randomized into 3 groups: TEG group, transfusions based on TEG parameters; standard of care (SOC) group, 3 units of random donor platelets before procedure; and on-demand group, transfusions based on procedural adverse events/clinician's discretion. The primary outcome was periprocedural platelet transfusion in each arm.

Results

Eighty-seven patients were randomized (29 in each group) with no significant differences in demographics/coagulation profile/procedures. The median platelet count was 33 × 10⁹/L (interquartile range, 26–43 × 10⁹/L). Percutaneous liver biopsy was the most common procedure (46, 52.9%). Significantly lower number of patients in the TEG group received platelets (4 cases, 13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9–31.7) compared with SOC group (100%; 95% CI, 88.1–100; P < .001). Four patients in the on-demand group received platelets (13.8%; 95% CI, 3.9–31.7). Minor (World Health Organization [WHO] Grade 2) procedure-related bleeding occurred in 3 (10%; 95% CI, 2.2–27.4) patients in the TEG-guided transfusion group compared with 1 (3.4%; 95% CI, 0.1–17.8) patient each in the SOC and on-demand groups (P = 0.43), although the study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates. No bleeding-related mortality was observed in any of the 3 groups.

Conclusions

TEG-prescribed transfusion reduced prophylactic transfusions in patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia undergoing high-risk invasive procedures. The study was not powered for comparison of bleeding rates.

Utilization of pro-coagulants, including blood products — most hepatology practices in the past utilized fresh frozen plasma and pooled platelet transfusions to the exclusion of other agents, and it is worth reconsidering these practice patterns and incorporating other agents that have lower volume and risk while considering the immunologic and infectious risks of transfusion, volume administered, and risks for clotting.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1172CSMh]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany published perioperative fluid guidelines for children in 2017. They recommended that colloids, including albumin, be used during surgery where crystalloids alone are not sufficiently effective and blood products are not indicated. In 2021, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended the use of albumin in the fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic shock when patients required large volumes of crystalloids.

Five RCTs that will enroll an additional 4,864 patients are ongoing and are expected to provide additional clarity on the role of albumin (Table 2). These trials will add clarity to the ICTMG recommendations for intensive care patients with infection, high-risk adult cardiac surgery, patients with acute kidney injury receiving kidney replacement therapy, and outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Table 2
Ongoing, Large Randomized Clinical Trials Comparing IV Albumin With Alternative Treatments

This guideline is limited by the uncertainty in the evidence identified in the literature search for many different patient populations and the limitation of the search to the English language. The lack of comparative dosing strategies leaves uncertainty on the choice between 4% to 5% and 20% to 25% albumin formulations, the dose for each indication, the risk of fluid overload, and the dosing schedules. The guidelines are limited to common uses of albumin and cannot address every possible patient scenario where albumin has been used in RCTs. The published studies often did not collect or did report adverse reactions from IV albumin, or both, limiting the conclusions regarding the potential risks of albumin. These guidelines improve on those previously published because of the rigorous methodology, broad scope of the recommendations, inclusion of a patient representative in the guideline process, and broad community consultation process. The guidelines will be supported by tools developed by the ICTMG Dissemination and Implementation Committee to assist hospitals with aligning practice with the evidence.

Future research is needed in multiple clinical settings including: (1) the role and timing of albumin in patients with sepsis or other conditions with insufficient response to crystalloids, (2) the role of albumin in patients undergoing surgery, (3) the role of albumin for intradialytic hypotension, and (4) the role of albumin in all indications for patients with cirrhosis. Research also is needed to understand therapeutic targets of albumin resuscitation (hemodynamic, urinary output, laboratory), the optimal formulation, and the dosing strategy. The risk of IV albumin infusions needs further investigation to allow clinicians to weigh the risk to benefit profile appropriately. Studies should include patient-important outcomes, rather than focusing on short-term physiologic outcomes.

### Specific items of enhanced recovery after surgery for liver surgery in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review [^117WasSg]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Perioperative Anticoagulation

New data have shown that several changes favor hemostasis and other increase the bleeding risk in cirrhotic patients (procoagulant effect: increased von Willenbrandt factor and anticoagulant effect: thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction). A 2018 prospective study found that cirrhotic patients had similar coagulation profiles as noncirrhotic patients after liver surgery, but patients were often in a hypercoagulable state.

Furthermore, classic prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times should not be used in cirrhotic patients to guide transfusion. Viscoelastic tests, such as ROTEM, should be preferred.

Some studies in cirrhotic rats have shown that injection of activated protein C or soluble thrombomodulin after extended hepatectomy permitted to decrease the postoperative liver dysfunction, but no data currently exist in human.

Preoperative anemia should be diagnosed and corrected preoperatively if possible. In case of significant intraoperative bleeding, platelets in addition to RBC should be administered and a thrombocyte threshold of 50,000/mm³ should be aimed. As in other hepatectomy, low central venous pressure during resection should be maintained to decrease the bleeding risk.

A recent meta‐analysis of eight studies, including 4238 patients, recommended pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis to decrease the risk of posthepatectomy thromboembolic events. Of note, three studies included only cirrhotic patients and were in favor of using perioperative mixed thromboprophylaxis. A conference consensus, including HPB surgeons and hematology specialists, published in 2016 suggested to use venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients after hepatectomy if hemoglobin values are stable, platelet level > 100,000 mm³, and INR < 1.8.

The evidence level was judged as moderate for this item.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115BWA7Q]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Guidelines Focus

These recommendations apply to patients receiving albumin in critical care settings with hypovolemia, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, thermal injuries, and ARDS; cirrhosis; intradialytic hypotension; and cardiovascular surgery. These settings were included based on common uses of albumin, the systematic review of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and with input from the panel. We included studies that compared the use of albumin with that of other resuscitation fluids, other pharmaceutical treatments, or standard of care.

Target Population

These guidelines provide actionable recommendations for the most common indications for the use of albumin. The use of albumin for therapeutic apheresis was excluded because recent guidelines were published.

Guidelines Development Process

Panel Composition

This guideline development process was funded by the Ontario Regional Blood Coordinating Network (Ontario, Canada) and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG; funded by Canadian Blood Services). Neither entity had any input on recommendations or guidelines content. An international panel of neonatal, pediatric, and adult specialists with expertise in the use of albumin developed the recommendations. This panel included 20 members with expertise in intensive care, hepatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, hematology, pathology, neonatology, transfusion medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, internal medicine, and methodology and a patient representative. A framework and related clinical questions were developed according to the United States Preventative Services Task Force Criteria. Disclosures were ascertained yearly from all members.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114Jke1d]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept — agreement: 100%, level of evidence: moderate)

It would seem uncontroversial to replace blood loss in UGIB by transfusion of red blood cell and plasma to restore and preserve tissue perfusion and blood pressure. The earliest study that suggested that blood transfusion might be harmful to patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was published over 30 years ago. A small group of patients with severe UGIB were randomised to receiving either a blood transfusion in cases of a haemoglobin < 8 g/dL or shock, or transfusion of at least two units of blood regardless of haemoglobin level and haemodynamics. Early blood transfusion appeared to lead to more recurrent bleeding in these patients, and the authors suggested that this was due to reversal of hypercoagulable response to haemorrhage thereby encouraging rebleeding and hence the need for surgery.

Almost three decades later, a study from Spain randomised 921 patients with severe acute UGIB to a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (transfuse only when haemoglobin level < 7 g/dL) or a liberal transfusion strategy (transfuse only when haemoglobin < 9 g/dL). Significant differences were demonstrated in the overall survival, further bleeding and adverse events between the two groups in favour of restrictive transfusion. The major difference, however, was seen in the group of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B diseases.

A more recent study from the UK (TRIGGER Study) took a cluster randomised feasibility trial approach in six hospitals. A slightly different definition of restrictive transfusion strategy (when haemoglobin < 8 g/dL) versus liberal transfusion strategy (when haemoglobin < 10 g/dL) was adopted. Comparison of centres using different transfusion strategies showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome, including mortality, thromboembolic events, surgical or radiological intervention, therapeutic intervention, length of hospital stay and serious adverse events.

### Restrictive versus liberal blood transfusion for gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111TbqKu]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a leading indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion worldwide, although optimal thresholds for transfusion are debated.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Transfusion Evidence Library from inception to Oct 20, 2016, for randomised controlled trials comparing restrictive and liberal RBC transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Main outcomes were mortality, rebleeding, ischaemic events, and mean RBC transfusion. We computed pooled estimates for each outcome by random effects meta-analysis, and individual participant data for a cluster randomised trial were re-analysed to facilitate meta-analysis. We compared treatment effects between patient subgroups, including patients with liver cirrhosis, patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and patients with ischaemic heart disease at baseline.

Findings

We included four published and one unpublished randomised controlled trial, totalling 1965 participants. The number of RBC units transfused was lower in the restrictive transfusion group than in the liberal transfusion group (mean difference -1.73 units, 95% CI -2.36 to -1.11, p < 0.0001). Restrictive transfusion was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.44–0.97, p = 0.03) and rebleeding overall (0.58, 0.40–0.84, p = 0.004). We detected no difference in risk of ischaemic events. There were no statistically significant differences in the subgroups.

Interpretation

These results support more widespread implementation of restrictive transfusion policies for adults with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Management of decompensated cirrhosis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^114DrUH5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Should thrombocytopenic patients with DC receive empiric platelet transfusion prior to procedures?

Recommendation

Empiric platelet transfusions are not indicated for peri-procedural correction of thrombocytopenia, unless VET indicates a functional platelet deficit.

Discussion

Thrombocytopenia is common in DC, related to splenic sequestration and decreased thrombopoietin levels. However, platelet function is also simultaneously augmented by elevated von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and increased circulating activated platelets. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends platelet transfusion to correct the platelet count to > 50 000 only in the setting of high-risk procedures or active bleeding, while the AASLD recommends no routine preprocedural correction. If high risk is anticipated 2–10 days in advance, thrombopoietin agonists are an emerging option to avoid transfusion. The use of desmopressin (DDAVP) outside of clear uremic platelet dysfunction is mechanistically unappealing, given the already increased circulating levels of vWF. Several studies of VET-guided algorithms for both peri-procedural as well as variceal bleeding transfusion algorithms suggest that VET- guided platelet transfusion is associated with similar or reduced blood product transfusion without increased risk of bleeding.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^115rHthy]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guideline — In patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing common gastrointestinal procedures, the AGA suggests against the routine use of blood products (eg, FFP and PLT) for bleeding prophylaxis. In patients with severe derangements in coagulation or thrombocytopenia undergoing a procedure that is high risk for bleeding, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include discussions about potential benefits and risks (including transfusion reactions and delay of procedure) in consultation with a hematologist. Strength: Conditional recommendation; quality: Very low certainty evidence.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^116Y1JBg]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Cirrhosis — pre-procedure bleeding risk and testing — The coagulation cascade is rebalanced in patients with cirrhosis and results in a relative hypercoagulable state, and standard measures of coagulation such as INR serve the practitioner poorly when an accurate assessment of bleeding risk is needed. Pervasive reliance on and misinterpretation of INR results in underutilization of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in admitted patients with cirrhosis. When assessing a patient's pre-procedure bleeding risk, one should ensure that treatment is necessary to prevent bleeding because several procedures (paracentesis, thoracentesis, and diagnostic endoscopy) do not require routine evaluation unless the patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation, and one should ensure that platelet number and fibrinogen level are adequate. Transfusions carry significant risk for immunologic consequences, exacerbate portal hypertension, and are likely overutilized in patients with cirrhosis. Further study of global measures of coagulation, such as TEG and ROTEM, to determine appropriate cutoffs for therapeutic intervention are urgently needed.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112tM3yb]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Platelets and clotting factors

Limited evidence exists regarding the need, or threshold, for platelet transfusion in UGIB. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus bundle advises a threshold of transfusion at 50×10⁹ platelets/L or less based on major haemorrhage protocols with the acknowledgment that this advice is based primarily on expert opinion. Within the context of variceal bleeding, no evidence suggests that platelet count correlates with inability to control bleeding or rebleeding. However, in the event of these outcomes, the Baveno VII consensus advises correction can be considered on an individual basis, whereas the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and British Society of Gastroenterology variceal guidelines advise transfusion at the threshold of 50×10⁹/L or less.

Clotting abnormalities and their management in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB is a complex area. Prothrombin time is often prolonged leading to the use of fresh frozen plasma; however, prothrombin is not an accurate indicator of the clotting risk in cirrhosis. Studies have not shown a clear benefit from fresh frozen plasma and the most recent iteration of US variceal guidelines did not advocate its use in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic shunt vs surgical shunt in good-risk cirrhotic patients… [^114YSsMi]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Setting Academic referral center for liver disease. Patients Patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis with at least 1 prior episode of bleeding from portal hypertension. Intervention Portal decompression by angiographic or surgical shunt. Conclusions Operative portal decompression is more effective, more durable, and less costly than TIPS in Child-Pugh class A and B cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding. Good-risk patients with portal hypertensive bleeding should be referred for surgical shunt. TIPS has been found to be particularly advantageous, even lifesaving, in patients with end-stage liver disease listed for orthotopic liver transplantation, 1, 2 as well as certain other categories of decompensated cirrhotic patients, eg, those with intractable coagulopathies, severe ascites, hypersplenism, and, perhaps, hepatorenal failure.

Therefore, we designed a study to compare clinical and resource allocation outcomes in a series of good-risk cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding undergoing either TIPS or PSS. Eligibility criteria included at least 1 prior episode of variceal bleeding, management on an elective basis, excellent or good hepatic status, and availability for complete follow-up. Exclusion criteria included poor hepatic risk, emergency intervention, and unavailability for complete follow-up.

These results are consonant with those of a small prospective randomized trial of TIPS vs H-graft portacaval shunt by Rosemurgy and colleagues, 23 in which it was demonstrated that deaths, rebleeding, and treatment failures were substantially greater in TIPS patients than in surgically shunted patients. In addition, in a recently published decision analysis in patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis undergoing TIPS or PSS, Zacks et al24 demonstrated prohibitively greater expenditures — almost $150 000 per life-year saved — for patients undergoing angiographic portacaval shunt.

Risks of blood product utilization in cirrhosis — blood product transfusion can be lifesaving, but the risks of exacerbating portal hypertension from volume expansion, bacterial and viral contamination, immunologic complications, and cost make it imperative to restrict their use whenever possible; serious complications include transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies that can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions; transfusion-related lung injury rates increase with the number of transfusions and are higher when platelets or plasma-containing blood products are utilized.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114tvdjQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — perioperative risk in cirrhosis: Table 2 summarizes four recommendations. Given the association between clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and increased perioperative risk, in patients with compensated cirrhosis and unclear presence of CSPH, we suggest liver stiffness measurement and platelet count assessment to rule in CSPH using recommended thresholds, as well as cross-sectional imaging to identify portosystemic collaterals and/or complications of portal hypertension (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000 K/mm³) undergoing invasive procedures, we recommend thrombopoietin receptor agonists dosed according to baseline platelet count to reduce the need for perioperative transfusions and potentially reduce the risk of bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and CSPH with alternative indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS; e.g., refractory ascites), we suggest preoperative TIPS to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality attributable to portal hypertension (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis undergoing major hepatic surgery, we suggest referral to a high-volume liver surgery and/or transplant center, when feasible (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

GI bleeding

Bleeding oesophageal and gastric varices are another important complication of cirrhosis with a high mortality rate. A recent UK-wide audit showed the overall 30-days mortality was 15% for patients with acute variceal bleeding, with higher mortality rates in subjects with more advanced cirrhosis. Airway protection is vital, particularly in patients with encephalopathy or massive GI bleeding to reduce the risk of aspiration. In patients with known varices or portal hypertension, upper GI bleeding should be regarded as variceal until proven otherwise, although a significant proportion will have non-variceal bleeding. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated according to pulse and blood pressure, aiming for a mean arterial pressure of > 65 mm Hg. Transfusion of red blood cells is indicated when the haemoglobin (Hb) falls below 7 g/dLaiming for an Hb of 8 g/dL. It has been recently shown that a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (transfuse when Hb < 7 g/dL) had lower mortality compared with a liberal strategy of transfusion (transfuse when Hb < 9 g/dL) in patients with cirrhosis and with GI bleeding. The liberal strategy also increased the portal pressure over 5 days, thus increasing the potential for rebleeding. Coagulation abnormalities are common in patients with cirrhosis and may require correction in patients with active bleeding. Although not evaluated in randomised controlled trials, correction of blood clotting abnormalities is recommended by NICE when the international normalised ratio (INR) is > 1.5 (fresh frozen plasma), platelet count is < 50×10⁹/L (platelets) or fibrinogen < 1.0 g/L (cryoprecipitate). Consider giving intravenous vitamin K in patients with cirrhosis and with a prolonged prothrombin time, as vitamin K deficiency is common due to malnutrition and chronic cholestasis.

### A multicenter study of blood component transfusion in patients with liver cirrhosis in China: patient characteristics, transfusion practice, and outcomes [^1177eySv]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is a complex acquired disorder of hemostasis and patients frequently receive blood transfusions. But there is very limited data on patterns of blood use at a patient level.

Aims

To characterize blood use in cirrhotic patients in China and compare with recommendations to help identify areas where quality improvement strategies can be targeted. We also compared findings to a similar study undertaken in UK.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 hospitals over a 2-month period. Data were collected prospectively on each hospitalized cirrhotic patient to day 28.

Results

1595 cirrhotic patients were included and 20.6% were transfused. 48.2% of transfused patients received transfusion for bleeding, most commonly gastrointestinal bleeding (65.8%). The remaining 51.8% were transfused for non-bleeding indications. 32.5% of patients transfused for gastrointestinal bleeding with red blood cells had a pre-transfusion haemoglobin > 7g/dL. 89.1% of patients transfused frozen plasma for non-bleeding indications received them in the absence of a planned procedure. The patterns of blood transfusion in cirrhosis were different between China and UK. Of note, empirical prophylactic use of frozen plasma was more common in the Chinese study (89%) than in the UK (24%).

Conclusion

Education and research should be implemented to improve patient blood management, especially in prophylactic frozen plasma use area.

### Don't routinely transfuse patients with sickle cell disease for… [^1113s6we]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease are especially vulnerable to potential harms from unnecessary red blood cell transfusion. In particular, they experience an increased risk of alloimmunization to minor blood group antigens and a high risk of iron overload from repeated transfusions. Patients with the most severe genotypes of sickle cell disease with baseline hemoglobin values in the 7 to 10 g/dL range can usually tolerate further temporary reductions in Hb without developing symptoms of anemia. Many patients with sickle cell disease receive intravenous fluids to improve hydration when hospitalized for management of pain crisis, which may contribute to a decrease in hemoglobin by 1 to 2 g/dL. Routine administration of red blood cells in this setting should be avoided. Moreover, there is no evidence that transfusion reduces pain due to vaso-occlusive crises.

For a discussion of when transfusion is indicated in sickle cell disease, readers are referred to recent evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Acute variceal hemorrhage (VH) initial resuscitation — restrictive PRBC transfusion is supported by an RCT in gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding showing that a "restrictive" PRBC strategy (initiating at 7 g/dL and maintaining 7–9 g/dL) decreased mortality versus a "liberal" strategy (initiating at 9 g/dL and maintaining 9–11 g/dL); in the cirrhosis subgroup, restrictive transfusion was associated with significantly lower early rebleeding and mortality, and transfusion/volume expansion should take into account age, cardiovascular disorders, ongoing hemorrhage, and hemodynamic status.

### Thrombelastography-guided blood product use before invasive procedures in cirrhosis with severe coagulopathy: a randomized, controlled trial [^117CA1gd]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bleeding is a feared complication of invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (as defined by routine coagulation tests) and is used to justify preprocedure use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelets (PLT). Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a more comprehensive global coagulation assessment than routine tests (international normalized ratio [INR] and platelet count), and its use may avoid unnecessary blood product transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy (defined in this study as INR > 1.8 and/or platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L) who will be undergoing an invasive procedure. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to TEG-guided transfusion strategy or standard of care (SOC; 1:1 TEG:SOC). The TEG group would receive FFP if the reaction time (r) was > 40 min and/or PLT if maximum amplitude (MA) was < 30 mm. All SOC patients received FFP and/or PLT per hospital guidelines. Endpoints were blood product use and bleeding complications. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Per protocol, all subjects in the SOC group received blood product transfusions versus 5 in the TEG group (100% vs. 16.7%; P < 0.0001). Sixteen SOC (53.3%) received FFP, 10 (33.3%) PLT, and 4 (13.3%) both FFP and PLT. In the TEG group, none received FFP alone (P < 0.0001 vs. SOC), 2 received PLT (6.7%; P = 0.009 vs. SOC), and 3 both FFP and PLT (not significant). Postprocedure bleeding occurred in only 1 patient (SOC group) after large-volume paracentesis.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis and significant coagulopathy before invasive procedures, TEG-guided transfusion strategy leads to a significantly lower use of blood products compared to SOC (transfusion guided by INR and platelet count), without an increase in bleeding complications. Remarkably, even in patients with significant coagulopathy, postprocedure bleeding was rare, indicating that TEG thresholds should be reevaluated.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^111zNvYv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin is used commonly across a wide range of clinical settings to improve hemodynamics, to facilitate fluid removal, and to manage complications of cirrhosis. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines developed guidelines for the use of albumin in patients requiring critical care, undergoing cardiovascular surgery, undergoing kidney replacement therapy, or experiencing complications of cirrhosis.

Study Design and Methods

Cochairs oversaw the guideline development process and the panel included researchers, clinicians, methodologists, and a patient representative. The evidence informing this guideline arises from a systematic review of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews, in which multiple databases were searched (inception through November 23, 2022). The panel reviewed the data and formulated the guideline recommendations using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. The guidelines were revised after public consultation.

Results

The panel made 14 recommendations on albumin use in adult critical care (three recommendations), pediatric critical care (one recommendation), neonatal critical care (two recommendations), cardiovascular surgery (two recommendations), kidney replacement therapy (one recommendation), and complications of cirrhosis (five recommendations). Of the 14 recommendations, two recommendations had moderate certainty of evidence, five recommendations had low certainty of evidence, and seven recommendations had very low certainty of evidence. Two of the 14 recommendations suggested conditional use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Twelve of 14 recommendations did not suggest albumin use in a wide variety of clinical situations where albumin commonly is transfused.

Interpretation

Currently, few evidence-based indications support the routine use of albumin in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. These guidelines provide clinicians with actionable recommendations on the use of albumin.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^113itP4Y]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

There is no definitive evidence that correction of thrombocytopenia, a prolonged PT, or abnormal TEG or ROTEM tests by infusion of FFP, platelet concentrates, or low volume coagulation factor concentrates is effective at achieving a more rapid hemostasis. There are no clinical studies evaluating adequate platelet thresholds for the purpose of enhancing hemostasis in the bleeding cirrhosis patient. Furthermore, transfusions with platelet concentrates are frequently complicated by febrile reactions and less commonly by potentially life‐threatening transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). Importantly, the risk of TRALI appears to be increased in patients with underlying liver disease. Platelet concentrates have been dose‐dependently associated with increased mortality in the setting of liver transplantation. Similarly, there is no evidence of benefit of FFP, but transfusion‐related side effects have significant potential to harm the patient with cirrhosis. In addition, the large volumes of FFP realistically needed to improve the INR makes transfusion of FFP very likely more harmful than beneficial in the treatment of variceal bleeding. Therefore, in the cirrhosis population, the use of FFP during acute variceal bleeding cannot be recommended. Lower volume factor replacements like the prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) and rVIIa are more effective than FFP in decreasing INR values in cirrhosisand do not carry the risk of volume overload. However, their use in acute variceal bleeding has not been adequately studied and could theoretically increase thrombotic risk.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116xTvdg]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Platelet interventions and therapies targeting primary hemostasis — evidence does not support routine platelet count correction before procedures. In vitro interpretations suggest platelet levels > 55,000/μL improve hemostasis in cirrhosis, yet this threshold has not been validated clinically and platelet transfusions do not substantially improve thrombin generation capacity or viscoelastic markers of bleeding risk. In a prospective cohort of critically ill patients with cirrhosis, 10 events (occurring in 4.7% of the entire cohort of patients with cirrhosis) were postprocedural or postoperative, and a peripheral platelet count < 30,000/μL was associated with bleeding. Among 50 liver transplant candidates with platelet counts < 125,000/μL (52% with counts < 75,000/μL), there were 10 (20%) bleeding complications after procedures, all in patients with a platelet count < 75,000/μL, and those who received prophylactic platelet transfusion were paradoxically more likely to experience bleeding. There are three U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved thrombopoietin receptor agonists for increasing platelet counts in cirrhosis; each oral agent requires a 2- to 8-day course and is superior to placebo in achieving a target platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL before the procedure, with no statistical differences in thrombotic complications or in postprocedural bleeding events, and therefore routine use to prevent procedure-related bleeding cannot be recommended. The guidance further states there are no high-quality data on appropriate platelet thresholds before procedures, general platelet-raising interventions are not evidence based and cannot be recommended, and it is reasonable to perform both low- and high-risk procedures without prophylactically treating the platelet count.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^112bKesV]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^112PmUoC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — bleeding and thrombotic risk in liver disorders advises against prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in cirrhosis at conventional doses (10 mL/kg); if sufficient volume is given (1–2 L) to lower INR, portal pressure may rise and variceal hemorrhage may be triggered, and infusion of plasma prophylactically to decrease bleeding risk is "futile and potentially risky" (conditional recommendation). In cirrhosis, routine prophylactic platelet transfusion before common procedures is not recommended outside of "significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL) or sepsis"; in vitro studies show adequate thrombin production with platelet levels ≥ 50,000/mL and a single adult platelet dose does not improve thrombin generation, with TPO agonists potentially more appropriate for elective high‑risk procedures (conditional recommendation). For persistent active bleeding, the guideline states "we do not recommend antifibrinolytic agents" such as epsilon aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid in the absence of hyperfibrinolysis and cautions use if pathological clot such as portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is present (conditional recommendation).

### How to manage hemostasis in patients with liver disease during interventions [^112eTs79]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD) often need procedures to both treat and prevent complications of portal hypertension such as ascites or gastrointestinal bleeding. Abnormal results for hemostatic tests, such as prolonged prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and/or thrombocytopenia, are commonly encountered, raising concerns about increased bleeding risk and leading to transfusion to attempt to correct prior to interventions. However hemostatic markers are poor predictors of bleeding risk in CLD, and routine correction, particularly with fresh frozen plasma and routine platelet transfusions, should be avoided. This narrative review discusses the hemostatic management of patients with CLD using 2 case descriptions.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^117HoYkC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Urgent diagnostic and potentially therapeutic endoscopic evaluation is needed in this patient and improved outcomes are demonstrated when performed in less than 12 h after presentation. There are extensive evidence‐based management recommendations for acute variceal bleeding that are beyond the scope of this document. Endoscopic and pharmacologic therapies are the mainstays of treatment for this life‐threatening disorder and are well described elsewhere. However, this patient will be admitted to an intensive care unit and requires resuscitation prior to endoscopic or other procedural therapy. This stage of patient care suffers from less evidence‐based recommendations. During this stage, the requirement for packed red blood cells (PRBC) raises the question whether addition of FFP and platelet concentrates are also required given the elevated INR and decreased platelet count in this patient.

Data from randomized controlled trials support a lower threshold of 7 g/dl for hemoglobin values when transfusing patients with cirrhosis and acute GI bleeding with PRBC. In a prospective randomized controlled trial of 921 patients (271 with cirrhosis) with severe GI bleeding, those assigned to transfusion using a lower threshold of 7 g/dl versus those assigned to 9 g/dl had improved 6‐week survival and less recurrent bleeding. The group assigned to the higher threshold also had significantly increased portal pressure within the first 5 days of hospitalization compared to the group with the lower threshold. This increase in portal pressures is contradictory to the aim of reducing overall portal pressures in the resuscitation of these patients and was likely a significant contributor to rebleeding rates in the patients undergoing more transfusions. This phenomenon of increasing portal hypertension with volume expansion has also been shown in experimental models with blood transfusion and crystalloid infusion. Care should be taken in this population to avoid aggressive volume overexpansion not only with PRBC but also with crystalloid and FFP in order to avoid paradoxical increase in portal hypertension and rebleeding risk.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^113eKbaj]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasing evidence shows that viscoelastic assays can be used to assess haemostatic status in patients with liver disease, with evidence that this can result in a reduction in blood products transfused. This has become increasingly established in liver surgery but more recently for other procedures. In a small randomised trial, De Pietrishowed that in patients with cirrhosis and an INR > 1.8 and/or platelet count < 50×10⁹/L requiring invasive procedures, a thromboelastogram-guided transfusion strategy led to a significantly lower use of blood products (17% compared with 100% transfusion in the standard of care group) without an increase in bleeding complications; only one major bleed occurred, which was in the standard of care group. This has been shown in other open-label randomised studies. Viscoelastic testing has therefore been used successfully to reduce unnecessary prophylactic transfusions in patients with liver disease (in comparison with using the INR and platelet count). In contrast, in a single-centre randomised study of central venous catheter insertion in patients with cirrhosis, a thromboelastography-based strategy did not reduce blood transfusion compared with usual care; however, a restrictive protocol (no transfusion unless INR > 5.0 or platelet count < 25×10⁹/L) reduced transfusion without an increase in bleeding. It should also be noted that these assays have not yet been shown to reliably predict bleeding in patients with liver disease.

### Trauma laparotomy for the cirrhotic patient: an outcome-based analysis [^1146K11T]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a lack of large-scale data on outcomes of cirrhotic patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We aimed to compare outcomes of cirrhotic versus noncirrhotic trauma patients undergoing laparotomy.

Methods

We analyzed 2018 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We included blunt trauma patients (≥ 18 y) who underwent a laparotomy. Patients who were transferred, dead on arrival, or had penetrating injuries were excluded. Patients were matched in a 1:2 ratio (cirrhotic and noncirrhotic). Outcomes included mortality, complications, failure to rescue, transfusion requirements, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) lengths of stay. Multivariable backward stepwise regression analysis was performed.

Results

Four hundred and seventy-one patients (cirrhotic, 157; noncirrhotic, 314) were matched. Mean age was 57 ± 15 y, 78% were male, and median injury severity score was 24. Cirrhotic patients had higher rates of mortality (60% versus 30%, P value < 0.001), complications (49% versus 37%; P value = 0.01), failure to rescue (66% versus 36%, P value < 0.001), and pRBC (units, median, 11 [7–18] versus 7 [4–11], P value < 0.001) transfusion requirements. There were no significant differences in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) lengths of stay (P value ≥ 0.05). On multivariate analysis, increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02, P value < 0.001), Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8 at presentation (aOR 3.3, P value < 0.001), and total splenectomy (aOR 5.7, P value < 0.001) were associated with higher odds of mortality. Platelet transfusion was associated with lower odds of mortality (aOR 0.84, P value = 0.044).

Conclusions

On a national scale, mortality following trauma laparotomy is twice as high for cirrhotic patients compared to noncirrhotic patients with higher rates of major complications and failure to rescue. Our finding of a protective effect of platelet transfusion may be explained by the platelet dysfunction associated with cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis among trauma patients warrants heightened surveillance.

### Prediction of risk of blood transfusion in patients with cirrhosis [^116YFa1d]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood transfusion is usually required for cirrhotic patients with bleeding which is related to high risk of mortality. Identifying cirrhotic patients at high risk of bleeding and needing blood transfusions would benefit these patients, yet this remains an unmet need.

Objectives

This study aims to enhance blood transfusion management for patients with cirrhosis by developing a predictive model to assess the risk of transfusion.

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of 711 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and divided into training set (n = 537) and validation set (n = 174). Each participant underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment. Data on prothrombin time (PT), platelet counts, and inflammatory markers were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. The nomogram was constructed. Model performance was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

The study successfully identified PT, platelet counts, and the mentioned inflammatory markers as significant predictors of the need for transfusion. The resulting nomogram demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with area under the curve values of 0.85 in the training set and 0.83 in the validation set.

Conclusion

The developed nomogram for predicting the need for blood transfusion in patients with cirrhosis shows promising effectiveness for clinical application. This tool can significantly contribute to optimizing transfusion practices, potentially improving patient care and outcomes through more personalized and efficient transfusion strategies.

Liver transplantation

This is probably appropriate only for patients who bleed while awaiting liver transplantation, although studies comparing VBL or TIPSS placement with urgent liver transplantation in this situation need to be done. Liver transplantation is an exceedingly rare option for the vast majority of patients, both because it is not commonly available and because of shortages and delays in organ procurement. No controlled trials of liver transplantation in uncontrolled/active bleeding are available.

Recommendations for the control of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis are given below and in figure 3.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators: Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^116DSJjx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists for preoperative thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis — In patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000 K/mm³) undergoing invasive procedures, we recommend thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists dosed according to baseline PLT count to reduce the need for perioperative transfusions and potentially reduce the risk of bleeding (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In an RCT of 292 patients with PLT count < 50 K/mm³, eltrombopag 75 mg daily for 14 days reduced PLT transfusion vs placebo (28% vs 81%, P < 0.001) but portal venous thrombotic events occurred in 5.7% vs 0.7%. A meta-analysis of 6 studies in cirrhosis with PLT < 50 K/mm3 found reduced PLT transfusions (22.5% vs 67.8%, P < 0.001) and reduced periprocedural bleeding (11.6% vs 15.6%, P = 0.01) with TPO receptor agonists.

### Transfusion strategies for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116rRgF6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy.

Methods

We enrolled 921 patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and randomly assigned 461 of them to a restrictive strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell below 7 g per deciliter) and 460 to a liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell below 9 g per deciliter). Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis.

Results

A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51%), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14%), did not receive transfusions (P < 0.001). The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95% vs. 91%; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.92; P = 0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10% of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40% as compared with 48% (P = 0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P = 0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy.

Conclusions

As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Funded by Fundació Investigació Sant Pau; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00414713.).

### Emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices… [^114r6KP8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE CRITICAL problem presented by the cirrhotic patient during massive hemorrhage from esophageal varices can be attacked actively by either the transthoracic or the peroral route. An entirely satisfactory way to stop variceal hemorrhage has not yet been found, and all must agree that at times it is impossible to control it by any means. Control is urgent, not only because of the blood loss itself but also for prevention of liver failure. If blood is readily available for transfusion, liver failure is more frequently a threat to life than exsanguination. Therefore it is most important that hemorrhage be checked quickly, even though blood replacement can be kept abreast of blood loss. The goal of emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices at Walter Reed Army Hospital is control of bleeding until portal decompression — preferably by portacaval shunt — can be accomplished. It is believed that at present no definitive procedure can safely be. PALMER ED.

### Preprocedural prophylaxis with blood products in patients with cirrhosis: results from a survey of the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) [^117Fng2t]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The concept of rebalanced hemostasis in cirrhosis challenges the policy of transfusing plasma or platelets before invasive procedures in patients with prolonged PT or severe thrombocytopenia. Recent guidelines recommend against plasma transfusion and suggest avoiding/minimizing platelet transfusions.

Aim

We assessed how hepato-gastroenterologists manage prolonged PT/INR or severe thrombocytopenia before invasive procedures.

Methods

On May 2021, AISF members were sent a questionnaire addressing the PT/INR and platelet thresholds required before invasive procedures, the use of other markers of bleeding risk or other hemostatic treatments and the burden of pre-emptive plasma and platelet transfusions.

Results

Of 62 respondents, 94% and 100% use PT/INR and platelet count to assess bleeding risk, respectively. Only 37% and 32% require less conservative PT/INR or platelet counts thresholds for low-risk procedures, respectively. As for those applying single thresholds, 68% require PT/INR < 1,5 and 86% require platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L. Half respondents use additional indicators of bleeding risk and 63% other hemostatic treatments. Low-risk procedures account for 70% of procedures, and for 50% and 59% of plasma and platelets units transfused, respectively.

Conclusions

the survey indicates lack of compliance with guidelines that advise against plasma and platelet transfusions before invasive procedures and the need for prospective studies and inter-society consensus workshops.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117EUKKT]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Procedural bleeding risk assessment in cirrhosis — international normalized ratio (INR), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and recombinant factor VIIa: The INR should not be used to gauge procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis who are not taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and measures aimed at reducing the INR are not recommended before procedures in patients with cirrhosis who are not taking VKAs. Given the lack of effect of FFP on hemostatic capacity in cirrhosis, the authors advise against prophylactic FFP transfusion before common procedures, and FFP transfusion before procedures is associated with risks and no proven benefits. Recombinant factor VIIa use in a prophylactic setting before invasive procedures is not recommended and has been associated with increased risks of thrombosis, including arterial thromboses, while prothrombin complex concentrates are under study in liver disease but efficacy and safety data are lacking to date.

### Prophylactic fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion have a prothrombotic effect in patients with liver disease [^112S9q2a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is increasingly broad consensus on the futility of INR correction with FFP for preventing bleeding complications in this setting, there is none on the requirement to correct cirrhotic thrombocytopenia. High‐quality research in this specific field is scarce, and clinical studies have shown contradicting results. 12, 13 Guidelines defining the indication for platelet transfusion in patients with liver disease‐associated thrombocytopenia are not uniform, although most guidelines maintain a platelet count threshold of 50 × 10⁹/L for patients with liver disease before invasive procedures. 14

In addition to doubts on whether prolonged INR and thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis are associated with bleeding risk, the efficacy of FFP and platelet transfusions in patients with liver disease has been questioned. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that although FFP improves the INR in patients with liver disease, there is no appreciable increase in hemostatic potential as estimated by thrombin generation tests. 15, 16, 17 In addition, several clinical studies have shown that FFP or platelet transfusions only minimally improve the hemostatic status of patients with liver disease and did not reduce bleeding risk. 17, 18, 19

Importantly, bleeding risk is, next to a patient's hemostatic status, determined by the procedure and operator. Extensive research has shown that many of the common procedures that patients with liver disease undergo (eg, endoscopy, paracentesis), have a low to very low bleeding risk, which further questions the need for prophylactic prohemostatic interventions. 6 Further, every transfusion is associated with the risk of transfusion‐related complications, such as circulatory overload, transfusion‐related acute lung injury, and infection, and those risks may be higher in patients with liver disease. 20, 21, 22

Here, we examined the hemostatic efficacy of prophylactic FFP and platelet transfusions to patients with chronic liver disease‐associated hemostatic changes. We specifically studied patients that were deemed to require FFP or platelet transfusion before an invasive procedure by their treating physician in a real‐life clinical setting.

Coagulation interventions and factor assessment in cirrhosis highlight that the international normalized ratio (INR) does not predict bleeding risk and that certain corrective measures have limited utility or risks: "it is not a reliable indicator of hemostatic balance in patients with cirrhosis and is unable to predict procedural bleeding risk". Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions "carry important risks: (1) a potential for developing transfusion-related lung injury syndromes and (2) increases in portal pressures directly proportional to the volume transfused" and "show minimal efficacy in improving thrombin generation capacity in vitro". Outside of advanced malnutrition or cholestasis, "vitamin K replacement has no measurable effect on the INR in patients with cirrhosis", and "Determination of factor V levels can aid the practitioner in differentiating vitamin K deficiency from impaired liver function".

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114SnLx7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Justification

The effectiveness of transfusing platelets to critically ill medical patients with active bleeding remains unclear. Moreover, there is significant variability in what clinicians consider serious active bleeding. The panel considered WHO grades 3 and 4 as serious active bleeding.

The literature search excluded patients with trauma and those with intracranial hemorrhage, resulting in the identification of 1 relevant study. An observational examination of platelet transfusions in adults with cirrhosis and esophageal variceal bleeding showed no significant difference in mortality rates between transfused and non-transfused individuals (25.3% vs 17.4%; p = 0.074). Moreover, stratification by platelet counts did not affect the results. Rebleeding rates were higher in those who received platelets, especially with pre-transfusion platelet counts > 20 × 10⁹/L, but not below this threshold. The relevance of these findings to other critically ill groups remains uncertain due to varying transfusion thresholds and potential selection and confounding bias.

In patients with thrombocytopenia and clinically significant active bleeding, platelet transfusion is the standard treatment. Strong evidence of net harm would be required to deviate from this practice, but the current evidence was insufficient to justify change. While a framework is suggested (Table 4), clinical judgment should guide platelet transfusion decisions, considering the bleeding site, severity, and coexisting factors that influence the patient's ability to tolerate bleeding.

Table 4
Suggested Approach for Platelet Transfusions

What Others Are Saying

Our recommendation aligns with those from other organizations. The BSH advises that for patients with WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding, platelet counts should be maintained > 50 × 10⁹/L if the clinician considered the bleeding severe and > 30 × 10⁹/L if considered not severe. Moreover, they suggest considering empirical transfusion in initial management of major hemorrhage (causing heart rate > 110 beats/min and/or systolic BP < 90 mm Hg). The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis advocates for transfusions to achieve > 50 × 10⁹/L in patients with DIC and active bleeding. The ASCO suggests transfusing platelets above prophylactic levels for active localized bleeding associated with necrotic tumors.ESICM guidelines made no recommendation regarding platelet transfusions in patients with massive or non-massive bleeding. Meanwhile, recommendations to transfuse platelets above 50 × 10⁹/L for bleeding patients with cirrhosis are controversial.

### Portal hypertension: contraindication to liver surgery? [^114BbYug]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent decades liver resection has become a safe procedure, mainly because of better patient selection. Despite this progress, however, outcomes of hepatectomy in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension are still uncertain. The aim of this study was to elucidate early and long-term outcomes of liver resection in these patients.

Methods

Between 1985 and 2003, a total of 245 cirrhotic patients underwent hepatectomy for HCC. Altogether, 217 patients were eligible for this analysis and were divided into two groups according to the presence of portal hypertension at the time of surgery: 99 patients with portal hypertension and 118 without it.

Results

Patients with portal hypertension had worse preoperative liver function (Child-Pugh A class patients: 66.7% vs. 94.9%; P < 0.0001). No differences were encountered in terms of intraoperative and pathology data. Operative mortality was similar (11.1% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.100), but patients with portal hypertension had higher morbidity (43.4% vs. 30.5%; P = 0.049) and received a higher rate of blood and plasma transfusions (51.5% vs. 32.2%, P = 0.004; 77.8% vs. 57.6%, P = 0.0017). Considering only Child-Pugh A patients, short-term results were similar in the two groups in terms of mortality, morbidity, and transfusion rates. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in patients without portal hypertension (39.8% vs. 28.9%; P = 0.020), although when considering only Child-Pugh A patients no difference of survival was encountered. Multivariate analysis identified Child-Pugh classification, tumor diameter, and vascular invasion as independent predicting factors for survival.

Conclusions

Portal hypertension should not be considered an absolute contraindication to hepatectomy in cirrhotic patients. Child-Pugh A patients with portal hypertension have short- and long-term results similar to patients with normal portal pressure.

TRADITIONAL HEMOSTATIC ASSESSMENT TESTS

There is a poor correlation between traditional coagulation tests and thrombin‐generating capacity in cirrhosis. Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) traditionally assess hemostasis; however, these tests measure only a discrete number of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors that can lead to an incomplete picture of hemostasis and have limitations in advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. PT/INR are usually prolonged in patients with decompensated cirrhosis as a result of reduced liver synthetic function; however, this does not account for all anticoagulant factors (including low levels of proteins C and S) and therefore does not correlate with bleeding risk and thus should not be corrected routinely with plasma transfusion. This is clearly demonstrated with studies using a modified thrombin generation assay, which adds thrombomodulin to activate protein C, thereby demonstrating a more accurate depiction of hemostasis in this population.

Thrombocytopenia has historically been considered a risk factor for bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. However, data are mixed, and the putative relationship between thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk is not well supported. Changes in the hemostatic system may partially compensate for thrombocytopenia, including elevated vWF, which promotes platelet adhesion and forms a complex with Factor VIII (also elevated) to accelerate coagulation. Large randomized controlled trials examining TPO use prior to procedures for patients with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia were not designed to assess the effect on bleeding outcomes. Viscoelastic testing (VET) has been used as a guide for platelet transfusions and demonstrates a reduction of platelet transfusion use. It remains unclear what level of thrombocytopenia represents an increased risk of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.

Transfusion of blood products in patients with cirrhosis has risks, including exacerbation of portal hypertension from volume expansion, hemolysis, and infectious and immunologic complications. The risk of human leukocyte antigen or red cell antibody development from transfusion can impair the ability to receive further transfusions and impact subsequent transplantation, especially for simultaneous liver–kidney transplantation. Transfusion‐associated circulatory overload rates increase with the number of transfusions administered, and transfusion‐related acute lung injury rates are higher when plasma‐containing blood products, including platelets, are used. Blood products and transfusion thresholds are summarized in Table 1.

Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". A conditional recommendation uses the wording "The AGA suggests… " and is interpreted as "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course, but many would not" and "Different choices would be appropriate for different patients. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision". When there is no recommendation, the wording "The AGA makes no recommendation… " is used and "The confidence in the effect estimate is so low that any effect estimate is speculative at this time".

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

In patients with ACLF and altered coagulation parameters, we suggest against transfusion in the absence of bleeding or a planned procedure (low quality, conditional recommendation). In patients with cirrhosis who require invasive procedures, we recommend use of thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational TEG (ROTEM), compared with INR, to more accurately assess transfusion needs (moderate quality, conditional recommendation).

Similarly, the role of albumin for improving outcomes in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is unclear. The trial data specific to this patient population are limited. The two largest RCTs failed to provide an explicit fluid resuscitation protocol for the patients randomized to no albumin, raising the concern for underresuscitation in the control arms of both studies. When similar albumin dosing strategies were used in trials examining patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections, no benefit was seen and concern for harm was expressed. The panel suggested the use of albumin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (conditional recommendation), but raised concerns regarding the dosing protocol used in two of the four trials and the risk of fluid overload (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) and the lack of data suggesting this specific regimen is beneficial compared with alternative dosing (eg, lower dose daily for 3 days). The panel also considered the lack of clarity on whether albumin is necessary for all patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or whether it could be used selectively (ie, patients at high risk of kidney failure or death: serum bilirubin > 4 mg/dL or serum creatinine > 1 mg/dL). Additional studies are necessary to address dosing, to address the benefit for patients with and without kidney impairment, and to clarify the risks of adverse events. The panel also noted that not all physicians currently adhere to the trial dosing strategy, although it continues to be recommended in current guidelines. A careful assessment of the patient's volume status, cardiovascular status, and degree of kidney impairment before transfusion is advised and the dose, frequency, or both being modified accordingly. In contrast, the RCTs find no support for the use of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and extraperitoneal infections.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111X3iwF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of bleeding ARV can be very challenging and essentially includes prompt resuscitation and correction of coagulopathy, immediate workup to localize the site/source of bleeding and then the application of a suitable treatment modality or immediate transfer to a tertiary referral center. Management options may vary with a combination of local/endoscopic, medical, radiological, and surgical methods available. In mild cases, intravenous fluid replacement, blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy, and optimal medication for portal hypertension are usually effective.

Initial resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization are critical and patients' conditions should be optimized before endoscopic intervention. The management of comorbid conditions, including the appropriate management of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants, requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach.

The intravascular volume repletion is done with crystalloids and packed red blood cells. The targets of resuscitation are the restoration of hemodynamic status but avoiding over-expansion, which may exacerbate portal pressure, impair clot formation, and increase the risk of further bleeding. In fact, a certain degree of hypovolemia and hypotension promotes activation of endogenous vasoactive systems, leading to splanchnic vasoconstriction and, therefore, reducing portal blood flow and pressure. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that a restrictive packed red blood cell transfusion strategy improves survival in Child–Pugh A and B patients. The results of this study showed that patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding should be transfused when hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dl, aiming at a target level of 7–9 g/dl. Other risks related to blood product utilization are immunologic (transfusion-related lung injury and development of HLA antibodies) and can impact subsequent transplantation or impair the ability to receive further transfusions. A recent guideline from the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee suggests the following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding in advanced liver disease: hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dl. Exceptions to this restrictive strategy are massive bleeding, which should prompt the activation of a dedicated transfusional protocol, cardiovascular comorbidities, and any other condition that precludes adequate physiological response to acute anemia. It is important to keep in mind that an acute hypotension may decrease hepatic perfusion, which in the setting of underlying chronic liver disease can exacerbate liver injury. A helpful maneuver to slow down the bleeding rate could be the endorectal placement of a compression tube (i.e. Sengstaken-Blakemore Tube or a Linton-Nachlas balloon compression tube) held under moderate traction: this device should be left in place until the patient is sufficiently stabilized or until the patient is transferred to a center with available expertise. The placement of balloon tamponade can also give additional time to correctly study the patients with CT scans or other imaging techniques, thus enabling to tailor the management strategy to the anatomy of the bleeding vessel. Eventually, rebleeding is almost universal if another modality of treatment is not instituted.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^115Rdk1s]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Platelet management in cirrhosis — thresholds, transfusion performance, and thrombopoietin (TPO) agonists: The convergence of retrospective and in vitro studies regarding platelet levels in the 50,000–60,000 range as promoting thrombin generation has led to this range becoming the target for prophylaxis, and when increased platelet levels are deemed urgently necessary, single-donor platelet transfusion will minimize immunologic risk. Thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis is multifactorial; the lifespan of a normal platelet is approximately 10 days and one-third are sequestered in the spleen, and the half-life of transfused platelets has been reported to be as low as 2.5–4.5 days and their function is diminished. When procedures are planned in advance, recently approved TPO agonists are a nice alternative to platelet transfusion; TPO agonists have the advantage of not increasing portal pressure and elevating platelets for longer than transfusions can, but eltrombopag has been associated with PVT when platelets inadvertently increased dramatically in a minority of patients, whereas both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag have more modest effects on platelet levels and, when used for a short duration, have not had this issue in currently available clinical trials.

Certainty of the evidence and clinical implications — The certainty of evidence was very low across all outcomes due to indirectness and few events. Data suggest baseline bleeding risk for common nonsurgical procedures is low in cirrhosis, and there are insufficient data to justify cutoffs of standard coagulation parameters. The technical review stratified procedure-related bleeding risk into low or high using a threshold of 1.5%. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing high-risk procedures, decisions about prophylactic blood transfusions should include potential benefits and risks, the threshold for severe thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy could not be clearly defined and remains a matter of clinical judgment, and in many cases care should be managed in collaboration with an expert hematologist.

### Thromboelastography-guided blood product transfusion in cirrhosis patients with variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^114hQrtp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to assess the use of thromboelastography (TEG)-directed blood product transfusion in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding compared with conventional transfusion for correction of coagulopathy.

Background

Coagulopathy is common in patients with cirrhosis. Recommendations for correction of conventional parameters of coagulation-platelets and the international normalized ratio before endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding-need more validation.

Study

In this randomized controlled trial, cirrhotic patients with severe coagulopathy and acute variceal bleeding were randomized to either TEG-guided blood product transfusion or conventional transfusion from March 2017 to December 2017. The primary outcome was the difference in the amount of fresh frozen plasma and platelet units transfused between the groups. Secondary outcomes were rebleeding at 5 days and 42 days, and 6-week mortality.

Results

Of the 60 recruited patients, 30 each were randomized to the TEG and conventional transfusion groups. There were no differences in baseline characteristic and endoscopic findings between the 2 groups. Four subjects in the TEG group received blood product transfusions versus all in the conventional transfusion group (13.3% vs. 100%; P < 0.001). The control of bleeding on initial endoscopy was similar in the 2 groups. Rebleeding in the TEG and conventional transfusion groups at 5 days was similar [1 (3.3%) vs. 4 (13.3%), P = 0.167], whereas it was significantly less in the TEG group at 42 days [3 (10%) vs. 11 (36.7%), P = 0.012]. Mortality at 6 weeks was seen in 4 (13.3%) in the TEG group and in 8 (26.7%) patients in the conventional transfusion group (P = 0.176).

Conclusions

TEG-guided strategy was associated with reduced blood product transfusion to correct coagulopathy without compromising hemostasis in cirrhotic patients (Clinical trial ID: CTRI/2017/02/007864).

### High mortality of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients with ascites [^114DPj4N]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Because of the high mortality associated with pneumonia in cirrhotic patients, it is important for development of pneumonia to be avoided in these patients. Hepatic encephalopathy and tracheal intubations are usually considered to be risk factors for the development of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients. In addition, influenza infection can lead to hepatic decompensation, resulting in severe secondary bacterial pneumonia in cirrhotic patients. In addition, plasma-based blood products increase transfusion-associated acute lung injury, which affects lung clearance and patients receiving these blood products are prone to develop pneumonia; red blood cell transfusions also increase the rate of pneumonia. In order to prevent cirrhotic patients from developing pneumonia, it is critical to avoid needless transfusions and to prevent influenza infections.

In the present study, we found that SWSF also contributed to higher mortality among cirrhotic patients with ascites. We considered that this kind of infection was caused by a failure of patients' defense mechanisms to prevent the microorganisms in the intestinal lumen from reaching the systemic circulation. When SWSF occurs, it means that the cirrhotic patients will have a tendency toward bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen and poor clearance of bacteria in their bloodstream. This phenomenon may contribute to higher mortality among cirrhotic patients with ascites.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^1111Wj1a]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The recent guidelines from the American Gastroenterology Associationinclude the recommendations that blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunisation and/or transfusion reactions.

The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimise clot formation in advanced liver disease: haematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50 × 10⁹/L, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly used thresholds for correction of the INR are not supported by evidence.

The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary INR target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the usefulness of this agent considerably.

In contrast, decompensated liver disease with acute or chronic liver failure is associated with a progressive consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenaemia, often with hyperfibrinolysis. Spontaneous mucocutaneous and other bleeding manifestations may become evident at this stage. In one study, a platelet count < 30×10⁹/L, fibrinogen level < 0.6 g/L and activated partial thromboplastin time values > 100 s were the strongest independent predictors for new onset of major bleeding. All but the most essential invasive procedures should be avoided under these circumstances. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with an increased risk of bleeding after paracentesis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Treatment with vitamin K should be considered in patients with an increased INR, which may in part reflect vitamin K deficiency; particularly in patients in intensive care, in patients with malnutrition, in patients using antibiotics and in patients with cholestatic liver disease.

Hemostasis and coagulation in perioperative cirrhosis — The international normalized ratio (INR) is not predictive of bleeding in cirrhosis and "prophylactic" fresh frozen plasma is "not recommended"; studies indicate platelet counts "above 50,000/μL are adequate to allow clot formation", so prophylactic platelet transfusions to higher levels are "unlikely to be beneficial". For thrombocytopenia, "Only avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are approved" and were "effective in raising platelet counts above 50,000/μL", but "rates of bleeding events… were equivalent" to placebo and "thrombotic events have occurred", so they should be used "with caution", and it "would seem reasonable to consider their use" before elective high-risk procedures when baseline platelets are "less than 50,000/μL". Regarding fibrinogen, low levels are linked to bleeding and "levels < 100 mg/dL are associated with a risk of inhibiting clot formation"; "Fibrinogen can be replaced with low-volume cryoprecipitate", and "it seems physiologically reasonable to replete fibrinogen… before high-risk surgical procedures". If available, "viscoelastic testing… should be considered before and during surgical procedures" to guide transfusion strategy.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — transfusion thresholds and blood product selection in cirrhosis — blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry transfusion risks; when managing active bleeding or high-risk procedures, thresholds that may optimize clot formation are hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL, and commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence; thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels; the utility of fresh frozen plasma is limited by large volume requirements and other drawbacks, and although the 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate offers a low-volume option, dosage is partly based on international normalized ratio (problematic in cirrhosis) and experience in liver disease is limited.
