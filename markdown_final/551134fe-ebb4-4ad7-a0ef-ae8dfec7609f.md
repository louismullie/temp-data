## Question

Why does rivaroxaban increase thrombosis risk in mechanical heart valves?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why rivaroxaban increases thrombosis risk in patients with mechanical heart valves and what the mechanistic and clinical evidence shows to support that conclusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique thrombogenic milieu created by mechanical valves. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanisms of rivaroxaban versus warfarin and whether selective factor Xa inhibition is sufficient. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence, including RE-ALIGN with dabigatran and the apixaban PROACT Xa trial, and consider any rivaroxaban-specific data. After that, I need to examine in vitro and translational studies that quantify thrombin generation on valve surfaces. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and synthesize a coherent, mechanism-based explanation with clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of mechanical valve thrombosis, because if I mischaracterize the substrate, the mechanistic reasoning will be off. Mechanical valves are intrinsically thrombogenic due to nonendothelialized sewing rings and leaflet surfaces that activate both the extrinsic (tissue factor) and intrinsic (contact) pathways, producing robust local thrombin generation and fibrin deposition; thrombosis often initiates on the sewing ring and can propagate to cause valve thrombosis and embolism, which is why lifelong anticoagulation is required and why mitral-position valves carry higher thrombotic risk than aortic-position valves [^115zVkfE] [^114kpLNy] [^114PusyG].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacologic differences between rivaroxaban and warfarin, because mechanism matters here. Rivaroxaban is a direct, reversible factor Xa inhibitor that blocks a single node in the coagulation cascade, whereas warfarin noncompetitively suppresses the hepatic synthesis of multiple vitamin K–dependent factors, including II, VII, IX, and X, thereby attenuating the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways; this broader suppression is particularly relevant when both contact and tissue factor–driven activation are intense on artificial surfaces [^117Euwd4] [^114kpLNy] [^115zVkfE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether selective factor Xa inhibition can be overwhelmed locally. In vitro thrombin generation assays show that mechanical valve leaflets and sewing rings markedly increase endogenous thrombin potential, and clinically relevant concentrations of rivaroxaban or apixaban reduce but do not fully suppress this surge, whereas warfarin achieves more complete suppression even at modest INR levels; importantly, combining rivaroxaban with dabigatran provides more-than-additive suppression, reinforcing that single-pathway blockade is insufficient in this setting [^117GVGAw] [^114kpLNy].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence, even though it is not all rivaroxaban-specific, because class signals matter mechanistically. The RE-ALIGN randomized trial of dabigatran in mechanical valve patients was terminated early for excess strokes and bleeding, with 9 strokes in the dabigatran arm versus none with warfarin, establishing a class failure signal for direct thrombin inhibition in this population; critically, thrombotic events occurred despite targeting trough dabigatran levels above 50 ng/mL, suggesting that even higher drug exposure could not compensate for the overwhelming local thrombin generation on valve surfaces [^1166vv5X].

> Wait, let me verify whether factor Xa inhibition fares better clinically. The PROACT Xa trial testing apixaban in patients with On-X mechanical aortic valves was also stopped early for excess valve thrombosis or thromboembolism with apixaban compared with warfarin, despite most patients receiving concomitant aspirin; this strengthens the inference that selective factor Xa inhibition is likewise inadequate in this high-thrombin milieu, aligning with the in vitro observations that rivaroxaban incompletely suppresses MHV-induced thrombin generation [^1121DaH1].

> I should double-check whether there is any rivaroxaban-specific human data in mechanical valves. A small pilot study of rivaroxaban 20 mg daily after mechanical aortic valve replacement reported no thrombotic events in 10 patients, but the sample size is far too small to detect meaningful differences and cannot override the broader class signal and mechanistic data; thus, this cannot be considered definitive evidence of safety or efficacy in this population [^112L7bn4].

> Let me consider the clinical context and guideline stance to ensure I'm not overinterpreting mechanistic plausibility. Major guidelines consistently recommend vitamin K antagonists as the only approved oral anticoagulants for mechanical valves and explicitly advise against DOACs, including rivaroxaban, citing lack of supportive evidence and potential harm; contemporary AF guidelines similarly exclude mechanical valves from DOAC indications, reinforcing that the balance of evidence and mechanism supports VKA therapy here [^113wNkLm] [^117VYgLC] [^114Z5jKo].

> But wait, what if the issue is simply underdosing rather than mechanism? I need to ensure I address that. In RE-ALIGN, dabigatran was titrated to maintain troughs above 50 ng/mL and still failed, and in vitro work shows that even higher concentrations of rivaroxaban or apixaban still do not match warfarin's suppression of MHV-induced thrombin generation; moreover, the absence of routine laboratory monitoring for DOACs makes it harder to titrate to the dynamic, postoperative prothrombotic state, whereas INR-guided VKA therapy allows individualized adjustment to the net anticoagulant effect required on these surfaces [^115yq5v4] [^1121DaH1] [^111ZNjDp].

> Synthesizing this, the most coherent explanation is that mechanical valves generate a high local burden of factor Xa and thrombin via contact and tissue factor activation, which can overwhelm selective single-pathway inhibition by rivaroxaban; warfarin's multi-factor suppression of the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways provides broader and more effective attenuation of this prothrombotic milieu, explaining the clinical failure of DOACs and the guideline-endorsed supremacy of VKAs in mechanical valve patients [^115zVkfE] [^114kpLNy] [^113wNkLm].

---

Rivaroxaban increases thrombosis risk in mechanical heart valves because it incompletely suppresses the **contact-pathway–driven thrombin generation** [^1121DaH1] induced by valve surfaces, especially the sewing ring [^114kpLNy]. Unlike warfarin, which broadly inhibits multiple vitamin K–dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X) [^117Euwd4], rivaroxaban's selective factor Xa blockade is overwhelmed by local thrombin bursts, leading to valve thrombosis and embolic events [^115zVkfE]. Clinical trials (RE-ALIGN [^115yq5v4], PROACT Xa [^117GVGAw]) and guidelines [^113wNkLm] confirm **higher thromboembolic risk with DOACs**, including rivaroxaban, in mechanical valves; therefore, warfarin remains the standard of care [^114PusyG].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis in mechanical heart valves

Mechanical heart valves are inherently thrombogenic due to **non-physiological surfaces and flow disturbances** that activate coagulation:

- **Contact activation**: Valve leaflets and sewing rings activate the intrinsic pathway, generating thrombin and fibrin [^115zVkfE].

- **Tissue factor exposure**: Surgical trauma exposes tissue factor, triggering the extrinsic pathway and thrombin generation [^notfound].

- **High shear stress**: Turbulent flow around valve hinges and leaflets promotes platelet activation and thrombin formation [^notfound].

These mechanisms create a **prothrombotic milieu** that requires potent, broad anticoagulation [^114PusyG].

---

## Pharmacological limitations of rivaroxaban in mechanical heart valves

Rivaroxaban is a **selective factor Xa inhibitor** that does not adequately suppress the intense thrombin generation driven by mechanical valves:

- **Selective inhibition**: Rivaroxaban only inhibits factor Xa, leaving thrombin and other pathways active [^1153M4cM].

- **Overwhelmed by local thrombin**: Valve surfaces generate thrombin faster than rivaroxaban can inhibit it, causing thrombosis [^115zVkfE].

- **Inadequate suppression**: Rivaroxaban is less effective than warfarin at suppressing valve-induced thrombin generation [^1121DaH1].

---

## Clinical evidence of increased thrombotic risk with rivaroxaban

Clinical studies show **increased thromboembolic events** with rivaroxaban in mechanical valves:

| **Study** | **Design** | **Population** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RE-ALIGN (dabigatran) | RCT | Mechanical valves | Higher thromboembolic events with dabigatran vs warfarin [^115yq5v4] |
| PROACT Xa (apixaban) | RCT | On-X aortic valves | Higher valve thrombosis/thromboembolism with apixaban vs warfarin [^117GVGAw] |
| RIWA (rivaroxaban) | Observational | Mechanical valves | Similar bleeding/thromboembolic events vs warfarin, but fatal outcomes reported [^111KS9rm] |

---

These data, along with mechanistic studies, support a **class effect** of increased thrombotic risk for DOACs in mechanical valves [^111Znf8x].

---

## Comparison with warfarin

Warfarin is superior because it **broadly inhibits** vitamin K–dependent factors (II, VII, IX, X), providing comprehensive suppression of thrombin generation [^117Euwd4]. It has **established efficacy** in reducing thromboembolic events and valve thrombosis in mechanical valves [^111iGHm5]. Guidelines recommend warfarin as the only approved oral anticoagulant for mechanical valves [^113wNkLm] [^114PusyG].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consistently **advise against DOACs** in mechanical valves:

- **ACC/AHA 2020**: DOACs are not recommended in mechanical valves; warfarin is required [^113wNkLm] [^114PusyG].

- **ESC 2017**: NOACs are contraindicated in mechanical valves [^115coprf].

- **AHA/ACC/HRS 2023**: DOACs are not recommended in mechanical valves [^114Z5jKo].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the increased thrombotic risk with rivaroxaban, clinicians should:

- **Use warfarin**: Maintain INR targets per valve type and patient risk [^112FPNMt].

- **Monitor INR closely**: Frequent INR checks reduce thromboembolic risk [^116EM7XU].

- **Avoid DOACs**: Do not switch to rivaroxaban or other DOACs in mechanical valves [^113wNkLm].

---

Rivaroxaban increases thrombosis risk in mechanical valves because its selective factor Xa inhibition cannot suppress the **intense, contact-pathway–driven thrombin generation** on valve surfaces [^1121DaH1]. Warfarin remains the only recommended oral anticoagulant for mechanical valves due to its broader inhibition and proven efficacy [^113wNkLm].

### Rivaroxaban in patients with mechanical heart valves: a pilot study [^112L7bn4]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with mechanical heart valves are still not eligible for treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). We aimed to conduct a proof-of-principle study investigating the anti-Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban as antithrombotic treatment in patients with recent mechanical aortic valve replacement.

Materials and Methods

Low-risk patients scheduled for elective mechanical aortic valve replacement were treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (OD) in a prospective cohort study, started on day 3 postoperatively and given for 6 months. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT02128841).

Results

Ten patients were included (median age, 48; range 39 to 60). Indication was aortic valve stenosis in 6 patients, aortic root aneurysm with severe aortic valve regurgitation in 3 patients, and mixed stenosis/regurgitation in 1 patient. Neither thromboembolic nor bleeding events were observed, and no patient died. Absence of valve thrombosis was demonstrated in all patients. On day 7, median D-dimers were 2723 μg/L (inter-quartile range [IQR] 1672, 5695 μg/L), median TAT levels were 4.5 μg/L (IQR 4.1, 5.6 μg/L); and median peak thrombin generation was 150 nM (IQR 91, 183). On day 90, median D-dimers were 426 μg/L (IQR 278, 569), median TAT levels were 2.7 μg/L (IQR 2.2, 3.1), and median peak thrombin generation were 66 nM (IQR 62, 87).

Conclusions

Rivaroxaban 20 mg OD was safe and effective in a pilot study of 10 low risk patients with mechanical aortic heart valve. Our results justify larger studies investigating the application of anti-Xa inhibitors in patients with mechanical heart valves.

Efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with standard treatment

In non-valvular AF, a meta-analysis of the four main trials investigating dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban revealed that the rate of stroke and systemic embolism, all-cause mortality and intracranial haemorrhage were all significantly reduced by 19%, 10%, and 52%, respectively, compared to patients on warfarin. However, with the exception of apixaban; rivaroxaban, higher doses of dabigatran and edoxaban were associated with 25% increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Meta-analysis of trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in patients with acute VTE, demonstrated DOACs were non-inferior to conventional therapy and associated with a reduced risk of bleeding. Pooled analysis of trials conducted with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban revealed that DOACs are effective for post-operative thromboprophylaxis in patients after a total hip or knee replacement, but their clinical benefits over LMWHs are marginal and DOACs are generally associated with higher bleeding tendency.

Finally, in a phase II dose validation study (RE-ALIGN), the efficacy and safety of dabigatran was compared to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves. The study was however terminated prematurely due to increased incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events in the dabigatran-treated patients and the thromboembolic effects were seen in patients with both high and low trough levels. Therefore, whilst DOACs are indicated in the management of non-valvular AF and VTE, warfarin currently remains the drug of choice for patients with mechanical heart valves. Three small scale proof of concept trials with rivaroxaban in patients with mechanical heart valves demonstrate future investigation of DOACs in mechanical heart valves may warrant investigation.

Factors affecting efficacy and safety of DOACs

Food and drug interactions

Unlike warfarin, DOACs are not known to be affected by food and have fewer drug-drug interactions. A comprehensive list of drug interactions with DOACs has been reviewed by Heidbuchel et al.

Introduction

Valvular heart disease is a common cardiovascular condition, comprising more than 10% of all cardiac surgical procedures in the United States. According to the 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guideline, prosthetic valve replacement is recommended when symptoms develop or valve repair is inappropriate. Tissue or mechanical valves can be used for heart valve replacement. For both mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), mechanical valves have resulted in a long-term mortality benefit in young patients due to the considerably lower reoperation risk compared with tissue valves. Patients who receive mechanical valve replacement surgery must take anticoagulants for the rest of their lives, mostly warfarin.

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are considered an alternative to warfarin in mechanical valve replacement. So far, 2 randomized clinical trials have compared NOAC and warfarin, ie, the Randomized Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement (RE-ALIGN) and the Rivaroxaban vs Warfarin in Patients With Metallic Prosthesis (RIWA) studies. The RE-ALIGN study found that dabigatran was not as effective as warfarin at the tested dose for thromboembolic event prevention after mechanical valve replacement, and furthermore, it had a higher bleeding risk. However, it has some limitations, such as an inadequate trough plasma level and different mechanism from other NOACs. In the RIWA study, 15 mg of rivaroxaban twice daily exhibited similar numbers of bleeding and thromboembolic events compared with warfarin. However, contrary to the aforementioned study, thrombolyticand even fataloutcomes have been described. Furthermore, apixaban demonstrated comparable efficacy in preclinical AVR models. Further investigations are warranted; however, warfarin remains the first-choice anticoagulant after mechanical valve surgery.

AF and Artificial Heart Valves

Valvular heart disease and AF commonly coexist and each contribute independently to thromboembolic events and mortality. 21 Valvular AF refers to the presence of mechanical prosthetic heart valve or moderate to severe mitral stenosis, conditions that substantially increase thromboembolic risk and serve as a principal exclusion criterion for the major DOAC phase III AF trials. 22, 23, 24, 25 More specifically, the RE‐ALIGN (Dabigatran Versus Warfarin in Patients With Mechanical Heart Valves) trial established the use of DOACs as contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves. 26 The study was terminated early, as patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves experienced excess thromboembolic and bleeding events. Therefore, VKA remains the preferred agent for this patient population as recommended in the current American College of Chest Physicians and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. 27, 28, 29 Bioprosthetic heart valves are considered less thrombogenic compared with mechanical heart valves but nonetheless are associated with increased risk and require chronic anticoagulation in the setting of concurrent AF or mitral stenosis. 30 Overall, the use of DOACs in patients with AF with bioprosthetic valves or other valve repairs still constitutes a gray area in clinical practice because of limited investigation and consensus about the definition of "valvular" AF. Despite the unfavorable outcomes of the RE‐ALIGN trial of mechanical valves, there is a growing interest to investigate use of DOACs in the setting of bioprosthetic valves. Subgroup analysis of the pivotal trials of selected DOACs (apixaban and edoxaban), 31, 32 as well as small‐cohort studies of DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran), 33, 34, 35, 36 support their safe and effective use in patients with bioprosthetic valves. The most recent addition to this area evaluated 218 patients undergoing bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valve replacement or repair and randomized to edoxaban 60 mg daily or warfarin dose adjusted to an INR between 2 and 3 during the first 3 months after the procedure. 37 Though the results are yet to be published, edoxaban was found to be noninferior for the primary efficacy (death, asymptomatic intracardiac thrombosis, and clinical thromboembolic event — defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic valve thrombosis, systemic non–central nervous system embolism or deep vein thrombosis) and safety (major bleeding) end points. Thus, the limited evidence supports the notion that bioprosthetic heart valves should not preclude DOAC use, a practice that is echoed by the European Heart Rhythm Association (see Table 2). 38

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^113dva2u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanical Prosthetic Valves and Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease

Valvular heart disease has a prevalence of 2.5% (any valve) in the United States, and is equally distributed between men and women. 27 Prosthetic heart valve replacement is recommended for many patients with severe valvular heart disease 28 and on average 300 000 prosthetic heart valve replacements are performed every year worldwide, 100 000 of which are in North America. 29 By 2050, the annual number of valve replacements is projected to be 850 000. 30 Mechanical valves are more durable than bioprosthetic valves but typically require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. 31 The use of VKAs provides excellent protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with mechanical heart valves, 31 but its use is bound by the drawbacks previously described.

Although preclinical studies showed a potential role of NOACs in the presence of a mechanical valve, in the RE‐ALIGN trial, dabigatran was associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves were excluded from the major NOAC trials, and thus their results cannot be generalized in this distinct patient population. In vitro studies have demonstrated that dabigatran (1 μmol/L) 32 and high‐dose rivaroxaban (300 ng/mL) 33 were as effective as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing thrombus formation on mechanical heart valves. In porcine models of heterotopic mechanical valve implantation, dabigatran 34 and rivaroxaban 35 have been equally effective as enoxaparin in preventing valvular thrombus formation. Dabigatran provides a mortality benefit when compared with warfarin after mechanical mitral valve replacement in pigs. 36 However, these results have not been translated in humans. Several case reports demonstrated severe valvular thrombosis when dabigatran was used in the setting of mechanical mitral valve, 37, 38 mechanical aortic valve, 39 or rheumatic mitral stenosis. 40 In the RE‐ALIGN phase II clinical trial, patients with mechanical heart valves were randomized to receive either dabigatran (150, 220, or 300 mg twice daily, to achieve serum dabigatran trough concentrations > 50 ng/mL) or dose‐adjusted warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5, depending on their thromboembolic risk. The trial was terminated prematurely because of significantly increased thromboembolic and bleeding rates in the dabigatran arm. 26 As a result, research for this indication has been stopped, and use of these agents is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^114eRc9g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Accumulated evidence from controlled study subanalyses, case reports, and current practice guidelines suggests that patients with AF and normal valves, or with defective valves that do not require surgical intervention, may be considered as having NVAF. With the exception of mechanical heart valves and severe mitral stenosis, there is a lack of evidence of increased stroke risk in the presence of other types of valvular abnormalities. In this author's opinion, any form of VHD not severe enough to require surgical intervention, including rheumatic and nonrheumatic mitral stenosis, may be considered NVAF. Many patients with mild or moderate VHD who were excluded from the pivotal DOAC trials could have been included.

Importantly, none of the pivotal DOAC trials were designed or powered to study the effectiveness of DOACs in patients with valve disease. Patients with VHD who were not excluded from the pivotal trials (eg, those with bioprosthetic heart valves, mitral regurgitation, and aortic stenosis), and those with valvular lesions that are not specifically contraindicated in the product information, may be considered for treatment with DOACs. However, it is important to note that this clinical perspective should be interpreted with caution, particularly by prescribing physicians in the United States. Given the definition of NVAF according to the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, prescribers and patients in the United States need to be aware that for patients with AF and bioprosthetic heart valves, treatment with DOACs is contrary to current FDA recommendations.

Results from the RE‐ALIGN trial and specific case reports of the use of dabigatran for the prevention of embolic events in patients with AF and coexistent native VHD indicate that the direct thrombin inhibitor is not effective in preventing thrombosis and should be avoided in patients with mechanical valve replacements. Until data are available on the use of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban in patients with mechanical heart valves, such patients should be anticoagulated with warfarin.

The localization of thrombus formation appears to differ in patients with NVAF and those with valvular AF. 48 In NVAF, thrombi predominantly develop in the left atrial appendage. This difference may influence efficacy and outcomes of anticoagulant therapy. 49 Results from a recent study showed that specific left atrial appendage morphology correlates with the risk of stroke in patients with NVAF. This observation may have an impact on anticoagulation management in patients with NVAF, particularly those with a low‐to‐intermediate risk of stroke. 50

### Novel horizons in anticoagulation: the emerging role of factor XI inhibitors across different settings [^116vBDuE]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Orthopedic surgery

In patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, especially total knee and hip arthroplasties, VTE prophylaxis is fundamental. Conventional anticoagulants, which target factor Xa or thrombin, are efficacious but associated with a marked risk of bleeding. This issue highlights the imperative for anticoagulation strategies that are both effective and safe. Against this backdrop, FXI inhibitors stand out as a promising avenue, potentially delivering effective thromboprophylaxis while minimizing bleeding risks, thus meeting the pressing demand for safer anticoagulants in patients undergoing arthroplasty procedures.

Patients with mechanical heart valves and external devices

Anticoagulation remains a pivotal yet challenging aspect in the management of valvular heart disease, particularly with mechanical heart valves. The standard treatment with warfarin has considerable limitations, prompting the search for alternatives. However, the use of DOAC in patients with mechanical heart valves has encountered setbacks, as evidenced by the failure of dabigatran and apixaban in major clinical trials, while rivaroxaban showed promise in smaller studies. Meanwhile, vitamin K antagonists continue to be the only approved oral anticoagulants for preventing valve thrombosis. The situation is further complicated in settings involving external surfaces such as left ventricular assist devices or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, in which the safety profile and appropriate use of DOAC are yet to be clarified.

In patients with left ventricular assist devices, the challenge lies in balancing the risk of pump thrombosis against bleeding complications due to coagulopathies such as an acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Thus, there is a pressing need for randomized controlled trials to establish optimal antithrombotic regimens in these patients, particularly in the context of new valve designs and targeting different aspects of the coagulation cascade.

### Rivaroxaban and dabigatran for suppression of mechanical heart valve-induced thrombin generation [^1121DaH1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with mechanical heart valves (MHVs) require warfarin to prevent thromboembolism. Dabigatran was less effective than warfarin in patients with MHVs, which prompted a black box warning against the use of direct oral anticoagulants for this indication. However, rivaroxaban and apixaban, which inhibit factor Xa, have not been evaluated in patients with MHVs. To determine whether rivaroxaban and apixaban would be effective, we used MHV-induced thrombin generation assays to compare them with warfarin either alone or in combination with dabigatran.

Methods

Thrombin generation in the absence or presence of MHV leaflets or sewing ring segments (SRSs) was quantified. Studies were done in control plasma; plasma from patients on warfarin; plasma containing varying concentrations of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or dabigatran alone; or plasma containing rivaroxaban plus dabigatran.

Results

Mean endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) increased 1.2-fold, 1.5-fold, and 1.8-fold in the presence of leaflets, Teflon (Terumo Aortic (Sunrise, FL)) SRSs, or Dacron (Terumo Aortic (Sunrise, FL)) SRSs, respectively. Rivaroxaban and apixaban reduced ETP at concentrations above 50 ng/mL but were less effective than warfarin. When rivaroxaban and dabigatran were combined, they suppressed ETP in a more than additive manner.

Conclusions

Whereas warfarin suppresses MHV-induced thrombin generation, MHVs induce the generation of factor Xa in concentrations that overwhelm clinically relevant concentrations of rivaroxaban or apixaban. When used in combination, rivaroxaban and dabigatran are more effective than either agent is alone, suggesting that concomitant inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin is better than inhibition of either clotting enzyme alone.

### Anticoagulant therapy for mechanical heart valves-unmet need persists [^116B6Psp]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban or dabigatran have revolutionized anticoagulant treatment. These drugs, which specifically inhibit either factor Xa or thrombin, respectively, are at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism and have important safety advantages that include reduced risks of intracranial hemorrhage, fatal bleeding, and all-cause mortality. 1–3 They are also much easier to use because they are given in a fixed dose without routine laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect and dose adjustment in the individual patient.

### Trial design: rivaroxaban for the prevention of major cardiovascular events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: rationale and design of the GALILEO study [^112dHvUf]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown and determined empirically. The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban may potentially reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications and premature valve failure.

Design

GALILEO is an international, randomized, open-label, event-driven, phase III trial in more than 1,520 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation who underwent a successful TAVR (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02556203). Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio), 1 to 7days after a successful TAVR, to either a rivaroxaban-based strategy or an antiplatelet-based strategy. In the experimental arm, subjects receive rivaroxaban (10mg once daily [OD]) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 75–100mg OD) for 90days followed by rivaroxaban alone. In the control arm, subjects receive clopidogrel (75mg OD) plus ASA (as above) for 90days followed by ASA alone. In case new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs after randomization, full oral anticoagulation will be implemented with maintenance of the original treatment assignment. The primary efficacy end point is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the composite of life-threatening, disabling, and major bleeding, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions.

Conclusions

GALILEO will test the hypothesis that a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications post-TAVR with an acceptable risk of bleeding compared with the currently recommended antiplatelet therapy-based strategy in subjects without need of chronic oral anticoagulation.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for mechanical heart valves: is the door still open? [^113j9Vkt]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of mitral or aortic valvular heart disease is ≈2.5% in the general population of Western countries, and is expected to rise with population aging. A substantial proportion of patients with valvular heart disease undergoes surgical valve replacement. Mechanical heart valves are much more durable than bioprostheses, and are thus preferentially implanted in patients with a longer life expectancy, but have the major drawback of requiring lifelong anticoagulation to prevent valve thrombosis because of their higher thrombogenicity. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are replacing vitamin K antagonists in many settings, including bioprostheses, because of their favorable safety and efficacy profiles. However, mechanical heart valves currently pose an absolute contraindication to NOACs based on the results of a single phase II study comparing dabigatran and warfarin (RE-ALIGN [Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement]). That trial was stopped prematurely because of an excess of both stroke and bleeding with the dabigatran doses tested. Because of such negative findings, research in this area has been halted. We believe that several aspects of both the preclinical studies and the RE-ALIGN trial should be critically reevaluated. In our opinion, 1 single trial with a single NOAC does not represent sufficient evidence for dismissing a therapeutic strategy, anticoagulation with NOACs, that has shown better safety and at least similar efficacy as warfarin in the setting of atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Herein, we reevaluate this topic to identify the patient profile that has the greatest likelihood of benefit from some of the NOACs, with a focus on factor Xa inhibitors, thus providing some perspectives for basic and translational research.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^116YctgG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Case Studies

At present, few data are available on the efficacy and safety of DOACs in VHD. However, several case studies of complications with DOAC use in the setting of valvular abnormalities have been reported. To date, several cases of thrombosis complicating dabigatran use in the setting of mechanical valve prosthesis have been published. All of these cases report mechanical valve thromboembolism after a switch from warfarin to dabigatran in the setting of either mitral 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 or aortic 42, 43, 44, 45 heart valves. Two fatal cases of mitral valve thrombosis were reported, with neither patient surviving repeat valve replacement surgery. 38 There was one report of nonfatal bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis leading to massive stroke after a switch from warfarin to dabigatran. Currently, there is one documented case of thrombosis in a patient with AF and coexistent valvular disease (mitral stenosis) without valve replacement during dabigatran anticoagulation. 46 To date, there are no published reports for any other DOAC relating to thromboembolism in patients with AF associated with VHD.

On the basis of these case reports, evidence is mounting that dabigatran is associated with mechanical valve thrombosis. Therefore, patients with mechanical heart valves, regardless of position (mitral or aortic), should not be treated with dabigatran as a replacement for warfarin. Additionally, these case reports highlight the risk of serious adverse events when switching treatment regimens from VKA to the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran in patients with AF and underlying valvular disease.

The role of DOACs in patients with mechanical or prosthetic heart valves requires further research. Currently, there are no published clinical trials and few case reports evaluating the use of the other DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban) in patients with mechanical valves. It is expected that results from the ongoing CATHAR (Comparison of Antithrombotic Treatments After Aortic Valve Replacement. Rivaroxaban: A New Antithrombotic Treatment for Patients With Mechanical Prosthetic Aortic Heart Valve; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02128841) trial, a phase 2 study to assess the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban for the prevention of major complications in patients undergoing mechanical aortic valve replacement, will elucidate the role of rivaroxaban in this population. 47

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113iuwWr]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — supportive evidence and pathophysiology relevant to secondary prevention indicate that the left atrial appendage is thought to be the main source of cardioembolism in AF and, in a series of patients with stroke and AF evaluated by echocardiography, 90% of identified thrombus was seen in the left atrial appendage; anticoagulation decreases thrombus formation systemically, including the left atrium, and reduces the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in AF, but at the cost of increased bleeding. VKA with warfarin reduced the primary event rate in the randomized SPAF trial by 67% (7.4% to 2.3%) and was superior to treatment with aspirin alone, which reduced the primary event rate by 42%; four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have been studied in 4 large randomized trials against VKA with consistent evidence of noninferior reduction in thromboembolic risk and reduced bleeding risks. All trials of DOACs specifically excluded patients with valvular AF; however, up to 20% of patients in these trials had some degree of valvular heart disease (VHD), and DOACs should not be used in patients with moderately severe or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Additionally, the presence of stroke or TIA places a patient in a category in which anticoagulation is recommended regardless of other risk factors, and even brief subclinical episodes of AF are associated with increased risk of stroke.

Direct oral anticoagulants dosing across multiple indications — The hierarchy of dosing for the direct oral anticoagulants should be considered; because thrombotic risks typically outweigh bleeding risks in eligible patients, the highest dose indicated should generally be selected. In a patient with coronary artery disease, PAD, and AF who has indications for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily as well as 15 or 20 mg daily, the AF dose of rivaroxaban should be prioritized over the lower coronary artery disease and PAD dose, and with reduced renal function rivaroxaban 15 mg daily should be used; special consideration should be paid to those with a mechanical heart valve, which requires a vitamin K antagonist.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### Warfarin faring better: vitamin K antagonists beat rivaroxaban and apixaban in the INVICTUS and PROACT Xa trials [^116qyr7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Although guidelines give preference to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), DOACs are not recommended in those with rheumatic heart disease or mechanical heart valves. The results of the INVICTUS trial (Investigation of Rheumatic AF Treatment Using Vitamin K Antagonists, Rivaroxaban or Aspirin Studies), which compared rivaroxaban with a VKA in patients with rheumatic heart disease-associated AF, and the PROACT Xa trial (A Trial to Determine if Participants with an On-X Aortic Valve Can be Maintained Safely on Apixaban), which compared apixaban with warfarin in patients with an On-X valve in the aortic position, support the use of VKAs for these indications. In this paper, we review the results of these trials, provide perspective on why VKAs were superior to DOACs, and discuss future directions for anticoagulation in these disorders.

### How did we get here? a historical review and critical analysis of anticoagulation therapy following mechanical valve replacement [^111ByZdq]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Managing severe valvular heart disease with mechanical valve replacement necessitates lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist. Optimal anticoagulation intensity for patients with mechanical valves remains uncertain; current recommendations are inconsistent across guideline bodies and largely based on expert opinion. In this review, we outline the history of anticoagulation therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves and critically evaluate current antithrombotic guidelines for these patients. We conclude that randomized trials evaluating optimal anticoagulation intensity in patients with mechanical valves are needed, and that future guidelines must better justify antithrombotic treatment recommendations.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — aortic mechanical valve anticoagulation notes that in bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) treated with a VKA, thromboembolism is estimated at 0.5% per patient-year over the INR range of 2.0 to 4.5, and adverse events increased if the INR was > 4.0. In a randomized trial comparing moderate-intensity (INR 2.0–3.0) with high-intensity (INR 3.0 to 4.5) oral anticoagulation in patients with a single mechanical valve replacement, there was no difference in embolic events but a reduction in bleeding with the moderate-intensity group. In patients with current-generation mechanical aortic prosthetic valves and no thromboembolic risk factors, an INR target of 1.5 to 2.5 was noninferior to 2.0 to 3.0, and for current-generation mechanical valve prostheses in the aortic position, an INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) provides a reasonable balance between the risks of thromboembolism and bleeding.

Mechanical heart valves and mitral stenosis — NOAC use guidance specifies that the use of the NOACs in patients with AF and mechanical valve prosthesis is contraindicated. Randomized clinical trials testing the efficacy and safety of direct oral FXa inhibitors in patients with AF and mechanical heart valve prosthesis are lacking, and until more data are available, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are contraindicated in such patients. Until more data are available, AF patients with any degree of rheumatic mitral valve stenosis and those with moderate-to-severe non-rheumatic mitral stenosis should not be treated with NOACs. The efficacy and safety of NOACs for stroke/SE prevention may be similar in AF patients with and without conservative valve surgery or bioprosthetic valves based on small numbers of patients in post hoc analyses of RCTs.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease [^115zVkfE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiologically, AF can be caused by different mechanisms that lead to remodeling of the left atria and increase the probability of thrombus formation. Among these mechanisms are VHDs that remain an important cause of AF, namely, in low‐ to middle‐income countries. Globally, at least one third of patients with AF have some degree of VHD. This is a subpopulation of particular interest because, as a group, patients with AF and VHD are known to have a higher prevalence of stroke and systemic thromboembolism than patients with AF without VHD. Therefore, the indication of DOACs versus warfarin also needed to be evaluated in this subpopulation.

The results of the RE‐ALIGN (Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients After Heart Valve Replacement) trial that tested dabigatran versus warfarin in patients with aortic or mitral mechanical heart valves brought some disappointment, however, as the trial had to be stopped early because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events in the dabigatran group, as compared with the warfarin group. Subsequently, an RCT that compared apixaban with warfarin to prevent valve thrombosis or thromboembolism after implantation of a mechanical aortic valve (PROACT Xa [Prospective Randomized On‐X Anticoagulation Clinical Trial]) similarly had to be stopped early due to an excess of thromboembolism in the apixaban group. Possible explanations for the increase in thromboembolic complications with DOACs compared with warfarin included inadequate plasma levels of the drug and a mechanism of action that differed from that of warfarin. Authors of the RE‐ALIGN study hypothesized that although the choice of a target trough plasma level of 50 ng/mL of dabigatran was primarily based on data from the RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial, they could not exclude the possibility that targeting a higher trough level of dabigatran in RE‐ALIGN would have been more effective for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. Nevertheless, higher dabigatran doses might have led to unacceptably higher bleeding rates. Also, while in patients with AF, thrombi are formed in the left atrial appendage under low flow, and thrombin generation is believed to be triggered by stasis and endothelial dysfunction, in patients with a mechanical heart valve, thrombin generation can be triggered by exposure of blood to the artificial surface of the valve leaflets and sewing ring, which induce activation of the contact pathway of coagulation. The sewing ring becomes less thrombogenic once endothelial tissue has formed around it. Warfarin is likely to be more effective than dabigatran in this context because it inhibits the activation of both tissue factor–induced coagulation (by inhibiting the synthesis of coagulation factor VII) and contact pathway–induced coagulation (by inhibiting the synthesis of factor IX), as well as inhibiting the synthesis of factor X and thrombin in the common pathway, while dabigatran only inhibits thrombin, and apixaban is a highly selective factor Xa inhibitor. It has been hypothesized that if contact activation is intense, the resulting thrombin generation may overwhelm local levels of DOACs, which can lead to thrombus formation on the surface of the valve and associated embolic complications.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Z5jKo]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): DOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the first-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients). Across pivotal trials, major bleeding risks were lower in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups versus warfarin, while differences were nonsignificant for the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group; all DOAC groups showed significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were significantly higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, whereas apixaban did not significantly increase gastrointestinal bleeding versus warfarin.

In patients with a mechanical mitral or aortic valve at low risk of bleeding, we suggest adding over not adding an antiplatelet agent such as low-dose aspirin (50–100 mg/d) to the VKA therapy (Grade 1B), with the remark that caution should be used in patients at increased bleeding risk, such as history of GI bleeding.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): a network meta-analysis [^116nCcEL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In people without an indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In people with an indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In people without an indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In people with an indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.

### Drug insight: an overview of current anticoagulation therapy after heart valve replacement [^117Lut5Y]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are the gold standard approach for the long-term anticoagulant therapy of patients with mechanical heart valves. Management decisions are, however, based predominantly on expert consensus and on data from nonrandomized, follow-up studies, which have inherent limitations in their methods. Low-intensity anticoagulation therapy provides protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with most types of modern prosthetic heart valve. The addition of low-dose aspirin is safe if international normalized ratio values below 3.5 are maintained. A combined regimen should be considered in high-risk patients and those with coexistent coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, and in patients who have suffered a thromboembolic event despite a therapeutic international normalized ratio. Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins is restricted to specific situations, such as when a patient is intolerant to vitamin K antagonists, when surgical procedures require discontinuation of oral anticoagulation, or when the patient is pregnant. A lack of uniformity across practice guidelines make it difficult to reach treatment decisions. Each patient's preference, expressed after counseling about the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy, and an individual assessment of the patient's risk factors, should guide treatment decisions. At present, new anticoagulant agents such as factor Xa inhibitors do not represent a treatment option for heart valve recipients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

2019 AHA/ACC/HRS AF guideline recommendations — anticoagulation selection and monitoring — include that for patients with AF and an elevated CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater in men or 3 or greater in women, oral anticoagulants are recommended, with options including warfarin (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), dabigatran (Class I, Level of Evidence: B), rivaroxaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B), apixaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B), or edoxaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B-R). DOACs (direct-acting oral anticoagulants) are recommended over warfarin in DOAC-eligible patients with AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). Among patients treated with warfarin, the INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of anticoagulant therapy and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). In patients with AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). Selection of anticoagulant therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

### An evidence-based approach to anticoagulation therapy comparing direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists in patients with atrial fibrillation and bioprosthetic valves: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis [^115GrnaG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a newer class of anticoagulants that inhibit factor Xa or factor IIa and include drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, and dabigatran. Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been traditionally used to prevent thromboembolic events, DOACs have gained popularity because of their faster onset and offset of action and reduced need for monitoring. This study aimed to provide more data for anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation with bioprosthetic heart valves by incorporating all available trials to date. A search was performed across 5 electronic databases to identify relevant studies. We analyzed the data using a pooled risk ratio for categorical outcomes and used the I 2 test to determine heterogeneity. The quality of randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, and the National Institutes of Health tool was used for observational studies. Our study included a frequentist network meta-analysis (MA) of the aggregate data to obtain the network estimates for the outcomes of interest. We retrieved 28 studies with a total of 74,660 patients with bioprosthetic heart valves. Our MA significantly showed that DOACs decrease the risk of all-cause bleeding (risk ratio [RR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.85, p > 0.00001), stroke and systemic embolization (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99, p = 0.03), and intracranial bleeding outcomes (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86, p = 0.004) compared with VKA. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the compared groups in major bleeding (RR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02, p = 0.10) and all-cause mortality outcomes (RR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07, p = 0.43), respectively. In addition, the network MA results did not favor any of the studied interventions over each other (p < 0.05) regarding all-cause bleeding, mortality, stroke and systemic embolization, and major bleeding outcomes. In conclusion, our study found that DOACs are more effective in reducing the risk of bleeding, stroke, systemic embolism, and intracranial bleeding than VKAs. However, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, thromboembolic events, and all-cause mortality. In addition, our network MA did not identify any specific DOAC treatment as more favorable than others.

Mechanical valve prostheses — antiplatelet therapy with vitamin K antagonist (VKA): The prior recommendation to add low-dose aspirin to therapeutic VKA for a mechanical valve prosthesis was based on older studies with additional risk factors. A 2013 Cochrane Systematic Review showed that compared with anticoagulation alone, adding an antiplatelet agent reduced thromboembolic events and total mortality but at the cost of an increased and offsetting risk of major bleeding, and an individualized approach that takes bleeding risk into account is required.

### Antithrombotic treatment for valve prostheses: which drug, which dose, and when? [^112Hmm7i]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the significant reduction of the overall burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), valvular heart disease (VHD) still represents an important cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. While the number of patients with prosthetic heart valves (PHV) is increasing, management of antithrombotic therapy in this setting remains particularly challenge. This happens also because the scientific guidelines and consensus documents rely on limited evidences. Nevertheless, the evolution in prostheses' materials, the spread of transcatheter interventions, and the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), altogether led to a scientific renaissance of this field. Our purpose is to examine and discuss the available evidences on the use of antithrombotic treatments in patients with mechanical and biological PHV, with the aim to provide a practical tool for decision making in every day clinical practice.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^112LQxpY]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease with atrial fibrillation — anticoagulant selection and intensity are specified as follows: In patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve who have ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and atrial fibrillation (AF), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — are recommended over warfarin therapy. For mechanical mitral valve replacement, warfarin is recommended with an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5); in GELIA, a lower INR (2.0–3.5) was associated with lower survival than a higher target INR range (2.5–4.5). Although routine addition of aspirin to warfarin in mechanical valves is not recommended, in those with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA before mechanical valve surgery the protection from combination aspirin–warfarin therapy may outweigh bleeding risk.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111H95oL]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — post-embolism evaluation in mechanical and bioprosthetic valves highlights prioritizing international normalized ratio (INR) review and individualized antithrombotic decisions. There are no comparative-effectiveness trials assessing higher-intensity vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy versus standard VKA therapy plus low-dose aspirin in mechanical valve recipients with stroke or systemic embolism while in target INR range, and excluding extended time in a subtherapeutic INR range is the first priority. Management includes reviewing INR levels to ensure the patient is in the target INR range most of the time, recognizing that subtherapeutic INR may reflect suboptimal medication adherence, intercurrent illness, new or recently adjusted medications, dietary changes, or alcohol intake. Whether to intensify VKA therapy or add low-dose aspirin is a patient-specific, shared decision-making proposition that must weigh several factors, including bleeding risk. In bioprosthetic valve patients with stroke or embolic events, further imaging with TEE or 3D CT may show leaflet thrombosis, which should respond to anticoagulation with either a VKA or a NOAC; if leaflet thrombosis is not established, the effectiveness of anticoagulation is uncertain and patients should undergo a full neurological evaluation to rule out other causes. Shared decision-making that accounts for bleeding risk is emphasized.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — mechanical valve anticoagulation states that all patients with mechanical valves require life-long anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), and therapy with an oral VKA at an INR goal appropriate for the patient and prosthesis is required to decrease thromboembolism; VKA is protective against valve thrombosis (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.07–0.2) and thromboembolic events (OR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16–0.27). It is preferable to specify a single INR target for each patient and to recognize that the acceptable range includes 0.5 INR units on each side of this target, and fluctuations in INR are associated with an increased incidence of complications in patients with prosthetic heart valves.

### Is concomitant aspirin helping novel oral anticoagulants? Focus on apixaban [^115DRH4Q]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

ARISTOTLE

A total of 20–25% of patients were on combination warfarin-ASA in the ARISTOTLE trial, despite the fact that only 14% and 16% of patients had a history or occurrence of MI before and throughout the trial duration, respectively. It is a conundrum as to why there was such a high rate of concomitant warfarin-ASA allowed, when a favourable benefit to risk ratio for combination warfarin-ASA therapy has only been shown for patients with mechanical heart valves, the very patients excluded from this trial.

Combined warfarin-ASA therapy confers a 1–2% absolute risk increase in major bleeds per year compared with warfarin alone, with each major bleed conferring a 9–10% death rate per year. Therefore, for every 1000 patients treated with combination warfarin-ASA in ARISTOTLE, 20 additional major bleeds and 2 additional deaths per year would occur compared with the group on warfarin alone. It has been previously shown that aspirin in addition to another new oral anticoagulant (dabigatran 150 mg twice daily) does not significantly increase major bleeds. Indeed, aspirin did not significantly increase major bleeds, clinically relevant plus major bleeds, or total bleeds, compared with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily without aspirin in the Dabigatran With or Without Concomitant Aspirin Compared With Warfarin Alone in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (PETRO) study. This is despite the fact that dabigatran increased gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin in the RE-LY trial. Thus, aspirin may not increase bleeding with concomitant use of apixaban (as it did not with dabigatran); it is generally recognised that apixaban may be the safest novel oral anticoagulant compared to dabigatran and rivaroxaban. If indeed aspirin does not increase the risk of a major bleed with apixaban, then this could potentially affect the interpretation of the ARISTOTLE trial.

Pregnancy with mechanical heart valves — antithrombotic guidance notes that low-dose aspirin is regarded as safe during pregnancy and can be continued when indicated, while anti-Xa direct oral anticoagulants have not been shown to be safe in patients with mechanical heart valves and should not be used in pregnancy. Fixed-dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) without anti-Xa monitoring in pregnant patients with mechanical prostheses has been associated with a high risk of valve thrombosis and maternal death, and in pregnant women treated with dose-adjusted LMWH, the dose required to maintain an adequate anti-Xa level 4 to 6 hours after administration increases throughout pregnancy. Additionally, a randomized clinical trial of dabigatran in nonpregnant patients with mechanical heart valves showed increased thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin.

### Dabigatran is less effective than warfarin at attenuating mechanical heart valve-induced thrombin generation [^117Euwd4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with mechanical heart valves (MHV) require life-long anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events. Traditionally, warfarin has been the anticoagulant of choice in such patients. By decreasing the functional levels of factors (F) II, VII, IX, and X, warfarin attenuates the extrinsic, intrinsic, and common pathways of blood coagulation. In patients with MHV, warfarin is dose-adjusted to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3.5, depending on the type of valve, its anatomical location, and the presence of patient factors associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.

Although effective, warfarin is burdensome for patients and physicians because it requires frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustments, reflecting, at least in part, numerous food- and drug-drug interactions. In addition, there is a risk of serious bleeding with warfarin, including intracranial bleeding, which can occur even when the INR is within the therapeutic range. The limitations of warfarin prompted the development of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) that can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. One such agent is dabigatran etexilate, an oral thrombin inhibitor, which is licensed for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, and for treatment of venous thromboembolism. At a dose of 150 mg twice daily, dabigatran was superior to warfarin for reduction in the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and was associated with significantly less intracranial bleeding.

Recently, dabigatran was compared with warfarin in 2 strata of MHV patients in the Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement (RE-ALIGN); those with newly implanted valves and those with valves implanted more than 3 months prior to randomization. In both strata, the dose of dabigatran could be increased from 150 to 300 mg twice daily in order to maintain trough drug levels above 50 ng/mL. The study was stopped early because there were 9 strokes in the dabigatran group and none in the warfarin group. Furthermore, in patients with newly implanted valves, there was a trend for more pericardial bleeding with dabigatran than with warfarin; a finding that precluded dabigatran dose escalation. The results of this study prompted a black box warning advising against the use of dabigatran in patients with MHV.

The study RIVER was published by Helio P Guimarães and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Prosthetic heart valves and Mitral regurgitation. In the RIVER study, the trial question was: is rivaroxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with AF and a bioprosthetic mitral valve? In the RIVER study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RIVER study, the population was: 1005 patients (607 female, 398 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF and a bioprosthetic mitral valve. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to either rivaroxaban or warfarin; high bleeding risk; transient AF caused by surgery; placement of mechanical valves. In the RIVER study, the interventions were: n = 500 rivaroxaban (oral dose of 20 mg daily) n = 505 warfarin (dose adjustment to maintain a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0). In the RIVER study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in time until death, major cardiovascular events, or major bleeding at 12 months (347.5 days vs. 340.1 days; AD 7.4 days, 95% CI -1.4 to 16.3). In the RIVER study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes or thromboembolic events (3.4% vs. 5.1%; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.2) Significant decrease in stroke (0.6% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.88) No significant difference in valve thrombosis (1% vs. 0.6%; HR 1.68, 95% CI 0.4 to 7.01). In the RIVER study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, nonmajor bleeding, other serious adverse events. In the RIVER study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF and a bioprosthetic mitral valve, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to time until death, major cardiovascular events, or major bleeding at 12 months.

CONCLUSIONS

In this comparative effectiveness and safety study, among patients with AF and VHD, DOAC treatment was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding compared with warfarin.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines — antithrombotic therapy and INR monitoring state that in patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized based on shared decision-making after discussion of the absolute and RRs of stroke and bleeding, and the patient's values and preferences (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). Selection of antithrombotic therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). In patients with nonvalvular AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended and the target international normalized ratio (INR) intensity (2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5) should be based on the type and location of the prosthesis (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with nonvalvular AF with prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, oral anticoagulants are recommended; options include: warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) (Class I, Level of Evidence: A); dabigatran (Class I, Level of Evidence: B); rivaroxaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B); or apixaban (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). Among patients treated with warfarin, the INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of antithrombotic therapy and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR range) is stable (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). Re-evaluation of the need for and choice of antithrombotic therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risks (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). For patients with atrial flutter, antithrombotic therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for AF (Class I, Level of Evidence: C).

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with valvular heart disease: a systematic review [^111B9Leh]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are indicated for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), which, according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines, excludes patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. However, the data regarding use of DOACs in AF patients with other types of valvular heart disease (VHD) are unclear. We aimed to summarize and evaluate the literature regarding the safety and efficacy of DOAC use in NVAF patients with other types of VHD. After an extensive literature search, a total of 1 prospective controlled trial, 4 subanalyses, and 1 abstract were identified. Efficacy of the DOAC agents in NVAF patients with VHD mirrored the overall trial results. Bleeding risk was significantly increased in VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban, but not for dabigatran or apixaban. Of the bioprosthetic valve patients enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, no safety or efficacy concerns were identified. In conclusion, subanalyses of DOAC landmark AF trials revealed that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban may be safely used in AF patients with certain types of VHD: aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. More evidence is needed before routinely recommending these agents for patients with bioprosthetic valves or mild mitral stenosis. Patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves should continue to receive warfarin, as these patients were excluded from all landmark AF trials.

This study is related to the following diseases: Mitral stenosis, Prosthetic heart valves, Aortic stenosis, Mitral regurgitation, Aortic regurgitation and Tricuspid regurgitation. In the RE-ALIGN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves? In the RE-ALIGN study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RE-ALIGN study, the population was: 252 patients (89 female, 163 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement within the past 7 days and those who had undergone such replacement at least 3 months earlier. The key exclusion criteria were previous prosthetic heart valve replacement, aortic root replacement, replacement of ascending aorta, concomitant bioprosthetic valve replacement, complex congenital heart abnormality, acute coronary syndrome within one month, uncontrolled hypertension, or recent emergency surgery. In the RE-ALIGN study, the interventions were: n = 168 dabigatran (150, 220, or 300 mg BID, adjusted to obtain a trough plasma level of at least 50 ng/mL) n = 84 warfarin (adjusted to obtain an INR of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5 on the basis of thromboembolic risk). In the RE-ALIGN study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, stroke, systemic embolism, or myocardial infarction (8% vs. 2%; HR 3.37, 95% CI 0.76 to 14.95). In the RE-ALIGN study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, stroke, TIA, systemic embolism, or myocardial infarction (9% vs. 5%; HR 1.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.86). In the RE-ALIGN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.48) and major bleeding with pericardial location (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.48). significant differences in any bleeding (27% vs. 12%, p = 0.01). In the RE-ALIGN study, the conclusion was: in patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement within the past 7 days and those who had undergone such replacement at least 3 months earlier, dabigatran was inferior to warfarin with respect to death, stroke, systemic embolism, or myocardial infarction.

INR targets and antiplatelet therapy for mechanical valves — In patients with a mechanical aortic valve, we suggest VKA therapy with a target of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) over lower targets, and we recommend VKA therapy with a target of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) over higher targets. In a mechanical mitral valve, we suggest VKA therapy with a target of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) over lower INR targets; in patients with mechanical heart valves in both the aortic and mitral position, we suggest target INR 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5) over target INR 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0). For patients at low risk of bleeding, we suggest adding over not adding an antiplatelet agent such as low-dose aspirin (50–100 mg/d) to the VKA therapy, with the remark that caution should be used in patients at increased bleeding risk, such as history of GI bleeding. For patients with mechanical aortic or mitral valves we recommend VKA over antiplatelet agents.

### Dabigatran versus warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves [^1166vv5X]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that has been shown to be an effective alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. We evaluated the use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves.

Methods

In this phase 2 dose-validation study, we studied two populations of patients: those who had undergone aortic- or mitral-valve replacement within the past 7 days and those who had undergone such replacement at least 3 months earlier. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either dabigatran or warfarin. The selection of the initial dabigatran dose (150, 220, or 300 mg twice daily) was based on kidney function. Doses were adjusted to obtain a trough plasma level of at least 50 ng per milliliter. The warfarin dose was adjusted to obtain an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5 on the basis of thromboembolic risk. The primary end point was the trough plasma level of dabigatran.

Results

The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrollment of 252 patients because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. In the as-treated analysis, dose adjustment or discontinuation of dabigatran was required in 52 of 162 patients (32%). Ischemic or unspecified stroke occurred in 9 patients (5%) in the dabigatran group and in no patients in the warfarin group; major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (4%) and 2 patients (2%), respectively. All patients with major bleeding had pericardial bleeding.

Conclusions

The use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications, as compared with warfarin, thus showing no benefit and an excess risk.

### Thrombosis and coagulation: operative management of the anticoagulated patient [^1147cbgW]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The surgical management of the anticoagulated patient requires an understanding of the fundamentals of blood thrombosis, the mechanisms that enable anticoagulants to work, and the indications for anticoagulation. As percutaneous cardiac and peripheral procedures become increasingly sophisticated, we can expect to encounter more patients on aspirin and clopidogrel. Management strategies will require continued appraisal of available literature for evidence-based surgical practice. This article summarizes how coagulation takes place and explains the role of certain agents that alter coagulation, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin. The article also discusses thrombosis risks involving patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, patients with mechanical heart valves and patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^111ZNjDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In RE‐ALIGN, most valvular thrombosis occurred in the immediate postoperative period, 26 suggesting that the increased release of pro‐thrombotic substances after surgery overwhelms the capacity of dabigatran to antagonize thrombin. Anticoagulation in this setting should occur with frequent and individualized dose adjustments that match the unpredictably released pro‐coagulant factors and maintain a net anticoagulant effect. 51 Although by study design dabigatran was dosed up to twice the Food and Drug Administration approved dose for AF, to achieve circulating levels > 50 ng/mL, this might not reflect the true anticoagulation effect of dabigatran, at the valve level, in the setting of unpredictable bursts of pro‐thrombotic factors after surgery. However, patients receiving dabigatran had a higher risk of bleeding compared with those receiving VKA. Contrary to this, INR measurements reflect the net anticoagulation effect of VKAs and enable individualized dose adjustment to achieve the desired level of anticoagulation. Given their short half‐lives, monitoring the net anticoagulation effect of NOACs in this dynamic setting would be challenging. Furthermore, dabigatran is a competitive inhibitor of a single coagulation factor while VKAs are noncompetitive irreversible inhibitors of multiple coagulation factors of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, as well as of factor X and thrombin in the common pathway. 52

VKAs remain the anticoagulation modality of choice in patients with mechanical valves. 31 In a meta‐analysis of 46 anticoagulation studies and 53 647 patients with mechanical valves, a mechanical valve in the mitral position was associated with a 2‐fold higher thromboembolic risk compared with the aortic position. Anticoagulation with warfarin was an effective approach for the reduction of thromboembolic events. 53 High INR variability is independently associated with reduced survival after a mechanical valve implantation. 54 There is limited experience on the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with AF and biological prosthesis or mitral valve repair. 55

Regarding patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend anticoagulation with VKAs in the presence of left atrial enlargement (> 55 mm), left atrial thrombus, AF, or history of systemic embolism. 31 There are no randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the benefit of VKAs in patients with rheumatic valve disease, and these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies. 56, 57 Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease were excluded from all major NOAC trials and their use should be avoided until further studies become available.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^113VV9mQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, in the ARISTOTLE, ROCKET‐AF, and RE‐LY trials, patients with VHD were older and had more comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, prior MI, and renal disease, compared with patients without VHD. In ROCKET‐AF and RE‐LY, stroke rates were similar in patients with and without VHD after adjusting for baseline criteria; however, in ARISTOTLE, the rate of SSE was higher in patients with VHD. Major bleeding rates were higher in patients with VHD versus in patients without VHD in all 3 trials. Overall, in the 3 subanalyses of patients with AF and VHD, the risk of SSE was comparable in patients with and without VHD, which demonstrates that the benefits of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban over warfarin for stroke prevention were consistent in these patients. To date, no data on the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin in patients with VHD are available from the ENGAGE‐AF TIMI‐48 trial.

Patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves were excluded from the pivotal trials of the DOACs. Results of subsequent studies led to revision of the dabigatran (Pradaxa ®; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc) product label to recommend against the use of dabigatran in patients with NVAF in the setting of other forms of VHD. In the RE‐ALIGN (Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients With Mechanical Heart Valves; ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01452347) trial, the use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin. 24 These findings suggest that DOACs may be used in selected patients with AF who do not have mechanical heart valve prostheses. Until more data become available, only apixaban and rivaroxaban can be considered at this time for use in patients with NVAF with other valve lesions, regardless of whether such lesions are clinically significant. However, the use of DOACs in this patient population should be appro‐ached with caution and the clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide treatment decisions on a case‐by‐case basis.

### Dabigatran is less effective than warfarin at attenuating mechanical heart valve-induced thrombin generation [^114kpLNy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to dabigatran, warfarin attenuates thrombin generation induced by leaflets or SRS with an INR of 1.5 or higher. Warfarin works because by reducing the functional levels of FIX, FX and prothrombin, it attenuates thrombin generation via the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. Therefore, these findings provide a plausible explanation as to why dabigatran was less effective than warfarin at preventing thromboembolic events in the RE-ALIGN study.

Our findings have important clinical implications. The observation that SRS are more thrombogenic than leaflets is consistent with the observation that thrombosis on MHV often starts on the sewing ring. Bioprosthetic valves also have Dacron sewing rings and our finding that Dacron SRS are more thrombogenic than Teflon SRS raises the possibility that patients with newly implanted bioprosthetic valves would benefit from a 3-month course of warfarin to reduce the risk of thrombosis while the sewing ring undergoes endothelialization; a concept consistent with the results of large observational studies. The finding that dabigatran is less effective than warfarin at suppressing Dacron SRS-induced thrombin generation supports the recommendation that dabigatran be avoided in patients with newly implanted bioprosthetic valves as well as in those with MHV. Finally, our observation that warfarin produces maximum suppression of leaflet- or SRS-induced thrombin generation at an INR over 1.5 raises the question as to whether the target INR needs to be higher than 2 to 3 for patients with MHV in the mitral position or for those with risk factors for thromboembolism. A target INR of 2 to 3 is used for atrial fibrillation patients regardless of their risk of stroke, and our findings raise the possibility that the same approach could be used for patients with MHV. Clinical trials are needed to explore this possibility.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116xEMdg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used, with studies showing a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), but overall data for GIB risk remains debatable. The objective was to assess non-fatal and fatal GIB risk in patients on DOACs compared with warfarin from randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Methods

RCTs comparing warfarin and DOACs for various indications (atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism, insertion of mechanical heart valves) were included. The primary endpoint was any GIB event. Other clinical events, such as fatal GIB, and effects of age (≤ 60 years or older), time in therapeutic range for warfarin, and choice of individual DOACs on GIB risk, were also assessed.

Results

14 RCTs were included, comprising 87,407 participants (DOACs n = 46,223, warfarin control n = 41,184). The risk of GIB with DOACs was similar to that of warfarin (relative risk [RR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–1.27). Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban (RR 1.23, 95%CI 1.03–1.48) and dabigatran (RR 1.38, 95%CI 1.12–1.71) had a higher risk of any GIB, whereas fatal GIB risk was lower in the DOACs group (RR 0.36, 95%CI 0.15–0.82). The risk of DOAC-related fatal GIB was lower in patients aged ≤ 60 years and in those with poor coagulation control (RR 0.39, 95%CI 0.15–0.98).

Conclusions

DOACs compared with warfarin have a lower risk of fatal GIB, especially in those aged < 60 years and those with poor coagulation control. However, the risk of GIB was comparable with warfarin and DOACs, except for rivaroxaban and dabigatran.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115e7VGM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A meta‐analysis comprising the overall patient population of 4 large clinical trials showed that NOACs, compared with warfarin, further decreased the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, death, and intracranial hemorrhage in nonvalvular AF patients. 19 Although experts may well understand that the term nonvalvular actually denotes that these trial patients do not have significant mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart valves, others may be hesitant to apply NOACs to AF patients with other types of VHD. The current study makes it clear that NOACs have similar benefits in terms of reducing stroke or systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients both with and without VHD.

No dedicated clinical trial to date has compared NOACs with warfarin in AF patients with moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis, and so warfarin use in these patients is suggested. 4 The use of a NOAC, dabigatran, in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications compared with warfarin and thus is not justified for these patients. 20

This study has limitations. First, a meta‐analysis is a retrospective approach, and subgroup analysis in patients with and without VHD was not prespecified in the original clinical trials. Second, AF patients with and without VHD had different baseline characteristics, as did patients enrolled in the 4 trials. Substantial bias might remain despite statistical adjustment. Third, the RE‐LY and ENGAGE AF trials used both higher and lower dose NOACs as active treatment agents, and their comparisons with warfarin were reported separately. Because this was a study‐level meta‐analysis, we were unable to combine groups of NOAC in a trial to create a single pairwise comparison. Consequently, only data from the higher dose NOACs versus warfarin were used in this meta‐analysis.

In conclusion, this meta‐analysis showed that AF patients with native VHD had a higher risk of all‐cause mortality and major bleeding. NOACs, compared with warfarin, reduced stroke or systemic embolism as well as intracranial hemorrhage in AF patients with or without VHD. Although evidence supported increased extracranial bleeding risk among VHD patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin, there was no increase in mortality risk. Our results further establish that for AF patients with native VHD, NOACs are an attractive alternative to warfarin for stroke preventive therapy.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in valvular heart disease (VHD) — For patients with AF and native valve heart disease (except rheumatic mitral stenosis [MS]) or who received a bioprosthetic valve > 3 months ago, a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is an effective alternative to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation and should be administered on the basis of the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 A). For patients with AF and rheumatic MS, long-term VKA oral anticoagulation is recommended (1 C-EO). For patients with new-onset AF ≤ 3 months after surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, anticoagulation with a VKA is reasonable (2a B-NR). In patients with mechanical heart valves with or without AF who require long-term anticoagulation with VKA to prevent valve thrombosis, NOACs are not recommended (3: Harm B-R).

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart lesions [^114bBZpM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanical Versus Bioprosthetic Heart Valves

Patients with mechanical heart valves are at an increased risk of stroke compared with patients without, and they require continuous anticoagulation. 34 The annual risk of thromboembolic events in patients with a mechanical heart valve is 1% to 2% versus 0.7% with a bioprosthetic valve, even with antithrombotic therapy. 28 Mechanical valves in the mitral position are generally more thrombogenic than those in the aortic position. 27

According to the ACC/AHA/HRS and 2010 ESC guidelines for the management of AF, conventional management is recommended in the setting of VHD. In patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, VKA therapy is indicated for the prevention of SSE, and anticoagulation should be based on the type and position of the prosthesis, maintaining an international normalized ratio of at least 2.5 for valves in the mitral position and at least 2.0 for aortic valves. 4, 14 The ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines specify that dabigatran should not be used in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve. In the 2014 ACC/AHA 28 guidelines for the management of patients with VHD, DOAC use is not recommended in patients with mechanical valve prostheses.

Bioprosthetic valves are considered to be less thrombogenic than mechanical heart valves. Additionally, bovine pericardial valves appear to be less susceptible than porcine valves to valve thrombosis. 35 It has been historically accepted that long‐term anticoagulation is unnecessary in patients with bioprosthetic valves and no additional risk factors, 36 and the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend only aspirin for these patients. However, because of an increased risk of thromboembolism during the first 3 months after implantation of a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is often used, especially when the valve is in the mitral position. 33 To date, there is little evidence of the use of DOACs in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves. However, a recent study in a series of 105 patients showed that catheter ablation of AF with uninterrupted DOAC use in patients with biological heart valves is feasible and safe. 37

### Safety and efficacy of novel oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease [^1158skAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the clinical trials of antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF have excluded patients with mechanical valves, mitral stenosis, and rheumatic heart disease. Valvular heart disease (VHD) coexists in > 50% of patients with AF and is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events, independent of the underlying cardiac rhythm. 6 Among patients with mitral valve stenosis or prosthetics valves, AF portends high thromboembolic risk and vitamin K antagonists are indicated for stroke and systemic embolism prevention. 7 Some patients with VHD have been included in the NOAC trials. In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, 26% of patients had a history of moderate or severe VHD (most of them with mitral regurgitation) or previous valve surgery. 8 Although these patients had higher rates of stroke and systemic embolism than those without, there was no evidence of differential effects of apixaban compared with warfarin on stroke, major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality between patients with and without VHD. In a post hoc analysis of the ROCKET‐AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), 9 14.1% had significant VHD and 5.3% had prior valvular procedures. Among patients with VHD, the rates of systemic thromboembolism and all‐cause mortality were similar, but major bleeding risk was significantly higher with rivaroxaban versus warfarin. Furthermore, a recent analysis of the RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial demonstrated that 21.8% of patients with AF had VHD (excluding prosthetic valves and significant mitral stenosis) and that the presence of VHD did not affect the comparison between dabigatran and warfarin. 10

We hypothesized that NOACs are prescribed to patients with VHD, despite lack of robust data. Therefore, we examined a large community‐based sample of patients with AF and VHD (excluding prosthetic valves) with a goal to do the following: (1) compare all‐cause mortality, stroke, and major bleeding risk among patients taking warfarin, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban; and (2) evaluate differences in outcomes between patients with AF with and without VHD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA PM-1 — anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter — states that direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are recommended over warfarin in DOAC-eligible AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Among patients treated with warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be determined at least weekly during initiation and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). In AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). For AF with mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). Selection of anticoagulant therapy should be based on thromboembolism risk irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). In AF, anticoagulant therapy should be individualized using shared decision-making after discussion of absolute and relative risks of stroke and bleeding and the patient's values and preferences (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). For atrial flutter, anticoagulant therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for AF (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). Reevaluation of the need for and choice of anticoagulant therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risks (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C).

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^111p71F1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study ROCKET AF was published by Patel MR and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ROCKET AF study, the trial question was: is rivaroxaban noninferior to warfarin in patients with NVAF who are at an increased risk for stroke? In the ROCKET AF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ROCKET AF study, the population was: 14264 patients (5663 female, 8601 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with NVAF who are at increased risk for stroke. The key exclusion criteria were prosthetic heart valve, planned cardioversion, active endocarditis, active internal bleeding or increased risk of bleeding, platelet count < 90,000/uL, or sustained uncontrolled hypertension. In the ROCKET AF study, the interventions were: n = 7131 rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of 20 mg) n = 7133 warfarin (adjusted-dose to target INR 2.0–3.0). In the ROCKET AF study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (1.7% / y vs. 2.2% / y; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96). In the ROCKET AF study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.9% / y vs. 1.1% / y; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06) No significant difference in the incidence of death (1.9% / y vs. 2.2% / y; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.02). In the ROCKET AF study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding and major bleeding. significant difference in ICH (0.8% vs. 1.2%) and fatal bleeding (0.4% vs. 0.8%). In the ROCKET AF study, the conclusion was: in patients with NVAF who are at increased risk for stroke, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin with respect to the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, after surgical mechanical prosthesis implantation, ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend to consider aiming at an INR target of 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) rather than lower targets in patients with mechanical mitral valves.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112kjTwM]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — management of excessive anticoagulation and serious bleeding in prosthetic valve patients: For patients with mechanical valves and uncontrollable bleeding who require immediate reversal of anticoagulation, administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex (or its activated form) is reasonable. For patients with mechanical valves and uncontrollable bleeding who have received 4-factor prothrombin concentrate complex, adjunctive use of intravenous vitamin K is reasonable if resumption of VKA therapy is not anticipated for 7 days. For patients with bioprosthetic valves or annuloplasty rings who are receiving a direct oral anticoagulant and who require immediate reversal of anticoagulation because of uncontrollable bleeding, treatment with idarucizumab (for dabigatran) or andexanet alfa (for anti-Xa agents) is reasonable. For patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve and supratherapeutic INR (> 5.0) who are not actively bleeding, the benefit of individualized treatment with oral vitamin K in addition to temporary withdrawal of the VKA, is uncertain.

### The optimal intensity of vitamin K antagonists in patients with mechanical heart valves: a meta-analysis [^1168uAaR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare two different intensities of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) among patients with mechanical heart valves using meta-analytic techniques.

Background

Patients with mechanical heart valves are at increased risk for valve thrombosis and systemic embolism, which can be reduced by VKA. The range of optimal intensity of VKA is still a matter of debate.

Methods

A computerized search in the PubMed database was made for relevant articles. A meta-analysis was performed of all eligible studies with data on the incidences of thromboembolic and bleeding complications in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses during different intensities of VKA therapy. The studies were classified into low-intensity VKA therapy (mean target international normalized ratio [INR] of 3.0 or lower) or high-intensity VKA therapy (mean target INR above 3.0).

Results

Thirty-five eligible studies were identified, including in total 23,145 patients, who were studied for 108,792 patient-years. For patients with an aortic valve, high intensity resulted in a lower incidence of thromboembolic events (risk ratio [RR] = 0.73, p < 0.0001); however, the incidence of bleeding was increased (RR = 1.23, p < 0.0001). In the mitral valve group, the incidence rate for thromboembolism was lower in the high-intensity group (RR = 0.74, p < 0.0001), without a significantly increased bleeding incidence (RR = 1.08, p = 0.0524). The total number of thromboembolic and bleeding events was decreased in the high-intensity group compared with low-intensity VKA therapy for both aortic and mitral valve prostheses (RR = 0.94 [p = 0.0067] and 0.84 [p < 0.0001]), respectively.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis shows that both aortic and mitral valves will benefit from a treatment strategy with a target INR higher than 3.0.

Exclusion Criteria Related to VHD to Identify Patients With NVAF in DOAC Versus Warfarin Pivotal Trials

The ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00412984) 20 trial excluded patients with moderate or severe mitral stenosis and conditions other than AF that required anticoagulation (ie, mechanical prosthetic heart valve). However, patients with VHD including those with aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, valve repair, and bioprosthetic valves were eligible for enrollment in the trial. In the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Strokes; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00496769) 21 trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus aspirin in NVAF patients who were unsuitable for VKA therapy, the exclusion criteria were VHD requiring surgery and any other conditions requiring anticoagulation. The AVERROES trial was prematurely terminated after the first planned interim analysis revealed a treatment benefit in favor of apixaban for the prevention of SSE that exceeded 4 SDs (1.6% per year versus 3.7% per year, hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.32–0.62, P < 0.001, z = 4.76). In ROCKET‐AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonist for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00403767), 22 patients with AF and concomitant mitral stenosis or prosthetic heart valves were excluded, whereas those with annuloplasty with or without prosthetic ring, commissurotomy, and/or valvuloplasty were permitted. Patients with hemodynamically significant VHD who did not meet the above exclusion criteria were included. Patients with NVAF who were at moderate‐to‐high risk of stroke (history of SSE or TIA, or ≥ 2 additional risk factors) were included. 4 In RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulation Therapy; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00262600), 23 patients with a history of heart valve disorder (ie, prosthetic valve or hemodynamically relevant VHD) were excluded. Patients with VHD were admitted to the RE‐LY trial if the VHD was unlikely to require an intervention before study completion. In the ENGAGE‐AF TIMI‐48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00781391) 12 trial, patients with moderate‐to‐severe mitral stenosis, unresected atrial myxoma, or a mechanical heart valve were excluded. Patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and/or valve repair were included.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116UNZpy]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Younger patients (aortic valve replacement [AVR]) — Patients ≤ 50 years of age at the time of AVR incur a higher and earlier risk of bioprosthetic valve deterioration. Overall, the predicted 15-year risk of needing reoperation because of structural deterioration is 22% for patients 50 years of age, 30% for patients 40 years of age, and 50% for patients 20 years of age. Anticoagulation with a VKA can be accomplished with acceptable risk in most patients < 50 years of age, particularly in compliant patients with appropriate monitoring of INR levels, and thus the balance between valve durability and risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events favors the choice of a mechanical valve in patients < 50 years of age, unless anticoagulation is not desired, cannot be monitored, or is contraindicated.

### The association of direct thrombin inhibitor anticoagulants with cardiac thromboses [^111KrDUb]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Direct thrombin inhibitor (anti-factor IIa) anticoagulants, now established for treatment and prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and VTE, have been repeatedly associated with a significantly increased frequency of thrombosis on abnormal cardiac endothelium when compared head-to-head with indirectly acting therapeutic anticoagulants in studies of sufficient patient number and duration. Although there is uncertainty as to the mechanism, the weight of evidence as a class effect warrants prescribing effective anticoagulants other than direct thrombin inhibitors.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — pregnancy risk overview and need for continuous anticoagulation: Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves are at increased risk of serious maternal complications, including valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and death, and for women with mechanical heart valves the maternal mortality rate remains > 1%, with more than one-third having a serious maternal or fetal complication during pregnancy. All women with mechanical heart valves require uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation throughout pregnancy. Warfarin is the most effective anticoagulant at preventing thrombotic complications, but it crosses the placenta and can cause miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, warfarin embryopathy, or fetal intracranial hemorrhage.

### Apixaban or warfarin in patients with an on-X mechanical aortic valve [^117GVGAw]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists are the only oral anticoagulants approved to prevent valve thrombosis and valve-related thromboembolism in patients with mechanical heart valves. Whether patients with an On-X mechanical aortic valve can be safely anticoagulated with apixaban is unknown. METHODS: Patients with an On-X aortic valve implanted at least 3 months before enrollment were randomly assigned to receive apixaban 5mg twice daily or warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0). The primary efficacy end point was the composite of valve thrombosis or valve-related thromboembolism with coprimary analyses comparing apixaban with warfarin for noninferiority and comparing the apixaban event rate with an objective performance criterion (OPC). RESULTS: The trial was stopped after 863 participants were enrolled owing to an excess of thromboembolic events in the apixaban group. Most (94%) participants took aspirin. A total of 26 primary end-point events occurred, 20 (in 16 participants) in the apixaban group (4.2%/patient-year; 95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 6.0) and 6 (in 6 participants) in the warfarin group (1.3%/patient-year; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.3). The difference in primary end-point rates between the apixaban and warfarin groups was 2.9 (95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0); noninferiority and OPC success criteria were not met. Major bleeding rates were 3.6%/patient-year with apixaban and 4.5%/patient-year with warfarin. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban did not demonstrate noninferiority to warfarin and is less effective than warfarin for the prevention of valve thrombosis or thromboembolism in patients with an On-X mechanical aortic valve.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^11629V9n]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Bridging anticoagulation during VKA interruption — mechanical prosthetic heart valve (PICO 5): In patients receiving VKA therapy for a mechanical heart valve who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest against heparin bridging (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by PERIOP-2 showing no significant difference between no bridging and bridging for major thromboembolism (0% vs 0.67%; p = 0.67) and major bleeding (1.96% vs 0.67%; p = 0.62), an observational study associating perioperative bridging with increased major bleeding (3.6% vs 1.2%; p = 0.0007), and a meta-analysis totaling 12,278 patients (24% had a mechanical heart valve) finding no significant difference in ATE (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.42–1.54) but increased major bleeding with bridging (OR = 3.60; 95% CI: 1.52–8.50); in non-randomized studies where all patients with a mechanical heart valve received perioperative therapeutic-dose heparin bridging, pooled incidences of ATE and major bleeding were 0.9% (95% CI: 0.2–1.5) and 2.8% (0.8–4.8), respectively, while for selected high-risk patients — such as those with an older-generation mechanical heart valve, a mechanical mitral valve with one or more risk factors for stroke, a recent (< 3 months) thromboembolic event, or other high-risk features (eg, prior perioperative stroke) — pre- and post-operative heparin bridging is suggested.

### Rivaroxaban and thromboembolic events in patients with heart failure, coronary disease, and sinus rhythm… [^113SJk9T]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

The composite of thromboembolic events includes myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. The cumulative percentage of patients with a thromboembolic event excluding sudden/unwitnessed deaths was 4%, 7%, and 9% after 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, for those patients assigned to rivaroxaban, and 5%, 8%, and 11%, respectively, for those assigned to placebo. HR indicates hazard ratio. In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 5022 patients, although thromboembolic events were not the major driver of the primary efficacy outcome, they occurred frequently. Rivaroxaban was associated with reduced risk of thromboembolic events compared with placebo from 15. 5% to
13. 1% with inclusion of sudden/unwitnessed deaths as part of the outcome and from 7. 6% to
6. 1% when sudden/unwitnessed deaths where not considered as part of the thromboembolic composite outcome.

Regardless, there is evidence that patients with HF and CAD are at increased risk for atherothrombotic events, 10–16 and it is possible that an effect of rivaroxaban on thromboembolic events in the COMMANDER HF trial5 might have been masked by pump failure deaths that drove the primary outcome. Thus, for this post hoc analysis, we defined an outcome that was more specific to thromboembolic events. Although there was no difference in efficacy between rivaroxaban and placebo in COMMANDER HF for the primary composite end point, HRs for the components varied, with numerical advantages observed for rivaroxaban compared with placebo for MI and stroke, both of which involve a thromboembolic mechanism. Consequently, this post hoc analysis was performed to assess the risk of thromboembolic events in COMMANDER HF and to determine whether the risk of these events might be reduced by low-dose rivaroxaban therapy.

Taken together with our exploration of a thromboembolic outcome, it is possible that the difference observed in MACE between COMMANDER HF and these 2 studies is because of the inclusion of patients with recent worsening of chronic HF in COMMANDER HF and that more CV deaths in COMMANDER HF were associated with pump failure causes that were not amenable to antithrombotic therapy.

Interventions Experimental: Rivaroxaban 20mg p. o., once daily, for six months Historical control: Phenprocoumon p. o., once daily Outcomes Primary outcome: Composite outcome of prosthetic thrombus requiring reoperation/intervention, major bleeding, visceral ischemia, stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or death from any cause 180 days after intervention. Secondary outcomes: Each component of the composite outcome plus serious adverse events. Prosthetic thrombus requiring reoperation/intervention plus non-clinically relevant thrombi will be used as an additional safety outcome. Molecular markers suitable for monitoring the effectiveness of rivaroxaban.

Background Although the overall incidence of complications associated with prosthetic cardiac valve implantation has decreased considerably since its introduction more than 3 decades ago, valvular thrombosis and systemic thromboembolism remain a major concern for cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists, and other practicing clinicians because of the well-known potential to cause devastating events including ischemic stroke and death. Does the RE-ALIGN trial preclude the investigation of rivaroxaban and other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in patients with mechanical heart valves. Not necessarily. Coagulation develops in at least two subsequent waves of thrombin generation and fibrin deposition, with factor Xa playing a pivotal role for its amplification.

In fact, since activation of 1 molecule of factor X results in the generation of 1000 molecules of thrombin, on a molar basis factor Xa is more thrombogenic than thrombin and several lines of research show that it requires less heparin to inhibit thrombosis prior thrombin formation than afterwards. Therefore, there is a sound rationale for hypothesizing that direct factor Xa inhibitors may be more efficient than dabigatran in preventing thromboembolic events among patients with mechanical heart valves. Objective Primary Objective: CATHAR is a pilot study to determine if rivaroxaban is feasible and safe for prevention of major complications in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replacement.

1 It is also labeled for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total knee or hip replacement surgery. Targeting only factor Xa in the coagulation cascade, rivaroxaban has a mechanism of action different from that of warfarin, which inhibits all vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. Therefore, it does not require international normalized ratio monitoring. SAFETY As with all anticoagulants, rivaroxaban increases the risk of major bleeding events. Rates do not differ significantly between patients who take rivaroxaban and those who take warfarin for all bleeding events or for major bleeding. 2 with an annual stroke risk of 6 to 18 percent based on a CHADS 2 score of 2 to 6.

5 Rivaroxaban was as effective as warfarin at preventing stroke and systemic embolism, and reduced annual stroke rates to
2. 1 percent, compared with 2. 4 percent for warfarin. Rivaroxaban has also proved effective for DVT prophylaxis following total knee or hip arthroplasty. The industry-supported RECORD trials compared rivaroxaban and enoxaparin, with rivaroxaban administered at 10 mg once daily, and with enoxaparin administered at the European dosing regimen of 40 mg once daily. 3, 4 The trials reported a lower one-month postoperative symptomatic thromboembolism rate with rivaroxaban than with enoxaparin for patients who had knee surgery, 3 and similar rates for patients who had hip surgery.

4 Rivaroxaban has not been studied for any other types of DVT prophylaxis.
