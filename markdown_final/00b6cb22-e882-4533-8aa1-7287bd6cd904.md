## Question

which is the best first daily asthma medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is best to start as a daily controller for asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal foundation of therapy and whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the starting point. Then, I should differentiate by age groups, since recommendations for adolescents/adults versus school-aged children can diverge. Next, I will layer in severity to decide between daily ICS, as-needed ICS-formoterol, or maintenance-and-reliever therapy (SMART/MART). After that, I need to review alternatives if ICS are not feasible, and finally, I should address implementation issues like inhaler technique, adherence, and step-down planning before synthesizing a clear bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the foundation of care, because if I get this wrong, everything else will be off. All contemporary guidelines converge on ICS as the cornerstone initial controller for persistent asthma due to clear reductions in symptoms and exacerbations over other monotherapies, and that aligns with both U.S. and international approaches, so the first daily medication class is ICS unless there is a compelling reason otherwise [^113azxef] [^111QJSJM] [^112WXZFZ].

> Now, I should verify the preferred approach for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. For this group, the strong modern signal is to use an ICS-formoterol single inhaler for both maintenance and relief (SMART/MART), which reduces severe exacerbations more than higher-dose ICS alone or fixed ICS-LABA with separate SABA, and the NHLBI 2020 update issued a strong recommendation with high certainty for ages ≥ 12 years, which GINA echoes as a preferred approach following exacerbations and in ongoing care, with ERS guidance supporting as-needed ICS-formoterol in mild disease as well [^116BCAjj] [^111NPNLz] [^111kNbTU] [^114GUSFD].

> Wait, let me verify a potential inconsistency before I lock that in. Some primary care summaries still state SABA as the preferred reliever, which could mislead us into underusing ICS at symptom onset; however, the balance of current specialty guidance favors ICS-formoterol as reliever for many adolescents and adults to ensure anti-inflammatory therapy accompanies bronchodilation, while recognizing that daily low-dose ICS with SABA as-needed remains acceptable if patient preference, cost, or device constraints preclude SMART/MART, so I should present both with context rather than overgeneralize [^113azxef] [^114GUSFD] [^111kNbTU].

> Next, I will examine children aged 5 to 11 years, since the approach differs and licensing matters. The clearest initial recommendation is twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA for newly diagnosed persistent asthma, with MART considered only when the child can manage the regimen and with acknowledgment that MART in this age group may be off-label depending on jurisdiction and device availability, while NHLBI 2020 notes moderate certainty supporting SMART for 4–11 years but implementation varies [^116cTeuf] [^116BCAjj].

> For children under 5 years, I need to ensure we do not overcomplicate delivery. Low-dose ICS via spacer or nebulizer is generally the recommended initial controller, individualized to symptom pattern and device technique, and I should confirm correct diagnosis and technique before escalating therapy given developmental limitations in this cohort [^112WXZFZ].

> Hold on, I should integrate severity, because "best" depends on baseline control. In adolescents/adults with mild persistent asthma, either daily low-dose ICS with SABA as-needed or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol can be used, with ERS and AAFP summarizing the latter's advantage for exacerbation prevention; for moderate-to-severe disease, SMART/MART with ICS-formoterol is preferred over simply increasing ICS dose or using fixed ICS-LABA with SABA reliever, due to stronger exacerbation reduction and regimen simplicity; in children 5–11, step up from low-dose ICS to moderate dose if uncontrolled, and consider pediatric low-dose MART when feasible and safe within local licensing constraints [^112h6GxW] [^114GUSFD] [^116BCAjj] [^111NPNLz] [^111kNbTU] [^116cTeuf].

> I will now review alternatives if ICS are not tolerated or adherence is problematic. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are a reasonable alternative for mild persistent asthma or an add-on when MART is not feasible, albeit generally less effective than ICS; long-acting muscarinic antagonists are considered add-on to ICS-LABA for ages ≥ 12 years when control remains suboptimal; critically, SABA should function as reliever only and not as monotherapy for persistent asthma, and in patients with features of asthma plus COPD, ICS must be included to mitigate risk [^111QJSJM] [^116cTeuf] [^116xQdZx] [^1177Woec] [^111pT1nV] [^115fx3bF].

> But wait, what if control is still poor despite the "right" medicine; I need to ensure we don't miss basics. Across all ages, I should first confirm inhaler technique, adherence, and modifiable risk factors at every visit, then apply shared decision-making to match regimen complexity to patient capability, and use a stepwise approach with reassessment every 3–6 months, including planned step-down after at least three months of good control to minimize steroid exposure while maintaining safety, with clear action plans and follow-up [^112WXZFZ] [^1177LqWS] [^111kNbTU] [^11416gE4] [^114Fb7SW] [^11381pRD].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line for adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older so the recommendation is actionable. The best first daily asthma medication is low-dose ICS-formoterol used as both maintenance and reliever (SMART/MART), given its superior reduction in severe exacerbations and regimen simplicity; if SMART/MART is not acceptable or available, daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA remains a guideline-supported alternative, and as-needed ICS-formoterol can be considered in mild disease to lower exacerbation risk [^116BCAjj] [^111NPNLz] [^111kNbTU] [^114GUSFD] [^113AGVuf].

> Now for children aged 5 to 11 years, I should be precise. The best first daily asthma medication is twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS with SABA as-needed, with escalation to moderate-dose ICS if not controlled; pediatric low-dose MART may be considered for select children who can manage the regimen, recognizing off-label status in some regions and the need for careful education and monitoring [^116cTeuf] [^116BCAjj].

> Finally, I need to ensure the universal principle is explicit and safe. Regardless of age, an ICS-containing regimen is essential for persistent asthma, SABA-only approaches should be avoided as controller therapy, and selection between daily ICS plus SABA versus ICS-formoterol strategies should be individualized based on age, severity, device availability, inhaler technique, and shared preferences after reviewing risks and benefits [^111QJSJM] [^115fx3bF] [^1177LqWS].

The best first daily asthma medication is a **low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)** [^111QJSJM] for most patients with persistent asthma, as it is the cornerstone of controller therapy [^1177LqWS] and effectively reduces symptoms and exacerbations [^113azxef]. For adults and adolescents with mild asthma, **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** [^114GUSFD] is an alternative that reduces severe exacerbations and SABA overuse [^113AGVuf]. In children aged 5–11 years, start with **daily low-dose ICS** [^116cTeuf] plus as-needed SABA [^1162D93p]. ICS-LABA combinations are reserved for patients not controlled on ICS alone [^113azxef], and leukotriene receptor antagonists are alternatives when ICS is not tolerated or adherence is a concern [^111QJSJM].

---

## Recommended first daily asthma medication

### Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

- **First-line therapy**: ICS are the preferred initial controller medication [^111QJSJM] for persistent asthma in adults and children [^113azxef], providing superior control compared to other single long-term control medications [^112n5yyg].

- **Mechanism**: ICS reduce airway inflammation, improve lung function, and decrease exacerbations.

- **Dosing**: Start with low-dose ICS and titrate based on control and exacerbation risk [^116BCAjj].

---

### ICS-formoterol combination therapy

For adults and adolescents with mild asthma, **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** [^114GUSFD] is recommended because it reduces severe exacerbations [^113AGVuf] and SABA overuse. For moderate-to-severe asthma, **SMART** (single maintenance and reliever therapy) [^111NPNLz] with ICS-formoterol is preferred, as it reduces exacerbations and simplifies regimens [^111a3w1W] [^113azxef].

---

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA)

LTRAs (e.g. montelukast) are **second-line options** [^111QJSJM] for mild persistent asthma [^113azxef], particularly when ICS are not tolerated or adherence is an issue.

---

## Age-specific recommendations

| **Age group** | **Recommended first daily medication** | **Alternative options** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years) | - Low-dose ICS [^113azxef] <br/> - As-needed ICS-formoterol [^114GUSFD] | - LTRA [^111QJSJM] <br/> - ICS-LABA (if uncontrolled on ICS alone) [^116BCAjj] |
| Children (5–11 years) | - Daily low-dose ICS [^116cTeuf] <br/> - As-needed SABA [^1162D93p] | - LTRA [^116cTeuf] <br/> - ICS-LABA (if uncontrolled on ICS alone) [^116cTeuf] |
| Children (< 5 years) | - Daily low-dose ICS [^1162D93p] <br/> - As-needed SABA [^1162D93p] | - LTRA (if ICS not tolerated) [^1162D93p] |

---

## Factors influencing medication choice

- **Severity and control**: Tailor therapy to symptom frequency, exacerbation risk, and lung function [^1177LqWS].

- **Adherence**: Consider patient preferences, inhaler technique, and adherence barriers [^1172m4Pe].

- **Comorbidities**: Account for allergic rhinitis, obesity, and other conditions affecting control [^112WXZFZ].

- **Patient preferences**: Engage in shared decision-making to improve adherence and outcomes [^1177LqWS].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Regular follow-up**: Assess control, adherence, and inhaler technique at each visit [^112WXZFZ].

- **Stepwise approach**: Adjust therapy up or down based on control and exacerbation risk [^1162D93p].

- **Action plan**: Provide a written asthma action plan for self-management [^111kNbTU].

---

## Conclusion

The preferred first-line daily controller is a **low-dose ICS**, with as-needed ICS-formoterol as an alternative for mild asthma. Therapy should be individualized based on severity, adherence, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring and adjustment to maintain control and minimize exacerbations [^1177LqWS].

### Chronic asthma treatment: Common questions and answers [^113azxef]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, and 62% of adults with asthma do not have adequately controlled symptoms. Asthma severity and level of control should be assessed at diagnosis and evaluated at subsequent visits using validated tools such as the Asthma Control Test or the asthma APGAR tools (activities, persistent, triggers, asthma medications, response to therapy). Short-acting beta-2 agonists are preferred asthma reliever medications.

Controller medications consist of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-2 agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Treatment typically begins with inhaled corticosteroids, and additional medications or dosage increases should be added in a stepwise fashion according to guideline-directed therapy recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program or the Global Initiative for Asthma when symptoms are inadequately controlled.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy combines an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-2 agonist for controller and reliever treatments. This therapy is preferred for adults and adolescents due to its effectiveness in reducing severe exacerbations. Subcutaneous immunotherapy may be considered for those five years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma; however, sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite appropriate treatment should be reassessed and considered for specialty referral. Biologic agents may be considered for patients with severe allergic and uncontrolled asthma.

- **Pharmacological management in children aged 5 to 11**: For guidance on doses of inhaled corticosteroids, refer to the full guideline.

- **Initial management in children aged 5 to 11**: Offer a twice-daily pediatric low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) as needed, as initial treatment for children aged 5 to 11 years with newly diagnosed asthma.

- **Medicine combination and sequencing in children aged 5 to 11**:
	- **MART pathway**: Consider pediatric low-dose MART for children with asthma that is not controlled on pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, provided they are assessed to have the ability to manage a MART regimen. In November 2024, no asthma inhalers were licensed for MART in children under 12, so this use would be off-label. The evidence supporting the use of MART in children aged 5 to 11 is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler.

	- **Consider increasing to pediatric moderate-dose MART** if asthma is not controlled on pediatric low-dose MART.

	- **Conventional pathway**: Consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to twice daily pediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed when a child is assessed as unable to manage the MART regimen. Provide the LTRA for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then discontinue it if it is ineffective.

### Medical therapy for asthma: Updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^111QJSJM]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication; studies have demonstrated that when inhaled corticosteroids are used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication. Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient, and such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids.

For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older, the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred.

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for the rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates the need for a reevaluation of the control strategy.

### Why and how to step down chronic asthma drugs [^11416gE4]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic airways disease. The goal of asthma management is to control symptoms while minimizing the side effects of treatment. Following a period of stable asthma, clinicians should consider stepping down treatment as recommended by guidelines. Step-down has been studied for several types of asthma drug regimens, and certain approaches may have lower risk than others.

Systematic reviews of multiple trials support the following specific step-down approaches: optimizing inhaled corticosteroid dosing when stepping down oral corticosteroid, reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose, lowering inhaled corticosteroid-long acting bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) dose while adding ICS-LABA on-demand, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) while lowering inhaled corticosteroid dose, and using allergen immunotherapy when reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose.

- **Increased risk of exacerbation**: Systematic reviews of multiple trials support an increased risk of asthma exacerbation for patients who completely stop taking inhaled corticosteroid or long acting bronchodilator.

- **Strategies to implement step-down in practice**: These include the use of risk prediction as well as tools to support shared decision making and communication about risk between clinicians and patients.

The general principles of asthma management emphasize achieving good symptom control, relieving symptoms when they occur, and minimizing the risk of exacerbations, asthma-related death, persistent airflow limitation, and side effects of treatment. It is important to identify the patient's own treatment goals, as they may differ. Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the patient (or parent/caregiver) and healthcare providers, involving shared decision-making and good communication.

Asthma management should be personalized and adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment adjustment, and review.

- **Assessment**: Assess not only symptom control and lung function but also the individual's modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (also called "treatable traits") and patient/parent goals and preferences. Check adherence and inhaler technique frequently. Poor symptom control is associated with a much higher risk of exacerbations, but patients with apparently mild asthma or with good symptom control can still have severe or life-threatening exacerbations.

- **Treatment adjustment**: Treatment adjustment includes not only changes in the asthma medication dose or type but also multidisciplinary management of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities and nonpharmacological strategies such as smoking cessation and avoidance of indoor/outdoor air pollution.

### The asthma control questionnaire as a clinical trial endpoint: past experience and recommendations for future use [^1167T7ed]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease according to guidelines issued by bodies such as the Global Initiative for Asthma. Effective control depends on the evaluation of symptoms, initiation of appropriate treatment, and minimization of the progressive adverse effects of the disease and its therapies. Although individual outcome measures have been shown to correlate with asthma control, composite endpoints are preferred to enable more accurate and robust monitoring of the health of the individual patient.

A number of validated instruments are utilized to capture these component endpoints; however, there is no consensus on the optimal instrument for use in clinical trials. The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) has been shown to be a valid, reliable instrument that allows accurate and reproducible assessment of asthma control, which compares favorably with other commonly used instruments. This analysis provides a summary of the use of ACQ in phase II, III, and IV asthma trials. Comparisons between the ACQ and other instruments are also presented. Our analysis suggests that the ACQ is a valid and robust measure for use as a primary or secondary endpoint in future clinical trials.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for asthma, more specifically with respect to clinical follow-up, BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend asking specific questions about medication use and assessing prescribing and any other data available to evaluate adherence. It is crucial to explore attitudes towards medication and identify practical barriers to adherence in a nonjudgmental manner.

### Expert panel report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma-summary report 2007 [^1162D93p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). High credibility.

The highlights of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma-Full Report 2007 are presented in this EPR-3 summary report. The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of asthma control. Asthma control is the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therapeutic intervention and the goals of therapy are met. Because asthma is highly variable, the level of control must be monitored on a periodic basis to determine whether therapy should be maintained or adjusted (stepped up if necessary, stepped down if possible).

On the other hand, asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of the disease process, most easily and directly measured in a patient not receiving long-term control therapy. For managing asthma, the recommendation is to assess severity to initiate therapy and assess control to adjust therapy.

Recommendations for managing asthma include an expanded section on childhood asthma with the addition of an age group 5 to 11 years old, as earlier guidelines combined this group with adults. The guidelines provide new recommendations on patient education in settings beyond the physician's office and new advice for controlling environmental factors that can cause asthma symptoms.

- **Concepts of impairment**: Frequency and intensity of symptoms, low lung function, and limitations of daily activities.

- **Future risk assessment**: Likelihood of exacerbations, progressive loss of lung function, or adverse side effects from medications.

These concepts support a new approach to assessing and managing asthma.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

- **Main results**: This review update added three new studies, including 419 participants, to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants.

- **Question 6.1**: What is the efficacy and safety of SCIT?

The Expert Panel conditionally recommends, for individuals aged 5 years and older with mild to moderate allergic asthma, the use of SCIT as an adjunct treatment to standard pharmacotherapy. This recommendation applies to those individuals whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build-up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy.

- **Recommendation 17**: Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence.

- **Implementation guidance**.

What is the comparative effectiveness of ICS with LABA used as both controller and quick-relief therapy compared to ICS with or without LABA used as controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

- **Recommendation 12**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared to either a higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy or the same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and SABA for quick-relief therapy. This is a strong recommendation with high certainty of evidence for ages 12 years and above, and moderate certainty of evidence for ages 4 to 11 years.

- **Implementation guidance**:
	- **Clinician's summary**: In individuals aged 4 years and older, the preferred Step 3 (low-dose ICS) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS) therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol both daily and as needed. In the literature, inhaled ICS-formoterol is referred to as "single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)". This form of therapy has only been used with formoterol as the LABA. Formoterol has a rapid onset and a maximum total daily dose that allows it to be used more than twice daily. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 8 puffs (36 μg) for ages 4 to 11 years and 12 puffs (54 μg) for ages 12 years and above. SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an ICS (primarily budesonide in the reviewed studies, but one study used beclomethasone).

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- **Patient evaluation**: Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations.
- **Controller therapy**: Prescribe or continue ICS-containing controller therapy, preferably MART with ICS–formoterol, to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If the patient is already on controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks.
- **Action plan**: Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice on avoiding exacerbation triggers.
- **Inhaler technique**: Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education, such as self-monitoring, a written action plan, and regular review.

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111NPNLz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, specifically in relation to ICSs and LABAs, the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend offering ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy for patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma rather than:

- **Higher-dose ICS**: Used as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy
- **Same-dose ICS-LABA**: Used as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^112h6GxW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The clinician's summary outlines the recommendations for individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma. The Expert Panel advises either of the following treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (i.e. one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual not regularly taking ICS controller therapy. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementing intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:

- **Individuals not taking treatment**: Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy.
- **Children aged 0 to 11 years**: The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma due to insufficient evidence.
- **Symptom perception**: Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).

Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is tw…

### Treatment patterns and related clinical consequences in adults with asthma [^111f1nmV]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Low credibility.

A stepwise therapeutic management is recommended for asthma patients by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Little is known about the recommendations applied in real-world settings. This study aims to associate treatment step with clinical events in patients with mild or severe asthma.

- **Methods**: A retrospective claims database analysis included adult patients with mild (GINA step 1) or severe asthma (GINA step 4). Maximum treatment step was measured within the first and second 90-day periods after the index date (the first date of asthma diagnosis during the inclusion period). Step-down was defined as a treatment step change from a higher to lower step, while step-up was defined as a treatment step change from a lower to higher step. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of asthma-related clinical events, measured at the third 90-day period.

- **Results and conclusions**: A total of 6,354 mild-asthma patients and 5,695 severe-asthma patients were included. In mild-asthma patients, when compared with no change in treatment step, step-down was associated with a lower risk of future clinical events [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.69–0.94], while step-up was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.77–1.27]. In severe-asthma patients, step-down was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81–1.10], while step-up was associated with a higher risk of future clinical events [OR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.29–3.33]. Our findings reassure the appropriateness of stepping-down treatment in mild-asthma patients.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for asthma, particularly in relation to the avoidance of exacerbating medications, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend deciding on prescribing oral or ophthalmic β-blockers on a case-by-case basis. It is advised to initiate treatment under close supervision by a specialist.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114t8MyU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes: exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life, and three important outcomes: quick-relief medication, adverse events (harms), and long-term medication use. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 18 can be found in EtD Table XXVII in Appendix B.

The evidence shows that SLIT provides a trivial benefit for the critical outcomes of exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life (moderate certainty of evidence). No studies assessed the impact of SLIT on emergency department visits, clinic visits, or hospitalizations. Three studies evaluated exacerbations using different end points. One study did not report the number of exacerbations, but it did report on the time to first exacerbation. SLIT decreased the severity of the first moderate exacerbation, but it did not increase the time to first severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Another study did not provide any raw data or rates of the critical outcomes; the authors only noted that the results showed no statistically significant improvement in asthma exacerbations. The third study, which enrolled only 60 participants, found a significantly lower number of exacerbations in the treatment group. Four studies (N = 1193) that evaluated asthma control using validated outcome tools — three used the ACQ, and one used the ACT — found no consistent improvement after treatment. Finally, multiple studies showed no difference in quality of life in those treated with SLIT or placebo (high certainty of evidence).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^116FcjFQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from health care systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels and to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^111sZBzt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

The stepwise approach to the pharmacologic treatment of asthma is a core foundation of asthma guidelines. Through this approach, treatment intensity is increased in discrete steps to obtain symptom control and reduce exacerbation risk, and it is decreased following a period of prolonged control. The stepwise approach is usually shown by an algorithm, as illustrated in the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy update. Here, we review the 2020 GINA stepwise algorithm and suggest alternative evidence-based algorithms that address potential problems with the currently recommended approach.

- **Personalized management for adults and adolescents**: Control symptoms and minimize future risk. The 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma algorithm. BDP = beclomethasone dipropionate; HDM = house dust mite; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β2-agonist; LTRA = leukotriene receptor antagonist; OCS = oral corticosteroids; SABA = short-acting β2-agonist; SLIT = sublingual immunotherapy.

### Asthma: Best treatment options [^113doHg9]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

To understand the principles of asthma management in patients of different ages, it is essential to outline major avoidance measures, classes of medications available, and indications for immunotherapy (IT).

Data sources include MEDLINE and major textbooks of allergy and immunology.

There has been an understanding of asthma as a chronic inflammatory disease for many decades; however, recent information about mediators and cytokines has led to new therapies and better understanding of the effects of IT and other preventive measures. The best treatment for any individual patient depends upon many factors and is a decision to be made between the patient and the physician. It seems that the best response to IT occurs in those who are highly sensitive to unavoidable allergens and who experienced a late-phase asthmatic response to the allergen initially. New data suggest that IT should be considered early, as it may prevent progression of asthma to more severe, less reversible disease. The best therapy results in the ablation of airway early- and late-phase reactivity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114P8mxx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to oral corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend offering add-on low-dose oral corticosteroids — ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent — as a last resort. This is applicable in selected adult patients with severe asthma with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations, despite good inhaler technique and adherence with step 5 treatment, and after the exclusion of other contributory factors and other add-on treatments, including biologics where available and affordable. There is a recognition that maintenance oral corticosteroids are often associated with substantial cumulative side effects.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision-making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (e.g. lack of blinding or of a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a LAMA to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) rather than continuing the same dose of ICS alone in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, if a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is not used.

### Achieving asthma control with ICS/LABA: A review of strategies for asthma management and prevention [^115K2F7R]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) is recommended for patients whose asthma is not controlled with a low-to-moderate dose of ICS alone; a separate reliever medication is used on an as-needed basis. The Gaining Optimal Asthma Control (GOAL) study demonstrated that salmeterol/fluticasone maintenance treatment can improve asthma control and reduce future risk compared with fluticasone alone, although the dose escalation design of this study meant that most patients treated with salmeterol/fluticasone were receiving the highest dose of ICS at the end of the study. Similarly, budesonide/formoterol maintenance therapy improved asthma control and reduced future risk compared with budesonide alone in the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy (FACET) study.

An alternative approach to asthma management is to use an ICS/LABA for both maintenance and reliever therapy. A large body of clinical evidence has shown that the use of budesonide/formoterol in this way improves both control and reduces future risk compared with ICS/LABA plus as-needed short-acting β2-agonist (SABA), even when patients receive lower maintenance doses of ICS as part of the maintenance and reliever therapy regimen. In addition, one study has shown that beclometasone/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy reduces exacerbations more effectively than beclometasone/formoterol plus as-needed SABA. The use of ICS/LABA as both maintenance and reliever therapy ensures that an increase in reliever use in response to worsening symptoms is aligned with the underlying need for increased ICS doses.

### Stepping down the dose of inhaled corticosteroids for adults with asthma [^114Fb7SW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Asthma is a condition of the airways affecting more than 300 million adults and children worldwide. National and international guidelines recommend titrating up the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to gain symptom control at the lowest possible dose because long-term use of higher doses of ICS carries a risk of systemic adverse events. For patients whose asthma symptoms are controlled on moderate or higher doses of ICS, it may be possible to reduce the dose of ICS without compromising symptom control.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the evidence for stepping down ICS treatment in adults with well-controlled asthma who are already receiving a moderate or high dose of ICS.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials from the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Airways Group and conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We searched all databases from their inception with no restriction on language. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We performed the most recent search in July 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration and excluded cross-over trials. We looked for studies of adults (aged ≥ 18 years) whose asthma had been well controlled for a minimum of three months on at least a moderate dose of ICS. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with any other respiratory comorbidity. We included trials comparing a reduction in the dose of ICS versus no change.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^112bL39Z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Currently, at each step, the GINA algorithm aligns treatment recommendations based on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol reliever therapy with those of the traditional short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever therapy. This assumes that the efficacy of treatment incorporating ICS/formoterol reliever therapy at each step aligns more closely with the corresponding alternative treatment incorporating a SABA reliever at the same step, rather than at adjacent higher or lower steps, which is not the case. This issue is illustrated by a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis that reported the relative risk of a severe exacerbation with low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy at GINA step 3 compared with:

- **Low-dose ICS/long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) plus SABA therapy (GINA step 3)**: 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.47–0.64).
- **Medium-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA (GINA step 4)**: 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56–0.91).
- **High-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA (GINA step 5)**: 0.78 (95% CI, 0.51–1.21).

Thus, low-dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy at GINA step 3 aligns most closely in terms of efficacy with high-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 5. It then progressively aligns to a lesser extent with medium-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 4, followed by low-dose ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy at GINA step 3. This ranking of efficacy is thus discordant with the algorithm. This structural problem could be resolved by separating the instructions for the stepwise approach incorporating ICS/formoterol reliever therapy.

### Guidelines for asthma management: A review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^115vixQ2]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups were collaborating on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in two additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries, resulting in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion within each guideline committee, though those opinions were based on the available studies.

The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science and served as the vehicle for implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1144behQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Section IV: Recommendations for the use of intermittent ICS in the treatment of asthma**:

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. The Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings. However, the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

- **Definitions of terms used in this section**:

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. It allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^117Kb3cg]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding appropriate health care for specific circumstances. These guidelines are based on scientific evidence regarding therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid-1980s when asthma became recognized as a public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). The first edition was opinion-based, but later updates became evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines has recently become available and is based on the control of the disease. Asthma guidelines aim to stimulate the implementation of practical approaches to reduce the global burden of asthma. Although asthma guidelines may not be perfect, they appear to be the best vehicle available to assist primary care physicians and patients in receiving the best possible care for asthma.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: Perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^111yCWSZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines.

This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development.

The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:

- **Better mechanisms**: A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.

- **Personalized medicine**: The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.

- **Professional engagement**: Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

- **Core outcome measures**: Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.

- **Clinical relevance and MIDs**: The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide minimal important differences (MIDs) for all asthma outcomes, such as exacerbations and asthma symptoms, and the cutoffs for tests. Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.

### Identification and management of adults with asthma prone to exacerbations: Can we do better [^113kycV4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A major goal of international guidelines on the management of asthma is to achieve control of symptoms, lung function, and reliever inhaler use, and to prevent future risks of exacerbations and decline in lung function. Despite the widespread dissemination of asthma guidelines, many patients have inadequately controlled disease and experience frequent exacerbations of asthma. Exacerbations are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, generate high health costs, and are the main cause of mortality in asthma. The identification and appropriate management of adults with asthma who are prone to exacerbations is of considerable importance, as this could potentially reduce the large number of patients currently experiencing uncontrolled disease.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111zDWFP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

In the reviewed studies, the indication for increasing the ICS dose was decreased peak flow and/or increased symptoms. When increased, the ICS dose was doubled, quadrupled, or quintupled.

- **Rationale and discussion**: In children aged 4 to 11 years, the intervention did not significantly reduce exacerbations or improve asthma quality of life in one study in the systematic review report. The intervention's potential to suppress growth in a more recent study and the lack of demonstrated efficacy in either of the reviewed articles led to the Expert Panel's recommendation against this intervention in this age group.

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the intervention as implemented also did not significantly reduce exacerbations in three studies in the evidence summary, but the certainty of evidence is low. The more recent study by McKeever et al. showed modest but significant reductions in time to severe exacerbation and rate of ICS use in individuals whose action plan included a quadrupling of the ICS dose. However, unlike the studies in the AHRQ systematic review report, this study did not include a placebo group or use blinding, and the baseline adherence rate was low (42%−50%). The adherence rate in the McKeever et al. study might be more similar to the adherence rates in routine clinical practice, whereas adherence rates in the RCTs were probably higher than in most real-world settings.

Thus, the Expert Panel believes that this recommendation applies most specifically to individuals who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^112PixgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children and families track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the three age groups of childhood: adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old). What works for one age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma.

Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on guidance documents but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112WXZFZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, particularly concerning the initial assessment, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating symptom control, potential future risks of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients (aged 6–11 years) presenting with asthma:

- **Assess symptom control**: Evaluate the symptom control over the last four weeks or longer.

- **Identify risk factors**: Identify other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side-effects.

- **Measure lung function**: Conduct measurements at diagnosis/ initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), but more frequently in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma.

- **Document treatment step**: Clearly document the patient's treatment step.

- **Inhaler technique and adherence**: Observe inhaler technique, assess adherence, and monitor side-effects.

- **Asthma action plan**: Verify that the patient possesses a written asthma action plan.

- **Patient attitudes and goals**: Inquire about the patient's attitudes toward asthma and their medication goals.

- **Assess multimorbidity**: Evaluate multimorbidities that contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and sometimes poor asthma control, such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111nz5nf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Jenkins et al. conducted a post hoc analysis of these three studies in 1,239 participants aged 12 years and older with milder asthma (daily maintenance ICS dose equal to 400 μg or less budesonide equivalent). The authors confirmed that SMART reduced exacerbations overall; however, in subgroup analyses, participants with the mildest asthma at enrollment (based on rescue SABA use of < 1 inhalation/d) showed a marginal and statistically nonsignificant benefit.

Another post hoc analysis of one of the three RCTs by O'Byrne et al. included 224 children aged 4 to 11 years who used medium to high ICS doses (any brand, 200–500 μg daily). The 118 participants in the SMART group were instructed to take budesonide-formoterol, 80/4.5 μg once daily, as their baseline therapy, with up to seven additional rescue puffs (total daily dose of 36 μg formoterol). The other 106 participants took budesonide, 320 μg daily, with rescue SABA. In the SMART group, the relative risk for a composite exacerbation measure — comprising systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, emergency department visits, and an increase in ICS or other medication dose — dropped by 57% (moderate certainty of evidence).

The authors did not report on validated outcome measures of quality of life or asthma control, but nighttime awakenings declined significantly with SMART. SMART participants used a lower daily ICS dose (average 127 μg vs. 320 μg/d in the fixed-dose budesonide group) and demonstrated significantly improved growth rates (adjusted mean difference of 1 cm compared with fixed-dose budesonide).

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^111pT1nV]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to the adjustment of treatment, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering adding a LAMA to ICS/LABA therapy for moderate-to-severe asthma not well-controlled with dual therapy to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations in patients aged ≥ 6 years. It is recognized that triple therapy is more effective than dual therapy.

### Should we apply a treatable traits approach to asthma care [^113U3MXE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the evidence for adopting a "treatable traits" approach to asthma management.

Data sources for the study included PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar. These databases were searched for randomized, controlled phase III or IV trials involving adults with the word "asthma" in the title published in the previous 10 years. Additionally, we searched for all articles containing the words "treatable AND trait(s)", "asthma AND biomarker(s) OR smoking OR obesity OR laryngeal OR management" published within the previous 5 years. Articles were excluded if they were not published in English. Our search identified 257 articles for consideration. Furthermore, we manually searched the reference lists of studies identified and explored the websites of the British Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and Global Initiative for Asthma for specific guidance related to asthma management.

The results demonstrate that "treatable traits" are described within three domains: pulmonary, extrapulmonary, and behavioral and lifestyle traits. We consider whether treatment should be targeted toward these traits, where present in asthma patients, based on currently available evidence. This is in contrast to increasing treatment in response to symptoms, in line with step-up, step-down asthma management guidelines.

In conclusion, we advocate that a treatable traits approach should be applied more broadly to the assessment and management of inadequately controlled asthma, rather than a step-up, step-down approach based on patient symptoms.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114eHEdL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The protocols that the EPCs used in their systematic reviews describe the prespecified key questions they addressed (listed in Table IA), the methods they used, and the overall analytic framework. When conducting the systematic reviews, the EPCs sought studies that included the prespecified target population(s), settings, and used the prespecified interventions, comparators, and outcomes. The EPCs excluded articles about studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria listed in the protocols for each systematic review. These inclusion criteria were summarized in the published systematic review reports. Appendices to the systematic review reports documented the rationales for excluding published articles identified by a broad search of the literature. The systematic review reports also included the EPCs' assessments of the risk of bias of each included article and of the strength of evidence for each key question, using methods described in the protocols and systematic review reports. The EPCs were not required to use the GRADE methodology to conduct the systematic reviews, but they used a similar framework. After peer review and posting for public comment, the systematic review reports were finalized and published between late 2017 and early 2018.

Westat (contract #HHSN268201700020B) conducted a literature search to identify any new articles published between the completion of the EPC's systematic review literature searches and October 2018, when the Expert Panel began its work.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^116xQdZx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

- **Comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy**: What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as an add-on therapy to ICS plus LABA, compared with ICS plus LABA as controller therapy, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

- **Recommendation 16**: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS-LABA compared to continuing the same dose of ICS-LABA. This is a conditional recommendation, with moderate certainty of evidence.

- **Implementation guidance**: For individuals whose asthma is not controlled with ICS-LABA, the Expert Panel recommends the addition of a LAMA for many individuals. Based on the studies available, the addition of a LAMA to ICS-LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma offers a small benefit. This therapy is recommended for individuals aged 12 years and older whose asthma is uncontrolled even though they are using ICS-LABA therapy. LAMA therapy should not be used in individuals with glaucoma or urinary retention. Adding a LAMA to ICS-LABA for individuals with uncontrolled asthma who are already taking ICS-LABA improves asthma control and quality of life but has no effect on asthma exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroids or rescue medication.

- **Clinician-patient discussion**: What clinicians should discuss with their patients about adding LAMA therapy to ICS-LABA is that adding LAMA therapy to ICS-LABA requires the use of an additional, different type of inhaler. The addition of a LAMA may improve asthma control and quality of life but may not decrease the frequency of exacerbations.

### Asthma maintenance and reliever therapy: Should this be the standard of care [^111a3w1W]? Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve optimal asthma control, defined by the absence of daytime symptoms, nighttime waking, reliever use, functional limitation, lung function stability, and to also reduce the future risks of asthma exacerbations, deterioration in lung function, and the medication's adverse effects. The most widely used maintenance therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). This review considered the evidence in which the combination of the ICS budesonide and the rapid-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) formoterol can be used as a standard of care for maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Data sources**: The archival literature of peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy and safety of budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Results**: The ICS-LABA combination containing budesonide-formoterol reduces future risk of severe asthma exacerbations and provides similar levels of day-to-day asthma control when compared with using high-dose ICS alone, or combination ICS-LABA therapy and short-acting β2-agonist as a reliever.

- **Conclusion**: Budesonide-formoterol as a single combination maintenance and reliever inhaler is effective in reducing asthma exacerbation risk, requires a lower maintenance dose of ICS, and results in a simplified approach to asthma management.

### SIGN 158 British guideline on the management of asthma: A national clinical guideline [^115HUcnX]. SIGN (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, specifically with respect to initial assessment, the BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a structured clinical assessment to evaluate the initial probability of asthma based on several factors:

- **History of symptoms**: Ideally corroborated by variable peak flows when symptomatic and asymptomatic.
- **Symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness, and chest tightness**: These should vary over time.

### Optimal asthma control: Time for a new target [^113Xumkj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The stepwise approach to pharmacological treatment in adult asthma mandates that treatment is progressively stepped up to achieve symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations and is stepped down following a period of prolonged control. This review proposes that in adults without good asthma control, well-controlled asthma can only be achieved in approximately 70% of patients across the strata of severity. This is only possible if there is a progressive increase in inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 agonist therapy to a maintenance inhaled corticosteroid dose, causing systemic side effects akin to a 5-mg daily dose of oral prednisone.

Another consideration is that in individuals with asthma, numerous overlapping disorders can present with symptoms indistinguishable from asthma. Comorbidities contribute to poor control, while lifestyle and environmental factors require specific treatments, potentially leading to better outcomes. The disparity between patients' perceptions and guideline assessment of control may be due to partially controlled asthma being associated with near-maximal levels of quality of life, with minimal impairment.

Finally, it is widely assumed that asthma symptom control equates to the elimination of the risk of asthma attacks. However, this assumption may not apply to many patients, particularly those with more severe asthma. Further research is proposed to determine the optimal levels of asthma control and the potential value of different treatment targets, such as control of type-2 airway inflammation.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically concerning long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend considering the addition of LAMA to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) rather than continuing the same dose of ICS-LABA in patients 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112UTXGN]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to management of exacerbation in the emergency department setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend continuing systemic (oral) corticosteroids for 5–7 days in adult patients (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and for 3–5 days in pediatric patients (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) to reduce the risk of relapse.

### Asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for poorly controlled asthma [^113CdJX3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients (and families) manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear.

The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for the patient with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience. They are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1176KhHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations and, taken together, resulted in overall low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4 to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence, and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

- **Recommendation 11**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

- **Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence**.

- **Implementation guidance: Clinician's summary**: This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose. For individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen, the Expert Panel advises caution against dose escalation for transient symptom deterioration.

### Patterns of inhaled corticosteroid use and asthma control in the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study [^114gXbTT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Daily controller medication use is recommended for children with persistent asthma to achieve asthma control.

- **Objective**: To examine patterns of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use and asthma control in an observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma (the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study).

- **Methods**: We assessed patterns of ICS use during a 12-month period (consistent, intermittent, and none) and asthma control (well-controlled vs poorly controlled). Multivariate logistic regression examined the association between the pattern of ICS use and asthma control.

- **Results**: Of 914 patients enrolled, 425 were recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy in the Childhood Asthma Management Program Continuation Study. Of these patients, 46% reported consistent ICS use, and 20% reported no ICS use during year 1. By year 4, consistent ICS use decreased to 20%, whereas no ICS use increased to 57%; poorly controlled asthma was reported in 18% of encounters. In multivariate models controlling for age, sex, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and asthma severity assessment, patients reporting consistent ICS use during a 12-month period were more likely to report poor asthma control (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.1) compared with those reporting no ICS use.

- **Conclusions**: In this observational study of children and adolescents with mild-to-moderate asthma, most did not report continued use of ICS. Patients recommended to continue receiving ICS therapy and reporting consistent ICS use were less likely to report well-controlled asthma.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: Management strategies [^111fyQ1M]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly in the context of exacerbation management in a primary care setting, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend administering inhaled short-acting β-agonists (SABAs) at 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for 1 hour in patients experiencing mild-to-moderate exacerbations.

### The risks, benefits, and uncertainties of stepping down asthma medications [^11381pRD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Stepwise adjustments have been suggested as a framework to manage chronic asthma over time. In this framework, individuals with good asthma control and a low risk for future asthma exacerbations may be considered for a reduction or "step down" of their chronic asthma medications. In this article, we discuss how patients may benefit or be harmed by stepping down asthma medications. Based on the literature presented in this article, we recommend that clinicians discuss the option of stepping down with patients when symptoms are stable, lung function is near normal, and biomarkers (if measured) are near normal. Other factors that should be considered in the decision to step down include the length of asthma stability, age of the patient, time of year, and patient preferences. Reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid by 25% to 50% appears to be the safest method of stepping down. A clear plan of care and follow-up is needed when stepping down asthma medications because many patients are likely to have re-exacerbations.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, particularly in pediatric patients, clinical follow-up is essential. The BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend asking specific questions about medication use and assessing prescribing data to evaluate adherence. It is important to explore attitudes towards medication and identify practical barriers to adherence in a nonjudgmental manner.

### Post hoc analysis of initial treatments and control status in the INITIAL study: an observational study of newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^111oebUu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two pivotal long-term goals of asthma management are symptom control and risk reduction. Evaluation of symptom control constitutes the basis of treatment decisions in a continuous asthma management cycle composed of assessment, treatment adjustment, and response review recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA).

Criteria used to assess clinical control have evolved from a combination of symptoms and lung function (peak expiratory flow [PEF] or forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV₁]) endorsed by GINA 2012 to symptoms alone in GINA 2014 and subsequent GINA updates. The removal of lung function from the assessment of asthma control is based on the rationale that although still important in predicting the risk of exacerbations, lung function testing results, such as spirometry, sometimes provide equivocal or even little utility for determining the level of clinical control. Valid tools that can be used to assess symptom control include simple screening tools (e.g. the 4-item questionnaires endorsed by GINA), categorical symptom control tools (e.g. Royal College of Physicians Three Questions' Tool), and numerical tools (e.g. Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with or without a long-acting β2 agonist (LABA), have been recommended by GINA as the mainstay initial controller treatment. Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) may be considered as an alternative option or add-on medication at steps 2 to 4. LTRA belongs to anti-leukotrienes and renders anti-inflammatory as well as bronchodilating effects via inhibiting leukotriene release.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115fx3bF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity; it includes several clinical phenotypes likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD. Treatment with long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without inhaled corticosteroids, ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, all patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence and advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

- **Rationale**: The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, and more rapid decline.

### The asthma controller step-down yardstick [^1169Nf5g]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to disease management in which the assessment of impairment and risk is linked to step-based therapy. Using this model, controller treatment is adjusted upward or downward according to a patient's level of asthma control over time. Strategies for stepping up controller therapy are well described, and the adult and pediatric asthma yardsticks provide operational recommendations based on patient profiles.

Strategies for stepping down controller treatment are less clear, although stepping down to the minimum effective therapy is important and should be considered when a patient's asthma has been well controlled for an adequate period as defined by risk and impairment. This yardstick presents recommendations for when and how to step down asthma controller therapy according to guideline-defined control levels. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat patients with asthma with a practical and clinically relevant framework for implementing a step-down in controller therapy.

### Daily versus as-needed corticosteroids for mild persistent asthma [^112n5yyg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although guidelines recommend daily therapy for patients with mild persistent asthma, prescription patterns suggest that most such patients use these so-called controller therapies intermittently. In patients with mild persistent asthma, we evaluated the efficacy of intermittent short-course corticosteroid treatment guided by a symptom-based action plan alone or in addition to daily treatment with either inhaled budesonide or oral zafirlukast over a one-year period.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind trial, 225 adults underwent randomization. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) before and after bronchodilator treatment, the frequency of exacerbations, the degree of asthma control, the number of symptom-free days, and the quality of life.

- **Results**: The three treatments produced similar increases in morning PEF (7.1 to 8.3 percent; approximately 32 liters per minute; P = 0.90) and similar rates of asthma exacerbations (P = 0.24), even though the intermittent-treatment group took budesonide, on average, for only 0.5 week of the year. As compared with intermittent therapy or daily zafirlukast therapy, daily budesonide therapy produced greater improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ (P = 0.005), bronchial reactivity (P < 0.001), the percentage of eosinophils in sputum (P = 0.007), exhaled nitric oxide levels (P = 0.006), scores for asthma control (P < 0.001), and the number of symptom-free days (P = 0.03), but not in post-bronchodilator FEV₁ (P = 0.29) or in the quality of life (P = 0.18).

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee expert panel working group [^112YJn8f]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Future research opportunities**: The Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for future research: comparative effectiveness studies of LAMA therapy for asthma, because the majority of LAMA studies were efficacy studies, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Comparative effectiveness and safety of ICS plus LAMA versus ICS-LABA in ethnically diverse populations in studies that are adequately powered to examine the harms and benefits of these two treatment options.

- **Systematic reviews**: In children with asthma aged 6 to 11 years, systematic reviews are needed to inform future guidelines. Comparisons of a LAMA to a leukotriene inhibitor as add-on therapy to ICS-LABA in individuals with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

- **Role of LAMAs**: Exploration of the role of LAMAs other than tiotropium as add-on therapy to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma is necessary.

### Optimizing adherence to medication to improve outcomes in asthma [^112D7inW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Taking medication as prescribed is an essential component of asthma management and has been proven to contribute to improved symptom management and reduced risk of asthma exacerbations. Nevertheless, patients continue to find it difficult to achieve optimal adherence, and healthcare professionals (HCP) often struggle with providing appropriate support. Although the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends reviewing inhaler technique and adherence to medications at every consultation as part of routine asthma assessment and management, following this recommendation is challenging in everyday practice.

Supporting adherence effectively requires understanding:

- **Effects of suboptimal adherence**: What effect suboptimal adherence has on outcomes in different patient groups.
- **Factors influencing behaviors**: What factors influence medication-taking behaviors at different levels.
- **Suitable interventions**: What interventions are best suited to address these factors and can be implemented in specific clinical contexts.

Moreover, as asthma is a variable condition, supported self-management can empower patients to adjust their preventer medication according to their asthma action plan. Adherence to medications has been conceptualized as a complex group of behaviors and interactions embedded in the broader process of asthma care. Research evidence is accumulating on the impact of these behaviors on a range of clinical outcomes, in particular severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, and deaths. Preventing asthma deaths through appropriate medical management and education needs to be a priority for health systems. Clinical teams need proven, evidence-based tools.

### Daily, once-weekly, or no asthma controller therapy at all: The annoying issue with disease remission in clinical asthma trials [^112sTQXa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

One of the main challenges in managing patients with asthma is the variability of associated symptoms and airflow limitation over time. Graduation of different severities of the disease still refers to the treatment intensity of a regularly applied controller medication and the related treatment efficacy. However, the stepwise treatment approach is not a one-way street and includes regular reassessment of symptoms, exacerbations, side effects, lung function, and patient satisfaction, consequently encouraging physicians to "step down" to find the lowest possible treatment intensity appropriate to achieve asthma control.

Four new monoclonal antibodies have recently been introduced as add-on therapies for patients with uncontrolled asthma under high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, together with a second controller medication, usually a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). Carefully administered to the right selection of patients, these drugs demonstrate a reduction in annualized exacerbation frequency and the need for continuous oral steroids. In patients clinically benefiting from such antibody therapies, reports that would clearly support the disease-modifying potentials of these medications are missing. It may still be too early for studies that would support the safe discontinuation of an applied antibody therapy following a certain period of successful add-on treatment.
