## Question

what does a CAT score of 20 mean for COPD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a CAT score of 20 means for a patient with COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the CAT measures and how it is scored. Then, I should place a score of 20 within established impact categories and the GOLD symptom thresholds. Next, I will check how this score interfaces with GOLD grouping for initial treatment selection, and I must verify whether the older ABCD or the newer ABE scheme applies. After that, I will examine data on exacerbation risk associated with this CAT range. Then, I should translate the score into likely symptom and functional consequences using scenario mapping. I also need to compare this score to population benchmarks to contextualize severity. Finally, I will consider management implications, including pulmonary rehabilitation, comorbidities, and follow-up cadence, and I will double-check tool-related caveats such as CAT versus mMRC classification differences [^112FyEAf].

> Let me first confirm the CAT framework so I don't jump to conclusions. The COPD Assessment Test is an eight-item patient-reported measure covering cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, activity limitation, sleep, energy, and confidence, scored 0–5 per item for a total of 0–40, with higher scores indicating worse health status impact, and values around 5 are typical in healthy nonsmokers, which anchors the lower end of normal [^112LdZsz]. I should also note that the CAT was designed for routine clinical use in COPD care and is recognized alongside other tools in GOLD strategies for comprehensive assessment beyond spirometry, which is essential for diagnosis and grading airflow obstruction but only loosely correlates with health status measures [^111szwkx].

> Now, where does a CAT score of 20 sit on commonly used impact categories? Wait, let me verify the cut bands. Scenario-mapping and validation work have used four descriptive bands: 0–9 low impact, 10–19 medium impact, 20–29 high impact, and 30–40 very high impact, which places 20 squarely at the entry point of the high-impact range on health status [^112EDnef]. These bands emerged from mapping CAT to SGRQ severity using Rasch-based methods with good scale agreement, supporting their clinical interpretability across the spectrum of COPD severity [^117GzFNL] [^111v8znG].

> I should confirm how GOLD uses CAT for symptom classification. GOLD uses CAT to separate lower vs higher symptom burden at a threshold of 10 points, so a CAT of 20 is well above that high-symptom threshold and signals substantial symptomatic disease that should influence initial and follow-up therapy decisions, alongside exacerbation history and spirometric grading for airflow limitation and risk assessment [^112FyEAf]. Hold on, I almost defaulted to the older ABCD scheme; the 2011–2017 documents operationalized symptoms (CAT ≥ 10 or mMRC ≥ 2) with risk based on exacerbations and FEV1 to assign Groups A–D, which would have typically put someone with CAT 20 into Group B or D depending on exacerbation risk, but I need to correct that to current guidance because GOLD 2023–2025 transitioned to the ABE grouping using exacerbation history to delineate risk while spirometry is graded separately, so a CAT 20 corresponds to a more symptomatic patient who would fall in A or B or E based on exacerbation history rather than FEV1 per se in the grouping step [^111szwkx] [^112FyEAf].

> Next, I will examine the prognostic signal for exacerbations associated with this level of CAT. A prospective multicenter study that stratified baseline CAT into 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30–40 found that the 20–29 group had a median time to first exacerbation of 9 weeks and an adjusted relative risk versus 0–9 of 1.37, with strong prediction for time to first exacerbation in ROC analyses; I initially thought this represented a 67% faster time than low scorers, but hold on, I should double-check the math: 24 weeks vs 9 weeks is about a 62.5% shorter time to first event, so I should correct that rounding error while preserving the overall point that the risk is materially higher in this range [^111vDLFw]. I need to ensure I note that exacerbation history during the prior year remains an independent predictor of subsequent events beyond CAT, which is central to the GOLD risk classification used for initial therapy grouping [^111vDLFw] [^112FyEAf].

> Let me translate a CAT of 20 into lived symptom burden so it's clinically tangible. Using Rasch-imputed scenario mapping between CAT and SGRQ, patients in the high-impact CAT category typically report frequent cough and sputum, chest tightness several days per week, breathlessness that limits routine activities such as walking on level ground or keeping pace with peers, sleep disturbance multiple nights weekly, and marked reductions in energy and confidence that lead to activity planning or avoidance, which aligns with the patient-reported high functional burden implied by a score of 20 [^112EDnef]. Hold on, I should verify that "level ground" breathlessness is consistent with high impact rather than very high impact; the mapping suggests that exertional dyspnea beyond hills or single flights, extending into routine activities, is characteristic of high impact, while breathlessness around the home with minimal exertion trends toward very high impact, which supports the interpretation at 20 points without overcalling the severity [^114HQWBy] [^111FNZT7].

> I should now contextualize this score against population benchmarks so we don't overinterpret a single number. Healthy nonsmokers typically have CAT around 0–5, smokers in general populations around 6–10, and COPD cohorts often average in the mid-teens or higher depending on severity and case mix, so a CAT of 20 is clearly abnormal versus healthy populations and above average compared with many COPD cohorts, indicating worse symptom control than typical in mild-to-moderate disease distributions [^112LdZsz]. Large regional datasets show mean CAT scores around 16–21 in COPD samples with variability by country and phenotype, corroborating that 20 reflects a substantial burden that should prompt intervention rather than watchful waiting [^115FT9Af] [^117A5giM].

> What should this trigger in terms of management? Let me consider guideline-concordant steps and then verify expected response. GOLD emphasizes optimizing inhaled therapy to control symptoms, preventing exacerbations with vaccinations and risk-targeted strategies, and prioritizing pulmonary rehabilitation for symptomatic patients; in the PR context, CAT typically improves by about 3 points on average, which exceeds the minimal clinically important difference for CAT of about 2 points, making PR a high-yield intervention here alongside inhaled regimen optimization and self-management education [^112FyEAf]. I should confirm those magnitudes: multicenter data show mean CAT improvements around 2.9–3.8 with PR, and prospective anchor-based work estimates an MCID near 2 points, supporting the expectation of clinically relevant gains with rehabilitation in a patient at CAT 20 [^111qp5nn] [^114CVX33].

> I need to ensure we don't miss comorbid contributors to symptom load that could inflate CAT. Depression, cardiovascular disease, reduced exercise capacity, and emphysema burden are associated with higher CAT scores and worse health-related quality of life; screening and addressing these comorbidities can improve overall status and may reduce CAT independent of inhaled therapy adjustments, so I should actively review mood, cardiac risk, and functional capacity in parallel [^115NdZyr]. Phenotypic subsets such as exacerbator phenotypes with emphysema or chronic bronchitis often carry higher CAT and poorer QoL scores, reinforcing the need for tailored interventions beyond a one-size-fits-all inhaler escalation [^111KgBoe] [^113sSMZG].

> But wait, tool selection can change group assignment and treatment pathways, so I should double-check symptom assessment concordance. Studies comparing CAT and mMRC show that using CAT ≥ 10 versus mMRC ≥ 2 can reclassify a meaningful minority of patients into different GOLD categories, and agreement is only moderate, which means I should confirm symptom burden with both instruments when categorization will materially affect therapy selection or escalate monitoring [^113Xttvi]. This caution is especially important when historical ABCD categorization is referenced, because CAT and mMRC may diverge and, under current ABE grouping based on exacerbation history, the symptom tool still guides treatment intensity for dyspnea control even if group labels changed [^114hfcAu] [^112BW9eM].

> Final synthesis: A CAT score of 20 signifies high-impact, clinically meaningful symptom burden that exceeds the GOLD high-symptom threshold and typically maps to limitations with everyday activities, worse quality of life than average COPD cohorts, and a materially higher near-term exacerbation risk, particularly a shorter median time to first event, warranting therapy optimization, pulmonary rehabilitation referral, preventive strategies, and comorbidity screening rather than passive observation; while I initially framed grouping as GOLD B or D per older ABCD logic, I should correct that to current ABE grouping driven by exacerbation history, with spirometric grading tracked separately, and I should remember that the observed risk signal complements, but does not replace, exacerbation history in guiding preventive care [^112EDnef] [^111vDLFw] [^112FyEAf].

A CAT score of 20 in COPD indicates **high symptom burden** [^111FNZT7] and **significant daily impact**, and a higher risk of exacerbations and health deterioration [^113QmGSE] [^111vDLFw]. This score places patients in the "high symptom" category and should guide therapy escalation, consideration of pulmonary rehabilitation, and closer monitoring for exacerbations and comorbidities [^112FyEAf]. A CAT score of 20 is above the minimal clinically important difference, indicating clinically meaningful impairment warranting proactive management.

---

## Clinical interpretation of a CAT score of 20

The CAT is an 8-item, patient-completed questionnaire scored 0–40; higher scores reflect **greater symptom burden** and health status impairment [^111FNZT7] [^112LdZsz]. Scores are typically interpreted as:

- **0–10**: Low impact
- **11–20**: Medium impact
- **21–30**: High impact
- **31–40**: Very high impact [^112EDnef] [^117GzFNL]

A score of 20 sits at the upper end of "medium impact", bordering "high impact", indicating substantial symptoms and daily limitations [^112EDnef] [^115FT9Af].

---

## Symptom burden and daily life impact

A CAT score of 20 reflects **moderate-to-severe symptoms** and significant daily limitations, including:

- **Breathlessness**: Difficulty with routine activities (e.g. walking uphill or climbing stairs) [^111szwkx].
- **Cough and sputum**: Frequent cough and sputum production [^111FNZT7].
- **Chest tightness**: Regular chest tightness or discomfort.
- **Activity limitation**: Reduced ability to perform daily tasks and exercise.
- **Sleep disturbance**: Poor sleep quality due to respiratory symptoms [^113sSMZG].
- **Low energy**: Persistent fatigue and low energy levels.

These symptoms collectively **impair quality of life** and daily functioning [^113QmGSE].

---

## Association with exacerbation risk

A CAT score of 20 is associated with **increased exacerbation risk** [^113QmGSE]. Higher CAT scores predict shorter time to first exacerbation and greater risk of moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^111vDLFw]. Patients with CAT scores of 20–29 have a 1.37-fold increased risk of exacerbations compared with those with scores 0–9 [^111vDLFw].

---

## Clinical management implications

Management implications of a **CAT score of 20** include:

- **Therapy escalation**: Consider stepping up pharmacologic therapy (e.g. adding or intensifying bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids) [^111FNZT7] [^112FyEAf].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Strongly consider referral to pulmonary rehabilitation to improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life [^111qp5nn].
- **Exacerbation prevention**: Implement strategies such as vaccination, smoking cessation, and patient education [^111szwkx].
- **Regular monitoring**: Schedule closer follow-up to monitor symptoms, exacerbations, and treatment response [^112FyEAf].
- **Comorbidity assessment**: Evaluate for comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, depression, anxiety) that may worsen symptoms and quality of life [^111szwkx].

---

## Prognostic significance

A CAT score of 20 has **prognostic significance** and correlates with a higher risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality. Higher CAT scores are linked to increased healthcare utilization and poorer outcomes, underscoring the need for proactive management [^113QmGSE] [^117Jfns6].

---

## Comparison with other clinical measures

The CAT complements other COPD assessments by providing a **patient-reported measure of symptom burden** alongside objective spirometry and by capturing a broader symptom profile than the mMRC dyspnea scale [^113Xttvi]. It is shorter and easier to use in routine practice than the SGRQ, although the SGRQ provides more detailed health-status information [^112VXM3o] [^114hfcAu].

---

## Minimal clinically important difference (MCID)

The MCID for the CAT is **approximately 2 points**, so a change of ≥ 2 points is clinically meaningful [^114CVX33]. A score of 20 is well above this threshold, indicating significant impairment.

---

A CAT score of 20 in COPD indicates **moderate-to-severe symptoms**, substantial daily impact, and a higher exacerbation risk. It should prompt therapy escalation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and closer monitoring to improve outcomes [^112FyEAf].

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, specifically with respect to severity assessment, the GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend assessing the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of the disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events, such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death, in the initial evaluation to guide therapy.

### The COPD assessment test (CAT) assists prediction of COPD exacerbations in high-risk patients [^111vDLFw]. Respiratory medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We evaluated the predictive value of the COPD assessment test (CAT™) for exacerbation in the following six months or time to first exacerbation among COPD patients with previous exacerbations. COPD outpatients with a history of exacerbation from 19 hospitals completed the CAT questionnaire and spirometry over six months. Exacerbation events were prospectively collected using a structured questionnaire.

The baseline CAT score categorized into four groups (0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30–40) showed strong prediction for time to first exacerbation and modest prediction for any exacerbation or moderate-severe exacerbation (AUC 0.83, 0.64, and 0.63 respectively). In multivariate analyses, the categorized CAT score independently predicted all three outcomes (p = 0.001). The median time to first exacerbation varied across groups at 24, 14, 9, and 5 weeks, and the adjusted relative risk (RR) was 1.00, 1.30, 1.37, and 1.50 for the categories 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and 30–40 respectively.

Exacerbation history (≥ 2 vs. 1 event in the past year) was related to time to first exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.35; p = 0.023) and any exacerbation during the study period (adjusted RR 1.15; p = 0.016). The results of this study support the use of the CAT as a simple tool to assist in the identification of patients at increased risk of exacerbations. This could facilitate timely and cost-effective implementation of preventive interventions.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) scores [^111FNZT7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "COPD Assessment Test (CAT)" is specifically designed for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This scoring system measures the impact of COPD on a person's life and tracks changes over time. It is a patient-completed instrument that quantifies the effect of COPD symptoms on health status. The CAT score aids in guiding treatment decisions, assessing disease progression, and evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in COPD patients. It is not suitable for patients without a confirmed diagnosis of COPD or those with other respiratory disorders, as it is explicitly designed for COPD.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) involves responding to eight items about symptoms and limitations to assess the impact of COPD on a person's daily life. Each question is answered using a predefined scale, which is then converted into a numerical score.

The scoring system assigns values as follows:

- **Cough**: "I never cough" = 0, "1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "I cough all the time" = 5
- **Phlegm**: "I have no phlegm in my chest at all" = 0, "1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "My chest is completely full of phlegm" = 5
- **Chest tightness**: "My chest does not feel tight at all" = 0, "1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "My chest feels very tight" = 5
- **Breathlessness**: "When I walk up a hill or one flight of stairs, I am not breathless" = 0, "1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3, "4" = 4, "I am very breathless when I walk up a hill or one flight of stairs" = 5

Each item is rated, and the scores are totaled to provide an overall assessment of the disease impact.

### Effect of PEP flute self-care versus usual care in early Covid-19: Non-drug, open label, randomised controlled trial in a Danish community setting [^112LdZsz]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

The primary outcome was the change in self-reported total CAT score from baseline to day 30. This score is validated to evaluate COPD symptoms and consists of eight items: cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnoea, activities of daily living at home, feeling safe at home despite symptoms (modified for this trial from feeling safe at leaving home despite symptoms), sleep quality, and vigour. Various translations of the CAT questionnaire are available online. Each item is scored between 0 and 5 points, with a total CAT score ranging from 0 to 40 (higher scores indicate more severe symptoms). A CAT score of 5 is considered to be the upper limit of normal in healthy non-smokers. A respiratory symptoms subscore including scores for cough, phlegm, chest tightness, and dyspnoea ranged from 0 to 20 points.

Secondary outcomes were self-reported urgent care visits during the study (see supplementary material, including the statistical analysis plan). Other outcomes were the number of Covid-19 related symptoms at day 30 and any change in self-rated health up to day 30. At 30-day follow-up, individuals in the PEP group were asked the open question, "How do you describe the PEP flute effect?" Outcomes of drug treatment and clinical progression, including mortality for the entire study population, await access to register data from the Danish health authorities and will be reported later.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD assessment test (CAT™) scores [^1133wdZt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this work has shown that it is possible to relate CAT scores to scenarios descriptive of impaired health status in COPD. The CAT is a concise instrument for use in everyday clinical practice; the scenarios described here allow for a more complete understanding of what its scores reflect in terms of the effect of the disease on the patient's health. It is our hope that a more complete understanding of a COPD patient's health status may help clinicians optimise their management.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) scores [^116gVcYx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Methods compare CAT and SGRQ scores, showing a strong correlation in stable patients (r = 0.80), but a more effective approach to assess agreement between two instruments is using the Bland and Altman plot. This plot examines if both instruments behave similarly across their scaling ranges by plotting the differences in measurements against their means. Ideally, differences should be minimal across the scale with little to no correlation with the means. While the CAT scale ranges from 0 to 40, the SGRQ scale ranges from 0 to 100. Thus, for a Bland and Altman plot, the CAT score needs to be multiplied by 2.5 for direct comparability with SGRQ, resulting in the 'adjCAT'.

- **Rasch analysis**: Rasch methodology evaluates the Guttman scaling properties of a questionnaire's components. The scale assumes that for a given severity item, a patient is more likely to respond positively to less severe items and less likely to do so for more severe items, with a positive response indicating impairment or disability presence. Rasch modeling was employed in the CAT development, detailed elsewhere.

### Clinical phenotypes of COPD and their impact on quality of life: A cross-sectional study [^111KgBoe]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotype is a single or group of disease characteristics that describe differences between individuals based on clinically important factors such as symptoms, exacerbations, morbidity, and treatment responses. Many studies estimated the prevalence of various phenotypes, but very few studies looked into their quality of life. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of different COPD phenotypes and their disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

- **Materials and methods**: The prospective study, with a sample size of 136, was conducted between May 2021 and December 2022 in a tertiary teaching institute. Based on their clinical features, COPD patients were classified into four different clinical phenotypes, and their disease-specific quality of life was assessed using St. George Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD (SGRQ-c) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) questionnaires.

- **Results**: Among 136 COPD patients, the frequency of non-exacerbator (NE), exacerbator emphysema (EEM), exacerbator chronic bronchitis (ECB), and asthma COPD overlap (ACO) phenotypes was 79 (58.1%), 16 (11.8%), 31 (22.8%), and 10 (7.4%) respectively. Based on the SGRQ-c score, the ECB and EEM phenotypes had a significantly poorer quality of life (QoL) when compared with NE (P < 0.0001), and ACO (P = 0.011) phenotypes. Similarly, ECB and EEM phenotypes had significantly poorer QoL when compared to NE (P < 0.0001), and ACO (P = 0.015), based on the CAT score. ECB and EEM patients also had the worst scores in all individual CAT items and SGRQ-c components.

- **Conclusion**: NE was found to…

### Assessing health status in COPD. A head-to-head comparison between the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) [^112VXM3o]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Both CAT and CCQ have been suggested as tools to measure health status in daily clinical practice for COPD patients. However, there has not been a study comparing these two questionnaires in everyday practice. The study aimed to make a head-to-head comparison between these questionnaires (CAT and CCQ) to assist physicians in selecting the tool that best meets their needs, taking into consideration psychometric properties and patient preferences.

Scoring the CAT

The item reduction stage of CAT development used Rasch analysis to determine the eight items that formed the final questionnaire. This model confirmed that the CAT met the requirements for a unidimensional scale. As a result, a reliable score of overall health status could be calculated using the simple sum of the patient's responses to the items. In a questionnaire developed using Rasch modeling, the relationship between the questionnaire's score, calculated as the simple sum, and severity scored in logits forms a mathematically defined relationship. A conversion table allows CAT scores to be converted to logits or vice versa. An abbreviated version is shown in Table 1, and the full version is included in Additional File 1: Appendix 1.

- **Abbreviated conversion table from CAT score to logits**: An abbreviated version is shown in Table 1, and the full version is included in Additional File 1: Appendix 1.

Scoring the SGRQ

Scores for the SGRQ are calculated by applying empirically derived weights to the patients' responses to each item. This is an entirely different methodology from that used for scoring the CAT, and meant that a simple direct mapping exercise to relate CAT scores to SGRQ scores was not possible. However, a recent exercise to refine the SGRQ to produce the SGRQ-C used Rasch methodology. This process also provided estimates of the severity of each item calculated as logits, which made it possible to compare CAT scores and SGRQ items using the same metric. Most of the items in the SGRQ are dichotomous, so we used the logit for that item. About 15% of the items have multiple response categories, and in these cases, we used the logit for each category.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) scores [^114HQWBy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This analysis has used an objective scientific method to create clinical scenarios associated with different scores obtained with a new measure of impaired health status for COPD. Several factors made this possible:

1. Rasch-imputed mapping has been successfully used in other diseases to map measures between two instruments and develop scenarios corresponding to outcomes within an instrument.
2. CAT scores and SGRQ-C scores correlate well across the entire scaling range from very mild to very severe.
3. The CAT scores and SGRQ-C items could be expressed in the same units of measurement.
4. The SGRQ comprises sufficient items (some with multiple response options, each with its own calculated logit value) to permit relatively rich descriptions, so each CAT category was associated with 12 or more SGRQ-C items.
5. Rasch models are considered sample independent, permitting comparisons between different groups of patients.

This approach enabled us to provide scenarios that describe patients exhibiting CAT scores ranging from very mild to very severe. For example, patients who become breathless while walking up hills fall into the Low Impact CAT category, while those who become breathless while walking around the home fall into the Very High Impact category. These scenarios allow for a more rounded understanding of the effects of COPD associated with different CAT scores and a more ready appreciation of what the scores mean for the patient in terms of the effect of COPD on their lives.

### Assessing health status in COPD. A head-to-head comparison between the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) [^114AGxdg]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The Bland-Altman plots reveal a stable relationship between the SGRQ and the CAT, with a mean bias of 1.8 CAT units. The relationship between the SGRQ and CCQ shows that the adjusted CCQ scores are lower across the scaling range and increase with increasing health status impairment, with a mean bias of 0.6 CCQ units. The CAT-CCQ plot shows that with decreasing health status, CAT scores are higher than CCQ scores (see Figure 2). Figure 3 illustrates the Bland-Altman plots for the SGRQ domains — symptoms, activity, and impact — compared with the CCQ domains — symptoms, functional status, and mental status, respectively. Notably, the CAT does not have domain scores.

### Differences in classification of COPD group using COPD assessment test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores: a cross-sectional analyses [^112BW9eM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) classification often involves the use of the COPD assessment test (CAT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores. This research examines discrepancies in COPD group classifications when utilizing these assessment tools.

- **Abbreviations**: COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CAT: COPD assessment test; mMRC scores: Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores.

The study revealed significant differences in group classification between the two scoring systems, which could impact clinical decision-making and patient management within pulmonary medicine. It highlights the necessity for consistent and accurate assessment methods in diagnosing and classifying COPD.

### Cat score single item analysis in patients with COPD: Results from COSYCONET [^1167LxrE]. Respiratory medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is widely used for evaluating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed whether the CAT items provide additional information beyond the sum score regarding COPD characteristics, including emphysema. Patients of GOLD grades 1 to 4 from the COPD cohort COSYCONET (German COPD and Systemic Consequences - Comorbidities Network) with complete CAT data were included (n = 2270), of whom 493 had chest CT evaluated for the presence of emphysema. Comorbidities and lung function were assessed following standardized procedures.

Cross-sectional data analysis was based on multiple regression analysis of the single CAT items against a panel of comorbidities, lung function, or CT characteristics (qualitative score, 15th percentile of mean lung density), with age, BMI, and gender as covariates. This was supported by exploratory factor analysis.

Regarding the relationship to comorbidities and emphysema, there were marked differences between CAT items, especially items 1 and 2 versus 3 to 8. This grouping was essentially confirmed by factor analysis. Items 4 and 5, and to a lesser degree 1, 2, and 6, appeared to be informative regarding the presence of emphysema, whereas the total score was not or less informative. In relation to comorbidities, similar findings as for the total CAT score were noted for the modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC), which was also informative regarding emphysema.

Our findings suggest that the usefulness of the CAT can be increased if evaluated on the basis of single items, which may be indicative of specific clinical characteristics.

### Ice cold Eric — international collaborative effort on chronic obstructive lung disease: Exacerbation risk index cohorts — study protocol for an international COPD cohort study [^114dEM6d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

- **Questionnaires**:

- **COPD-specific health-related quality of life**: We will use the widely used and validated Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) in both Dutch and German versions. The 20 questions of the CRQ provide summary scores for four domains important to COPD patients: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function, and mastery. Patients answer each question on a seven-point scale to express the degree of disability, ranging from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). The total score and score per domain can be calculated using the mean value, which ranges from 1 to 7. We will use the self-administered version that takes 5–10 minutes to complete. A change of 0.5 in CRQ domain scores represents the minimal important difference.

- **Feeling thermometer**: The Feeling thermometer is a validated visual analogue scale presented as a thermometer with 100 marked intervals. The worst health state (dead = 0) and the best (perfect health = 100) are defined as anchors, facilitating comparisons between individuals and groups. We will ask patients to reflect in their score how they have felt in the last seven days.

- **Self-efficacy instrument**: Self-efficacy refers to the patient's confidence in their ability to manage their illness. It is associated with medication compliance and may be a prognostic factor. We will use a short, COPD-specific instrument to measure the patient's self-efficacy. This instrument contains 3 questions about the management of their illness, answered on a five-point scale from 1 (not confident) to 5 (very confident).

### The COPD assessment test: Can it discriminate across COPD subpopulations [^117A5giM]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a valid disease-specific questionnaire measuring health status. However, knowledge concerning its use regarding patient and disease characteristics remains limited. Our main objective was to assess the degree to which the CAT score varies and can discriminate between specific patient population groups.

- **Methods**: The Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) is a random-sampled, population-based, multicenter, prospective cohort that includes subjects with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] classifications 1 to 3). The CAT questionnaire was administered at three visits (baseline, 1.5 years, and 3 years). The CAT total score was determined for sex, age groups, smoking status, GOLD classification, exacerbations, and comorbidities.

- **Results**: A total of 716 subjects with COPD were included in the analysis. The majority of subjects (72.5%) were not previously diagnosed with COPD. The mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 61.1 ± 8.1%, with a mean FEV1% predicted of 82.3 ± 19.3%. The mean CAT scores were 5.8 ± 5.0, 9.6 ± 6.7, and 16.1 ± 10.0 for GOLD 1, 2, and 3+ classifications, respectively. Higher CAT scores were observed in women, smokers, ever-smokers, and subjects with a previous diagnosis of COPD. The CAT was also able to distinguish between subjects who experience exacerbations vs those who had no exacerbation.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that the CAT, originally designed for use in clinically symptomatic patients with COPD, can also be used in individuals with mild airflow obstruction.

### Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease 2011 symptom/risk assessment in α1-antitrypsin deficiency [^114UMXfj]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The new GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) strategy recommends using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale to assess symptoms in COPD against "risk", as assessed by spirometry or exacerbation frequency. We aimed to determine the concordance between CAT and the mMRC scale in assessing risk in patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and the CAT threshold for risk assessment at which similar proportions of patients are assigned into the risk categories.

- **Methods**: Distribution of 309 patients (protease inhibitor Z phenotype) in four GOLD categories (A, B, C, and D) was compared. Using CAT for symptoms, we compared patient distribution using scores between 10 and 15 to ascertain the CAT threshold at which the distribution of patients in each group is proportional.

- **Results**: Using CAT 10 and spirometry for risk assessment, 6.1% of patients were in group A (low symptoms/low risk), 39.2% in B (high symptoms/low risk), 2.3% in C (low symptoms/high risk), and 52.4% in D (high symptoms/high risk). Using the mMRC scale and spirometry for risk produced a significantly different distribution from that using CAT (P < .0001). Using CAT 13 as a symptom threshold and spirometry for risk resulted in a more proportional distribution of patients, which was similar using CAT and exacerbation history (P > .0001) and mMRC scale and spirometry and/or exacerbation history for risk (P > .0001).

### Assessing health status in COPD. A head-to-head comparison between the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) [^116Ni6MD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent disease in the general population. It has been estimated that it will be the fourth leading cause of death by the end of 2030. Apart from its high mortality, a main concern for physicians is that COPD strongly impairs health status and quality of life. Improving quality of life is an important goal in COPD management, highlighted as a future research need by the recent International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG) research needs statement.

Patients with COPD often develop symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, phlegm, chest tightness, exercise intolerance, sleep and mental disorders, as well as restriction of social activities. In everyday practice, COPD treatment and management guidance is largely based on spirometric assessment. Recently, GOLD guidelines proposed health status, dyspnea measurement, and number of exacerbations as key elements in addition to spirometry to manage and treat COPD. This is mainly because spirometry is only weakly associated with various health status questionnaires and does not give a real picture of COPD patients' well-being.

Numerous quality of life and/or health status questionnaire tools have been developed in an attempt to find an easy and reliable tool for everyday clinical practice. Although most COPD-specific health status questionnaires show similar basic content, there is heterogeneity in the amount and quality of the items addressed. The IPCRG has recently published a 'users guide to COPD wellness tools'.

### Determinants of CAT (COPD assessment test) scores in a population of patients with COPD in central and Eastern Europe: The POPE study [^115NdZyr]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The COPD assessment test (CAT) has been proposed to help guide therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is important to understand the distribution of scores in different COPD populations and their determinants.

- **Methods**: The POPE study is an international, observational cross-sectional study of COPD subjects in 11 Central and Eastern European countries aimed at characterizing COPD phenotypes. Here, we report the analysis of CAT scores with the objective of identifying their determinants, evaluating symptom load, and investigating the distribution of scores among the participating countries. Additionally, we investigated the discrepancies between the CAT and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores when used to classify patients according to the GOLD strategy.

- **Results**: The study included 3,452 patients (69.2% men, mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1% predicted) 52.5%). The mean CAT score was 17.5 (SD = 7.8), ranging from 15.1 in Hungary to 21.2 in Bulgaria. Multiple linear regression analysis showed six variables significantly associated with CAT scores: depression, number of previous exacerbations, 6-min walking distance, FEV1(%), mMRC, and country, which explained 47.2% of the variance of CAT. According to either CAT or mMRC, up to 23.9% of patients would be classified in different GOLD groups.

- **Conclusions**: The CAT score may be predicted by factors related to COPD severity, depression, and exercise capacity, with significant differences in the distribution of CAT scores in different countries. According to our results, CAT > 10 is not eq.

### Discriminative accuracy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening instruments in 3 low- and middle-income country settings [^111vYgVE]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Most of the global morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with significant economic effects.

To assess the discriminative accuracy of three instruments using questionnaires and peak expiratory flow (PEF) to screen for COPD in three LMIC settings, a cross-sectional analysis was conducted from January 2018 to March 2020. This study took place in semiurban Bhaktapur, Nepal; urban Lima, Peru; and rural Nakaseke, Uganda, using a random age- and sex-stratified sample of the population aged 40 years or older.

Three screening tools were evaluated. The COPD Assessment in Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk (CAPTURE) had a range of 0 to 6, with high risk indicated by a score of 5 or more, or a score between 2 and 5 with low PEF (< 250 L/min for females and < 350 L/min for males). The COPD in LMICs Assessment questionnaire (COLA-6) ranged from 0 to 5, with high risk indicated by a score of 4 or more. The Lung Function Questionnaire (LFQ) had a range of 0 to 25, with high risk indicated by a score of 18 or less. These instruments were assessed against a reference standard diagnosis of COPD using quality-assured postbronchodilator spirometry. CAPTURE and COLA-6 include a measure of PEF.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the discriminative accuracy of the tools in identifying COPD, measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) with 95% confidence intervals. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

### The COPD assessment test (CAT): Response to pulmonary rehabilitation. A multicentre, prospective study [^111qp5nn]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

The COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) assessment test (CAT) is a recently introduced, simple-to-use patient-completed quality of life instrument. It contains eight questions covering the impact of symptoms in COPD. However, it is not known how the CAT score performs in the context of clinical pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs or what the minimum clinically important difference is.

- **Methods**: The introduction of the CAT score as an outcome measure was prospectively studied by PR programs across London. It was used alongside other measures, including the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression score, the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score, and a range of different walking tests. Patients completed a 5-point anchor question used to assess overall response to PR, ranging from 'I feel much better' to 'I feel much worse'.
- **Results**: Data were available for 261 patients with COPD participating in seven programs: mean (SD) age 69.0 (9.0) years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 51.1 (18.7)% predicted, MRC score 3.2 (1.0). The mean change in CAT score after PR was 2.9 (5.6) points, improving by 3.8 (6.1) points in those scoring 'much better' (n = 162) and by 1.3 (4.5) in those who felt 'a little better' (n = 88) (p = 0.002). Only eight individuals reported no difference after PR, and three reported feeling 'a little worse', making comparison with these smaller groups not possible.

- **Conclusion**: The CAT score is simple to implement as an outcome measure for PR.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD assessment test (CAT™) scores [^111v8znG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We have recently described the development of a new simple health status questionnaire, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT™), which correlates very well with the SGRQ-C in stable COPD patients (r = 0.80) and in patients experiencing an exacerbation (r = 0.78). This paper describes the development of descriptive scenarios for the CAT based upon the content of the SGRQ-C.

'Mapping' the contents of SGRQ-C to the CAT was possible as the CAT was developed using Rasch methodology, while the development of the SGRQ-C involved retrospective Rasch analysis of the original SGRQ to identify items that could be removed. Consequently, it has been possible to convert both questionnaires' scores to a common unit of measurement that then allows direct comparison between CAT scores and SGRQ item severity scores, and subsequent mapping of SGRQ-C scenarios to the full spectrum of CAT scores.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^1131DeNm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A cutoff point of 1.4 in the Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Questionnaire (CCQ) demonstrated the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for identifying more symptomatic patients with an SGRQ score ≥ 25. The AUROC values were 0.605, 0.633, 0.681, 0.762, and 0.711 for the CCQ cutoff points of 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6, respectively (see Fig. 4).

- **Agreement with the SGRQ 25-based categorization**: The categorization based on the CCQ cutoff point of 1.4 showed the highest agreement with an SGRQ 25-based categorization. For a CCQ cutoff point of 0.7, the agreement rate was 75.61% with a κ value of 0.27. At a CCQ cutoff point of 1.0, the agreement rate was 76.42% with a κ value of 0.33. For a CCQ cutoff point of 1.4, the agreement rate was 82.11% with a κ value of 0.56 (see Table 2).

- **CART analysis**: Even after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), a CCQ score ≥ 1.4 was a good determinant of an SGRQ score ≥ 25 in the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, with a relative hazard risk of 1.23 (see Fig. 5).

Figure 4 illustrates the area under the receiver operating curve used to compare the concordance of the SGRQ according to different CCQ cutoff levels.

### Validation of the COPD assessment test (CAT) as an outcome measure in bronchiectasis [^115gBysh]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Objective assessment of symptoms in bronchiectasis is important for both research and clinical practice. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a short, simple assessment tool widely used in COPD. The items included in the CAT are not specific to COPD and also reflect the dominant symptoms of bronchiectasis. Therefore, we conducted a study to validate the CAT as an outcome measure in bronchiectasis.

- **Methods**: The CAT was administered to two cohorts of bronchiectasis patients along with other quality of life questionnaires. Patients underwent comprehensive clinical assessments. One cohort had repeated questionnaires collected before and after the treatment of acute exacerbations. We analyzed convergent validity, repeatability, and responsiveness of the score and calculated the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) using a combination of distribution and anchor-based methods.

- **Results**: In both cohorts, there were positive correlations between the CAT and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (r = 0.90, P < .0001 and r = 0.87, P < .0001). There was an inverse relationship between the CAT and Quality of Life - Bronchiectasis Respiratory Symptoms Scale (r = -0.75, P < .0001) and Leicester Cough Questionnaire score (r = -0.77, P < .0001). Patients with more severe disease, based on the bronchiectasis severity index, had significantly higher CAT scores. CAT also correlated with FEV1% predicted and 6-min walk distance (6MWD). CAT increased significantly at exacerbation and fell at recovery. The intraclass correlation coefficient for two measurements four weeks apart was significant.

### Characteristics of patients with increasing COPD assessment test scores within 3 years [^113TSMyi]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) is a subjective measure of quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of COPD patients with increasing CAT scores within 3 years.

- **Methods**: Keio University and its affiliate hospitals conducted an observational COPD cohort study over 3 years. St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and CAT were completed at baseline and annually thereafter. Patients who had at least 3 CAT scores were included (n = 315). The ΔCAT score/year and ΔSGRQ score/year were calculated by the slope between each of the measures and the date of measurement.

- **Results**: The median ΔCAT score/year was 0.4, and ΔCAT score/year was significantly correlated with ΔSGRQ total score/year. Using an annual cut-off CAT score of +2 points, patients who deteriorated (n = 79) were older, had lower %FEV1, and more severe emphysema on computed tomography scan at baseline than patients who did not deteriorate. The baseline value was not a determinant of subsequent changes in the CAT score. Longitudinal changes in the CAT score were positively correlated with those in the SGRQ score.

- **Conclusions**: Old age and severe COPD, not the CAT score at one time point, predicted worsening quality of life.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^112QMJUG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The CCQ demonstrated significant clinical value for assessing the health status of patients with COPD, showing a strong correlation with other questionnaires, including the SGRQ and the CAT, as well as lung function and exercise capacity. Although the gold standard tool for assessing the severity of symptoms in COPD patients is still debated, the CCQ threshold of 1.4 showed better agreement with the SGRQ threshold of 25, as suggested by GOLD.

### Clinical utility of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease knowledge questionnaire [^116SbSeN]. Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although typically symptomatic, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is undertreated compared to many asymptomatic conditions, such as hypertension. Unfortunately, many patients lack basic information about their major disease states, including COPD. The primary aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of the valid and reliable COPD Questionnaire (COPD-Q) in a sample of underserved patients diagnosed with COPD.

- **Methods**: This prospective, descriptive study enrolled COPD patients at a family medicine residency teaching clinic. Patients participated in a telephone survey assessing COPD knowledge, demographic data, and health literacy. Data related to COPD clinical outcomes were gathered through the electronic medical record.

- **Results**: The average total COPD-Q score was 7.6 plus or minus 2.1, out of a total possible score of 13. Total COPD-Q scores were significantly related to health literacy and educational attainment.

- **Conclusions**: The COPD-Q is a valid and reliable tool for assessing COPD knowledge in settings with patients who have limited health literacy. It is useful for identifying key knowledge deficits, enabling clinicians to offer focused and individualized patient education and counseling.

### Assessing health status in COPD. A head-to-head comparison between the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) [^1171Jor3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Our study is the first to assess the variation of all three questionnaires in BODE quartiles. The BODE-index is a grading system developed to predict mortality in COPD. We found significant variations in health status across each BODE quartile. Surprisingly, patients in the 3rd BODE quartile reported worse health status, as assessed with all questionnaires — CAT, CCQ, and SGRQ — than patients in the 4th quartile. This may be because patients adjust their lifestyles as the disease progresses, leading to fewer activities that provoke dyspnea compared to patients with less severe disease. Further studies with appropriate designs could better answer this important question.

SGRQ and CCQ total scores showed good correlation (rho = 0.769; see Table 2), strongly indicating convergent validity. The CAT score showed a slightly weaker correlation with SGRQ (rho = 0.646), which is lower than the results reported in the study by Jones et al. This discrepancy in the correlation between SGRQ and CAT could be due to the differences in the COPD populations studied, including variations in severity, gender, and nationality. The CCQ total score and CAT score also have a strong correlation (rho = 0.644; p < 0.01), supporting the notion that they measure the same construct. However, further studies, including those set in different clinical settings, are needed to confirm the precise magnitude of the correlation of CAT with older quality of life instruments such as the CCQ and the SGRQ.

CAT is a one-dimensional questionnaire and has an easy calculation algorithm. In contrast, CCQ has more similarities with SGRQ.

### Clinical application of a simple questionnaire for the differentiation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1136BGRg]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases characterized by airflow limitation. Both diseases have a distinct pathogenesis and require unique treatment approaches. Due to some common characteristic traits, asthma and COPD are often lumped together in clinical practice. We sought to develop a simple questionnaire for the distinction of asthma and COPD.

- **Methods**: Clinical discriminants of asthma and COPD were retrospectively identified by multiple logistic regression using files from 547 consecutive adult patients presenting to a pulmonary specialist practice with a diagnosis of asthma or COPD. With these features, we generated a simple quantitative questionnaire supporting a diagnosis of COPD with high scores and asthma with low scores (range 0–15 points). Questionnaire results were compared with a physician's diagnosis based on GINA and GOLD guidelines, including skin tests, spirometry, and reversibility data.

- **Results**: 210 patients had COPD and 337 had asthma. Age of onset, smoking history, atopy status, and cough quality were significantly associated with a diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Questionnaire scores for COPD patients were higher than those for asthmatics (mean score 10.5 ± 0.18 vs. 4 ± 0.12, P < 0.0001). Receiver operational characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed a cutoff score of 7 with the highest discriminant power (87.6% sensitivity, 87.2% specificity for COPD, 87.4% correctly classified, area under the ROC curve: 0.954). The overlap between asthma and COPD (score 6–8) comprised about 20% of the total population.

### Scoring system and clinical application of COPD diagnostic questionnaires [^113SBjJQ]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

In most primary care settings, spirometric screening of all patients at risk is not practical. In prior work, we developed questionnaires to help identify COPD in two risk groups: (1) persons with a positive smoking history but no history of obstructive lung disease (case finding), and (2) patients with prior evidence of obstructive lung disease (differential diagnosis). For these questionnaires, we now present a scoring system for use in primary care.

- **Methods**: Scores for individual questions were based on the regression coefficients from logistic regression models using a spirometry-based diagnosis of obstruction as the reference outcome. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine performance characteristics for each questionnaire. Several simplified scoring systems were developed and tested.

- **Results**: For both scenarios, we created a scoring system with two cut points intended to place subjects within one of three zones: persons with a high likelihood of having obstruction (high predictive value of a positive test result); persons with a low likelihood of obstruction (high predictive value of a negative test result); and an intermediate zone. Using these scoring systems, we achieved sensitivities of 54 to 82%, specificities of 58 to 88%, positive predictive values of 30 to 78%, and negative predictive values of 71 to 93%.

- **Conclusions**: These questionnaires can be used to help identify persons likely to have COPD among specific risk groups. The use of a simplified scoring system makes these tools beneficial in the primary care setting.

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD assessment test (CAT™) scores [^112EDnef]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) is a new short health status measure intended for routine use. New questionnaires require reference points, so that users can understand the scores; descriptive scenarios are one way of achieving this. A novel method of creating scenarios is described.

- **Methods**: A Bland and Altman plot showed a consistent relationship between CAT scores and scores obtained with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C), permitting a direct mapping process between CAT and SGRQ items. The severity associated with each CAT item was calculated using a probabilistic model and expressed in logits (log odds of a patient of a given severity affirming that item 50% of the time). Severity estimates for SGRQ-C items in logits were also available, allowing direct comparisons with CAT items. CAT scores were categorized into Low, Medium, High, and Very High Impact. SGRQ items of corresponding severity were used to create scenarios associated with each category.

- **Results**: Each CAT category was associated with a scenario comprising 12 to 16 SGRQ-C items. A severity 'ladder' associating CAT scores with exemplar health status effects was also created. Items associated with 'Low' and 'Medium' Impact appeared to be subjectively quite severe in terms of their effect on daily life.

- **Conclusions**: These scenarios provide users of the CAT with a good sense of the health impact associated with different scores. More generally, they offer a surprising insight into the severity of the effects of COPD, even in patients with apparently mild-to-moderate health status impact.

### Assessing health status in COPD. A head-to-head comparison between the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) [^112U2rZC]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 18 (SPSS Inc, IL, USA). Data are expressed as median (interquartile range) unless otherwise stated. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test for normally distributed continuous data and the Chi-square test for not normally distributed continuous data and categorical data. The normality of the data was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. The CCQ and CAT internal consistency was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficient.

Discriminant validity of the CAT and CCQ was determined with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test in COPD GOLD stages I-IV; we subsequently used the Mann–Whitney U test to compare specific groups. Test-retest reliability was assessed by calculating the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Convergent and divergent validity were examined using Spearman's rank correlations. The responsiveness of both the CAT and CCQ was determined using the Wilcoxon U test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the CAT and CCQ, the smallest calculated change in score that is perceived as relevant, was assessed by using the GRC and the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM).

In order to calculate the SEM of the CAT, CCQ, and SGRQ questionnaires, we used the formula SEM = σₓ√(1 − rₓₓ), where σₓ represents the standard deviation of the questionnaire at baseline, and rₓₓ is the reliability/Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of the questionnaire.

Bland and Altman graphs were made to assess the agreement between questionnaires.

### Identifying abnormal exertional breathlessness in COPD: Comparing modified medical research council and COPD assessment test with cardiopulmonary exercise testing [^114KGtz9]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

In people with mostly mild to moderate COPD, the mMRC and CAT questionnaires were shown to have low concordance with CPET to identify abnormally high exertional breathlessness. An mMRC score of ≥ 2 had high specificity and may be useful for screening but identified only 17% of the patients who showed abnormally high breathlessness on CPET. Standardized exercise testing may be useful to improve symptom assessment and management in COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second five-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of the severity of airflow limitation.

The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of:

- **Symptoms** and severity of airflow limitation.
- **History of exacerbations** and the presence of comorbidities.

The first three points can be used to evaluate the level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, splitting patients with COPD into four categories: A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and there is a separate section in the document addressing the management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant stakeholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines.

### Reliability and validity of the clinical COPD questionnaire and chronic respiratory questionnaire [^115F4ihJ]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Questionnaires are often used in assessing health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is important that these questionnaires have good reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare these properties in the disease-specific Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire self-reported (CRQ-SR).

- **Methods**: Two hundred ninety-six participants with spirometry-confirmed mild to moderate COPD were included in a smoking cessation trial. It was assumed that health-related quality of life would improve in participants who stopped smoking. The questionnaires were administered at baseline and at weeks 5, 26, and 52 after the target quit date.

- **Results**: At baseline, 292 (97%) participants returned the CCQ and 296 (100%) the CRQ-SR questionnaire. For both instruments, the internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha > 70%) as was the convergent validity with each other, but not with spirometry. The CCQ was responsive to improvements in respiratory symptoms at both week 26 (-1.02, SD = 0.81) and week 52 (-1.04, SD = 0.91) and in the total score at week 26 (-0.54, SD = 0.50) and week 52 (-0.43, SD = 0.44). The mastery domain and the total score of the CRQ-SR were responsive at week 26 (1.14, SD = 0.82; 0.67, SD = 0.97 respectively) but not at week 52 (0.04, SD = 0.93; 0.38, SD = 0.57 respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Both the CCQ and CRQ-SR are equally reliable and valid. The long-term responsiveness of the CCQ is better. Both questionnaires can be used in future research.

### GOLD 2011 disease severity classification in COPDGene: A prospective cohort study [^113Xttvi]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The 2011 GOLD (Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [COPD]) consensus report uses symptoms, exacerbation history, and forced expiratory volume (FEV1)% to categorize patients according to disease severity and guide treatment. We aimed to assess both the influence of symptom instrument choice on patient category assignment and prospective exacerbation risk by category.

- **Methods**: Patients were recruited from 21 centers in the United States as part of the COPDGene study. Eligible patients were aged 45–80 years, had smoked for 10 pack-years or more, and had an FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7. Categories were defined with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale (score 0–1 vs. ≥ 2) and the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; ≥ 25 vs. < 25 as a surrogate for the COPD Assessment Test [CAT] ≥ 10 vs. < 10) in addition to COPD exacerbations in the previous year (< 2 vs. ≥ 2), and lung function (FEV1% predicted ≥ 50 vs. < 50). Statistical comparisons were done with k-sample permutation tests. This study cohort is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00608764.

- **Findings**: A total of 4,484 patients with COPD were included in this analysis. Category assignment using the mMRC scale versus SGRQ was similar but not identical. On the basis of the mMRC scale, 1,507 (33.6%) patients were assigned to category A, 919 (20.5%) to category B, 355 (7.9%) to category C, and 1,703 (38.0%) to category D. On the basis of the SGRQ, 1,317 (29.4%) patients were assigned to category A, 1,109 (24.7%) to category B, 221 (4.9%) to category C, and…

### Creating scenarios of the impact of COPD and their relationship to COPD assessment test (CAT™) scores [^117GzFNL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Results

- **CAT categories within a COPD population**: Full details of these patients have been published elsewhere. In brief, their mean age was 66 years, 32% were female, and their mean FEV1 was 58% predicted. In Figure 1, the CAT severity categories are superimposed upon a cumulative frequency distribution of CAT scores in 1503 patients recruited from Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA. The proportion of scores was 18% Low Impact, 43% Medium Impact, 28% High Impact, and 11% Very High Impact.

- **Correlation with SGRQ**: SGRQ and CAT scores were obtained in the same patients. The Bland and Altman plot in Figure 3 showed a very stable relationship across the scaling range, although there was a very small positive correlation (r = 0.16, p = 0.005). At the mild end of the CAT scale, the score slightly over-estimated severity by a small amount (SGRQ = 0, adjCAT = 5, equivalent to 2 CAT units), and at the severe end, it slightly under-estimated severity (SGRQ = 100, adjCAT = 92.5, equivalent to 37 CAT units). This level of agreement was sufficient to permit direct mapping between SGRQ and CAT for the purpose of creating these scenarios.

Figure 3: The Bland and Altman plot of SGRQ and adjCAT scores shows CAT scores converted to 0 to 100% (adjCAT) to match SGRQ scores. The X-axis is the mean of the SGRQ and adjCAT scores; the Y-axis is the SGRQ-adjCAT score. The correlation for a linear regression was r = 0.16, p = 0.005. The plot also shows the limits of agreement between CAT and SGRQ; 31% of the score differences are less than 5 points.

### Characteristics of a COPD population categorised using the GOLD framework by health status and exacerbations [^115xXwan]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

GOLD proposed a COPD assessment framework focused on symptoms measured by the COPD Assessment Test™ (CAT) or the mMRC and on exacerbation risk based on poor lung function (FEV1 < 50%) or a history of ≥ 2 exacerbations in the previous year. This analysis examined the characteristics of COPD patients recruited from routine clinical settings and classified using the GOLD framework. A total of 1041 European COPD patients (38.5% from primary care) from the Adelphi Respiratory Disease Specific Programme, with information on CAT, mMRC, spirometry, and exacerbation history in the previous year, were analyzed. Their mean age was 64.9 ± 9.9 years, and the mean FEV1 was 62.5 ± 17.8% predicted; 80% were in GOLD 2 spirometric grade or milder.

CAT and mMRC cut points identified different groups of patients. Using CAT, the composition was: Group A 9.3%, Group B 48.5%, Group C 0.7%, and Group D 41.5%. 80% of patients were classified as high risk based on exacerbation history, and 25% of patients in a low-risk category (GOLD A and B) had 1 exacerbation in the previous year. The incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia increased with worsening GOLD group (all p < 0.0001): diabetes GOLD A 4%, GOLD B 16%, GOLD D 29%; hypertension GOLD A 38%, GOLD B 55%, GOLD D 65%; hyperlipidemia GOLD A 13%, GOLD B 30%, GOLD D 37%.

In patients seen in routine clinical settings, 25% of GOLD low-risk patients had one exacerbation per year, and the incidence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased with worsening GOLD group.

### Psychometric evaluation of the COPD assessment test: Data from the BREATHE study in the Middle East and North Africa region [^115FT9Af]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the validity and performance of the Arabic and Turkish versions of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) for evaluating the severity and impact of COPD symptoms. The data were obtained from the BREATHE study in the Middle East and North Africa region, a large general population survey of COPD conducted in ten countries of the region (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates) using a standardized methodology. A total of 62,086 subjects were screened, of whom a random sample of 5,681 subjects were administered the CAT by telephone. A total of 5,639 evaluable questionnaires were recovered, representing a completion rate of 99%. In addition, the CAT was administered to an additional 833 subjects fulfilling the epidemiological diagnostic criteria for COPD.

- **Mean scores**: In the general population, mean scores were 6.99 ± 6.91 for the Arabic version and 9.88 ± 9.04 for the Turkish version. In patients with COPD, mean scores were 16.2 ± 9.1 and 20.9 ± 10.2, respectively. Scores were consistently higher in smokers than in non-smokers.

- **COPD criteria and scores**: In the general population, the proportion of respondents fulfilling criteria for COPD rose with higher CAT scores, particularly above the 80th percentile, where 63% of COPD cases were found. This suggests that the CAT may be useful as a case-finding tool in the general population.

- **Healthcare resource consumption**: In the COPD population, healthcare resource consumption rose linearly with CAT scores above a threshold score of twenty, supporting the good criterion validity of the CAT.

### The COPD assessment test: What do we know so far? A systematic review and meta-analysis about clinical outcomes prediction and classification of patients into GOLD stages [^113QmGSE]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was developed as a simple instrument to assess health status in patients with COPD. This study aimed to systematically review the determinants of the CAT score, its ability to predict clinical outcomes, and the agreement between CAT (≥ 10) and the modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC ≥ 2) to categorize patients into the new Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification system.

- **Methods**: From January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2015, databases were searched for studies using CAT in adults with COPD and in general populations aiming to detect COPD. Two investigators independently screened, selected, and extracted data by using a standardized form. Where appropriate, the results were combined in a random effects meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Of 453 studies, 17 were included, and eight were used in the meta-analysis. The models to predict the CAT score were able to explain less than 50% of its variance. CAT scores can indicate risk of exacerbation, depression, acute deterioration in health status, and mortality. All studies found a different proportion of patients in each Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease category using CAT ≥ 10 or mMRC ≥ 2. On average, the distribution was 13% different according to the instrument used. The κ agreement between CAT and mMRC ranged from 0.13 to 0.77.

- **Conclusions**: CAT may be used as a complementary tool in a patient's clinical assessment to predict COPD exacerbation, health status deterioration, depression, and mortality. The interpretation of this meta-analysis does no…

### CAD-Q (COPD-asthma differentiation questionnaire): Performance of a new diagnostic score to differentiate between COPD and asthma in adults [^116ZCPir]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The results obtained from the CAD-Q questionnaire demonstrate a good capacity to discriminate between patients with COPD and asthma in our study population; its overall performance is superior compared to previously validated questionnaires for identifying COPD. These results encourage more research and refinement of available diagnostic tools and more robust studies to validate and expand our findings in diverse clinical contexts.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^1169TpSn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

An adequate threshold for the Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Questionnaire (CCQ) defining more symptomatic COPD patients has not been determined. We aimed to determine the efficacy of the CCQ and the appropriate CCQ threshold for more symptomatic COPD patients.

- **Methods**: COPD patients aged > 40 years who smoked or had smoked ≥ 10 packs/year were prospectively enrolled over 1 year from three South Korean hospitals (n = 126). Correlations between the CCQ and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), the modified Medical Round Council (mMRC) scale, lung function, and exercise capacity were evaluated. "More symptomatic patients" were those with an SGRQ score ≥ 25. Area under the receiver operating curve and classification and regression tree analyses were performed to determine the CCQ threshold equivalent to an SGRQ score ≥ 25.

- **Results**: The CCQ significantly correlated with the SGRQ, CAT, and mMRC scale (r = 0.76, 0.69, and 0.53, respectively). A CCQ cutoff of 1.4 predicted an SGRQ score of 25 better than others. A CCQ score of 1.4 was a significant determinant of an SGRQ score ≥ 25 even after adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Conclusions**: The CCQ was correlated with other symptom indicators, lung function, and exercise capacity. A CCQ cutoff of 1.4 agreed better than CCQ cutoff of 1.0, suggested by guidelines, and this cutoff value may identify more symptomatic COPD patients well.

### Smoking cessation can improve quality of life among COPD patients: Validation of the clinical COPD questionnaire into Greek [^117TAPnt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major public health problem that affects the quality of life of patients; however, smoking cessation may ameliorate the functional effects of COPD and alter patient quality of life. The aim of this study was to validate the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) into Greek and, with that, to evaluate the quality of life in patients with different stages of COPD, as well as to assess their quality of life before and after smoking cessation.

- **Results**: The internal validity of the questionnaire was high (Cronbach's α = 0.92). The reliability of equivalent types in 16 stabilized patients was also high (ICC = 0.99). In general, the domains within the CCQ were strongly correlated with each other, while each domain separately was strongly correlated with the overall CCQ score (r² = 0.953, r² = 0.915, and r² = 0.842 regarding the functional, symptomatic, and mental domains, respectively). The CCQ scores were also correlated with FEV1 (r² = -0.252, p < 0.001) and FEV1/FVC (r² = -0.135, p < 0.001), as well as with the quality of life questionnaire SF-12 (r² = -0.384, p < 0.001). Smoking cessation also led to a significant reduction in CCQ score and increase in the SF-12 score.

- **Conclusions**: The self-administered CCQ indicates satisfactory validity, reliability, and responsiveness, and may be used in clinical practice to assess patient quality of life. Moreover, the CCQ indicated the health-related quality of life gains attributable to smoking cessation among COPD patients, projecting smoking cessation as a key target in COPD management.

### Differences in classification of COPD group using COPD assessment test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores: a cross-sectional analyses [^114SoF32]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Symptoms were quantified with both the mMRC and the CAT. The mMRC scale, ranging from 0 to 4, was developed by the American Thoracic Society as a modification of the originally proposed British Medical Research Council dyspnea index (scale 1–5). The CAT consists of 8 items, and each item is scored from 0 to 5. An overall score is calculated by adding the score from each item, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 40. We determined the distribution of COPD patients with both the mMRC and the CAT. According to the GOLD 2011 classification, patients were stratified with either the mMRC score (0–1 vs. ≥ 2) or CAT score (< 10 or ≥ 10), resulting in two low-symptom categories (A and C) and two high-symptom categories (B and D).

Exacerbation risk was assessed with either FEV1% predicted (< 50% or ≥ 50%) or COPD exacerbation history (0–1 vs. ≥ 2) in the previous year to stratify patients into low-risk groups (A and B) versus high-risk groups (C and D). An exacerbation was defined as an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication. The number of exacerbations in the previous year was taken from patients' history at the same time when mMRC and CAT scores were measured. Patients underwent standardized spirometry before and after the inhalation of 10 mg of salbutamol by nebulizer. Finally, patients with COPD were categorized into A, B, C, and D by combining symptom assessment using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores and exacerbation risk.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^1136hu2F]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Descriptive data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or number (%) unless otherwise specified. To evaluate the correlation between questionnaires (CCQ vs. SGRQ, CCQ vs. CAT, and CCQ vs. mMRC) and between CCQ and lung function indexes (FEV1% and 6-min walk distance), Pearson correlation analyses were used. The degree of agreement between two indexes is expressed as the correlation coefficient, r, where a positive value indicates positive correlation; the higher the value, the stronger the correlation.

Several CCQ cutoff scores were used based on an SGRQ score of 25 and a CAT score of 10, to indicate more symptomatic patients according to guidelines. A CCQ score equivalent to an SGRQ score of 20 was also applied, which is considered better than suggesting an SGRQ score of 25 for a CAT score of 10. To determine which CCQ cutoff score was most equivalent to an SGRQ score of 25, an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis was performed.

- **Decision tree analysis**: A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, a type of decision tree methodology for identifying mutually exclusive subgroups of at-risk persons who share common characteristics related to particular health-related behavior, was performed.
- **Agreement analysis**: The Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated to compare the degree of agreement between the CCQ cutoff points and an SGRQ score of 25.

All analyses were two-sided and performed at a significance level of 0.05 unless otherwise noted. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using STATA.

### Differential effect of modified Medical Research Council dyspnea, COPD Assessment Test, and Clinical COPD Questionnaire for symptoms evaluation within the new GOLD staging and mortality in COPD [^117Jfns6]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) have been interchangeably proposed by GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) for assessing symptoms in patients with COPD. However, there are no data on the prognostic value of these tools in terms of mortality. We endeavored to evaluate the prognostic value of the CAT and CCQ scores and compare them with mMRC dyspnea.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the ability of these tests to predict mortality in an observational cohort of 768 patients with COPD (82% men; FEV1, 60%) from the COPD History Assessment in Spain (CHAIN) study, a multicenter observational Spanish cohort, who were monitored annually for a mean follow-up time of 38 months.

- **Results**: Subjects who died (n = 73; 9.5%) had higher CAT (14 vs 11, P = 0.022), CCQ (1.6 vs 1.3, P = 0.033), and mMRC dyspnea scores (2 vs 1, P < .001) compared with survivors. The CAT score ≥ 2.5 provided similar sensitivity to mMRC dyspnea scores ≥ 2 for predicting all-cause mortality.

- **Conclusions**: The CAT and the CCQ have similar ability for predicting all-cause mortality in patients with COPD, but were inferior to mMRC dyspnea scores. We suggest new thresholds for CAT and CCQ scores based on mortality risk that could be useful for the new GOLD grading classification.

### Differences in classification of COPD group using COPD assessment test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores: a cross-sectional analyses [^114hfcAu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The GOLD 2011 document proposed a new classification system for COPD, combining symptom assessment by COPD assessment test (CAT) or modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores and exacerbation risk. We postulated that the classification of COPD would differ depending on the symptom scale used: CAT versus mMRC.

- **Methods**: Outpatients with COPD were enrolled from January to June 2012. The patients were categorized into groups A, B, C, and D according to the GOLD 2011 standards; categorization occurred twice, once with the mMRC score and once with the CAT score for symptom assessment, respectively. Additionally, correlations between mMRC scores and each item of CAT scores were analyzed.

- **Results**: Classification of 257 patients using the CAT score versus mMRC scale was as follows: using the CAT score, 60 patients (23.3%) were assigned to group A, 55 (21.4%) to group B, 21 (8.2%) to group C, and 121 (47.1%) to group D. On the basis of the mMRC scale, 97 patients (37.7%) were assigned to group A, 18 (7.0%) to group B, 62 (24.1%) to group C, and 80 (31.1%) to group D. The kappa of agreement for the GOLD groups classified by CAT and mMRC was 0.510. The mMRC score displayed a wide range of correlation with each CAT item, ranging from r = 0.290 for the sputum item to r = 0.731 for the dyspnea item, with a p-value < 0.001.

- **Conclusions**: The classification of COPD produced by the mMRC or CAT score was not identical. Care should be taken when stratifying COPD patients with one symptom scale versus another according to the GOLD 2011 document.

### The CAT (COPD assessment test) questionnaire as a predictor of the evolution of severe COPD exacerbations [^116nJf5a]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly impact disease progression and generate high health expenditures, necessitating tools to evaluate their prognosis.

- **Method**: A multicenter, observational, prospective study was conducted to evaluate the prognostic utility of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) in severe exacerbations of COPD. Anthropometric and clinical variables were analyzed, including smoking, history of exacerbations during the previous year, drug treatment, degree of baseline dyspnea, and comorbidities. Laboratory variables at admission, such as complete blood count, arterial blood gas, and biochemistry, were also considered. CAT scores were evaluated within 24 hours of admission, on the third day, at discharge, and three months post-discharge.

- **Results**: We evaluated 106 patients (91 males) with a mean age of 71.1 years (SD 9.8 years), mean FEV1 of 45.2% (14.7%), and an average CAT score at admission of 24.7 points (SD 7.1). At three months after discharge, treatment failure was observed in 39 patients (36.8%): 14 patients (13.2%) presented an exacerbation without the need for hospital admission, 22 (20.8%) were readmitted, and 3 (2.8%) died during follow-up. The three factors associated with an increased risk of failure were a reduction of less than 4 units in the CAT score at discharge compared to admission, lower hemoglobin levels, and treatment with domiciliary oxygen.

- **Conclusions**: A change of ≤ 4 points in the CAT score at discharge, compared to that obtained at admission due to a severe exacerbation of COPD, helps to predict therapeutic failure such as a new exacerbation, readmission, or death.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^116FTwoJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment instruments are crucial in determining patient outcomes, particularly in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The SGRQ total score ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the worst quality of life, and its minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is 4 units. The CAT total score, on the other hand, ranges from 0 to 40, with 2.0 units suggested as its MCID value. The modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire has a total score ranging from 0 to 4; a score of 4 signifies the most severe dyspnea. An mMRC score of ≥ 2 is used as a cutoff to differentiate patients with less dyspnea from those with more dyspnea. The 6-minute walk test, performed to measure exercise capacity, follows the American Thoracic Society guidelines and has an MCID value of 30 meters.

The CCQ consists of 10 questions distributed across three domains: symptom, functional state, and mental state. These are assessed on a seven-point scale from 0 to 6, representing the best (asymptomatic and no limitation) and the worst conditions (extremely symptomatic and limited), respectively. The CCQ total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 10 questions and dividing by the number of items. The Korean version of the CCQ was utilized in the present study.

### Assessing health-related quality of life in COPD: Comparing generic and disease-specific instruments with focus on comorbidities [^113sSMZG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) influences different aspects of a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQL). While disease-specific HRQL instruments focus on symptoms and functional impairments, generic instruments provide a broader view on health. This study compares the generic EQ-5D-3L and two disease-specific questionnaires — St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ-C) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) — across a comprehensive spectrum of COPD disease grades. Particular attention was given to comorbidities, and the study assessed the discriminative abilities of these instruments.

- **Methods**: Using data from the baseline visit of the German COPD cohort COSYCONET, mean HRQL scores in different COPD grades were compared by linear regression models. These models adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking status, BMI, and the low vs. high number of comorbidities, or a list of several self-reported comorbid conditions. Discriminative abilities of HRQL instruments to differentiate between COPD grades were assessed by standardized mean differences.

- **Results**: In 2,291 subjects in COPD GOLD grades 1–4, the EQ-5D-3L utility, EQ-5D VAS, SGRQ, and CAT were found to discriminate between COPD grades, with some limitations for the EQ-5D utility in mild disease. Both generic and disease-specific HRQL instruments reflected the burden of comorbid conditions. The SGRQ demonstrated the best discrimination between COPD grades and was less influenced by comorbidities, whereas EQ-5D utility placed a higher weight on comorbid conditions. For all instruments, psychiatric disorders and peripheral artery disease showed significant impact.

### The cutoff point of clinical chronic obstructive pulmonary disease questionnaire for more symptomatic patients [^112MPqXd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

An adequate threshold for the Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Questionnaire (CCQ) defining more symptomatic COPD patients has not been determined. We aimed to determine the efficacy of the CCQ and the appropriate CCQ threshold for more symptomatic COPD patients.

- **Methods**: COPD patients aged > 40 years, who smoked or had smoked ≥ 10 packs/year, were prospectively enrolled over 1 year from three South Korean hospitals (n = 126). Correlations between the CCQ and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale, lung function, and exercise capacity were evaluated. "More symptomatic patients" were those with an SGRQ score ≥ 25. Area under the receiver operating curve and classification and regression tree analyses were performed to determine the CCQ threshold equivalent to an SGRQ score ≥ 25.

- **Results**: The CCQ significantly correlated with the SGRQ, CAT, and mMRC scale (r = 0.76, 0.69, and 0.53, respectively). A CCQ cutoff of 1.4 predicted an SGRQ score of 25 better than others. A CCQ score of 1.4 was a significant determinant of an SGRQ score ≥ 25, even after adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Conclusions**: The CCQ was correlated with other symptom indicators, lung function, and exercise capacity. A CCQ cutoff of 1.4 agreed better than the CCQ cutoff of 1.0 suggested by guidelines, and this cutoff value may identify more symptomatic COPD patients well.

### Minimum clinically important difference for the COPD assessment test: A prospective analysis [^114CVX33]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is responsive to change in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) has not been established. We aimed to identify the MCID for the CAT using anchor-based and distribution-based methods.

- **Methods**: We conducted three studies at two centres in London (UK) between April 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Study 1 assessed CAT scores before and after 8 weeks of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD who were able to walk 5 m and had no contraindication to exercise. Study 2 assessed change in CAT scores at discharge and after 3 months in patients admitted to hospital for more than 24 hours for acute exacerbation of COPD. Study 3 assessed change in CAT scores at baseline and at 12 months in stable outpatients with COPD. We focused on identifying the minimum clinically important improvement in CAT score. The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) were measured concurrently as anchors. We used receiver operating characteristic curves, linear regression, and distribution-based methods (half SD, SE of measurement) to estimate the MCID for the CAT. We included only patients with paired CAT scores in the analysis.

- **Findings**: In Study 1, 565 of 675 patients (84%) had paired CAT scores. The mean change in CAT score with pulmonary rehabilitation was -2.5 (95% CI -3.0 to -1.9), which correlated significantly with change in SGRQ score (r = 0.32; p < 0.0001) and CRQ score (r = -0.46; p < 0.0001). In Study 2, 200 patients were recruited.
