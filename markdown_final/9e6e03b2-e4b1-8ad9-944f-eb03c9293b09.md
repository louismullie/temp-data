## Question

Skin asthma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "skin asthma" means and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "skin asthma" is a standard medical term or a lay misnomer. Then, I should verify the most likely intended condition, which is atopic dermatitis, and clarify its relationship to asthma. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for the atopic march, including epidemiology, genetics, and mechanisms. After that, I should review clinical implications for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, including shared therapies and guideline-based care. Finally, I will consider exceptions and related entities so I don't miss alternative diagnoses or bidirectional relationships.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating terms. "Skin asthma" is not a standard medical diagnosis; the correct term is atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease frequently associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis in the so-called atopic march, whereas asthma is a respiratory disease with variable airflow limitation and airway inflammation, not a skin condition [^115m9iKZ] [^112xPhoQ].

> Wait, let me verify the intended condition and its link to asthma. Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease globally, characterized by pruritic, eczematous lesions and a relapsing course, and it commonly coexists with asthma and allergic rhinitis due to shared type 2 inflammatory pathways and genetic susceptibility, including filaggrin mutations that impair the skin barrier and facilitate percutaneous sensitization [^115m9iKZ] [^115pMgin] [^116kkwaN].

> I will now examine the epidemiologic evidence for the atopic march, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating causality. Multiple high-quality sources indicate that children with atopic dermatitis have an increased risk of subsequent asthma, with pooled relative risks around 2.16 and higher risk in persistent or severe AD, and large cohort data show approximately a 2-fold increased asthma risk in children with AD and a 38% increased risk in adults with AD, supporting a robust association even if not every child follows the classic sequence [^113UjELC] [^117Ekx8A] [^1144Ycdy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I need to check mechanistic and genetic data. Filaggrin loss-of-function mutations increase AD risk and, importantly, increase asthma risk only in the presence of AD, supporting a causal pathway whereby skin barrier dysfunction permits epicutaneous sensitization and systemic type 2 priming that manifests later as asthma; experimental models and human data implicate thymic stromal lymphopoietin and IL-1β in cutaneous sensitization and subsequent airway disease, reinforcing a mechanistic link rather than mere co-occurrence [^116kkwaN] [^114riVRm] [^115A24oY].

> Next, I should review clinical implications for diagnosis and screening. Because of the elevated asthma risk, clinicians should proactively ask patients with AD about respiratory symptoms, wheeze, cough, and exercise intolerance, and consider spirometry or referral when indicated; conversely, patients with asthma should be asked about pruritic rashes and sleep disturbance suggestive of AD, aligning with GINA's emphasis on recognizing atopy in asthma evaluation and AAD guidance on AD comorbidities [^112xPhoQ] [^1144Ycdy] [^117TeQV9].

> I need to ensure I address prevention and early intervention. Early aggressive control of AD with barrier repair and anti-inflammatory therapy may reduce the risk of sensitization and downstream atopic disease; while definitive prevention trials are ongoing, guidelines support early emollients, trigger avoidance, and stepwise topical therapy, and they caution against routine systemic corticosteroids for AD due to limited benefit and potential harms, favoring targeted anti-inflammatory strategies instead [^115Bc9ot] [^116wwvUA] [^113ApyEb].

> Let me consider therapeutic overlap, because this affects real-world management. Type 2–targeted biologics such as dupilumab are effective for both moderate-to-severe AD and for allergic asthma, and pediatric guidance supports biologics like omalizumab and dupilumab for severe allergic asthma in eligible ages; this dual efficacy supports a coordinated dermatology–pulmonology approach in patients with overlapping disease, though clinicians should monitor for rare adverse effects and follow label precautions when initiating or adjusting therapy [^115LH3D7] [^1117ZmNV] [^114QToY7].

> But wait, what if the "skin asthma" phrase reflects a different entity entirely? I should review alternatives. Psoriasis has a bidirectional association with asthma and can be confused colloquially with "skin asthma", and mastocytosis can present with cutaneous lesions and respiratory symptoms; however, the pathophysiology and treatments differ, so careful history, exam, and, when needed, biopsy or genetic testing help distinguish these from atopic dermatitis and asthma comorbidity [^113KsdLx] [^115A9cSx].

> I should confirm that I am not overgeneralizing the atopic march. Contemporary evidence emphasizes heterogeneity: not all children with AD progress to asthma, some have reverse or nonsequential patterns, and shared genetics and environment contribute to co-occurrence; thus, counseling should be individualized, acknowledging elevated risk without implying inevitability, and focusing on early recognition and control of both skin and airway disease [^117SdEVe] [^114GRRMi] [^115sqtZT].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: "skin asthma" is a misnomer for atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that shares type 2 inflammatory pathways with asthma and carries a substantially increased risk of subsequent asthma, particularly when AD is early-onset, persistent, or severe; clinicians should screen for respiratory symptoms in AD and for dermatologic symptoms in asthma, optimize barrier-directed and anti-inflammatory therapy, and consider shared biologic options in appropriate patients to mitigate the atopic march and improve outcomes [^115m9iKZ] [^113UjELC] [^112xPhoQ] [^115LH3D7].

"Skin asthma" is a misnomer for **atopic dermatitis (eczema)** [^115m9iKZ], a chronic inflammatory skin disease linked to asthma via the atopic march [^114GRRMi]. About 20–30% of children with eczema develop asthma [^113Vcdyi], with risk rising with severe or persistent eczema [^113UjELC] and filaggrin mutations [^116kkwaN]. Shared type 2 inflammation [^111g5ur6] and skin barrier dysfunction [^115pMgin] drive this progression. Management focuses on **skin barrier repair** [^115Bc9ot], topical anti-inflammatories [^116wwvUA], and trigger avoidance [^115Bc9ot]; biologics like dupilumab [^114QToY7] can benefit both eczema and asthma [^115vKrGp]. Early, coordinated care reduces asthma risk and improves outcomes [^115pMgin].

---

## Pathophysiological connection between skin asthma and asthma

- **Shared inflammatory pathways**: Both eczema and asthma feature type 2 inflammation (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IgE) [^111g5ur6], linking skin and airway disease [^116Xr9ES].

- **Skin barrier dysfunction**: Filaggrin mutations and barrier defects allow allergen sensitization [^116kkwaN], promoting systemic allergy and asthma [^114riVRm].

- **Atopic march**: Eczema often precedes asthma in childhood, with ~20–30% of eczema patients developing asthma [^1117wJuH] [^113UjELC].

---

## Clinical evidence linking skin asthma to asthma

- **Epidemiological studies**: Children with eczema have a 2–3-fold higher asthma risk [^117Ekx8A]; severe or persistent eczema carries the highest risk [^113UjELC].

- **Genetic studies**: Filaggrin mutations increase eczema risk and asthma only when eczema is present, supporting a causal pathway [^116kkwaN] [^114EhZW3].

- **Longitudinal cohorts**: Early eczema predicts later asthma, even after adjusting for shared genetics and environment [^117SdEVe] [^114t53fE].

---

## Risk factors and triggers

| **Risk factors** | **Triggers** |
|-|-|
| - Severe or persistent eczema [^113UjELC] | - Allergens (dust mites, pollen, pet dander) [^114riVRm] |
| - Early-onset eczema [^111Tm2sS] | - Irritants (soaps, detergents, fragrances) [^notfound] |
| - Filaggrin mutations [^116kkwaN] | - Stress, temperature changes, infections [^notfound] |
| - Family history of atopy [^112gDRso] | - Environmental pollutants [^114nrWov] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Early identification**: Screen children with eczema for asthma symptoms (wheeze, cough, exercise intolerance) [^112xPhoQ].

- **Coordinated care**: Dermatology and pulmonology collaboration improves outcomes [^notfound].

- **Skin-focused management**: Emollients, topical corticosteroids [^116wwvUA], and calcineurin inhibitors control eczema and may reduce asthma risk [^115pMgin].

- **Systemic therapies**: Biologics (e.g. dupilumab) [^114QToY7] target type 2 inflammation and benefit both eczema and asthma [^115vKrGp].

- **Patient education**: Teach trigger avoidance, adherence, and recognition of early asthma symptoms [^115Bc9ot].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

- **Skin barrier repair**: Regular emollients and gentle skin care reduce eczema severity and may lower asthma risk [^115pMgin].

- **Allergen avoidance**: Minimize exposure to identified allergens and irritants [^115Bc9ot].

- **Environmental controls**: Use HEPA filters, maintain humidity, and reduce indoor pollutants [^notfound].

- **Stress management**: Stress reduction may lessen flares and improve control [^notfound].

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions include **precision medicine** efforts to identify biomarkers and phenotypes that predict asthma development in eczema [^113iNMch] [^116ZT2a3]. Early-life interventions targeting the skin barrier and type 2 inflammation are being studied to prevent the atopic march [^115pMgin] [^114riVRm]. Long-term studies are clarifying the durability of biologic effects and their impact on asthma outcomes [^notfound].

---

"Skin asthma" reflects the **eczema–asthma axis** driven by shared type 2 inflammation and barrier dysfunction [^111g5ur6] [^115pMgin]. Early, proactive management of eczema — especially when severe or persistent — can reduce asthma risk and improve quality of life [^113UjELC] [^117Ekx8A]. Coordinated, guideline-based care and targeted therapies are essential to interrupt the atopic march [^114QToY7] [^112xPhoQ].

### Association between psoriasis and asthma: a systematic review and bidirectional meta-analysis [^113KsdLx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the evidence in support of a bidirectional relationship between psoriasis and asthma is substantial. The risk of psoriasis in asthma and the risk of asthma in psoriasis are both significant, as shown in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, patients with asthma should pay attention to the timely identification of psoriatic lesions because, according to the research available at the moment, there are similarities between the two pathogenic mechanisms. Nevertheless, more evidence is still required to support the recommendation that psoriasis patients with respiratory symptoms be tested for asthma.

### Atopic dermatitis and asthma: parallels in the evolution of treatment [^1146KpSj]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review epidemiologic correlations between asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD), identify common features in disease pathophysiology, and review steps involved in the development of asthma therapy guidelines to assess the appropriateness of a similar process and approach for AD.

Methods

A 7-member panel representing specialists in dermatology, allergy, asthma, immunology, and pediatrics from around the United States convened to review the current literature and evolving data on AD. Participants presented reviews to the panel on the epidemiology of asthma and AD, the genetic predisposition to allergic disease, the current understanding of the immunopathophysiology of AD, interrelationships between the pathologic pathways of asthma and AD, evolving treatment concepts and options in AD, and the applicability of the asthma treatment model and how it may be adapted for guideline development for AD. Commentary and criticism were recorded for use in document preparation.

Results

There are clear epidemiologic parallels in asthma and AD. Importantly, AD frequently is the first manifestation of an atopic diathesis, which occurs in genetically predisposed individuals and also includes asthma and allergic rhinitis. Up to 80% of children with AD will eventually develop allergic rhinitis or asthma later in childhood. This classic "atopic triad" has numerous pathophysiologic elements in common, including cyclic nucleotide regulatory abnormalities, immune cell alterations, and inflammatory mediators and allergic triggers. New therapeutic options that target underlying immune mechanisms are available, and their place among treatments for AD is becoming established. Guidelines of care have been developed for asthma. The panel noted that the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines for diagnosis and management of asthma, first issued in 1991, had a tremendous positive impact on many aspects of asthma treatment. It not only created a heightened awareness that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation, but it also provided unified approaches for therapy and opened new areas of basic science and clinical research. In addition, the guidelines spurred interactions among physicians of various specialties and stimulated a great quantity of research in asthma therapy. It is anticipated that AD therapy guidelines would have similar positive outcomes.

Conclusions

The panel concluded that, on the basis of current information and evolving therapeutic options, a clear rationale exists to support AD guideline development. The many parallels between AD and asthma suggest that processes and approaches used for the asthma therapy guidelines would be appropriate for AD.

### Does eczema lead to asthma? [^116kKsod]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

The nature of the relationship between eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis has been controversial. It has been commonly held that these disorders, while sharing genetic and environmental risk factors, are unrelated disorders that may develop sequentially along an atopic pathway. Conversely, the link between eczema and these later-onset respiratory disorders may be causal. This review examines the relationship between eczema, asthma, and allergic rhinitis in the context of the atopic march, the skin barrier, and recent developments in eczema genetics; and we propose that the relationship is causal. We describe a plausible biological pathway with eczema as the first step in a progressive atopic march that over time leads to asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. Such a pathway has implications for our understanding of these disorders and steps that might be made to prevent the development of asthma in particular. We propose that intervention studies in eczema should be conducted to confirm or refute this causal relationship. Such studies may materially improve the quality of life of eczema patients and will have important public health benefits if the interventions lead to a reduction in the burden of asthma.

### Current updates in the epidemiology and comorbidities of atopic dermatitis [^1172BRqW]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that affects individuals across the lifespan, with significant implications for both public health and individual well-being. This paper provides an overview of the epidemiology of AD, focusing on its prevalence, incidence, and risk factors across different populations and regions. We evaluate the growing global burden of AD, highlighting trends in both high-income and low- to middle-income countries, and the impact of socioeconomic, environmental, and genetic factors on disease manifestation. The review also explores the variations in disease severity, age of onset, and comorbidities such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. This paper emphasizes the need for more robust epidemiologic studies to further elucidate the complex interactions between genetic predisposition and environmental exposures in the development and progression of AD and explores the potential role of technology (eg, artificial intelligence) in helping to collect robust epidemiologic data. Understanding the epidemiology of AD is crucial for identifying high-risk groups, informing preventive strategies, and optimizing management approaches.

### How epidemiology has challenged 3 prevailing concepts about atopic dermatitis [^1137q1Vt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

We challenge 3 prevailing concepts in understanding atopic dermatitis using data from epidemiologic studies. First, we show that although atopy is associated with atopic dermatitis to some degree, its importance is not likely to be a simple cause-and-effect relationship, especially at a population level. Our epidemiologic data do not exclude a contributory role for IgE-mediated immunologic processes, especially in those with existing and severe disease. Second, evidence is presented that does not support a straightforward inverse relationship between infections and atopic dermatitis risk. A link, if present, is likely to be more complex, depending critically on the timing and type of infectious exposure. Third, recent evidence suggests that the risk of subsequent childhood asthma is not increased in children with early atopic dermatitis who are not also early wheezers, suggesting a co-manifestation of phenotypes rather than a progressive atopic march. Collectively, these observations underline the importance of epidemiologic studies conducted at a population level to gain a more balanced understanding of the enigma of atopic dermatitis.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^1144Ycdy]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Atopic and allergic conditions — association with asthma in adults with atopic dermatitis (AD) is described as well established, with a pooled prevalence of asthma in adults with AD of 24.8% (95% CI, 22.2%-27.5%); adults with AD are 3 times as likely to have asthma compared with the general population, and greater AD severity is linked to higher relative risk in a cross-sectional population-based survey, where severe AD defined by Patient Oriented Eczema Measure scores had a relative risk of 2.38 (95% CI, 1.91–2.85), with moderate AD showing risk ratio [RR], 1.94; 95% CI, 1.66–2.21 and mild AD RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.12–1.56; the concept of the "atopic march" as an explanation is stated to be unproven.

### From atopic dermatitis to asthma: the atopic March [^111EbawT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the mechanisms whereby allergen exposure through the epidermis could initiate systemic allergy and predispose individuals to the development of 1 or more atopic diseases via the so-called atopic march.

Data Sources

PubMed databases from 1950 to the present were searched for relevant articles pertaining to epidemiologic and genetic evidence of the progression of the atopic march.

Study Selection

Articles concerning pathophysiologic conditions that link atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma were examined.

Results

The data suggest that a sequence of atopic manifestations occurs, typically atopic dermatitis in infancy followed by allergic rhinitis and/or asthma in later stages. Reduced filaggrin expression is implicated as a major predisposing factor for atopy in multiple lines of evidence, including genome-wide analysis and microarray investigations. Other gene products have an important role. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies provide preliminary epidemiologic support for the sequential development of allergic diseases.

Conclusion

The mechanisms by which allergen exposure through the epidermis can initiate systemic allergy and predispose individuals to atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma have become clearer in recent years. Longitudinal studies of individuals carrying loss-of-function filaggrin gene mutations are needed to further define the risks associated with epidermal barrier dysfunction and potentially identify specific targets for barrier repair and prevention of atopic dermatitis and other atopic disease. The effects of preventive and treatment strategies have been inconsistent across studies, and further research is warranted before any definitive recommendations can be made.

### Skin exposure and asthma: is there a connection? [^112zTwHQ]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Numerous occupational and environmental exposures that increase asthma risk have been identified. Research and prevention have focused primarily on the respiratory tract. However, recent studies suggest that the skin may also be an important route of exposure and site of sensitization that contributes to asthma development. Factors that impair skin barrier function, such as filaggrin gene mutations or skin trauma, may facilitate allergen entry and promote Th2-like sensitization and subsequent asthma. Animal studies demonstrate that skin exposure to chemical and protein allergens is highly effective at inducing sensitization, with subsequent inhalation challenge eliciting asthmatic responses. A similar role for human skin exposure to certain sensitizing agents, such as isocyanates, is likely. Skin exposure methodologies are being developed to incorporate skin exposure assessment into epidemiology studies investigating asthma risk factors.

### From itchy skin to wheezing: potential biomarkers and targeted drugs for atopic dermatitis and asthma in children [^116ZT2a3]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic asthma (AA) are interconnected allergic diseases that frequently co-occur in early childhood, representing a critical sequence in the "atopic march". The rising global prevalence of these conditions, driven by environmental factors and epigenetic changes, underscores an urgent clinical need to understand their shared pathogenesis and disrupt disease progression. Evidence implicates multifaceted mechanisms in AD-to-AA progression, including skin barrier dysfunction, type 2 inflammation, microbiome dysbiosis, and systemic immune priming. These pathways not only elucidate the disease continuum but also offer actionable biomarkers for early prediction and targeted interventions. This review synthesizes the epidemiology, mechanistic insights, and translational implications of AD-to-AA progression, advocating for a paradigm shift toward early-risk stratification and precision medicine. By bridging mechanistic discoveries with clinical practice, we aim to guide optimized management and primary prevention, ultimately reducing the global allergy burden.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma — longitudinal context and persistence: Among patients with atopic multimorbidity, "AD does not usually precede other atopic comorbidities", suggesting that "shared genetic factors and environmental exposures beyond barrier disruption are important". "The association between AD and asthma may have implications for clinical practice", and in one cohort "having asthma by age 7 or 13 years was associated with a more persistent AD phenotype". Therapies effective for both severe AD and asthma, such as dupilumab, "have the potential to benefit patients with both conditions".

### Comorbidities of atopic dermatitis-what does the evidence say? [^117CFLB6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common disease that is associated with atopic and nonatopic comorbidities. There has been a growing interest in this area of AD, because presence or risk of comorbidities can in many ways impact the management of patients with AD. Thus, some treatments for AD may improve its comorbidities as well, whereas others may increase their risk. In this review article, we discuss various comorbidities of AD mostly on the basis of the results of recent multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses to update readers about this rapidly developing area of dermatology. We emphasize the important information provided by studies presenting both relative risk and absolute risk, and show that AD is associated with, among others, atopic comorbidities such as asthma, rhinitis, and food allergy, nonatopic comorbidities such as ocular, psychiatric, infectious, endocrine, autoimmune, and cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. Clinicians need to be aware of these and be cognizant about positive and negative effects of existing and new treatments for AD.

### Phenotypes of atopic dermatitis and development of allergic diseases [^115sqtZT]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense pruritus and eczematous lesions that substantially impair quality of life. The pathogenesis of AD includes genetic factors and environmental exposures, and impaired epidermal barrier is a key feature leading to inflammatory responses and AD. AD is most common in childhood, impacting 20% of children globally. Approximately 60% of those with AD develop it in the first year of life, and incidence has increased over the last few decades, particularly in nonendemic countries.

Although AD is most commonly seen in young children, the onset and resolution of the disease also varies widely. AD phenotypes have been identified based on the natural history of the disease and associations with other allergic diseases. However, how AD phenotypes vary across diverse populations is not well understood.

AD is associated with the development of comorbidities such as food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. For example, approximately 20% of children with mild AD and 60% of children with severe AD go on to develop asthma. Longitudinal observational studies, indicate that some children have an atopic march, referring to the progression from atopic dermatitis to food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. However, only a subset of children with AD develop these comorbidities.

We aim to understand and characterize the different AD phenotypic patterns among children participating in the Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW), a consortium of 12 US birth cohorts. The study goals were to identify personal characteristics and early life exposures associated with the development of disease and examine risk across AD phenotypes for developing other allergic diseases.

### Meta-analysis identifies seven susceptibility loci involved in the atopic March [^1117wJuH]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The atopic or allergic march describes the sequential progression of different allergic conditions frequently observed in children with IgE-antibody responses against common environmental allergens (atopy). Generally, eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the first clinical manifestation of the atopic march followed by asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. About 20–30% of infants with eczema undergo this unfavourable disease course, which is associated with severe and persistent allergic disease manifestations.

In recent years, the concept of the atopic march has received increasing attention. Multiple progression patterns have been discussed as allergic conditions may manifest in different orders. A breakthrough in the understanding of the atopic march was the discovery of the filaggrin loss-of-function mutations that provided genetic evidence linking skin barrier deficiency to eczema and subsequent asthma development.

We aimed to identify the genetic factors underlying the atopic march in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used the most common phenotype representing the atopic march, which is eczema followed by asthma. In the discovery phase, six GWASs were included and another six populations were used for replication. Our meta-analysis identifies seven susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance of which two are associated with allergic disease for the first time. In addition, we find an overrepresentation of eczema loci among the atopic march loci. Deciphering the molecular determinants of the atopic march may point to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or at least arrest the atopic march.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^111Qv1et]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) — skin tone–inclusive inflammation assessment and implications for care are described: The guideline states we define erythema to include transient skin alterations characteristic of active AD inflammation, including erythema, shades of brown, violaceous, or gray appearances. Postinflammatory dyspigmentation (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) may persist for months to years and be important to patients. Principles of AD care remain similar for all skin types, and the relevance of these findings to informing treatment selection is not clear and, so far, multiple agents display no differential treatment response across these groups.

### Early eczema and the risk of childhood asthma: a prospective, population-based study [^1136FMgm]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The atopic march is a term used to describe the relationship between allergy-related diseases, starting with food allergy and eczema in early childhood, and the subsequent development of asthma and rhino-conjunctivitis. An association between eczema and asthma in childhood has been documented in several studies, and severe eczema is associated with an increased tendency to produce immunoglobulin E (IgE) and developing asthma. The nature of the relationship between eczema and asthma has, however, been debated. Although these diseases share some genetic and environmental risk factors, it has been argued that eczema and asthma are unrelated and that the progression of eczema to asthma is due to the co-manifestation of eczema and wheezing early in life. On the other hand, plausible biological pathways have been described, with eczema as the first step in a progressive atopic march leading to asthma and/or rhino-conjunctivitis. It has also been argued that the atopic march is restricted to males only. A defective skin barrier due to mutations in the gene encoding profilaggrin/filaggrin (FLG) is associated with increased trans-epidermal water-loss, dry skin, itching and eczema. Studies on FLG mutations have not, however, found any association with FLG mutations and asthma/rhino-conjunctivitis in children who did not have eczema.

These findings suggest different phenotypes for both asthma and eczema.

Because previous studies have been based primarily on cross-sectional data, high-risk or hospitalised patients, population-based studies with prospective designs are warranted. The aim of the present study was to prospectively investigate the association between a history of eczema at 2 years of age and current asthma at 6 years of age in a general population. We also aimed to determine the prevalence of allergy-related diseases at 6 years of age according to eczema status at 2 years of age.

### Type 2 immunity-driven diseases: towards a multidisciplinary approach [^111g5ur6]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

2 TYPE 2 INFLAMMATION: WHERE DOES IT FIT?

2.1 From phenotypes to endotypes

AD, AR, CRSwNP or CRSsNP and asthma have a broad definition, which highlights their heterogeneity. AR requires the demonstration of a causal link between atopy, allergen sensitization and allergen‐driven nasal symptoms. Conversely, CRS, a frequent upper airway condition (11% of the adult population), is defined by evidence of rhinosinusitis on computed tomography (CT) and/or by nasofibroscopy along with chronic nasal symptoms (≥ 12 weeks). The same observation can be made with asthma, which is determined by respiratory symptoms related to variable airflow limitation in a variable bronchial inflammation setting. AD is clinically defined by chronic or relapsing eczematous skin lesions associated with pruritus. To reduce heterogeneity and help decipher the critical physiopathological pathways involved, clinical studies of such diseases have been performed to identify homogeneous phenotypic groups (Table 1).

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^117TeQV9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Definition and scope — atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults is described as a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease with a relapsing course that often coexists with allergic rhinitis and asthma, and it is characterized as burdensome with increased patient- and population-level impact due to associated comorbidities; longstanding associations with atopic/allergic conditions and more recent links with autoimmune, metabolic, cardiovascular, and mental health conditions are noted, and this section reviews potential comorbidities of AD in adults and whether associations vary by AD severity.

### External exposome and allergic respiratory and skin diseases [^114nrWov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Allergies are complex diseases that result from interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors. However, the increase in allergies observed in the past decades is explained exclusively by environmental changes occurring in the same period. Presently, the exposome, the totality of specific and nonspecific external environmental exposures (external exposome) to which a subject is exposed from preconception onward and their consequences at the organ and cell levels (internal exposome), is being considered to explain the inception, development, and exacerbations of allergic diseases. Among the best-studied environmental factors of the specific external exposome, indoor and outdoor aeroallergens and air pollutants play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of the inflammatory response to allergens and in clinical manifestations of allergic disease. Climate change, urbanization, and loss of biodiversity affect sources, emissions, and concentrations of main aeroallergens and air pollutants and are among the most critical challenges facing the health and quality of life of the still increasing number of allergic patients today and in the coming decades. Thunderstorm-related asthma is a dramatic example of the effects of combined environmental factors and an in vivo model for understanding the mechanisms at work in respiratory allergy. Environment- or lifestyle-driven aberrancies in the gut and skin microbiome composition represent key mediators of allergic diseases. A better knowledge of the effect of the external exposome on allergy development is crucial for urging patients, health professionals, and policymakers to take actions to mitigate the effect of environmental changes and to adapt to them.

The primary outcome was ICS reduction. After 28 weeks of omalizumab therapy, the ICS dose was reduced, as tolerated, and the percentage of patients in whom ICS reduction occurred was 100% with omalizumab versus 66. 7% of the placebo group patients. Fewer participants had asthma exacerbations during the steroid reduction phase in the omalizumab group versus placebo. 7 Participants were randomly assigned 2: 1 to receive omalizumab or placebo, and there was a 24-week, fixed inhaled-steroid phase followed by a 28-week, adjustable ICS steroid phase. From the baseline period to week 24, there was a 31% reduction in exacerbations in the omalizumab group versus placebo and a 43% reduction in exacerbations over the entire study time frame with omalizumab versus placebo.

8 Participants were randomly assigned to receive omalizumab or placebo, in addition to standard care during a 60-week treatment period. The mean age was approximately 11 years. The percentage of children with one or more exacerbation during the study period was 48. 8% with placebo and
30. 3% in the omalizumab group. In addition, seasonal analysis of exacerbations revealed that omalizumab reduced the spring and fall spikes in asthma exacerbations. The mean ICS dose in the omalizumab group was 663 μg per day versus 771 μg per day in the placebo group. This study underscored the efficacy of omalizumab in children from low-income families and people of color. All mepolizumab-treated groups also had reduced circulating blood eosinophils and sputum eosinophils. One post hoc analysis of the DREAM trial data also showed that treatment response was unaffected by season or atopy.

21 After the DREAM trial, there were 2 additional studies in which researchers evaluated the efficacy of mepolizumab in adults and adolescents. The Mepolizumab as Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Severe Asthma study, in which researchers enrolled 576 participants aged 12 to 82 years (only 25 patients in age range 12–17 years.

### Revisiting the atopic March current evidence [^114GRRMi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

On the basis of the study findings, the authors recommend that clinicians withhold advice to parents of children with eczema regarding the potential future risk of asthma. In an era of prioritizing precision prevention and management, it is perhaps hasty to dismiss the importance of risk communication in clinical settings. Understanding the likelihood of developing asthma or allergic rhinitis can benefit patients by increasing awareness and enabling timely diagnosis and management. An alternate approach could be to better define the characteristics that identify the 25% of children with "itchy rash" (defined as eczema) who are at risk.

We propose that the findings of the current study, taken together with previous studies, provide strong evidence for the validity of the atopic march, when this is interpreted to broadly describe the temporal associations between allergic phenotypes that may evolve along multiple pathways, incorporating the progression from sensitization to overt clinical allergic disease or from one allergic condition to others. In this wider context, the original description of atopic dermatitis preceding allergic airway disease represents the most observed pathway. We support an expanded interpretation of the atopic march that includes the various transitions in atopic conditions as it expedites the advancement of precision practice by offering an approach to early identification of patient subgroups at risk of marching toward other allergic conditions.

There is great potential to conduct in-depth investigations of multiple phenotypes of allergic disease using the rich birth cohort data sets as presented in the current manuscript with the aim of better understanding risk trajectories for the development of allergic diseases. Such information will benefit efforts toward personalized patient care and may facilitate the development of novel tailored strategies to arrest an individual's march toward further disease. Let's not "throw the atopic baby out with the bathwater" just yet.

### Phenotypes of atopic dermatitis and the risk for subsequent asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UjELC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Various atopic dermatitis (AD) phenotypes showed an enormously heterogenic risk for subsequent asthma development.

Objective

We aimed to investigate the association between AD phenotypes and the risk for progression to asthma.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for relevant publications. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% CI were calculated using the CMA-3.0 software. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019129273).

Results

We analyzed 39 publications with 458,810 participants. The RR for asthma in AD was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.88–2.48). The risk in persistent AD (RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 2.83–3.99) was higher than in transient AD (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34–1.73), and the risk in severe AD (RR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.96–2.94) was higher than in mild AD (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.03–3.23) or moderate AD (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30–1.75). The risk for asthma in early-onset AD was slightly higher than in late-onset AD and higher in boys than in girls.

Limitations

The AD and asthma definitions differed across the included studies.

Conclusion

Patients with persistent or severe AD were at a higher risk for developing asthma. These findings further elucidate the atopic march and identify target populations for asthma prevention.

### Atopic dermatitis and the atopic March [^1164E31p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), one of the most common skin disorders seen in infants and children, usually has its onset during the first 6 months of life. The prevalence of AD is similar in the United States, Europe, and Japan and is increasing, similar to that of other atopic disorders, particularly asthma. AD has been classified into 3 sequential phases: infantile, childhood, and adult, each with characteristic physical findings. AD has a tremendously negative effect on the quality of life of patients as well as family, most commonly disturbing sleep. The condition also creates a great financial burden for both the family and society. The cutaneous manifestations of atopy often represent the beginning of the atopic march. On the basis of several longitudinal studies, approximately half of AD patients will develop asthma, particularly with severe AD, and two thirds will develop allergic rhinitis. Epicutaneous sensitization has been thought to be responsible, with subsequent migration of sensitized T cells into the nose and airways, causing upper and lower airway disease. Animal models and human observation concur with this theory. Preliminary prevention studies with oral antihistamines provide evidence that early intervention might slow the atopic march.

### A genome-wide association study of atopic dermatitis identifies loci with overlapping effects on asthma and psoriasis [^112N5hvU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common dermatological disease of childhood. Many children with AD have asthma and AD shares regions of genetic linkage with psoriasis, another chronic inflammatory skin disease. We present here a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of childhood-onset AD in 1563 European cases with known asthma status and 4054 European controls. Using Illumina genotyping followed by imputation, we generated 268 034 consensus genotypes and in excess of 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for analysis. Association signals were assessed for replication in a second panel of 2286 European cases and 3160 European controls. Four loci achieved genome-wide significance for AD and replicated consistently across all cohorts. These included the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1, the genomic region proximal to LRRC32 on chromosome 11, the RAD50/IL13 locus on chromosome 5 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6; reflecting action of classical HLA alleles. We observed variation in the contribution towards co-morbid asthma for these regions of association. We further explored the genetic relationship between AD, asthma and psoriasis by examining previously identified susceptibility SNPs for these diseases. We found considerable overlap between AD and psoriasis together with variable coincidence between allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of AD incorporates immune and epidermal barrier defects with combinations of specific and overlapping effects at individual loci.

### Atopic dermatitis part 1: pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and associations [^116QEyYk]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), or eczema, is a common, chronic inflammatory skin condition resulting in recurrent flares of itch and rash. This review discusses current literature regarding epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and impact on quality of life with the goal of addressing common gaps in understanding. Onset is usually early in life, but it is not uncommon to persist into adulthood, despite a common assumption that children outgrow AD. The primary drivers of its pathophysiology are skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation, which are complex and interrelated. The etiology is influenced by genetic, microbial, immunological, and possibly environmental factors. A notable predictor of AD is a family history of atopic disease. Comorbidity with other atopic diseases including asthma and food allergies is common. Nonatopic comorbidities common in AD include autoimmune conditions and psychiatric diseases. Clinical manifestations include the almost universal feature of pruritus, which can be seen without rash. Rash can include classic dermatitis, but other morphologies including those more common in patients with skin of color should be recognized. Complications such as secondary infection are common, often related to the complex role Staphylococcus aureus plays in AD. Living with AD places a significant burden on the patient's quality of life including significant impacts on sleep. Assessment of severity includes assessing itch severity and impact on quality of life. Tools such as a numeric rating scale for itch severity may be useful in clinical practice.

### The immunogenetics of asthma and eczema: a new focus on the epithelium [^115CKXuf]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2004). Medium credibility.

Asthma and eczema (atopic dermatitis) are the most common chronic diseases of childhood. These diseases are characterized by the production of high levels of immunoglobulin E in response to common allergens. Their development depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Over the past few years, several genes and genetic loci that are associated with increased susceptibility to asthma and atopic dermatitis have been described. Many of these genes are expressed in the mucosa and epidermis, indicating that events at epithelial-cell surfaces might be driving disease processes. This review describes the mechanisms of innate epithelial immunity and the role of microbial factors in providing protection from disease development. Understanding events at the epithelial-cell surface might provide new insights for the development of new treatments for inflammatory epithelial disease.

### New biological treatments for asthma and skin allergies [^115vKrGp]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergies are typically endemic, complex and heterogeneous diseases with a high impact at quality of life. Mechanistically, type 2 immune responses involving eosinophil and basophil granulocytes, mast cells and humoral factors such as IgE are key drivers of allergic diseases. Fighting allergic diseases knows three strategies: prevention, symptomatic and causative therapy. While remarkable progress was made in understanding molecular events in allergies as a prerequisite for effective prevention and desensitization, this review article focuses on the most efficient symptomatic treatments-that is using more and more specific antibodies neutralizing particular immune pathways. We highlight and classify recent and upcoming developments in the three prototype chronic allergic diseases allergic asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria and atopic eczema. In all three examples, biologics such as dupilumab or omalizumab become reliable and efficient therapeutic options. Finally, we give an outlook how a diagnostic and therapeutic workflow might look like in the near future for these three major burdens of society.

### Cutaneous manifestations of ANCA-associated small vessels vasculitis [^112m6nBR]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are frequent manifestations of underlying systemic conditions, including systemic autoimmune vasculitis. In particular, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with distinct forms of vasculitis characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration of the walls of small and medium-sized vessels leading to vascular destruction and tissue necrosis. ANCA-associated vasculitis is rare and systemic diseases, which can be classified based on different distribution of vascular inflammation and presence or absence of granulomatosis and asthma. Despite their diversities, ANCA-associated vasculitis, namely microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, can all display a broad variety of cutaneous manifestations, which can appear during the course of the disease or even as first sign at the time of onset. Different skin manifestations might coexist in the same patient and occur in different occasions during the course of the vasculitis. Thus, a deep knowledge of the spectrum of skin lesions as part of ANCA-associated vasculitis is mandatory for a correct diagnostic process, whenever cutaneous vasculitis is suspected. Due to this broad variety of manifestations, the diagnosis of skin involvement in ANCA-associated vasculitis is very challenging and it must be supported by a detailed medical history, accurate physical examination, specific histopathological analysis of skin biopsy and the presence of ANCA serology. In this review, we focus on the cutaneous manifestations that can develop in the context of ANCA-associated vasculitis, detailing the clinical features, the histopathological aspects as well as the direct immunofluorescence studies for each of the three conditions. Moreover, we acknowledged the differential diagnoses that must be ruled out in the diagnostic process and the main therapeutic approaches available for treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

### Filaggrin loss-of-function mutations predispose to phenotypes involved in the atopic March [^114EhZW3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood eczema often precedes the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis in the so-called atopic march. Recently, 2 loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the epidermal barrier protein filaggrin were reported to be predisposing factors for eczema and concomitant asthma, suggesting a possible role in disease transition.

Objective

We aimed to assess the importance of filaggrin loss-of-function mutations in the susceptibility to eczema and associated clinical phenotypes.

Methods

The filaggrin mutations were genotyped and tested for association with allergic disorders in 2 large European populations including 1092 children with eczema.

Results

Highly significant association of the filaggrin null mutations with eczema and concomitant asthma was replicated. Moreover, we found that these mutations predispose to asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the presence of eczema. We show that the presence of 2 filaggrin null alleles is an independent risk factor for asthma in children with eczema, and that the 2 investigated mutations account for about 11% of eczema cases in the German population.

Conclusion

These results lend strong support to the role of filaggrin in the pathogenesis of eczema and in the subsequent progression along the atopic march. The fact that previous expression of eczema is a prerequisite for the manifestation of allergic airways disease and specific sensitization highlights the importance of the epidermal barrier in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

Clinical Implications

Our results suggest that the maintenance and repair of the epidermal barrier in infants with eczema may prevent the subsequent development of allergic airways disease.

### Predicting airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in patients with atopic dermatitis [^117JB7D2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder due to disrupted skin barrier, with the main form of pathophysiology being immune-mediated skin hyperreactivity. Similarly, asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways that is exacerbated by triggers penetrating the epithelial barrier, with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) as a key feature. AHR has previously been reported in patients with AD without a background asthmatic history, with an incidence between 36% and 72%. A systematic review reported the prevalence of asthma in patients with AD as being as high as 25.7% (95% CI = 23.7–27.7), whereas a large Canadian longitudinal cohort showed that allergic sensitization in children with AD can increase the relative risk of asthma by age 3 years with a relative risk of 7.04 (95% CI = 4.13–11.99). To better understand the predictive factors for AHR in individuals with AD, we measured severity of AD, skin lesions, blood biomarkers, lung function, sputum eosinophil counts, and AHR in adult patients with AD and no history of asthma.

### Revisiting the atopic March current evidence [^117SdEVe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The concept of the atopic march was originally proposed to describe the typical sequence of progression of childhood allergic disorders, with atopic dermatitis predating the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Data from cohort studies conducted over the past 2 decades has greatly improved our understanding of the natural history of allergic diseases, and there is now a large body of evidence revealing that applying a strict interpretation of the atopic march as initially described does not accurately reflect the wide heterogeneity of the natural history across diverse patient populations. For example, allergic conditions may not necessarily evolve in the order as described, and the "march" of conditions may span across many decades, with asthma developing in adulthood, years after childhood atopic dermatitis. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the interrelationships between allergic conditions are causal or related to confounding by shared genetics and/or shared environment. There is convincing evidence that the allergic conditions share a common genetic origin, and there is also compelling data from twin and sibling studies that controlled for shared genetics and shared environment, which suggests the associations between conditions could be causal. Confirming the existence of causal relationships would have substantial implications in an era marked by soaring prevalence of allergic disease and asthma and few effective prevention strategies.

Interest in the atopic march has increased substantially in the past decade. On PubMed, journal publications related to the topic have increased from five articles between 1990 and 1999 to 45 articles annually between 2019 and 2021. Of note, the definition of "atopic march" applied by authors across these studies has varied widely, with some studies adhering to the narrow definition as originally described and others applying a broader interpretation to acknowledge the diversity of disease natural history that has been reported. Furthermore, authors have variably assumed a causal relationship between atopic dermatitis and later allergic airway disease. These inconsistencies have caused much confusion, with the same findings often being used to both support and reject the atopic march concept. For example, the observation that eczema and asthma may coexist in early childhood has been used to support the atopic march; conversely, the atopic march has been challenged based on the argument that where eczema and wheeze occur together in early life, it is wheeze rather than eczema that is associated with subsequent asthma. Nevertheless, some cohort studies have demonstrated persistence of the association between eczema and subsequent asthma even after excluding wheezers from the analysis.

### Genetic risk factors for the development of allergic disease identified by genome-wide association [^112kiPGy]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Different allergic diseases are related by overlapping aetiology, i.e. elevated IgE, therefore co-morbidity due to a genetic component is logical. However, other factors are important within the disease per se, e.g. non-IgE mechanisms in asthma. Initial allergic sensitisation occurs on exposure to an allergen breaching the epithelial barrier, due to disruption or dysfunction, which may have genetic and/or environmental causes (Fig. 1). Specifically, disruption of the epidermal barrier is considered to be the first step in the development of eczema. This cutaneous sensitisation might then become systemic and subsequently give rise to other allergies, such as AR; this phenomenon is referred to as 'atopic march' and contributes to co-morbidity of allergies.

Figure 1
Development of allergy. Both environmental and genetic factors influence barrier integrity and sensitisation to common environmental allergens. This can lead to a Th2-dominant environment, elevated IgE levels, and allergic phenotypes that affect a variety of organs.

In this review, we will provide an overview to the current status of the genetics of asthma, AD and AR including related allergic traits; serum IgE, sensitisation and blood eosinophil counts with a focus to Genome-Wide Association Studies.

### Meta-analysis of filaggrin polymorphisms in eczema and asthma: robust risk factors in atopic disease [^116kkwaN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The discovery of filaggrin (FLG) null mutations as a major risk factor for eczema represents a milestone toward the understanding of an important mechanism in this complex disease. However, published studies demonstrate differences concerning design and effect size, and conflicting results for asthma have been reported.

Objectives

We sought to provide a more accurate estimate of FLG effect sizes and to better refine FLG risk profiles within the broad and inclusive eczema diagnosis. We also sought to provide a more detailed and conclusive estimate of the risk for asthma associated with FLG null alleles.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of 24 studies on FLG mutations and eczema involving 5,791 cases, 26,454 control subjects, and 1,951 families as well as 17 studies on asthma involving 3,138 cases, 17,164 control subjects, and 1,511 offspring.

Results

Both case-control and family studies showed strong associations with eczema. Case-control studies were heterogeneous, whereas family studies yielded more homogeneous results. Combined analysis showed that FLG haploinsufficiency strongly increases the eczema risk (odds ratio [OR], 3.12; 95% CI, 2.57–3.79) and is associated with more severe and dermatologist-diagnosed disease. FLG mutations are also significantly associated with asthma (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.32–1.66). However, although strong effects for the compound phenotype asthma plus eczema (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.84–3.82) were observed, there appears to be no association with asthma in the absence of eczema.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis summarizes the strong evidence for a high eczema risk conferred by FLG mutations and refines their risk profiles, suggesting an association with more severe and secondary care disease. FLG mutations are also a robust risk factor for asthma and might help define the asthma endophenotype linked with eczema.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112xPhoQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma history and family history — Commencement of respiratory symptoms in childhood, a history of allergic rhinitis or eczema, or a family history of asthma or allergy increases the probability that symptoms are due to asthma, but these features are not specific for asthma and are not seen in all asthma phenotypes; patients with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis should be asked specifically about respiratory symptoms.

### The atopic march: what's the evidence? [^113UtHPx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and compile data from published studies that provide support for the existence of the atopic march.

Data Sources

Relevant articles and references found via a PubMed search using the following keywords: atopic march, allergic march, atopic dermatitis, eczema, atopic eczema, atopy, rhinitis, wheeze, bronchiolitis, and asthma.

Study Selection

All articles were reviewed and the most relevant were selected for inclusion in this review and for the compilation and graphical presentation of disease trends.

Results

Data on the prevalence of each phenotype of the atopic march confirm the temporal pattern of progression from eczema to allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, the atopic march as it is currently defined, is lacking precision, which affects its usefulness. Early events in the atopic march, such as eczema, may be more useful with more careful refinement of the phenotype into atopic and nonatopic eczema.

Conclusion

Evidence supports that the atopic march is a useful paradigm to describe the clinically observed progression of atopy in certain children. There may be more precise phenotypes of the early stages of the atopic march that may improve its utility in predicting the development of later atopic, comorbid chronic disease.

### Atopic dermatitis: the skin barrier and beyond [^115pMgin]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, affecting up to 20% of children and 10% of adults in industrialized countries. This highly debilitating condition poses a considerable burden to both the individual and society at large. The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis is complex, encompassing both genetic and environmental risk factors.

Methods

This is a narrative review based on a systematic literature search.

Conclusions

Dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity plays a key role; however, recent epidemiological, genetic and molecular research has focused interest on skin barrier dysfunction as a common precursor and pathological feature. Current understanding of the aetiology of atopic dermatitis highlights disruption of the epidermal barrier leading to increased permeability of the epidermis, pathological inflammation in the skin, and percutaneous sensitization to allergens. Thus, most novel treatment strategies seek to target specific aspects of the skin barrier or cutaneous inflammation. Several studies have also shown promise in preventing atopic dermatitis, such as the early use of emollients in high-risk infants. This may have broader implications in terms of halting the progression to atopic comorbidities including food allergy, hay fever and asthma.

Good practice statement — clinicians managing all severities of atopic dermatitis (AD) should, before issuing any new therapy, perform the following: ensure the correct diagnosis and identify complicating diagnoses; provide education, for instance an information guide about the disease and an action plan; address trigger avoidance; ensure proper medication use and adherence; and encourage application of a bland moisturizer titrated to symptomatic benefit (at least once, often multiple times, per day).

### Advances in asthma and allergy genetics in 2007 [^115dKexj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

This review discusses the main advances in the genetics of asthma and allergy published in the Journal in 2007. The association studies discussed herein addressed 3 main topics: the effect of the environment and gene-environment interactions on asthma/allergy susceptibility, the contribution of T(H)2 immunity gene variants to allergic inflammation, and the role of filaggrin mutations in atopic dermatitis and associated phenotypes. Other articles revealed novel, potentially important candidate genes or confirmed known ones. Collectively, the works published in 2007 reiterate that allergy and asthma are typical complex diseases; that is, they are disorders in which intricate interactions among environmental and genetic factors modify disease susceptibility by altering the fundamental structural and functional properties of target organs at critical developmental windows.

### A genome-wide association study of atopic dermatitis identifies loci with overlapping effects on asthma and psoriasis [^115WpV9x]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that may affect 20% of children and 3% of adults. Up to 60% of children with severe AD will develop asthma, and infantile AD is a strong predictor of subsequent asthma development. These observations are consistent with the genetic correlation of 0.35–0.55 found between these two strongly heritable diseases, and indicates some shared elements of aetiology.

Despite this apparent overlap, few genes implicated in AD have been confirmed to play a role in asthma. The positionally cloned and highly replicated FLG locus may contribute towards the pathogenesis of asthma, but only within the context of AD. FLG mutations have not been found to be a risk factor for asthma alone, suggesting that 'AD plus asthma' is a genetically distinct form of asthma or a specific endophenotype of AD. In contrast, far greater levels of genomic coincidence have been observed between AD and psoriasis, another common familial inflammatory skin disease. While not mutually exclusive, AD and psoriasis rarely co-exist. They share a number of similar features, particularly in the chronic phase of AD, including epidermal hyperplasia and altered terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, as well as a number of highly divergent features, such as the level of cornification and susceptibility towards recurrent bacterial, viral or fungal infections.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed the association between AD and the FLG locus and specified additional contributory loci at 2q12, 3p21.33, 3q13.2, 5q22.1, 5q31.1, 6p21.3, 7p22, 10q21.2, 11p15.4, 11q13.1, 11q13.5, 19p13.2 and 20q13. To date, more than half of these loci have only been observed in Japanese populations. As yet, none of these GWAS have specifically examined the differing genetic contribution of individual loci to the AD endophenotypes 'AD plus asthma' and 'AD no asthma' on a genome-wide scale.

In this study, we consequently have set out to map the genetic architecture of AD in a Northern European population and to explore the genetic overlap between AD and asthma in the same dataset (Fig. 1). Using existing evidence from GWAS of psoriasis, we also sought to identify genetic communalities between these two common inflammatory skin diseases.

### Allergic vs nonallergic asthma: what makes the difference? [^116o1r73]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this work was to describe clinical similarities and differences between allergic and nonallergic asthmatics, notably concerning the nasosinusal involvement.

Methods

A total of 165 asthmatics (122 allergics and 43 nonallergics) and 193 controls (40 allergics and 153 nonallergics), recruited in the frame of EGEA study (Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy), were included. Asthmatics were included on the basis of positive answer to four standardized items. To establish differences and similarities between allergic and nonallergic asthmatics, general characteristics (age, sex, smoking habits, history of hay fever and allergic dermatitis), history of asthma, severity and nasosinusal involvement were examined. Clinical assessment was based on the answers to a detailed questionnaire, and spirometry.

Results

Greater age, female sex, sinusal polyposis, and FEV₁ below 80% of the predicted value increased the risk of displaying a nonallergic type of asthma, whereas history of hay fever, seasonal exacerbation of asthma, and asthma duration lowered this risk. Unexpectedly, we found no difference in terms of rhinitic symptoms between both groups, probably resulting from distinct causes.

Conclusion

These results give new insights into the contrasts between clinical features of allergic and nonallergic asthma. The terminology of extrinsic asthma was first introduced by Rackeman in 1947 (1) and referred to the triggering role of allergens in asthma. By symmetry, he described intrinsic asthma as a disease characterized by later onset in life, female predominance, higher degree of severity, and more frequent association to nasosinusal polyposis. As these asthmatics were not improved by conventional treatment, this author considered their disease as caused by a nonallergic, unknown phenomenon. It is now widely admitted that nonallergic asthma can be objectively distinguished from allergic asthma based on negative skin tests to usual aeroallergens. On the other hand, positive skin test shows a tendency to produce IgE antibodies in response to low doses of allergens. "Atopy" and "atopic" are the terms used to describe this clinical trait and predisposition (2). Allergic clinical manifestations of atopy are of various types, for example rhinitis and asthma. Nowadays the terminology of "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" asthma should no longer be used, and should be replaced by the terminology of "allergic" or "nonallergic" asthma (2).

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis symptom burden is substantial. Intense pruritus occurs in most patients, with more than 85% of patients with moderate-to-severe disease reporting daily itch and 42% experiencing itch for 18 or more hours each day. More than 40% of children and 60% of adults report skin pain. Sleep disturbance is common — Children (47%-80%) and adults (33%-87%) frequently report sleep disturbance — along with difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime wakening, excessive daytime sleepiness, and objective findings of prolonged sleep-onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and increased time awake.

### A case of concurrent exacerbation of manifestations and asthma after the initiation of nemolizumab treatment for atopic dermatitis [^113AWs3W]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 81-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with the chief complaint of severe itch associated with AD that met Hanifin and Rajka's diagnostic criteriaand was poorly controlled despite treatment with class II topical corticosteroids. The patient had asthma, which had been well-controlled with no attacks for at least 5 years. The disease was kept into well-controlled status with 25 points by the Asthma Control Test, a self-administered questionnaire to subjectively evaluate asthma control status with the scores ranging from 5 to 25 (5–19 indicates very poorly controlled, 20–24 poorly controlled, and 25 controlled). Before our treatment, the numeric rating scale score for itch was 8 (range, 0–10) and Eczema Area and Severity Index was 12 (range, 0–72) (Fig 1, A, B). We started to administer nemolizumab 60 mg subcutaneously for the treatment of AD. The second week after the initiation of the administration, erythema and papules, which were previously undetected, appeared on the trunk, and then the second dose of nemolizumab 60 mg was administered (Fig 1, C, D). However, the third dose of nemolizumab was discontinued because the manifestations were more progressive (Fig 1, E, F). Concurrently, the patient began experiencing asthma attacks at night requiring inhaled corticosteroids for the first time in 5 years, and his Asthma Control Test score decreased to 18. At the 12th week, erythematous macules and papules newly appeared further (Fig 1, G, H). Skin biopsy was performed from newly emerging erythematous macules and papules on the trunk. Histopathologic examination demonstrated a liquefactive degeneration, spongiosis, and dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and eosinophils (Fig 2, A). Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated a higher number of CD4⁺ cells than CD8⁺ cells in the epidermis and papillary dermis (Fig 2, B, C). Blood examinations revealed an increased number of eosinophils, and elevated levels of serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and immunoglobulin (Ig) E (eosinophils increased from 1065 to 1159 /mm³, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine from 358 to 1084 pg/mL, and IgE from 269 to 905 IU/mL). The serum anti-BP 180 antibody level was within the normal range (< 9 U/mL). Based on these findings, we considered that both the exacerbation of the cutaneous manifestations and the asthma attacks were associated with nemolizumab treatment. Therefore, his asthma attack was treated with low dose of systemic corticosteroid (betamethasone 0.02 mg/kg/d) and inhaled corticosteroid, resulting in improvement of both asthma attacks and the cutaneous manifestations. Consequently, systemic therapies such as biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors were not required for AD. We reduced dose of systemic corticosteroid (betamethasone 0.0067 mg/kg/d) after his asthma had been well-controlled (Asthma Control Test 25). No asthma attacks occurred 2 years after stopping nemolizumab treatment. He has continued to be treated with topical steroids and difamilast ointment (Eczema Area and Severity Index 6.3, numeric rating scale 2).

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^111SpHQH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic condition that involves a complex interplay between the immune system and the skin that manifests mainly as pruritus and an eczematous eruption. In the United States, patients with AD are typically managed by primary care physicians, dermatologists, and allergists. Both the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) have independently developed guidelines for management of AD. The most recent AAD guidelines, published from 2022 to 2024, focus on adults with AD, not children, and are an update of the AD clinical guidelines that were published in 2014. In 2023, the JTFPP expanded on its 2012 AD Practice Parameter, with updated guidelines for both children and adults.,

In 2015 Mohan and Lio, successfully compared and contrasted the AD management guidelines put forth by the 2014 AAD work group and the 2012 JTFPP representing the AAAAI, the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The management of AD has changed drastically since the review article of Mohan and Lio, especially related to the treatment of AD with medications such as biologics and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Therefore, we are providing an updated comparison of the most recent dermatology and allergy AD guidelines to identify key similarities and differences in management of this condition in adults only, as there had not been a pediatric update from the AAD as of the time at which this review was performed.

### Identification of OCA2 as a novel locus for the co-morbidity of asthma-plus-eczema [^111SQauz]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous genes have been associated with the three most common allergic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema) but these genes explain only a part of the heritability. In the vast majority of genetic studies, complex phenotypes such as co-morbidity of two of these diseases, have not been considered. This may partly explain missing heritability.

Objective

To identify genetic variants specifically associated with the co-morbidity of asthma-plus-eczema.

Methods

We first conducted a meta-analysis of four GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) of the combined asthma-plus-eczema phenotype (total of 8807 European-ancestry subjects of whom 1208 subjects had both asthma and eczema). To assess whether the association with SNP(s) was specific to the co-morbidity, we also conducted a meta-analysis of homogeneity test of association according to disease status ("asthma-plus-eczema" vs. the presence of only one disease "asthma only or eczema only"). We then used a joint test by combining the two test statistics from the co-morbidity-SNP association and the phenotypic heterogeneity of SNP effect meta-analyses.

Results

Seven SNPs were detected for specific association to the asthma-plus-eczema co-morbidity, two with significant and five with suggestive evidence using the joint test after correction for multiple testing. The two significant SNPs are located in the OCA2 gene (Oculocutaneous Albinism II), a new locus never detected for significant evidence of association with any allergic disease. This gene is a promising candidate gene, because of its link to skin and lung diseases, and to epithelial barrier and immune mechanisms.

Conclusion

Our study underlines the importance of studying sub-phenotypes as co-morbidities to detect new susceptibility genes.

### Meta-analysis identifies seven susceptibility loci involved in the atopic March [^113Vcdyi]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Methods

Phenotype definition

The term 'atopic march' refers to the sequential manifestations of different allergic diseases such as eczema, asthma and rhinitis. Typically, eczema is the first allergic disease in infancy, followed by asthma and/or rhinitis in childhood. More than 20% of the children with eczema develop asthma, making this the largest group among children with multiple allergic conditions. Since complete longitudinal data were available only for a few study populations, we aimed to approximate the temporal component of the atopic march by using eczema up to the age of 3 years and asthma up to the age of 16 years (strict definition). For a total of 12 study populations, six of the discovery set and six of the replication set, the corresponding phenotype data were available (Supplementary Table 1). Another four study populations had no data on early eczema available. They were included in a separate analysis using a wider definition of the atopic march (childhood eczema plus asthma up to the age of 16 years).

Controls were selected for the absence of eczema and asthma if phenotype data were available. Four data sets included unselected, population-based controls. The phenotype characteristics of each study population are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. All but one study population of the discovery set had participated in the previous GWAS on asthma performed by the GABRIEL consortium. All study populations were of European ancestry. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians, and all studies were approved by the local ethics committees as indicated in the Supplementary Methods.

Genotyping and imputation

Genotyping and imputation of the study populations was performed in the context of the GABRIEL consortium or according to the methods described there, if not otherwise stated. Briefly, after genotyping, an ancestry analysis was carried out using EIGENSTRAT2.0 (ref.) and putative non-European samples were eliminated from subsequent analyses. Genotyped SNPs for imputation had to fulfil the following quality control criteria: (1) genotype missing rate < 3% in both cases and controls; (2) minor allele frequency ≥ 1% in controls; and (3) consistency with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by a one degree-of-freedom goodness-of-fit test in unselected controls (for case–control study populations) or in the whole population before case–control selection (for study populations derived from population-based cohorts), respectively (P > 1 × 10⁻⁴). Imputation was carried out with MACHor IMPUTEusing Hapmap 2 CEU SNPs (release 22, NCBI build 36) as reference.

Comorbidities and complications of atopic dermatitis (AD) include both atopic and nonatopic conditions, infections, ocular disease, skeletal risk, and cardiometabolic associations. The guideline states that "Several comorbid atopic (food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis) and nonatopic (depression, anxiety, neurocognitive impairment, skin infections, and adverse effects of treatment) health problems occur in patients with AD", and that "AD severity is associated with developing such comorbidities and may be due to uncontrolled disease, systemic inflammation, and disturbed sleep". It notes "Complications of skin traumatization in AD include bacterial, viral, and fungal infection, lichen simplex chronicus, and prurigo nodularis. Severe exacerbations can present as erythroderma". Ophthalmic issues are highlighted: "Ophthalmic and ocular diseases, some potentially sight-threatening, occur as comorbidities and complications of AD, such as recurrent keratoconjunctivitis, keratoconus, and anterior subcapsular cataracts", and "Conjunctivitis, for example, can occur after treatment with dupilumab, tralokinumab, or lebrikizumab". Additional risks include bone and systemic disease: "AD is associated with increased fracture incidence… which may be due to decreased physical activity, increased systemic inflammation, and excessive use of certain treatments such as potent topical and systemic corticosteroids", and "Shared mechanisms may also promote AD's possible association with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure".

### Atopy is important in the management of asthma [^116pfDyw]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Allergic diseases are a public health problem in industrialized countries due to the increasing number of allergies related to Western lifestyle. The multiplicity of organs affected by allergy (skin (atopic dermatitis), airway epithelium (respiratory allergy), and digestive tract (food allergy)) worsens the prognosis of each of the allergic diseases and specially asthma. The importance of allergy in management of asthma is also underlined by the risk of fatal or near fatal acute asthma attacks due to multiple allergic sensitizations. Preliminary studies suggest that specific treatment of allergy could change the asthma course.

### Meta-analysis identifies seven susceptibility loci involved in the atopic March [^112iiQqp]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Other atopic march patterns exist as allergic conditions may occur in different orders. In addition, since eczema and asthma are common diseases, they may also co-manifest coincidentally. Thus, the identification of known eczema and asthma loci in this study may reflect the underlying association with each disease independently. In addition, the role of less prevalent allergic manifestations in the atopic march still needs to be resolved. For food allergy, mouse models point to a potential involvement in the atopic march, but robust data from longitudinal cohorts are sparse.

Some limitations of our study need to be discussed. Although most of our study populations selected strict controls by the absence of eczema and asthma, others used population-based controls with unknown disease status. Accordingly, the presence of affected individuals among controls may have decreased the power of these studies. In addition, we did not use atopy status in our meta-analysis due to missing data in some populations. Where available, atopy data were very heterogeneous between studies regarding age at testing, assay used, number of data points and allergens tested. The inclusion of atopic controls may have reduced the power to detect atopy-related genes involved in the atopic march. However, homogeneous effects of the atopic march loci across our study populations (Supplementary Fig. 5) using selected and unselected (population-based) controls pointed to a minor effect of the selection process.

### Context-dependent function of TSLP and IL-1 β in skin allergic sensitization and atopic March [^114riVRm]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma, affect a large proportion of the population, with increasing prevalence worldwide. These diseases result in considerable morbidity, and are in some circumstances life-threatening, raising these diseases as major health problems. AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by defective skin barrier, cutaneous inflammation with infiltration of Th2 cells, eosinophils as well as expression of Th2 cytokines and allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E production. It usually starts in early infancy and precedes other atopic diseases such as asthma. More than 50% of moderate to severe AD children develop asthma and/or allergic rhinitis at a later stage, called the atopic march –. In addition to the efforts in the development of medical therapy for asthma, it is critically important to develop strategies to prevent and block the atopic march.

It has been found that AD children are prone to develop allergen sensitization, indicated by T cell and B cell memories to allergens. Cutaneous exposure to allergens, such as aeroallergen house dust mites (HDM) is recognised as a critical route for sensitization in AD patients. It is thus assumed, which has been supported by studies from mouse models, that following the phase of skin sensitization, allergen challenge upon re-encountering of the allergen in the airway at a later stage results in the development of asthmatic symptoms. Recently, a human cohort study showed that AD with allergen sensitization has a higher risk of asthma, whereas AD without concomitant allergic sensitization is not associated with an increased risk of asthma, providing further evidence for the key role of allergic sensitization occurring during AD in the process of the atopic march. The understanding of how allergic sensitization occurs and how it is regulated in AD context is therefore crucially required for developing strategies to prevent and stop the atopic march.

### Early eczema and the risk of childhood asthma: a prospective, population-based study [^114t53fE]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Severe eczema in young children is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma and rhino-conjunctivitis. In the general population, however, most cases of eczema are mild to moderate. In an unselected cohort, we studied the risk of current asthma and the co-existence of allergy-related diseases at 6 years of age among children with and without eczema at 2 years of age.

Methods

Questionnaires assessing various environmental exposures and health variables were administered at 2 years of age. An identical health questionnaire was completed at 6 years of age. The clinical investigation of a random subsample ascertained eczema diagnoses, and missing data were handled by multiple imputation analyses.

Results

The estimate for the association between eczema at 2 years and current asthma at 6 years was OR = 1.80 (95% CI 1.10–2.96). Four of ten children with eczema at 6 years had the onset of eczema after the age of 2 years, but the co-existence of different allergy-related diseases at 6 years was higher among those with the onset of eczema before 2 years of age.

Conclusions

Although most cases of eczema in the general population were mild to moderate, early eczema was associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma. These findings support the hypothesis of an atopic march in the general population.

The Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim study has been identified as ISRCTN28090297 in the international Current Controlled Trials database.

### Atopic dermatitis [^115m9iKZ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease globally. Key features include an eczematous eruption accompanied by intense itch, which can have an enormous negative effect on patients' quality of life, especially in those with moderate-to-severe disease. Atopic dermatitis is part of a spectrum of atopic conditions that can also include several non-cutaneous organs such as respiratory (eg, allergic rhinitis and asthma) and gastrointestinal (eg, food allergy) systems. For decades, long-term disease control and maintenance were particularly challenging given that treatment options were limited to broad topical and systemic immunosuppressive agents. However, better insights into the pathophysiology of this condition over the past decade have led to the development and approval of safe and efficacious novel targeted treatment approaches. The updated pathophysiological understanding and the evolving therapeutic landscape of atopic dermatitis are discussed in this Seminar.

### Incident asthma, asthma exacerbations, and asthma-related hospitalizations in patients with atopic dermatitis [^117Ekx8A]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is thought to induce asthma via the "atopic march", but the effects of AD on incident asthma and asthma severity have not been fully characterized.

Objective

To determine risk of asthma, asthma exacerbations, and asthma-related hospitalizations among patients fwith AD.

Methods

A cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from UK general practices from 1994 to 2015. Children (< 18 years old) and adults (≥ 18 years) with AD were matched on age, practice, and index date to patients without AD. AD severity was categorized using treatments and dermatologist referrals. Outcomes were incident asthma among all patients and asthma exacerbation or hospitalization among patients with asthma.

Results

On comparing 409,341 children with AD (93.2% mild, 5.5% moderate, 1.3% severe) with 1,809,029 unaffected children, those with AD were found to be associated with a 2-fold greater risk of asthma compared with those without AD (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.93–1.98). On comparing 625,083 adults with AD (65.7% mild, 31.4% moderate, and 2.9% severe) with 2,678,888 unaffected adults, AD was found to be associated with a 38% higher risk of asthma (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.36–1.40). Asthmatic patients with AD also had a 21% to 63% greater risk of asthma exacerbations and a 20% to 64% greater risk of asthma-related hospitalizations compared with asthmatic patients without AD. Risk of asthma, asthma exacerbation, or asthma-related hospitalization increased with AD severity in a dose-dependent manner in both the pediatric and adult cohorts.

Conclusions

AD, especially in children and when more severe, is associated with greater risk of asthma as well as greater risk of asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations among asthmatic patients.

### Skin barrier dysfunction measured by transepidermal water loss at 2 days and 2 months predates and predicts atopic dermatitis at 1 year [^112gDRso]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic diseases include atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. The prevalence of these diseases has increased in recent decades, causing considerable morbidity in childhood. The putative "Atopic March" refers to the typical sequence of clinical manifestation of atopic disease, usually initiated by AD from early infancy.

Parental atopy is an independent risk factor for the development of atopic disease. The genetic mechanisms and inheritance pattern of atopic diseases are not fully elucidated, but recent candidate gene studies and genomewide association studies have yielded some insights. The most widely replicated and most significant gene to influence AD is filaggrin (FLG). Filaggrin is a filament-binding protein in the stratum corneum. FLG loss-of-function mutations occur in 10% of Europeans, imparting an increased risk of AD, food allergy, and asthma. The overall increase in the risk of AD conferred by a single FLG loss-of-function mutation is approximately 3.3, with a significant additional and independent effect conferred by intragenic copy number variations in FLG. Importantly, FLG mutations increase the risk of developing asthma only in the presence of AD.

The stratum corneum contributes greatly to skin barrier function. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a noninvasive in vivo measurement of water loss across the stratum corneum. It is raised in subjects with AD. This is seen at both lesional and nonlesional skin sites. Recent studies of high-risk atopic individuals showed that a raised TEWL may precede the clinical manifestation of AD in those at high risk of atopy. A defect in skin barrier function may facilitate allergen entry and immune priming. Further evidence for this theory has been gained from murine studies in which systemic allergic reactions to peanut can be induced by epicutaneous sensitization across a disrupted stratum corneum. Such a defect has been proposed as a risk factor and a route of sensitization for the development of peanut allergy. With regard to aeroallergens, in a cross-sectional study of children, an increased TEWL is associated with increased sensitization to aeroallergens.

PH symptoms and exposure history — PH is a multisystem disorder, and it is characterized by skin lesions including urticaria, eczema, erythema multiforme, papulopustular lesions, vesiculobullous and vesiculopustular lesions, as well as stomatitis; non-dermatologic hypersensitivity symptoms including asthma and anaphylaxis have also been described, and both non-dermatologic and dermatologic manifestations have been described in the same patient. Use of high-dose progestogens in women undergoing in vitro fertilization may predispose them to the development of PH and make it difficult for patients to undergo fertility treatment, and a careful history of both symptom timing and exposures is crucial to making the diagnosis of PH.

### One remarkable molecule: filaggrin [^111xG86w]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The discovery, in 2006, that loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin (FLG) gene are the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris-the most common disorder of keratinization-and also a strong genetic risk factor for atopic eczema, marked a significant breakthrough in the understanding of eczema pathogenesis. Subsequent investigations of the role of FLG-null mutations have identified a series of significant associations with atopic disease phenotypes, including atopic asthma, allergic rhinitis, and peanut allergy. However, many questions remain to be answered in relation to the precise mechanisms by which deficiency of an intracellular protein expressed primarily in the differentiating epidermis may contribute to the development of cutaneous and systemic pathology. This review aims to highlight the key milestones in filaggrin research over the past 25 years, to discuss the mechanistic, clinical, and therapeutic implications, and to consider possible future directions for ongoing investigation.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

### Dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19: a comprehensive review of the current knowledge [^112knsWJ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a significant health problem globally. The virus has spread widely and become a global pandemic. The pathophysiology for SARS-CoV-2 has not been explained clearly. It has been associated with several multiorgan symptoms, among which its dermatological manifestations are of great interest. Primarily, there has been no report of skin features among COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, recently there have been several reports regarding COVID-19 patients who presented with cutaneous manifestations. In the current review, we focus on the various cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 infection.

5.3	Eosinophilic Conditions

Patients being treated for asthma may present with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Healthcare providers should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, kidney injury, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia were reported in adults who participated in the asthma development program. Cases of EGPA have been reported with DUPIXENT in adults who participated in the asthma development program as well as in adults with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development program. Advise patients to report signs of eosinophilic pneumonia and EGPA to their healthcare provider. Consider withholding DUPIXENT if eosinophilic pneumonia or EGPA are suspected.

5.4	Acute Symptoms of Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or Acute Deteriorating Disease

DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute symptoms or acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma or COPD remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT.

5.5	Risk Associated with Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage

Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.

5.6	Patients with Co-morbid Asthma

Advise patients with co-morbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians.

5.7 Psoriasis

Cases of new-onset psoriasis have been reported with the use of DUPIXENT for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and asthma, including in patients without a family history of psoriasis. In postmarketing reports, onset of psoriasis varied from weeks to months after the first dose of DUPIXENT and resulted in partial or complete resolution of psoriasis with discontinuation of dupilumab, with or without use of supplemental treatment for psoriasis (topical or systemic). Those who continued on dupilumab received supplemental treatment for psoriasis to improve associated symptoms. Advise patients to report new-onset psoriasis symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider dermatologic evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT.

### Increasing comorbidities suggest that atopic dermatitis Is a Systemic disorder [^113KZF2o]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis comorbidities extend well beyond the march to allergic conditions (food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis), suggesting both cutaneous and systemic immune activation. In reviewing atopic dermatitis comorbidities, Councilors of the International Eczema Council found a strong pattern of immune activation in peripheral blood and the propensity to both skin and systemic infections. Associations with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and malignant diseases were increasingly reported, but confirmation of their link with atopic dermatitis requires longitudinal studies. Given the possibility of atopic dermatitis-related systemic immune activation, future investigations of new interventions should concurrently examine the impact on these comorbidities.

Inhaled corticosteroid dosing and local side-effect mitigation — the minimum effective dose of ICS to maintain good asthma control should be used; if decreased growth velocity is seen, other factors should be considered, including poorly controlled asthma, frequent use of oral corticosteroids (OCS), and poor nutrition, and referral should be considered. If ICS is delivered through a face-mask or nebulizer, the skin on the nose and around the mouth should be cleaned shortly after inhalation to avoid local side-effects such as steroid rash (reddening and atrophy).

Atopic dermatitis — definition and diagnosis note that AD (also known as atopic eczema) is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children but also affects many adults and follows a relapsing course, and it is often associated with a personal or family history of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Although the diagnosis of AD is usually made clinically, alternative or concomitant causes of dermatitis such as allergic contact dermatitis or irritant contact dermatitis should be considered and evaluated via comprehensive history and physical exam, and other diagnostic tests such as biopsy or patch testing should be performed if warranted.

### Eczema and related atopic diseases are associated with increased symptom severity in children with autism spectrum disorder [^115R8Vcf]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has diverse genetic, neurological, and environmental factors that contribute to its neurodevelopmental course. Interestingly, childhood ASD is often accompanied by skin disorders, such as eczema, and other related atopic manifestations. This link may be due to the shared embryonic origin of epidermal and neural tissue. Accordingly, we consider the potential influence of a skin-brain co-vulnerability and ensuing atopic cascade on ASD symptomatology by investigating whether atopic disorders (asthma, allergies, eczema and hay fever) are associated with increased symptom severity in children with ASD. Overall, 45 atopic and 93 non-atopic children with ASD were assessed using the ADOS-2 on scores of total, social and non-social symptoms. Differences in ASD symptom severity were further evaluated as a function of atopic disease type. Atopic children displayed greater symptom severity overall and in the social domain, relative to non-atopic participants. Atopic children were 2.4 times more likely to experience overall impairments classified within the ADOS-2 highest-level severity bracket and 2.7 times more likely to show social difficulties in this range. Moreover, those reporting comorbid eczema displayed increased symptom severity relative to both their non-atopic peers and those reporting asthma and allergies. Taken together, findings indicate that atopic disorders, and particularly comorbid eczema, are associated with increases in ASD symptom severity. Findings provide grounds for future investigations into this link between childhood skin diseases and ASD symptom severity to advance our understanding of neurodevelopment and to develop targeted assessment and intervention opportunities.

### Does a' reverse' atopic March exist? [^112jwMLX]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

The classical description of the atopic march usually refers to the progression from atopic dermatitis towards asthma, but this pathway has been questioned. We assessed in a prospective observation the possible onset of atopic dermatitis in children with asthma alone at baseline, and evaluated retrospectively their characteristics. Seven hundred and forty-five children (360 male, 6–9 years of age) with asthma alone, without food allergy or atopic dermatitis, were followed-up with regular visits for 9 years. 692 children completed the 9-year observation, and 20% of them were found to have developed atopic dermatitis at 9 years. Comparing retrospectively the children who developed AD with the remaining, no significant difference existed at baseline concerning the demographic characteristics and family history. There was a significantly higher proportion (χ² = 0.01) of subjects with single sensitization to mites and a significantly lower proportion of polysensitized subjects (χ² = 0.01) within the children who developed AD. Sensitization to foods appeared in 9% of children who developed AD and in 3.8% in the other children (NS). According to these observations, the development of a particular allergic disease does not necessarily follow the classical paradigm of the atopic march.

### The microbial environment and its influence on asthma prevention in early life [^113Z7KSJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

There is accumulating evidence to suggest that the environmental microbiome plays a significant role in asthma development. The very low prevalence of asthma in populations highly exposed to microbial environments (farm children and Amish populations) highlights its preventive potential. This microbial diversity might be necessary to instruct a well-adapted immune response and regulated inflammatory responses to other inhaled and ingested environmental elements, such as allergens, particles, and viruses. Like the internal gut microbiome, which is increasingly recognized as an important instructor of immune maturation, the external environmental microbiome might shape immune responses on the skin, airway mucosal surfaces, and potentially also the gut early in life. The diversity of the external microbial world will ensure that of the many maladapted pathways leading to asthma development, most, if not all, will be counterbalanced. Likewise, important contributors to asthma, such as allergen sensitization and allergic manifestations early in life, are being suppressed. Thus the facets of innate immunity targeted by microbes and their compounds and metabolites might be the master switch to asthma and allergy protection, which has been found in environments rich in microbial exposures.

### Risk factors for onset of asthma: a 12-year prospective follow-up study [^115LpuBJ]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma development and prognosis have been studied extensively in at-risk populations, but knowledge of the natural history of asthma in the general population is limited.

Objective

To describe the incidence and remission of asthma and its predictors, data from a 12-year follow-up study of a random population sample (n = 291; age range, 7 to 17 years) at enrollment, were analyzed.

Methods

The sample was examined in 1986 and in 1998. A case history, including data on asthma, allergic diseases, and lifestyle factors, was obtained by questionnaire and interview. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to histamine, lung function, and skin-prick test reactivity to a standard panel of 10 aeroallergens were measured.

Results

The point prevalence of asthma increased from 4.1% at the first survey to 11.7% at follow-up, at which point 19.6% of the sample had ever experienced asthma symptoms. Of the subjects with ever-asthma, 40% had remitted at follow-up. Asthma developed in 45 subjects (16.1%) during the follow-up period, which was predicted by the following factors: wheezing in childhood (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34 to 9.75), AHR (OR, 4.94; 95% CI, 2.42 to 10.08), allergic sensitization to house dust mites (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.00 to 10.40), and dermatitis (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.22 to 7.11). The simultaneous presence of more than one of these risk factors was associated with a high probability of developing asthma at follow-up (61.5%). In subjects without any risk factors, such as AHR, allergic sensitization, rhinitis, dermatitis or wheezing in childhood; paternal/maternal allergy, or asthma, asthma developed in only 4% during follow-up.

Conclusion

The presence of AHR and concomitant atopic manifestations in childhood increase the risk of developing asthma in adulthood, and should be recognized as markers of prognostic significance, whereas the absence of these manifestations predicts a very low risk of future asthma.

### Allergic and nonallergic forms of atopic diseases [^1118HqLP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma are atopic diseases that develop on a complex genetic background, the so-called atopic diathesis. Although they target different organs, in most patients they are characterized by the presence of elevated total serum IgE levels. However, a subgroup of atopic patients exhibits normal IgE levels and mechanisms contributing to the so-called "intrinsic" or "nonallergic form" have been the matter of intensive research work in the last years. Because of the rapid advancements in the research field of atopic diseases, it now becomes possible for the first time to delineate a new disease classification of allergic and nonallergic subtypes of atopic diseases, thereby bringing hope to the clinician for a more specific treatment approach for each subgroup of these patients.

### Clinical and pathophysiological tangles between allergy and autoimmunity: deconstructing an old dichotomic paradigm [^116Yiuae]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological Background

Autoimmune disorders and allergy are chronic immune–mediated diseases characterised by inflammatory responses towards antigens: allergy results from an exaggerated immune response to foreign antigens (allergens), whereas autoimmune diseases are characterised by a pathological response to internal antigens (autoantigens). These two conditions share some similarities and also some differences and their relationship has been broadly discussed.

Allergic diseases constitute a broad set of pathophysiologically and clinically variegated conditions affecting a large share of the general population. Despite the chance of amelioration during adulthood, most of them have a profound impact on long-term prognosis, quality of life, and productivity with increased direct and indirect healthcare costs. In fact, the severity of allergy symptoms can range from seasonal mucocutaneous manifestations and rhinitis to life-threatening anaphylaxis and severe asthma. In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the incidence of allergic disorders, with prevalence reported in between 10 and 30% in developed nations. For example, in 2021, an American survey reported that nearly one-third of adults aged 18 and over had a diagnosed seasonal allergy, eczema, or food allergy. Seasonal allergy was the most common, with about one-quarter (25.7%) of adults being affected, followed by eczema (7.3%) and food allergy (6.2%). Moreover, it was recently estimated that asthma affects 2.4–4.3% of the global population. Furthermore, although worldwide asthma mortality has significantly decreased over the past decades, it has been estimated that approximately 250,000 people die prematurely of asthma each year. The increase in asthma survival may be attributed to the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids over the past 20–30 years. Several risk factors may explain the high number of near-fatal or fatal asthma attacks: comorbidities such as systemic vasculitis, a history of severe asthma with previous near-fatal asthma attacks, inappropriate use of anti-asthmatic medications, and poor compliance. The other possibly life-threatening situation is anaphylaxis: worldwide data are heterogeneous, but it has been estimated that 0.3–5% of the population will experience anaphylaxis. Fatal outcomes are quite rare, with a mortality rate of less than one death per million people per year: drugs are usually the most commonly reported cause of fatal anaphylaxis, with an estimated rate of 0.05–0.51 per million people per year, followed by food-induced anaphylaxis (0.03–0.32) and venom-induced anaphylaxis (0.09–0.13).

### Early eczema and the risk of childhood asthma: a prospective, population-based study [^112V5VEN]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

We found that only twenty percent of children with eczema at 2 years were sensitised, whereas others have found sensitisation among children in this age group to be approximately one-third. It has been hypothesised that the course of the disease is different for those with sensitisation as opposed to those without sensitisation, and that rather than a progressive atopic march, there are different phenotypes of eczema leading to asthma. Others have found that FLG mutations with co-existing eczema increase the risk for asthma and hay-fever without an obligate presence of concurrent sensitisation. Our results show an increased risk of asthma at age 6 years among children with eczema at 2 years compared to children without eczema at 2 years, regardless of sensitisation.

### 131 genetic loci highlight immunological pathways and tissues in nasal polyposis and asthma [^116Xr9ES]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Several loci previously associated with childhood asthma, (e.g. 15q22.33, 16p12.1, and 3q21.3 near genes SMAD3, IL4R, EEFSEC, respectively) were also linked here with a more generally selected asthma. This observation sheds lights on the high but not entirely complete genetic correlation between childhood and adult-onset asthma. Less clear is the mechanism behind childhood asthma loci such as 6p25.3 near IRF4 and 17q21.32 near TBX21, which we associate here with CRSwNP but not asthma. Interestingly, despite CRSwNP usually manifesting in adulthood, some loci associated with childhood asthma also overlap with CRSwNP. This observation emphasizes the complexities of heritable etiologies shared between CRSwNP and both asthma types. The apparently higher CRSwNP impact among shared variants may well be explained by more special care-based diagnoses, in addition to a higher heterogeneity of asthma etiologies. Additionally, while the shared genetic contributions of atopic dermatitis and asthma have previously been well characterized, we found no overlap between CRSwNP-specific loci and atopic dermatitis. While epidemiologically expected, this absence raises the question of the underlying mechanisms driving the impact of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and CRSwNP, suggesting a common immunological contribution related to type 2 inflammation. as further evidenced by type 2 targeting therapeutics impacting all three diseases. However, the unique influences of asthma-specific loci remain a matter for exploration, potentially relating to interaction of environmental risk factors – such as obesityand smoking.

Guideline limitations — Limitations of these guidelines include focusing on the most common aspects of AD care, and the authors state they did not address Traditional, Complementary, or Integrative medicines or Indigenous Ways of Knowing, aiming to address these in subsequent living guidelines as evidence emerges. The guideline notes that AD lacks robust evidence for safety of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and calls for well-conducted studies for this population. It also highlights that many AD trials are placebo controlled and calls for funding and investigations through professional, government, and private organizations to promote comparative effectiveness and safety of approved medications and their optimal use in treatment pathways, with robust data in pregnant patients and comparative effectiveness informing future recommendations.

### Context-dependent function of TSLP and IL-1 β in skin allergic sensitization and atopic March [^115A24oY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma, affect a large proportion of the population, with increasing prevalence worldwide. AD often precedes the development of asthma, known as the atopic march. Allergen sensitization developed through the barrier-defective skin of AD has been recognized to be a critical step leading to asthma, in which thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was previously shown to be critical. In this study, using a laser-assistant microporation system to disrupt targeted skin layers for generating micropores at a precise anatomic depth of mouse skin, we model allergen exposure superficially or deeply in the skin, leading to epicutaneous sensitization or dermacutaneous sensitization that is associated with a different cytokine microenvironment. Our work shows a differential requirement for TSLP in these two contexts, and identifies an important function for IL-1β, which is independent of TSLP, in promoting allergen sensitization and subsequent allergic asthma.

### Epidemiology of atopic dermatitis and atopic March in children [^111Tm2sS]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic childhood skin diseases affecting up to 17% of children in the United States. The point prevalence of AD has increased based on validated questionnaires in the most recent update of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. However, the increases are primarily in developing countries, whereas the rates have stabilized in countries with higher incomes. AD starts in early childhood with 65% of children affected by 18 months of age. Furthermore, less than half of the patients with AD have complete resolution by 7 years of age and only 60% have resolution by adulthood, indicating the chronic nature of AD. AD is a major risk factor for the development of asthma, with an increased odds ratio in children with AD in several longitudinal studies compared with children without AD, and about 30% of patients with AD develop asthma. Patients with atopic sensitization along with eczema are at a higher risk for progressing in the atopic march to asthma. The main risk factors for progression and persistence of asthma are early onset and severity of AD.

### Filaggrin failure-from ichthyosis vulgaris to atopic eczema and beyond [^114hcYiF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Interestingly, one of studies involved a cohort of children ascertained initially for asthma. 11 About half of these patients also had a history of eczema. The FLG mutations were shown to be a major genetic risk factor for asthma per se, but further analysis revealed that all of the observed association was with asthma plus eczema group, where as the asthma‐only group showed no FLG association. 11 This result demonstrated that there are at least two forms asthma – one driven via an eczema/skin barrier pathomechanism and the other driven by some other unknown mechanism(s). Since filaggrin is not expressed in the airway epithelia outside of the hair‐bearing outer nasal cavity (which is essentially epidermis), this led to the hypothesis that filaggrin deficiency leads to atopy via percutaneous antigen/allergen priming, which causes development of a systemic allergic immune reaction, which can then later manifest in other organ system remote from the skin, such as lung. In keeping with this, genetic associations of the FLG mutations were reported with hay fever and food allergy – additional phenotypic markers of the atopic diathesis. 1 To prove this hypothesis experimentally, we turned to animal models, where we identified the causative mutation in a natural filaggrin mutant mouse known as flaky tail. 12 Using these animals, we were able to show that filaggrin deficiency allows allergens cross the epidermis and trigger Th‐2 allergic immunity. Thus, the skin barrier hypothesis of eczema was established beyond all doubt and has become a widely accepted dogma in dermatology.

### Biomarkers associated with the development of comorbidities in patients with atopic dermatitis: a systematic review [^113iNMch]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Biomarkers associated with the development of comorbidities in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients have been reported, but have not yet been systematically reviewed. Seven electronic databases were searched, from database inception to September 2021. English language randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort, and case–control studies that investigated the association between a biomarker and the development of comorbidities in AD patients were included. Two authors independently screened the records for eligibility, one extracted all data, and critically appraised the quality of studies and risk of bias. Fifty six articles met the inclusion criteria, evaluating 146 candidate biomarkers. The most frequently reported biomarkers were filaggrin mutations and allergen specific‐IgE. Promising biomarkers include specific‐IgE and/or skin prick tests predicting the development of asthma, and genetic polymorphisms predicting the occurrence of eczema herpeticum. The identified studies and biomarkers were highly heterogeneous, and associated with predominately moderate‐to‐high risk of bias across multiple domains. Overall, findings were inconsistent. High‐quality studies assessing biomarkers associated with the development of comorbidities in people with AD are lacking. Harmonized datasets and independent validation studies are urgently needed.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

### Skin-blanching is associated with FEV₁, allergy, age and gender in asthma families [^115oEs4R]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled glucocorticosteroids reduce airway inflammation in asthma patients, thereby improving lung function and reducing airway hyperresponsiveness and symptoms. The response to glucocorticosteroids can be measured with the glucocorticosteroid skin-blanching test. We investigated if asthmatics have a lower skin-blanching response to glucocorticosteroids than non-asthmatic subjects and if asthmatics with airway obstruction have lower skin-blanching response than those without obstruction. Finally, we assessed which clinical and inflammatory parameters influence the variability in skin-blanching response.

Methods

We evaluated the skin-blanching response to topical budesonide in a large group of 315 well-characterized asthmatics and their relatives (asthma n = 114, healthy n = 140, other = 61).

Results

The skin-blanching scores of the asthma probands and their healthy spouses were not significantly different. The skin-blanching score of patients with FEV₁ < 80% predicted was lower than of patients without obstruction. Lower skin-blanching score was significantly associated with lower FEV₁ %predicted, higher age, female gender, absence of allergy and summer season, but not with use of inhaled or oral glucocorticosteroids or packyears smoking.

Conclusions

Asthmatics do not have lower skin-blanching response to glucocorticosteroids than healthy subjects. Furthermore, lower skin-blanching response to glucocorticosteroids is associated with lower FEV₁, female gender, higher age and the absence of allergy.

### Disease trajectories in childhood atopic dermatitis: an update and practitioner's guide [^111JTCF6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge of analysing epidemiological data

The clustering of atopic comorbidities has long been recognized. 46 Cross‐sectional and longitudinal analyses of epidemiological studies have suggested a phenotype known as the 'atopic march', described as a natural progression of atopic manifestations from AD to asthma and allergic rhinitis (Fig. 2). 47, 48, 49, 50 This has created a common perception that AD is the 'entry point' for the development of other allergic diseases and that most paediatric patients with AD either follow the atopic march trajectory or outgrow the disease. However, the concept of the atopic march as the most common phenotype in paediatric patients with AD has been challenged by newer longitudinal studies applying more sophisticated statistical techniques. 51

Figure 2
The atopic march has been defined as the sequential progression from atopic dermatitis to asthma and allergic rhinitis. The common perception is that patients either follow this trajectory or outgrow the disease. This graph shows the percentage of patients with each of the indicated allergic conditions (y ‐axis) at different age groups (x ‐axis) in the subset of patients who follow what is traditionally known as the atopic march trajectory. This corresponds to the cross‐sectional analysis of the data described by Belgrave et al. 41
