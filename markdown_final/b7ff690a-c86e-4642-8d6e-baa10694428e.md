## Question

What is the function of methyl CpG binding protein?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the function of methyl-CpG binding proteins, with emphasis on MeCP2 and MBD2, and how their roles reconcile with evolving models of methylation-mediated repression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the MBD protein family. Then, I should verify the canonical model of methylation recognition and repressor recruitment. Next, I will examine MeCP2's specific mechanisms, including DNA binding, histone interactions, and non-CG methylation. After that, I should review MBD2's distinct roles in immunity and cancer. Then, I need to integrate the newer evidence that direct inhibition of transcription factor binding may be the prevailing repression mechanism, and finally, I will consider disease implications and therapeutic angles, including Rett syndrome and cancer, before summarizing a balanced conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the core concept and the protein family. Methyl-CpG binding proteins are "readers" of DNA methylation that recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides and translate that epigenetic mark into transcriptional outcomes, historically linked to repression via chromatin remodeling and histone modification recruitment [^112HA3Hq]. The canonical mammalian MBD family includes MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4, with MBD3 being a NuRD subunit that lacks robust methyl-CpG binding in mammals, while other methyl-DNA binders include zinc finger proteins such as ZBTB38 and Kaiso, expanding the repertoire beyond classical MBDs [^112HA3Hq] [^116jCQxq] [^11356QX2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single mechanism. The classical model posits that MBD proteins bind symmetrically methylated CpGs and recruit repressive complexes such as NuRD and Sin3A/HDACs, thereby establishing compacted, hypoacetylated chromatin and transcriptional silencing; MeCP2's MBD and transcriptional repression domain (TRD) are key to this model, and MBD2 participates via NuRD engagement, while MBD4 primarily functions in mismatch repair of 5mC deamination rather than sustained transcriptional repression [^112HA3Hq] [^113FES3z] [^1137t8FY] [^117STeFq].

> I will now examine MeCP2's specific mechanisms, but wait, let me verify the binding specificity beyond CpG. MeCP2 binds methylated CpG and, importantly, non-CG methylation (mCH) enriched in neurons, and its genomic distribution is shaped by GC content and nucleosome positioning, with sequence features predicting binding with high accuracy; it also directly interacts with H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes, indicating dual recognition of DNA methylation and repressive histone marks that together modulate transcription [^114nXhrD] [^114Acbzx] [^112CfZU6] [^114HUAAa]. Let me consider the functional consequences: MeCP2 can repress long neuronal genes enriched in mCA, and its loss causes a length-dependent upregulation of long genes, linking methylation-dependent repression to neuronal physiology; it also engages in activity-dependent phosphorylation that modulates its release from specific promoters such as Bdnf, integrating neuronal signaling with chromatin regulation [^115QZtcG] [^115jiVED].

> Next, I should review MBD2's distinct roles. MBD2 is a key NuRD-associated reader that shapes dendritic cell programming to promote Th2 immunity, and in cancer it appears to facilitate the maintenance and spread of hypermethylation at CpG islands and shores, with evidence of physical association with DNMTs and functional contributions to tumor-suppressor gene silencing in certain contexts [^116BsmsL] [^111pvNwh] [^111b5aaM]. But wait, what if MBD2's role is purely structural rather than catalytic? The data suggest an active role in reinforcing methylation-dependent repression at specific loci, even though the broader necessity of MBD proteins for methylation-mediated repression has been challenged in some systems [^111pvNwh] [^114P65eG].

> I should double-check the recent paradigm shift. High-credibility studies show that combinatorial deletion of the four functional MBD proteins (MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD4) does not reactivate methylated promoters or repeats, whereas removal of DNA methylation itself unleashes methylation-sensitive transcription factors and drives expression, indicating that direct TF occlusion is the prevailing mechanism at regulatory regions; this does not negate MBD roles but reframes them as contributory, context-dependent, and sometimes redundant in the tested systems [^114P65eG] [^115toSkU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MBD proteins were universally required for methylation-mediated repression; these data correct that overgeneralization and emphasize that MBD-dependent repression remains important in specific loci and cell states even if it is not the dominant genome-wide mechanism in the tested contexts [^114P65eG].

> Let me consider disease implications, starting with Rett syndrome. MeCP2 mutations are the principal cause of Rett syndrome, with pathogenic variants clustering in the MBD and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain; strikingly, a minimal MeCP2 construct comprising just the MBD and NCoR interaction domain can rescue most neurological defects in mice, supporting the centrality of bridging methylated DNA to corepressors, while also acknowledging MeCP2's broader hub functions with dozens of partners and roles in chromatin architecture and RNA processing [^1158ZeRy] [^111y1uUw] [^1171ViJa]. I need to ensure I capture the non-neuronal roles too: adipocyte-specific MeCP2 loss promotes browning and leanness via SLPI regulation, illustrating tissue-specific regulatory circuits beyond the brain [^116G9qUr].

> Turning to cancer, I should confirm that MBD proteins both interpret and reinforce aberrant methylation. MBD2 occupancy at hypermethylated tumor-suppressor promoters and its association with DNMTs support a model wherein MBD2-containing NuRD helps stabilize and propagate cancer-specific methylation landscapes; conversely, MBD4's DNA glycosylase activity protects against methylation damage, and germline MBD4 deficiency increases mutational burden and cancer risk, highlighting a distinct tumor-suppressor function within the family [^111pvNwh] [^117STeFq]. Hold on, I should verify that these are not contradictory: MBD2's facilitative role in silencing and MBD4's protective role operate on different axes of methylation biology, so both observations can be true in different contexts [^111pvNwh] [^117STeFq].

> Therapeutically, I need to check the current trajectory. For Rett syndrome, gene therapy and RNA-editing approaches that restore MeCP2 expression are advancing, with a first-in-human CRISPR-based RNA editing trial for MECP2 duplication syndrome underway, while preclinical work shows that precise control of MeCP2 dosage is essential to avoid toxicity; for cancer, targeting MBD2-NuRD interactions or exploiting vulnerabilities in methyl-CpG–bound repressor complexes are under exploration, though clinical translation remains early [^114JG5Q6] [^112XJxSL] [^112HA3Hq]. Let me reconsider whether small molecules directly modulating MBD function are realistic; while conceptually attractive, specificity and on-target effects remain challenges given the overlapping roles and redundancy in some systems [^112HA3Hq].

> In summary, methyl-CpG binding proteins are the primary cellular interpreters of CpG methylation that link this mark to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional outcomes; MeCP2 and MBD2 exemplify MBD-dependent repression via NuRD and corepressor recruitment, while also participating in broader regulatory networks, and recent evidence indicates that direct inhibition of transcription factor binding is the predominant mechanism of methylation-mediated repression at regulatory regions, with MBD proteins providing essential but context-dependent contributions rather than universal indispensability [^112HA3Hq] [^114P65eG] [^115toSkU]. I should confirm that this synthesis preserves the historical model while integrating the newer data, which it does by acknowledging MBD roles in specific loci and cell states alongside the emerging TF-occlusion paradigm [^112HA3Hq] [^114P65eG].

Methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs) interpret **DNA methylation** by binding methylated CpG sites and recruiting chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers, thereby mediating transcriptional repression and shaping chromatin architecture [^111uT5Px] [^111FdxvP]. MeCP2, the best-studied MBP, is essential for neuronal development and function; mutations cause **Rett syndrome** [^1158ZeRy] [^1157SXiR]. MBD2 links methylation to the NuRD complex and is critical for dendritic cell–mediated Th2 immunity [^116BsmsL] [^1137t8FY]. MBD4 is a DNA glycosylase that repairs methylation-induced mismatches, safeguarding genome integrity [^117STeFq]. MBPs are central to epigenetic regulation, development, and disease, and are emerging therapeutic targets in **cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders** [^112HA3Hq] [^114JG5Q6].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of methyl-CpG-binding proteins

MBPs share a conserved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) that recognizes methylated CpG dinucleotides and recruits chromatin-modifying complexes to establish repressive chromatin states [^111uT5Px] [^111FdxvP].

---

### MeCP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2)

- **Structure and binding**: MeCP2 binds methylated CpG and non-CpG (mCH) sites via its MBD; its transcriptional repression domain (TRD) recruits co-repressors such as Sin3A and HDACs, and it also interacts with H3K27me3, linking DNA and histone methylation [^114nXhrD] [^112CfZU6] [^114HUAAa].

- **Neuronal function**: MeCP2 is highly expressed in neurons and regulates neuronal maturation, synaptic plasticity, and activity-dependent gene expression; loss-of-function mutations cause Rett syndrome [^1158ZeRy] [^1157SXiR].

- **Chromatin architecture**: MeCP2 organizes heterochromatin and can form liquid-like condensates that compartmentalize heterochromatin factors, though recent data indicate its nuclear distribution is primarily determined by global methylation patterns rather than intrinsic phase separation [^117Fep1Z] [^114r9mpi].

---

### MBD2 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2)

- **NuRD recruitment**: MBD2 links methylation to the NuRD complex, directing histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling to methylated regions [^11356QX2] [^1137t8FY].

- **Immune regulation**: MBD2 is essential for dendritic cell–mediated Th2 differentiation and allergic responses, and its loss impairs Th2 immunity [^116BsmsL] [^1137t8FY].

- **Cancer**: MBD2 promotes hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressors in cancer, and its depletion induces hypomethylation and reactivation of silenced genes [^111pvNwh].

---

### MBD4 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4)

MBD4 is a DNA glycosylase that repairs T:G mismatches from 5-methylcytosine deamination, maintaining genome integrity and preventing CpG→TpG transitions [^117STeFq]. Germline biallelic MBD4 variants cause MBD4-associated neoplasia syndrome with increased cancer risk and a CpG→TpG mutational signature [^117STeFq].

---

## Biological roles of methyl-CpG-binding proteins

MBPs are integral to multiple biological processes, including:

| **Biological process** | **Role of mbps** |
|-|-|
| Transcriptional repression | MBPs recruit HDACs and chromatin remodelers to methylated CpG sites, establishing repressive chromatin [^11356QX2] [^111FdxvP] |
| Chromatin organization | MeCP2 organizes heterochromatin and modulates chromatin compaction [^117Fep1Z] |
| DNA repair | MBD4 repairs methylation-induced mismatches, maintaining genome integrity [^117STeFq] |
| Development | MeCP2 is essential for neuronal development and synaptic function [^1158ZeRy] [^1157SXiR] |
| Immunity | MBD2 regulates dendritic cell function and Th2 immunity [^116BsmsL] [^1137t8FY] |

---

## Clinical significance and therapeutic implications

MBPs are implicated in several diseases, making them attractive therapeutic targets:

- **Rett syndrome**: MeCP2 mutations cause Rett syndrome; gene therapy and pharmacological strategies to restore MeCP2 function are under development [^114JG5Q6] [^111y1uUw].

- **Cancer**: MBD2 and MeCP2 are implicated in tumor suppressor silencing; targeting MBD2-NuRD interactions or MeCP2 pathways is being explored [^112HA3Hq] [^111pvNwh].

- **Immune disorders**: MBD2 modulates Th2 responses, offering potential targets for allergic and autoimmune diseases [^116BsmsL] [^1137t8FY].

Methyl-CpG-binding proteins interpret DNA methylation by recruiting chromatin modifiers, mediating repression, and shaping chromatin architecture. They are essential for development, immunity, and genome integrity, and their dysregulation contributes to neurodevelopmental and malignant disease, positioning them as key therapeutic targets.

### Transcription factors as readers and effectors of DNA methylation [^1172vDSe]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recent technological advances have made it possible to decode DNA methylomes at single-base-pair resolution under various physiological conditions. Many aberrant or differentially methylated sites have been discovered, but the mechanisms by which changes in DNA methylation lead to observed phenotypes, such as cancer, remain elusive. The classical view of methylation-mediated protein-DNA interactions is that only proteins with a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) can interact with methylated DNA. However, evidence is emerging to suggest that transcription factors lacking a MBD can also interact with methylated DNA. The identification of these proteins and the elucidation of their characteristics and the biological consequences of methylation-dependent transcription factor-DNA interactions are important stepping stones towards a mechanistic understanding of methylation-mediated biological processes, which have crucial implications for human development and disease.

### Molecular genetics of Rett syndrome: when DNA methylation goes unrecognized [^1158ZeRy]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

The discovery that Rett syndrome is caused by mutations that affect the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 provided a major breakthrough in understanding this severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Animal models and expression studies have contributed to defining the role of MeCP2 in development, highlighting its contribution to postnatal neuronal morphogenesis and function. Furthermore, in vitro assays and microrray studies have delineated the potential molecular mechanisms of MeCP2 function, and have indicated a role in the transcriptional silencing of specific target genes. As well as unravelling the mechanisms that underlie Rett syndrome, these studies provide more general insights into how DNA-methylation patterns are recognized and translated into biological outcomes.

### Does genotype predict phenotype in Rett syndrome? [^115ewJiP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 are the primary cause of classic and atypical Rett syndrome and have recently been shown to contribute to other neurodevelopmental disorders of varying severity. To determine whether there are molecular correlates to the phenotypic heterogeneity, numerous groups have performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies. These studies have yielded conflicting results, in part because they used different criteria for determining severity and classifying mutations. Evolution of the phenotype with age and variable expressivity arising from individual variability in X-chromosome inactivation patterns are among other reasons the findings varied. Nonetheless, evidence of differences in the phenotypic consequences of specific types of mutations is emerging. This review analyzes the available literature and makes recommendations for future studies.

### A dominant role for the methyl-CpG-binding protein mbd2 in controlling Th2 induction by dendritic cells [^116BsmsL]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Dendritic cells (DCs) direct CD4(+) T-cell differentiation into diverse helper (Th) subsets that are required for protection against varied infections. However, the mechanisms used by DCs to promote Th2 responses, which are important both for immunity to helminth infection and in allergic disease, are currently poorly understood. We demonstrate a key role for the protein methyl-CpG-binding domain-2 (Mbd2), which links DNA methylation to repressive chromatin structure, in regulating expression of a range of genes that are associated with optimal DC activation and function. In the absence of Mbd2, DCs display reduced phenotypic activation and a markedly impaired capacity to initiate Th2 immunity against helminths or allergens. These data identify an epigenetic mechanism that is central to the activation of CD4(+) T-cell responses by DCs, particularly in Th2 settings, and reveal methyl-CpG-binding proteins and the genes under their control as possible therapeutic targets for type-2 inflammation.

### Regulation, diversity and function of MECP2 exon and 3' UTR isoforms [^115DyS6B]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) is a critical global regulator of gene expression. Mutations in MECP2 cause neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome (RTT). MECP2 exon 2 is spliced into two alternative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isoforms encoding MECP2-E1 or MECP2-E2 protein isoforms that differ in their N-termini. MECP2-E2, isolated first, was used to define the general roles of MECP2 in methyl-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding, targeting of transcriptional regulatory complexes, and its disease-causing impact in RTT. It was later found that MECP2-E1 is the most abundant isoform in the brain and its exon 1 is also mutated in RTT. MECP2 transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation generating mRNAs with four possible 3'untranslated region (UTR) lengths ranging from 130 to 8600 nt. Together, the exon and 3'UTR isoforms display remarkable abundance disparity across cell types and tissues during development. These findings indicate discrete means of regulation and suggest that protein isoforms perform non-overlapping roles. Multiple regulatory programs have been explored to explain these disparities. DNA methylation patterns of the MECP2 promoter and first intron impact MECP2-E1 and E2 isoform levels. Networks of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins also post-transcriptionally regulate the stability and translation efficiency of MECP2 3'UTR isoforms. Finally, distinctions in biophysical properties in the N-termini between MECP2-E1 and E2 lead to variable protein stabilities and DNA binding dynamics. This review describes the steps taken from the discovery of MECP2, the description of its key functions, and its association with RTT, to the emergence of evidence revealing how MECP2 isoforms are differentially regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels.

### Mechanisms of disease: methyl-binding domain proteins as potential therapeutic targets in cancer [^112HA3Hq]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

The methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins 'read' and interpret the methylation moieties on DNA, and thus are critical mediators of many epigenetic processes. Currently, the MBD family comprises five members; MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4 and MeCP2. Although not a 'classical' MBD protein, Kaiso also mediates transcriptional repression by using zinc finger domains to bind its targets. Since DNA hypermethylation is a well-recognized mechanism underlying gene silencing events in both tumorigenesis and drug resistance, it is likely that the MBD proteins may be important modulators of tumorigenesis. We review the recent work addressing this possibility, and discuss several of the MBD proteins as potentially excellent novel therapeutic targets.

Abstract

The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) is a critical global regulator of gene expression. Mutations in MECP2 cause neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome (RTT). MECP2 exon 2 is spliced into two alternative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isoforms encoding MECP2-E1 or MECP2-E2 protein isoforms that differ in their N-termini. MECP2-E2, isolated first, was used to define the general roles of MECP2 in methyl-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding, targeting of transcriptional regulatory complexes, and its disease-causing impact in RTT. It was later found that MECP2-E1 is the most abundant isoform in the brain and its exon 1 is also mutated in RTT. MECP2 transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation generating mRNAs with four possible 3′untranslated region (UTR) lengths ranging from 130 to 8600 nt. Together, the exon and 3′UTR isoforms display remarkable abundance disparity across cell types and tissues during development. These findings indicate discrete means of regulation and suggest that protein isoforms perform non-overlapping roles. Multiple regulatory programs have been explored to explain these disparities. DNA methylation patterns of the MECP2 promoter and first intron impact MECP2-E1 and E2 isoform levels. Networks of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins also post-transcriptionally regulate the stability and translation efficiency of MECP2 3′UTR isoforms. Finally, distinctions in biophysical properties in the N-termini between MECP2-E1 and E2 lead to variable protein stabilities and DNA binding dynamics. This review describes the steps taken from the discovery of MECP2, the description of its key functions, and its association with RTT, to the emergence of evidence revealing how MECP2 isoforms are differentially regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels.

### Proteins that bind methylated DNA and human cancer: reading the wrong words [^115Mxkm3]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

DNA methylation and the machinery involved in epigenetic regulation are key elements in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in embryonic development and the establishment of tissue-specific expression, X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting patterns, and maintenance of chromosome stability. The balance between all the enzymes and factors involved in DNA methylation and its interpretation by different groups of nuclear factors is crucial for normal cell behaviour. In cancer and other diseases, misregulation of epigenetic marks is a common feature, also including DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications. In this scenario, it is worth mentioning a family of proteins characterized by the presence of a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBDs) that are involved in interpreting the information encoded by DNA methylation and the recruitment of the enzymes responsible for establishing a silenced state of the chromatin. The generation of novel aberrantly hypermethylated regions during cancer development and progression makes MBD proteins interesting targets for their biological and clinical implications.

### The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 inhibits cGAS-associated signaling [^114jN67v]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The detection of cytosolic dsDNA by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is tightly regulated to avoid pathological inflammatory responses. Here, we show that the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a major transcriptional regulator, controls dsDNA-associated inflammatory responses. The presence of cytosolic dsDNA promotes MeCP2 export from the nucleus to the cytosol where it interacts with dsDNA, dampening detection by cGAS. MeCP2 export partially phenocopies MeCP2 deficiency, leading to innate immune activation and enforcing an antiviral state. Finally, MeCP2 displacement from the nucleus following dsDNA stimulation disrupts its canonical function, leading to the reactivation of otherwise repressed genes, such as endogenous retroelements. Re-expression of the latter leads to the accumulation of DNA species feeding cGAS-dependent signalling. We thus establish a direct role of MeCP2 in the regulation of the breadth and nature of dsDNA-associated inflammatory responses and suggest targeting dsDNA-associated pathways or endogenous retroelements as therapeutic options for patients with MeCP2 deficiency.

Table 1
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and methyl binding proteins. Dnmts establish and maintain methylation marks whilst methyl CpG binding proteins interpret these marks.

Abbreviations: MeCP – Methyl-CpG-binding protein, MBD – methyl-CpG binding domain.

Early models for the control of DNA methylation proposed two-steps: ' de novo methylation' by DNMTs active on unmethylated DNA e.g. DNMT3a and 3b, followed by 'maintenance methylation' by DNMT3a or by DNMT1 which is specific for the hemi-methylated DNA resulting from replication. However, the validity of this model has recently been questioned. There are a number of DNMTs and DNMT-interacting proteins reported mostly distinguished on the basis of structural similarity, sequence specificity but rarely primary function. Indeed most predicted proteins have been designated as being DNMTs solely because they have most, or all, of the conserved motifs observed in the catalytic domain of known DNMTs. The problem is compounded by the fact that DNMTs may also form complexes with each other.

### Rett syndrome: insights into genetic, molecular and circuit mechanisms [^1157SXiR]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Almost two decades of research into RTT have greatly advanced our understanding of the function and regulation of the multifunctional protein MeCP2. Here, we review recent advances in understanding how loss of MeCP2 impacts different stages of brain development, discuss recent findings demonstrating the molecular role of MeCP2 as a transcriptional repressor, assess primary and secondary effects of MeCP2 loss and examine how loss of MeCP2 can result in an imbalance of neuronal excitation and inhibition at the circuit level along with dysregulation of activity-dependent mechanisms. These factors present challenges to the search for mechanism-based therapeutics for RTT and suggest specific approaches that may be more effective than others.

### Methyl CpG binding proteins: coupling chromatin architecture to gene regulation [^111FdxvP]. Oncogene (2001). Low credibility.

A correlation between DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing has existed for many years. Recently, substantial progress has been reported in the search for proteins that interpret the regulatory information inherent in DNA methylation and translate this information into functional states, resulting in the identification of a family of highly conserved proteins, the MBD family. Direct connections between these proteins and histone modification enzymes have emerged as a common theme, implying that DNA methylation exerts its effects primarily through repressive chromatin architecture. Recent structural determinations of the DNA binding domain of two MBD family members, MeCP2 and MBD1, provide a framework to model the interactions of this family with DNA. Comparative sequence analysis and experimental DNA binding data can be interpreted using this structural framework allowing one to contrast the members of the MBD family with each other and to predict the properties of new family members. The identification of mutations in MeCP2, the founding member of this family, as causal for the neurological developmental disorder Rett Syndrome provides additional information regarding amino acid residues crucial to the functions of this interesting protein family.

### Methyl-CpG binding domain 2 (mbd2) is an epigenetic regulator of autism-risk genes and cognition [^1159EqQi]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain Protein family has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity. Some evidence linked this protein to neurodevelopment. However, its exact role in neurodevelopment and brain function is mostly unknown. Here we show that Mbd2-deficiency in mice (Mbd2-/-) results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Mbd2 binds regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus and loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in Mbd2-/- mice. Differentially expressed genes significantly overlap with gene-expression changes observed in brains of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals. Notably, downregulated genes are significantly enriched for human ortholog ASD risk genes. Observed hippocampal morphological abnormalities were similar to those found in individuals with ASD and ASD rodent models. Hippocampal Mbd2 knockdown partially recapitulates the behavioral phenotypes observed in Mbd2-/- mice. These findings suggest that Mbd2 is a novel epigenetic regulator of genes that are associated with ASD in humans. Mbd2 loss causes behavioral alterations that resemble those found in ASD individuals.

### A dominant role for the methyl-CpG-binding protein mbd2 in controlling Th2 induction by dendritic cells [^1137t8FY]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

In recent years, it has become clear that 'epigenetic' mechanisms, which alter gene expression without changing underlying DNA sequence, play an important role in regulating multiple aspects of T-cell differentiation and function. Although much less is known about epigenetic control of innate cells, it has recently been shown that histone methylation can regulate fibroblast and DC antiviral responses, as well as myeloid cell differentiation and activation.

Methyl-CpG-binding proteins are required for normal gene regulation during development. The methyl-CpG-binding domain protein, Mbd2, links DNA methylation to transcriptional silencing via the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Although Mbd2 is widely expressed in immune cellsand has previously been implicated in control of T-cell differentiation, no role has yet been identified for it in innate immune cells such as DCs.

We have assessed whether epigenetic control of gene expression is important for DC activation and function, and in the promotion of Th2 responses. Our results reveal that Mbd2 regulates DC expression of a suite of immunologically relevant genes and plays a dominant role in regulating the ability of DCs to prime type-2 responses in vitro and in vivo, against either helminths or allergens. This requirement for Mbd2 provides further evidence that Th2 priming by DCs is more than a passive 'default' process and highlights methyl-binding domain proteins, and the genes under their control, as novel therapeutic targets for Th2 inflammation.

### Unmasking of epigenetically silenced candidate tumor suppressor genes by removal of methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins [^111b5aaM]. Oncogene (2008). Low credibility.

Methyl-cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG)-binding domain (MBD) proteins are bound to hypermethylated promoter CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes in human cancer cells, although a direct causal relationship at the genome-wide level between MBD presence and gene silencing remains to be demonstrated. To this end, we have inhibited the expression of MBD proteins in HeLa cells by short hairpin RNAs; and studied the functional consequences of MBD depletion using microarray-based expression analysis in conjunction with extensive bisulfite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The removal of MBDs results in a release of gene silencing associated with a loss of MBD occupancy in 5'-CpG islands without any change in the DNA methylation pattern. Our results unveil new targets for epigenetic inactivation mediated by MBDs in transformed cells, such as the cell adhesion protein gamma-parvin and the fibroblast growth factor 19, where we also demonstrate their bona fide tumor suppressor features. Our data support a fundamental role for MBD proteins in the direct maintenance of transcriptional repression of tumor suppressors and identify new candidate genes for epigenetic disruption in cancer cells.

### The role of MeCP2 in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders [^116Wiz31]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Methyl CpG binding protein-2 (MeCP2) is an essential epigenetic regulator in human brain development. Rett syndrome, the primary disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, is characterized by a period of cognitive decline and development of hand stereotypies and seizures following an apparently normal early infancy. In addition, MECP2 mutations and duplications are observed in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including severe neonatal encephalopathy, X-linked mental retardation, and autism, implicating MeCP2 as an essential regulator of postnatal brain development. In this review, we compare the mutation types and inheritance patterns of the human disorders associated with MECP2. In addition, we summarize the current understanding of MeCP2 as a central epigenetic regulator of activity-dependent synaptic maturation. As MeCP2 occupies a central role in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, continued investigation into MeCP2 function and regulatory pathways may show promise for developing broad-spectrum therapies.

### Methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2 plays a key role in maintenance and spread of DNA methylation at CpG islands and shores in cancer [^111pvNwh]. Oncogene (2017). Low credibility.

Cancer is characterised by DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing of CpG island-associated promoters, including tumour-suppressor genes. The methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins bind to methylated DNA and can aid in the mediation of gene silencing through interaction with histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases. However, the mechanisms responsible for eliciting CpG island hypermethylation in cancer, and the potential role that MBD proteins play in modulation of the methylome remain unclear. Our previous work demonstrated that MBD2 preferentially binds to the hypermethylated GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells. Here, we use functional genetic approaches to investigate if MBD2 plays an active role in reshaping the DNA methylation landscape at this locus and genome-wide. First, we show that loss of MBD2 results in inhibition of both maintenance and spread of de novo methylation of a transfected construct containing the GSTP1 promoter CpG island in prostate cancer cells and Mbd2-/- mouse fibroblasts. De novo methylation was rescued by transient expression of Mbd2 in Mbd2-/- cells. Second, we show that MBD2 depletion triggers significant hypomethylation genome-wide in prostate cancer cells with concomitant loss of MBD2 binding at promoter and enhancer regulatory regions. Finally, CpG islands and shores that become hypomethylated after MBD2 depletion in LNCaP cancer cells show significant hypermethylation in clinical prostate cancer samples, highlighting a potential active role of MBD2 in promoting cancer-specific hypermethylation. Importantly, co-immunoprecipiation of MBD2 shows that MBD2 associates with DNA methyltransferase enzymes 1 and 3A. Together our results demonstrate that MBD2 has a critical role in 'rewriting' the cancer methylome at specific regulatory regions.

### Rett syndrome: reaching for clinical trials [^1135Wh9R]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a syndromic autism spectrum disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in MECP2. The methyl CpG binding protein 2 binds methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethycytosine at CpG sites in promoter regions of target genes, controlling their transcription by recruiting co-repressors and co-activators. Several preclinical studies in mouse models have identified rational molecular targets for drug therapies aimed at correcting the underlying neural dysfunction. These targeted therapies are increasingly translating into human clinical trials. In this review, we present an overview of RTT and describe the current state of preclinical studies in methyl CpG binding protein 2-based mouse models, as well as current clinical trials in individuals with RTT.

### Function and information content of DNA methylation [^116XHhd9]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Cytosine methylation is a DNA modification generally associated with transcriptional silencing. Factors that regulate methylation have been linked to human disease, yet how they contribute to malignances remains largely unknown. Genomic maps of DNA methylation have revealed unexpected dynamics at gene regulatory regions, including active demethylation by TET proteins at binding sites for transcription factors. These observations indicate that the underlying DNA sequence largely accounts for local patterns of methylation. As a result, this mark is highly informative when studying gene regulation in normal and diseased cells, and it can potentially function as a biomarker. Although these findings challenge the view that methylation is generally instructive for gene silencing, several open questions remain, including how methylation is targeted and recognized and in what context it affects genome readout.

### Preferential binding of the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 at methylated transcriptional start site regions [^113LPuuq]. Epigenetics (2011). Low credibility.

Methyl-CpG Binding Domain (MBD) proteins are thought to be key molecules in the interpretation of DNA methylation signals leading to gene silencing through recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes. In cancer, the MBD-family member, MBD2, may be primarily involved in the repression of genes exhibiting methylated CpG at their 5' end. Here we ask whether MBD2 randomly associates methylated sequences, producing chance effects on transcription, or exhibits a more specific recognition of some methylated regions. Using chromatin and DNA immunoprecipitation, we analyzed MBD2 and RNA polymerase II deposition and DNA methylation in HeLa cells on arrays representing 25,500 promoter regions. This first whole-genome mapping revealed the preferential localization of MBD2 near transcription start sites (TSSs), within the region analyzed, 7.5 kb upstream through 2.45 kb downstream of 5' transcription start sites. Probe by probe analysis correlated MBD2 deposition and DNA methylation. Motif analysis did not reveal specific sequence motifs; however, CCG and CGC sequences seem to be overrepresented. Nonrandom association (multiple correspondence analysis, p < 0.0001) between silent genes, DNA methylation and MBD2 binding was observed. The association between MBD2 binding and transcriptional repression weakened as the distance between binding site and TSS increased, suggesting that MBD2 represses transcriptional initiation. This hypothesis may represent a functional explanation for the preferential binding of MBD2 at methyl-CpG in TSS regions.

### MeCP2 binds to methylated DNA independently of phase separation and heterochromatin organisation [^114r9mpi]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Correlative evidence has suggested that the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 contributes to the formation of heterochromatin condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation. This interpretation has been reinforced by the observation that heterochromatin, DNA methylation and MeCP2 co-localise within prominent foci in mouse cells. The findings presented here revise this view. MeCP2 localisation is independent of heterochromatin as MeCP2 foci persist even when heterochromatin organisation is disrupted. Additionally, MeCP2 foci fail to show hallmarks of phase separation in live cells. Importantly, we find that mouse cellular models are highly atypical as MeCP2 distribution is diffuse in most mammalian species, including humans. Notably, MeCP2 foci are absent in Mus spretus which is a mouse subspecies lacking methylated satellite DNA repeats. We conclude that MeCP2 has no intrinsic tendency to form condensates and its localisation is independent of heterochromatin. Instead, the distribution of MeCP2 in the nucleus is primarily determined by global DNA methylation patterns.

### Methylated cytosine and the brain: a new base for neuroscience [^111NqjzE]. Neuron (2001). Low credibility.

Methylation of genomic CpG residues is crucial for proper neuronal function. Rett syndrome, a common form of mental retardation, is associated with mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2, a methyl CpG binding protein linked to transcriptional repression. Gene knockouts of mouse Mecp2 have reproduced key aspects of the disease. A CNS-restricted knockout of Dnmt1, encoding the enzyme that maintains CpG methylation patterns, results in loss of mutant neurons and glia.

### Proceedings of the birmingham cancer epigenetics conference; translational opportunities [^112FTFuw]. Clinical Epigenetics (2013). Low credibility.

The DNA sequence 5'CG (CpG) is self-complementary and can exist in three major chemical forms depending on the modification status of its cytosine moiety. To understand the functional significance of the CpG dinucleotide, we study proteins that bind either its methylated or unmethylated form. These proteins are likely mediators of CpG signalling that influence chromatin modification and thereby genome activity. The local density of CpG varies dramatically within genomic DNA. In the bulk genome CpG is rare and highly methylated, but in so-called "CpG islands" (CGIs) it is dense and usually non-methylated. A signature histone mark at non-methylated CGIs and also at transcriptionally active genes is trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4. We are exploring the mechanisms by which DNA sequence features that are shared by all CGIs influence this and other epigenetic marks. In contrast, proteins that interact with methyl-CpG are thought to promote gene silencing by recruiting transcriptional corepressors. In particular mutations in the gene for the methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 cause the autism spectrum disorder Rett Syndrome. By studying MeCP2 we are learning about its partner proteins that mediate effects on chromatin. These findings allow us to evaluate competing models for MeCP2 function and they illuminate the biology of DNA methylation and the molecular basis of this neurological condition.

### The role of MeCP2 in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders [^115NaMch]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

MeCP2 Function

MeCP2 is a member of a family of proteins that specifically bind to methylated DNA sequences in the genome. DNA methylation is a covalent modification to CpG dinucleotides and an epigenetic mark used by cells to alter expression of genes without permanently changing the DNA sequence. In this way, DNA methylation represents a mitotically heritable yet reversible modification to the genome. By binding to methylated DNA, MeCP2 can read these epigenetic marks in the genome and translate them into functional effects of modified gene expression.

Historically, DNA methylation has been thought to be a repressive mark, primarily when found at CpG-rich gene promoters. Therefore, MeCP2 was predicted to be a global repressor of transcription of genes by binding to methylated gene promoters and recruiting transcriptional repressors to silence gene expression. However, gene promoters are vastly de-enriched for DNA methylation, and global analyses of MeCP2-dependent expression have not yielded many clear target genes with densely methylated promoters that require MeCP2 for silencing, suggesting that the function of MeCP2 is broader than the proximal repression of methylated gene promoters. Recently, new models of MeCP2 function have been proposed in which MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional modulator capable of regulating increases and decreases in expression of transcriptionally active genes by long-range regulation of chromatin structure from distal methylation sites outside of gene promoters. An additional study suggested an activating role for MeCP2 by its interaction with the transcription factor CREB at the promoters of active genes.

### The role of MeCP2 in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders [^1151PSw9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The MECP2 gene encodes methyl CpG binding protein-2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional regulator required for proper neuronal development. Mutations in MECP2 are the major cause of the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked disorder that primarily affects females. MECP2 mutations and dysfunctions have also been associated with a broad array of other neurodevelopmental disorders in males and females, including X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), severe neonatal encephalopathy, Angelman's syndrome (AS), and autism, demonstrating that disruption of MeCP2 can have wide-ranging effects on neurodevelopment and lead to a spectrum of disorders. However, the extent of MECP2 mutations within these individual disorders is variable. Although MECP2 mutations can account for up to 96% of classic RTT, they are rare in other disorders (eg, autism), indicating that MECP2 is just one of many genes that could contribute to the broader spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Additionally, a clear correlation does not always exist between specific MECP2 mutations and individual disorders or phenotypic severity, suggesting that genetic, epigenetic, and/or environmental factors interact with the MECP2 mutation to determine the final phenotypic outcome in terms of type and severity of the disorder.

MECP2 mutations can be grouped into three general categories: severe loss-of-function mutations, mild loss-of-function mutations, and a broad group of duplications and other noncoding mutations that affect MeCP2 expression levels. Each mutation type is associated with a subset of disorders (Fig. 1). The involvement of MeCP2 in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders demonstrates that it occupies a central role in the postnatal development of the human brain. Understanding the role that MeCP2 plays in brain development and maturation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders and identifying potential therapeutic targets. To achieve this will require a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which MeCP2 acts, as well as how MeCP2 interacts with signaling and epigenetic pathways in the developing brain.

### MeCP2 ubiquitination and sumoylation, in search of a function [^1121rkbp]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

MeCP2 (Methyl CpG binding protein 2) is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds to methylated genome regions. The protein is a critical transcriptional regulator of the brain, and its mutations account for 95% of Rett syndrome (RTT) cases. Early studies of this neurodevelopmental disorder revealed a close connection with dysregulations of the ubiquitin system (UbS), notably as related to UBE3A, a ubiquitin ligase involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins. MeCP2 undergoes numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs), including ubiquitination and sumoylation, which, in addition to the potential functional outcomes of their monomeric forms in gene regulation and synaptic plasticity, in their polymeric organization, these modifications play a critical role in proteasomal degradation. UbS-mediated proteasomal degradation is crucial in maintaining MeCP2 homeostasis for proper function and is involved in decreasing MeCP2 in some RTT-causing mutations. However, regardless of all these connections to UbS, the molecular details involved in the signaling of MeCP2 for its targeting by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the functional roles of monomeric MeCP2 ubiquitination and sumoylation remain largely unexplored and are the focus of this review.

### Sequence features accurately predict genome-wide MeCP2 binding in vivo [^114Acbzx]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is critical for proper brain development and expressed at near-histone levels in neurons, but the mechanism of its genomic localization remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution MeCP2-binding data, we show that DNA sequence features alone can predict binding with 88% accuracy. Integrating MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in a probabilistic graphical model, we demonstrate that previously reported genome-wide association with methylation is in part due to MeCP2's affinity to GC-rich chromatin, a result replicated using published data. Furthermore, MeCP2 co-localizes with nucleosomes. Finally, MeCP2 binding downstream of promoters correlates with increased expression in Mecp2-deficient neurons.

### Proteins that bind methylated DNA and human cancer: reading the wrong words [^111uT5Px]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

DNA METHYLATION AND ITS MEDIATORS

DNA methylation is one of the most important mechanisms for epigenetic silencing in mammals. It is a key element in heterochromatin formation and maintenance, and is involved in processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and gene imprinting. DNA methylation also occurs at repetitive sequences to ensure chromosome stability. DNA methylation is developed by a family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) that add a methyl group to the fifth carbon position of cytosine when followed by a guanine nucleotide. Methylation of DNA is accompanied by histone post-translational modifications that modulate DNA function, regulating chromatin structure and determining the transcriptional state of the DNA wrapped around it.

The crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modifications is established by different nuclear factors. Among them, it is particularly remarkable a family of proteins that contain a Methyl-CpG-binding domain commonly known as MBD proteins that recognises single methylated CpG dinucleotide. MBD family members recruit histone modifying and chromatin remodeling complexes to methylated sites. The MBD family of proteins is composed by five members namely MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3 and MBD4. MeCP2 was the first characterised member and its 70 amino acids region corresponding to the MBD was used for database identification of the remaining MBD containing proteins. The binding affinity of MBD proteins differs between them, as was demonstrated that MBD2 is the MBD protein with higher methylated DNA-binding affinity in vitro.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2). Two decades of research have fostered the view that MeCP2 is a multifunctional chromatin protein that integrates diverse aspects of neuronal biology. More recently, studies have focused on specific RTT-associated mutations within the protein. This work has yielded molecular insights into the critical functions of MeCP2 that promise to simplify our understanding of RTT pathology.

### Evidence that direct inhibition of transcription factor binding is the prevailing mode of gene and repeat repression by DNA methylation [^114P65eG]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we asked to what extent repression of regulatory regions by DNA methylation depends on direct inhibition of binding of TFs versus indirect inhibition via sequence-independent recruitment of MBD proteins. Both stable and acute deletion of four MBD proteins with established 5mC binding in murine ES cells, differentiated neurons and a human cell line caused limited transcriptional response that appears not to be linked to methylation of regulatory sequences. This challenges a scenario where indirect repression mediated by the tested MBD proteins is essential for repression of CpG-dense methylated regulatory regions. Conversely, removal of DNA methylation results in upregulation of a group of genes controlled by otherwise methylated CpG island promoters in the tested cell states, as well as rampant transcription of endogenous retroviruses in neurons. In line with this upregulation being caused by methylation-sensitive TFs, we identify and validate new factors that are blocked from binding their motifs by DNA methylation and that activate genes and retroviruses in its absence. These results suggest that direct impediment of TF binding is a prevailing mechanism of methylation-mediated repression of regulatory regions in both human and mouse.

Importantly, these observations are compatible with other proposed functions of MBD proteins — in particular MeCP2 — in gene regulation, such as impacting transcriptional elongation by methyl-CA binding, alternative splicing, microRNA processingor protecting CA repeats from nucleosome invasion. While MBD proteins can have a repressive function — in particular when recruited to certain sites or at transfected reporter plasmids. — our experiments argue against functional redundancy between the four tested MBD proteins as a reason for the absence of more severe transcriptional phenotypes, as hypothesized in previous loss-of-function studies of selected MBD proteins. It remains conceivable that the MBD proteins we tested participate in stabilizing aspects of transcriptional repression, in a way that is redundant in the cell systems we employed, yet relevant in vivo in different contexts. It remains possible that other, currently uncharacterized, sequence-agnostic methyl-CpG binding proteins exist and are able to mediate indirect repression. TAM domain proteins, seem unlikely candidates because they do not bind methylated DNA, and show only weak homology in the MBD domain. The plant-specific MBD5 and MBD6 are readers of methylated DNA and mediate transcriptional repression at a subset of genes and repeatsvia the recruitment of chaperone activity, yet are unrelated and nonhomologous.

### A study of the treatment of Rett syndrome with folate and betaine [^11596EYc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that increasing methyl-group pools might promote transcriptional repression by other methyl-binding proteins or by mutant methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 with altered affinity, ameliorating the clinical features of Rett syndrome. A 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled folate-betaine trial enrolled 73 methylCpG-binding protein 2 mutation positive female participants meeting consensus criteria for Rett syndrome. Participants were randomized as young (< age 5 years) or old (≥ age 5 years). Structured clinical assessments occurred at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary outcome measures included quantitative evaluation of breathing and hand movements during wakefulness, growth, anthropometry, motor/behavioral function, and qualitative evaluations from electroencephalograms and parent questionnaires. In all, 68 participants completed the study. Objective evidence of improvement was not found. Subjective improvement from parent questionnaires was noted for the < 5 years group. This study should inform future treatment trials regarding balancing participants with specific mutations and comparable severity to minimize selection bias.

### Low levels of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 are accompanied by an increased vulnerability to the negative outcomes of stress exposure during childhood in healthy women [^113mP9sJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The X-linked Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) is a reader of the DNA methylome and plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression in the brain. MECP2 activity, which is regulated by post-translational modifications of the protein, is modulated by neuronal firing, thus strongly contributing to the adaptability of neurons to a dynamic environment. Of note, stressful events early in infancy, which are recognized to be a major cause of increased vulnerability to future challenges, were found to affect MECP2 functionality, thus allowing an enduring reorganization of methylation and expression of stress-related genes, suggesting a potential involvement of this protein in shaping vulnerability to develop stress-related psychopathology. In line with this, MECP2 was found to be mutated or differentially expressed in a number of mental disorders whose onset can be triggered by stress such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. Moreover, regulation of MECP2 functionality has been suggested to contribute to both depressive-like symptoms and their mitigation by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as to drug craving in substance abuse disorders.

In spite of the increasing evidence of MECP2 involvement in stress-related psychopathology, its role in prompting disease vulnerability has so far received little attention. We have shown that a hypomorphic mutation in the MeCP2 gene provides vulnerability to develop behavioral and molecular features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in trauma-exposed mice, suggesting that MECP2 could represent a marker of stress susceptibility.

Based on this evidence, this study explored whether MECP2 expression levels may be associated with increased stress vulnerability in humans. To this aim we examined MECP2 expression levels in blood samples from healthy volunteers, and assessed MECP2 interaction with depressive and anxiety symptom clusters, hereby considered as proxies of increased risk to develop mental disorders related to stress. Previous studies have in fact demonstrated that individuals with subthreshold symptoms are more likely to develop a mental disorder compared to individuals without such symptoms.

### Radically truncated MeCP2 rescues Rett syndrome-like neurological defects [^111y1uUw]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine. Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex), transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions (approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

### CpG islands influence chromatin structure via the CpG-binding protein cfp1 [^116wbXjq]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

CpG islands (CGIs) are prominent in the mammalian genome owing to their GC-rich base composition and high density of CpG dinucleotides. Most human gene promoters are embedded within CGIs that lack DNA methylation and coincide with sites of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), irrespective of transcriptional activity. In spite of these intriguing correlations, the functional significance of non-methylated CGI sequences with respect to chromatin structure and transcription is unknown. By performing a search for proteins that are common to all CGIs, here we show high enrichment for Cfp1, which selectively binds to non-methylated CpGs in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of a mono-allelically methylated CGI confirmed that Cfp1 specifically associates with non-methylated CpG sites in vivo. High throughput sequencing of Cfp1-bound chromatin identified a notable concordance with non-methylated CGIs and sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain. Levels of H3K4me3 at CGIs were markedly reduced in Cfp1-depleted cells, consistent with the finding that Cfp1 associates with the H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1 (refs 7, 8). To test whether non-methylated CpG-dense sequences are sufficient to establish domains of H3K4me3, we analysed artificial CpG clusters that were integrated into the mouse genome. Despite the absence of promoters, the insertions recruited Cfp1 and created new peaks of H3K4me3. The data indicate that a primary function of non-methylated CGIs is to genetically influence the local chromatin modification state by interaction with Cfp1 and perhaps other CpG-binding proteins.

### Evidence that direct inhibition of transcription factor binding is the prevailing mode of gene and repeat repression by DNA methylation [^11171eca]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Main

Over 80% of cytosines in the context of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in mammalian genomes. Methylation of CpG-dense promoters causes stable transcriptional repression, and is the basis for long-term monoallelic silencing, such as X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. DNA methylation is also associated with silencing of retrotransposons in somatic tissuesand tumor suppressor genes in cancer.

Two pathways, which are not mutually exclusive, are presumed to be responsible. The first operates in an indirect manner, via proteins that recognize methylated CpGs, as first shown for the MBD of MeCP2. Based on homology, four additional MBD proteins (MBD1–4) as well as six proteins with an MBD-like domain, also known as a TAM (TIP5/ARBP/MBD) domain, were discovered –; the latter, however, did not bind methylated DNA. Only four MBD proteins harbor a functional domain that binds methylated DNA in vitro and in vivo: MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2 and MBD4 (refs.). MBD3 harbors a mutated MBD, which does not locate to methylated sequences in the genome,– and is not required for its function. Other factors bind methylated DNA via structurally divergent domains yet require additional sequence context or are limited to hemimethylated DNA. In contrast, 5mC-binding MBD proteins recognize symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides in a largely sequence-independent fashion. Together with protein interaction studies and in vitro experiments, these findings have established a model in which MBD proteins recruit histone deacetylases to methylated DNA, contributing to transcriptional repression –.

The second mechanism for repression is direct obstruction of TF binding by cytosine methylation within their motif. Although sensitivity of several TFs to methylation of their binding site has been observed in biochemical assays –, evidence in the cellular context remains scarce –.

Defining the contribution of both pathways is critical for our understanding of epigenetic silencing in mammals. Loss of individual MBD proteins results in only mild phenotypes in mice – with the exception of MeCP2, whose mutation can cause Rett syndrome. Combinatorial deletions of Mbd2/MeCP2 (ref.) or Mbd2/MeCP2/Kaiso in mice did not reveal a pronounced phenotype (other than Rett syndrome). Functional redundancy between MBDs has accordingly been suggested to account for the absence of severe transcriptional upregulation in the single or combinatorial knockouts generated thus far. To date, no combined genetic deletion of all four MBD proteins has been reported.

### Testing the PEST hypothesis using relevant Rett mutations in MeCP2 E1 and E2 isoforms [^114KoFXu]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MeCP2 (Methyl-CpG binding protein 2) was identified based on its ability to bind to methylated DNA, in particular methylated CpG, but also to mCH (H = A, T or C). It is a vertebrate protein with two isoforms, E1 and E2, that are the product of alternative splicing. Despite its intrinsically disordered nature, it has been divided into six different domains (1, 3) (Fig. 1A). From the early studies, the protein was shown to interact with the transcriptional repressor Sin3a through its transcriptional repressor domain (TRD), yet it also upregulates transcription by interacting with CREB1 transcriptional activator. Mutations in MeCP2 account for most Rett syndrome phenotypes, and a crucial part of these mutations are clustered within the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) and TRD. Indeed, mice expressing a minimal version of the protein consisting only of the MBD and TRD show substantially improved neurological symptoms when introduced into a MeCP2-deficient mouse model of RTT. Despite the well-established link between MeCP2 mutations and Rett syndrome (RTT), this fascinating protein has many other functions; a notable example is the classification of MeCP2 as a bona fide oncogene in several types of human cancer. The protein also involves many other neurological disorders beyond RTT. Regardless of its ability to bind methylated DNA, MeCP2 is a global transcriptional regulator critical for proper brain function, in which the protein is predominantly found.

### MeCP2 in neurons: closing in on the causes of Rett syndrome [^114sFX36]. Human Molecular Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

The discovery in 1999 that Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding repressor protein MECP2 provided a significant breakthrough in the understanding of this devastating disease. The subsequent production of Mecp2 knockout mice 2 years later provided an experimental resource to better understand how mutations in the MECP2 gene result in RTT. This paper reviews the recent progress in understanding when and where MeCP2 function becomes important in the developing brain, why MeCP2 protein levels are crucial, which genes are normally silenced by MeCP2, and how misexpression of these targets might lead to the clinical manifestations of RTT.

### MeCP2 interacts with chromosomal microRNAs in brain [^115p1o67]. Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Although methyl CpG binding domain protein-2 (MeCP2) is commonly understood to function as a silencing factor at methylated DNA sequences, recent studies also show that MeCP2 can bind unmethylated sequences and coordinate gene activation. MeCP2 displays broad binding patterns throughout the genome, with high expression levels similar to histone H1 in neurons. Despite its significant presence in the brain, only subtle gene expression changes occur in the absence of MeCP2. This may reflect a more complex regulatory mechanism of MeCP2 to complement chromatin binding. Using an RNA immunoprecipitation of native chromatin technique, we identify MeCP2 interacting microRNAs in mouse primary cortical neurons. In addition, comparison with mRNA sequencing data from Mecp2-null mice suggests that differentially expressed genes may indeed be targeted by MeCP2-interacting microRNAs. These findings highlight the MeCP2 interaction with microRNAs that may modulate its binding with chromatin and regulate gene expression.

### Exploring the complexity of MECP2 function in Rett syndrome [^1171ViJa]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in the methyl-DNA-binding protein MECP2. MECP2 is an important epigenetic regulator that plays a pivotal role in neuronal gene regulation, where it has been reported to function as both a repressor and an activator. Despite extensive efforts in mechanistic studies over the past two decades, a clear consensus on how MECP2 dysfunction impacts molecular mechanisms and contributes to disease progression has not been reached. Here, we review recent insights from epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies that advance our understanding of MECP2 as an interacting hub for DNA, RNA and transcription factors, orchestrating diverse processes that are crucial for neuronal function. By discussing findings from different model systems, we identify crucial epigenetic details and cofactor interactions, enriching our understanding of the multifaceted roles of MECP2 in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure. These mechanistic insights offer potential avenues for rational therapeutic design for RTT.

### Evidence that direct inhibition of transcription factor binding is the prevailing mode of gene and repeat repression by DNA methylation [^115toSkU]. Nature Genetics (2022). High credibility.

Cytosine methylation efficiently silences CpG-rich regulatory regions of genes and repeats in mammalian genomes. To what extent this entails direct inhibition of transcription factor (TF) binding versus indirect inhibition via recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins is unclear. Here we show that combinatorial genetic deletions of all four proteins with functional MBDs in mouse embryonic stem cells, derived neurons or a human cell line do not reactivate genes or repeats with methylated promoters. These do, however, become activated by methylation-restricted TFs if DNA methylation is removed. We identify several causal TFs in neurons, including ONECUT1, which is methylation sensitive only at a motif variant. Rampantly upregulated retrotransposons in methylation-free neurons feature a CRE motif, which activates them in the absence of DNA methylation via methylation-sensitive binding of CREB1. Our study reveals methylation-sensitive TFs in vivo and argues that direct inhibition, rather than indirect repression by the tested MBD proteins, is the prevailing mechanism of methylation-mediated repression at regulatory regions and repeats.

### Proteins that bind methylated DNA and human cancer: reading the wrong words [^11356QX2]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

MBD3

The gene coding MBD3 is located on chromosome 19. Methyl-CpG-binding domain 3 has two splicing variants that differ in size, 32 and 20 kDa. In mammals, MBD3 is unable to bind methylated DNA due to the presence of two alterations within the MBD. Despite the lack of a functional methyl-CpG-binding domain, MBD3 plays an important role in DNA methylation-dependent events. MBD3 deficient mice die early during embryonic development.

Methyl-CpG-binding domain 3 is an integral subunit of the chromatin remodelling complex Mi-2/NuRD (Figure 1). This complex is also composed by histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, the chromatin-remodelling protein Mi-2 and metastasis-associated proteins MTA1 and MTA2. Mi-2/NuRD association with MBD2 leads to MeCP1 complex, initially identified as a methylated DNA-binding protein and later like a complex containing MBD proteins.

Mi-2/NuRD-mediated silencing of methylated genes was hypothesised as starting with MBD2 binding to methylated DNA followed by Mi-2/NuRD recruitment. However, MBD2 and MBD3 associate to the Mi-2/NuRD complex in a mutually exclusive way with different biochemistry and functional properties. Proteins interacting with MBD2/Mi-2 complex, but not with MBD3/Mi-2 complex, have been identified, for instance PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase (RMT). This model proposes a mechanism in which methylated DNA would be recognised by MBD2/Mi-2 complex leading to arginine methylation and histone hypoacetylation of the histone next to methylated DNA. This new state of the chromatin structure would be the target of MBD3 containing Mi-2 complex enhance histone deacetylation spreading to proximal regions.

### Rett syndrome: disruption of epigenetic control of postnatal neurological functions [^112jmagk]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) cause a devastating pediatric neurological disorder called Rett syndrome. In males, these mutations typically result in severe neonatal encephalopathy and early lethality. On the other hand, owing to expression of the normal allele in ∼50% of cells, females do not suffer encephalopathy but instead develop Rett syndrome. Typically females with Rett syndrome exhibit a delayed onset of neurologic dysfunction that manifests around the child's first birthday and progresses over the next few years. Features of this disorder include loss of acquired language and motor skills, intellectual impairment and hand stereotypies. The developmental regression observed in patients with Rett syndrome arises from altered neuronal function and is not the result of neurodegeneration. Maintenance of an appropriate level of MeCP2 appears integral to the function of healthy neurons as patients with increased levels of MeCP2, owing to duplication of the Xq28 region encompassing the MECP2 locus, also present with intellectual disability and progressive neurologic symptoms. Despite major efforts over the past two decades to elucidate the molecular functions of MeCP2, the mechanisms underlying the delayed appearance of symptoms remain unclear. In this review, we will highlight recent findings that have expanded our knowledge of MeCP2's functions, and we will discuss how epigenetic regulation, chromatin organization and circuit dynamics may contribute to the postnatal onset of Rett syndrome.

### SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of MeCP2 contributes to BDNF expression [^117DeX6U]. Epigenetics (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is capable of binding methylated cytosines at CpG sites, and mutations in its gene have been associated with Rett Syndrome. It has been previously described that post-translational modifications can regulate MeCP2 protein function. Phosphorylation at serine 80 or serine 421 regulate, in opposite ways, the binding or release of MeCP2 from BDNF gene promoter. In this study, we demonstrated that MeCP2 undergoes lysine acetylation, an event mediated by the acetyltransferase p300 in vitro. More interestingly, SIRT1, a NAD + -dependent histone deacetylase, appears to mediate the opposite reversible reaction. Importantly, accumulating evidence underscores the importance of this histone deacetylase in regulating neuronal differentiation.

We speculate that SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of MeCP2 could allow its release from the methylated CpG sites within the BDNF exon 4 promoter leading to increased BDNF transcription. In keeping with this hypothesis, the absence of a functional SIRT1 in SIRT1 Δex4 mice prevents the release of the acetylated MeCP2 from the BDNF promoter, resulting in decreased expression.

Our findings indicate that control of BDNF expression may implicate the interplay of two epigenetic pathways, where SIRT1-mediated deacetylation appears to influence MeCP2 binding to methylated DNA. Due to the strong connection between SIRT1 and metabolism, this scenario also contemplates the intriguing possibility that MeCP2 function may be modulated by changes in the metabolic state of specific neurons.

### SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of MeCP2 contributes to BDNF expression [^111VVeTb]. Epigenetics (2012). Low credibility.

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binds methylated cytosines at CpG sites on DNA and it is thought to function as a critical epigenetic regulator. Mutations in the MeCP2 gene have been associated to Rett syndrome, a human neurodevelopmental disorder. Here we show that MeCP2 is acetylated by p300 and that SIRT1 mediates its deacetylation. SIRT1, the mammalian homologue of Sir2 in yeast, is a nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent histone deacetylase that belongs to the family of HDAC class III sirtuins. Importantly, SIRT1 has been shown to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This study reveals a functional interplay between two critical epigenetic regulators, MeCP2 and SIRT1, which controls MeCP2 binding activity to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promoter in a specific region of the brain.

### Functions of DNA methylation: islands, start sites, gene bodies and beyond [^111iRogt]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2012). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation is frequently described as a 'silencing' epigenetic mark, and indeed this function of 5-methylcytosine was originally proposed in the 1970s. Now, thanks to improved genome-scale mapping of methylation, we can evaluate DNA methylation in different genomic contexts: transcriptional start sites with or without CpG islands, in gene bodies, at regulatory elements and at repeat sequences. The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. Improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.

### Context-dependent CpG methylation directs cell-specific binding of transcription factor ZBTB38 [^116jCQxq]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation on CpGs regulates transcription in mammals, both by decreasing the binding of methylation-repelled factors and by increasing the binding of methylation-attracted factors. Among the latter, zinc finger proteins have the potential to bind methylated CpGs in a sequence-specific context. The protein ZBTB38 is unique in that it has two independent sets of zinc fingers, which recognize two different methylated consensus sequences in vitro. Here, we identify the binding sites of ZBTB38 in a human cell line, and show that they contain the two methylated consensus sequences identified in vitro. In addition, we show that the distribution of ZBTB38 sites is highly unusual: while 10% of the ZBTB38 sites are also bound by CTCF, the other 90% of sites reside in closed chromatin and are not bound by any of the other factors mapped in our model cell line. Finally, a third of ZBTB38 sites are found upstream of long and active CpG islands. Our work therefore validates ZBTB38 as a methyl-DNA binder in vivo and identifies its unique distribution in the genome.

### The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 inhibits cGAS-associated signaling [^114MMNCV]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cytosolic dsDNAs are recognized drivers of chronic inflammation in a broad range of human diseases. A major pathway involved in detecting cytosolic dsDNA and triggering the subsequent activation of inflammatory responses, relies on the cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) pathogen recognition receptor –. The interaction of cytosolic dsDNAs with cGAS leads to the production of the 2'3'-cGAMP second messenger, which in turn interacts with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) adaptor protein, promoting the recruitment and activation of transcription factors, such as the Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), that drive a transcriptional programme ultimately leading to the production of type I Interferons (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines –. Regulation of the cGAS-STING signalling axis at several levels has been reported, including STING degradation, or regulators of cGAS catalytic activity. In contrast, although the detection of dsDNA by cGAS is a key rate-limiting step in the activation of cGAS-STING signalling, few regulators of this interaction have been identified to date. Those include the Three-prime exonuclease 1 (TREX1), the ablation of which feeds cGAS-STING-dependent signalling through endogenous cytosolic DNA accumulation, and underlying the most severe form of Aicardi-Gouttière Syndrome (AGS). This highlights the importance of the regulation of the cytosolic DNA-cGAS interaction for the regulation of pro-inflammatory signalling.

Pathological activation of cGAS-STING signalling has been documented in a wide range of neurological disorders, mostly highlighting a link between chronic STING signalling and neurodegeneration –. Similarly, chronic inflammatory responses and immunological dysfunction have been reported in the Rett syndrome neurodevelopmental disorder (RTT; OMIM 312750). RTT is a rare genetic disorder frequently associated with de novo mutations in the Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) X-linked gene, giving rise to dysfunctional MeCP2. Neurological manifestations of RTT have been shown to be reversibleand accompanied by immunological dysfunction as well as chronic low-grade inflammation –. Indeed, the absence of MeCP2 sensitizes immune cells to pro-inflammatory stimulation. While inflammation has been proposed to be associated with RTT disease progression and severity, there is no mechanism explaining the onset of chronic inflammation in RTT.

### Acute and crucial requirement for MeCP2 function upon transition from early to late adult stages of brain maturation [^1121keSY]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Germline mutations in the X-linked gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), underlie most cases of Rett syndrome (RTT), an autism spectrum disorder affecting approximately one in 10 000 female live births. The disease is characterized in affected girls by a latent appearance of symptoms between 12 and 18 months of age while boys usually die before the age of two. The nature of the latency is not known, but RTT-like phenotypes are recapitulated in mouse models, even when MeCP2 is removed at different postnatal stages, including juvenile and adolescent stages. Unexpectedly, here, we show that within a very brief developmental window, between 10 (adolescent) and 15 (adult) weeks after birth, symptom initiation and progression upon removal of MeCP2 in male mice transitions from 3 to 4 months to only several days, followed by lethality. We further show that this accelerated development of RTT phenotype and lethality occur at the transition to adult stage (15 weeks of age) and persists thereafter. Importantly, within this abbreviated time frame of days, the brain acquires dramatic anatomical, cellular and molecular abnormalities, typical of classical RTT. This study reveals a new postnatal developmental stage, which coincides with full-brain maturation, where the structure/function of the brain is extremely sensitive to levels of MeCP2 and loss of MeCP2 leads to precipitous collapse of the neuronal networks and incompatibility with life within days.

### Context-dependent CpG methylation directs cell-specific binding of transcription factor ZBTB38 [^114YsAb2]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

ZBTB38 is a ZNF transcription factor considered a methyl-CpG binding protein due to its ability to bind with high-affinity methylated sequences in vitro. Two clusters of ZNFs exhibit methyl-CpG binding activity in the protein. A central KAISO-like ZNFs cluster was first described for its ability to bind methyl-CpG sequences. A second C-terminal ZNFs cluster recognizes a SELEX-enriched ATmeCGGmeCG sequence (also called mCZ38BS) in vitro and in cells. Several studies have revealed that ZBTB38 (Cibz / Zbtb38 in the mouse) regulates cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation. The function of ZBTB38 in cell growth is complex as its depletion (or genetic inactivation) can either promote, reduce, or not affect cell proliferation according to cell types, which echoes its potential function as an oncogene or tumour suppressor in cancers. Further highlighting the pleiotropic, context-specific, and tissue-specific effects of ZBTB38, many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) either within or in close proximity to ZBTB38 have been associated with adult height and many diseases including idiopathic short stature, atopic dermatitis, macular degeneration, osteoporosis, prion disease, and prostate cancer.

To shed light on the functions of ZBTB38 and its relationship with DNA methylation, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of ZBTB38 binding sites in the human genome. We demonstrate that ZBTB38 binds a large number of regions in the genome in a DNA methylation- and sequence-dependent manner, including a transcriptional program involved in the response to doxorubicin.

### The story of Rett syndrome: from clinic to neurobiology [^115HUCYv]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

The postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional repressor involved in chromatin remodeling and the modulation of RNA splicing. MECP2 aberrations result in a constellation of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, whereby both loss of function and gain in MECP2 dosage lead to similar neurological phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate disease reversibility in RTT mouse models, suggesting that the neurological defects in MECP2 disorders are not permanent. To investigate the potential for restoring neuronal function in RTT patients, it is essential to identify MeCP2 targets or modifiers of the phenotype that can be therapeutically modulated. Moreover, deciphering the molecular underpinnings of RTT is likely to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of a broader class of neuropsychiatric disorders.

### MeCP2 regulates gene expression through recognition of H3K27me3 [^112CfZU6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

MeCP2 plays a multifaceted role in gene expression regulation and chromatin organization. Interaction between MeCP2 and methylated DNA in the regulation of gene expression is well established. However, the widespread distribution of MeCP2 suggests it has additional interactions with chromatin. Here we demonstrate, by both biochemical and genomic analyses, that MeCP2 directly interacts with nucleosomes and its genomic distribution correlates with that of H3K27me3. In particular, the methyl-CpG-binding domain of MeCP2 shows preferential interactions with H3K27me3. We further observe that the impact of MeCP2 on transcriptional changes correlates with histone post-translational modification patterns. Our findings indicate that MeCP2 interacts with genomic loci via binding to DNA as well as histones, and that interaction between MeCP2 and histone proteins plays a key role in gene expression regulation.

### MeCP2 links heterochromatin condensates and neurodevelopmental disease [^117Fep1Z]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a key component of constitutive heterochromatin, which is crucial for chromosome maintenance and transcriptional silencing 1–3. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the progressive neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome 3–5, which is associated with severe mental disability and autism-like symptoms that affect girls during early childhood. Although previously thought to be a dense and relatively static structure 1,2, heterochromatin is now understood to exhibit properties consistent with a liquid-like condensate 6,7. Here we show that MeCP2 is a dynamic component of heterochromatin condensates in cells, and is stimulated by DNA to form liquid-like condensates. MeCP2 contains several domains that contribute to the formation of condensates, and mutations in MECP2 that lead to Rett syndrome disrupt the ability of MeCP2 to form condensates. Condensates formed by MeCP2 selectively incorporate and concentrate heterochromatin cofactors rather than components of euchromatic transcriptionally active condensates. We propose that MeCP2 enhances the separation of heterochromatin and euchromatin through its condensate partitioning properties, and that disruption of condensates may be a common consequence of mutations in MeCP2 that cause Rett syndrome.

### Understanding the structural and dynamic consequences of DNA epigenetic modifications: computational insights into cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation [^116hVmwt]. Epigenetics (2014). Low credibility.

Another interesting cytosine modification is hydroxymethylation, which was recently discovered to also be present in significant amounts in the genome. While its functions are still unclear, it appears to be involved in gene regulation, and interference with hydroxymethylated cytosines can result in a variety of cancers, including myeloid cancers. Even though no protein has been found to interact with hydroxymethylation sites on DNA, 10–11 translocation proteins (TET) have been identified as converters of methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine.

Functionally, DNA methylation is crucial for both the developmental and adult stages of an organism. Its presence in highly repetitive sequences makes it a powerful mechanism for gene silencing, in order to maintain genome stability and integrity. In the absence of methylation in these regions, illegitimate recombination can occur, with severe mutagenic consequences for the genome, such as duplications, deletions, insertions, and translocations. Additionally, inactivation of transposable elements is of extreme importance, because these elements are also highly mutagenic and can self-replicate and be inserted in other regions of the genome, most likely disrupting essential genes for normal cellular function.

It is believed that DNA methylation leads to gene silencing by 2 different mechanisms: first, methylated CpG-binding proteins (MeCP1 and 2) recognize and bind methylated CpG dinucleotides and themselves alter transcription due to their transcription repression domain. They also recruit other factors involved in chromatin condensation. Additionally, methylated CpG nucleotides may directly inhibit the binding of transcription factors and alter gene expression. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications exert their effects are unclear. For example, adding a methyl group to cytosine alters the hydrophobicity of the major groove and also provides steric hindrance for certain DNA-binding proteins. Crystallographic data suggests C5-methylation has small effects on the overall double-helix structure, although IR spectroscopy has demonstrated that C5-methylation shifts the equilibrium between different backbone sugar pucker conformations of DNA in solution. Therefore, the main aim of this work is to understand the effects of cytosine modification on the fundamental structural properties of DNA before binding to proteins or other ligands. This is a problem of major biological importance, as the reshaping of DNA methylation patterns throughout the genome is connected to a variety of human diseases, including (but not limited to) imprinting syndromes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. For instance, hypomethylation of transposable elements and hypermethylation of CpG islands flanking gene promoters involved in cell cycle regulation are examples of deregulation of methylation in cancer.

### MeCP2 regulates gene expression through recognition of H3K27me3 [^114HUAAa]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is highly expressed in neurons, where expression increases postnatally after the final stage of neurogenesis. Mutations in the MECP2 gene constitute the primary cause of the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) –. It was hypothesized that MeCP2 functions as a transcriptional repressor that targets methylated DNA at CpG islands to repress transcription. Using high throughput assays, several studies demonstrated that, in addition to its affinity to methylated CpG, MeCP2 is also localized to methylated cytosine in the non-CG context (mCH, where H = A, C, or T) and to many non-methylated loci –.

We recently found that MeCP2 localization can be predicted by genomic DNA sequence features, particularly regions of high GC content where intrinsic nucleosome occupancy is observed. Several studies, including ours, demonstrated that MeCP2 co-localized with nucleosomes or the nucleosome associated protein, histone H1. In addition, in native co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, MeCP2 binds to H3K9/H3K27 methylated nucleosomes in brain tissue. Moreover, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, MeCP2 is associated with H3K9 methylation in the IL6 gene region. These studies suggest that MeCP2 affinity to chromatin can be achieved through binding to DNA as well as to histones.

In this study, we demonstrate that MeCP2 can be recruited to genomic loci via binding to H3K27me3 and co-enrichment of MeCP2 and H3K27me3 at transcription start site (TSS) cooperatively regulates gene expression. Our findings indicate that MeCP2, in addition to direct DNA binding, can interact with chromatin via histone protein and that MeCP2 interaction with histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) plays significant roles in transcription regulation.

### Epigenetic mechanisms involved in hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression [^1145gguj]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation, on the other hand, can recruit methyl-binding proteins (MBPs) to methylated sites, where they function as scaffolds to recruit members of chromatin remodelling complexes.MBPs are broadly categorised into three main families: methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins, which specifically recognise symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides; SET-associated and Really Interesting New Gene (RING)-associated domain-containing proteins, which display higher binding affinity towards hemi-methylated regions; and methyl-CpG binding zinc finger proteins, which can bind to both methylated and unmethylated DNA. Collectively, these MBP families translate DNA methylation marks into transcriptional activation or repression, depending on the cellular context.

Epigenetic readers are pivotal in interpreting the histone code, and their dysregulation can lead to abnormal gene expression, fuelling oncogenesis, tumour growth and metastasis. Among these, BRD4 has attracted considerable attention for its elevated expression in HCC tissues, where it promotes EMT. BRD4 binds acetylated histones, particularly H3K27ac, which are highly present in large enhancers known as super-enhancers, driving the transcription of oncogenes. Other BRD-containing proteins, including BRD9, Bromodomain Phd-Finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) and BRPF1, also contribute to HCC progression through distinct mechanisms that are only partially understood. BRD9's oncogenic role is likely associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin and TUFT1/AKT signalling pathways. Meanwhile, BPTF influences the transcriptional upregulation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and BRPF1 regulates various oncogenes, including E2F2 and EZH2. In contrast, BRD7 appears to activate the p53 pathway in HCC, indicating a potential tumour-suppressive function. While less studied, chromodomain proteins are increasingly recognised for their roles in hepatocarcinogenesis.

### The odyssey of MeCP2 and parental imprinting [^112djZLk]. Epigenetics (2006). Low credibility.

DNA methylation in mammals has long been implicated in the epigenetic mechanism of parental imprinting, in which selective expression of one allele of specific genes is based on parental origin. Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) selectively binds to methylated DNA and mutations in the MECP2 cause the autism-spectrum neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome. This review outlines the emerging story of how MeCP2 has been implicated in the regulation of specific imprinted genes and loci, including UBE3A and DLX5. The story of MeCP2 and parental imprinting has unfolded with some interesting but unexpected twists, revealing new insights on the function of MeCP2 in the process.

### The correlation between CpG methylation and gene expression is driven by sequence variants [^116bQDGP]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Main

Cytosines preceding guanines in DNA (CpG dinucleotides) are modified predominantly by the addition of a methyl group in humans and other vertebrates. This modification is commonly known as CpG methylation, or 5-mCpG, where the number 5 indicates the position of the methyl group on the carbon ring of cytosine. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible for adding methyl groups to CpGs. DNMTs are essential in mice as their deletion results in embryonic death, but these embryos are nonetheless able to form all main cell types.

DNA regulatory sequences, for example, promoters and enhancers, are frequently bound by transcription factors (TFs), and depleted of CpG methylation. Promoter sequences are found frequently within so-called CpG islandscontaining a high density of CpGs that are typically unmethylatedprobably because of TF binding counteracting DNMTs –. DNA sequence variability in TF binding sites represents a plausible mechanism by which variation in CpG methylation arises –.

There are TFs that bind to CpG-containing motifs in DNA and some (but not all) of these TFs are influenced by CpG methylation in their binding site. By influencing the binding sites of some TFs, CpG methylation may therefore be involved in regulating gene expression, repeat repressionand imprinting. CpG methylation is nonetheless modified dynamically as a consequence of protein (for example, TF) binding to DNA. Hence, CpG methylation is highly malleable by TFs and, for this reason, CpG methylation status is not necessarily the driving force of correlation between CpG methylation and gene expression –.

In this study, we searched for cis -acting influences of sequence variants on CpG methylation and explored the relevance of this DNA sequence variability to correlations observed between CpG methylation and gene expression.

### Fat-specific knockout of mecp2 upregulates slpi to reduce obesity by enhancing browning [^116G9qUr]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Abnormalities of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) cause neurological disorders with metabolic dysfunction; however, its role in adipose tissues remains unclear. Here, we report upregulated Mecp2 in white adipose tissues (WAT) of obese humans, as well as in obese mice and during in vitro adipogenesis. Normal chow-fed adipocyte-specific Mecp2 knockout mice (Mecp2 Adi KO mice) showed a lean phenotype, with downregulated lipogenic genes and upregulated thermogenic genes that were identified using RNA sequencing. Consistently, the deficiency of Mecp2 in adipocytes protected mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and inhibited in vitro adipogenesis. Furthermore, Mecp2 Adi KO mice showed increased browning under different stimuli, including cold treatment. Mechanistically, Mecp2 bound to the promoter of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (Slpi) and negatively regulated its expression. Knockdown of Slpi in inguinal WAT of Mecp2 Adi KO mice prevented cold-induced browning. Moreover, recombinant SLPI treatment reduced the HFD-induced obesity via enhancing browning. Together, our results suggest a novel non-central nervous system function of Mecp2 in obesity by suppressing browning, at least partially, through regulating adipokine Slpi.

### Transcriptional regulation in pluripotent stem cells by methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) [^115rkjiK]. Human Molecular Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is one of the most prevalent female mental disorders. De novo mutations in methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) are a major cause of RTT. MeCP2 regulates gene expression as a transcription regulator as well as through long-range chromatin interaction. Because MeCP2 is present on the X chromosome, RTT is manifested in an X-linked dominant manner. Investigation using murine MeCP2 null models and post-mortem human brain tissues has contributed to understanding the molecular and physiological function of MeCP2. In addition, RTT models using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from RTT patients (RTT-iPSCs) provide novel resources to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of MeCP2. Previously, we obtained clones of female RTT-iPSCs that express either wild-type or mutant MECP2 due to the inactivation of one X chromosome. Reactivation of the X chromosome also allowed us to have RTT-iPSCs that express both wild-type and mutant MECP2. Using these unique pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the regulation of gene expression by MeCP2 in pluripotent stem cells by transcriptome analysis. We found that MeCP2 regulates genes encoding mitochondrial membrane proteins. In addition, loss of function in MeCP2 results in de-repression of genes on the inactive X chromosome. Furthermore, we showed that each mutation in MECP2 affects a partly different set of genes. These studies suggest that fundamental cellular physiology is affected by mutations in MECP2 from early development, and that a therapeutic approach targeting to unique forms of mutant MeCP2 is needed.

### Epigenetic regulation of MAGE family in human cancer progression-DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs [^111gUiVA]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Some methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins, which are able to bind methylated DNA, have been reported to contribute to the silencing of MAGE-A genes as modulator. Most hypermethylated promoters are occupied by MBD proteins, whereas unmethylated promoters generally lack MBDs. Treatment of demethylating agents causes hypomethylation of CpG islands, MBD release, and gene re-activation, reinforcing the notion that the association of MBDs with methylated promoters is methylation-dependent. In all MBD-containing proteins, MBD1 differs from other members due to its unique structure and specific function in gene regulation. Except for the conserved MBD domain at its N-terminal, it also has a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) at its C-terminal. These two domains are related to the interaction between MBD1 and other proteins. However, the MBD domain mediates the binding of MBD1 to the methylated DNA, but the TRD domain regulates the transcriptional repression of target genes. In addition, MBD1 has two or three specific CXXC domains distinct from other MBD-containing proteins. The number of CXXC motifs varies among different MBD1 isoforms and depends on whether MBD1 binds to the unmethylated DNA. The first two CXXC domains (CXXC1 and CXXC2) allow MBD1 to bind to the methylated DNA, but the presence of the third CXXC domain (CXXC3) enables MBD1 to bind to DNA irrespective of its methylation status. MBD1 binds to methylated as well as unmethylated MAGE-A gene promoters, and leads to the repression of the promoters. Repression of unmethylated genes depends on the third CXXC domain, and repression of methylated genes requires the MBD domain. MBD1mut, which lacks the MBD domain and harbors a non-functional TRD, showed no effect on MAGE-A gene expression. The isoform MBD1v1 which contains the additional third CXXC domain could repress MAGE-A gene promoters regardless of their methylation status. However, although MBD1v3 lacks the third CXXC domain, it also has a weak repression on the unmethylated MAGE-A gene promoters, suggesting that the two other CXXC domains may also contribute to the repression of unmethylated MAGE-A promoters, however, with a weaker affinity. These two kinds of binding to both methylated and unmethylated DNA enable MBD1 to act in different epigenetic regulations for MAGE-A genes. Another methyl-CpG binding protein, MeCP2, was also found to regulate MAGE-A11 expression in ESCC progression.

### SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of MeCP2 contributes to BDNF expression [^115ck9em]. Epigenetics (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a very abundant protein that was identified for its capacity to bind methylated cytosines at CpG sites. MeCP2 is highly conserved within mammals and it contains a N-terminal methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) and a C-terminal transcriptional repressor domain (TRD). A large body of evidence has established the concept that DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing. The family of MBD binding proteins has been intimately linked to this process. Moreover, MeCP2 is capable of further inhibiting transcription through the recruitment of Sin3A and histone deacetylases. MeCP2 expression is present in many different tissues, but it appears to be most abundant in the brain. The MeCP2 gene, located on the X-chromosome, is transcribed into two different splicing isoforms, MeCP2e1 and MeCP2e2, that differ only in a few amino acids of their N-terminal regions. While the e2 isoform was the first one to be identified, the e1 isoform is the most expressed in the brain in both human and mice. Mutations in the MeCP2 gene have been associated with Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder with affected individuals displaying autistic features, mental retardation and motor and respiratory abnormalities. MeCP2 is capable of controling the expression of several genes that play a crucial role during the process of synapse formation, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inhibitors of differentiation (IDs), early growth gene response 2 (EGR2) and JunB. - The molecular and physiological pathways controlling MeCP2 function have remained elusive.

SIRT1, the mammalian homologue of Sir2 in yeast, is a nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD +)-dependent histone deacetylase. Its function is tightly coupled to cellular metabolism and its dysfunction has been linked to inflammation, obesity and cancer. Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of SIRT1-mediated epigenetic control in neuronal plasticity. It has been described that SIRT1 can regulate neuronal differentiation, and also prevents neurodegeneration in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. - Moreover, Tau acetylation can be reverted by SIRT1. Interestingly, SIRT1 brain-specific knockout mice show impaired cognitive abilities. This enzyme can also regulate synaptic plasticity and memory formation through a microRNA-mediated mechanism.

In this study, we show that MeCP2 is acetylated at a specific lysine residue and that SIRT1 mediates its reversible deacetylation. This post-translational modification appears to modulate MeCP2 binding at the BDNF promoter in the hippocampus. Thus, we reveal the convergence in the control of SIRT1 and MeCP2, two critical epigenetic regulators.

### Distribution, recognition and regulation of non-CpG methylation in the adult mammalian brain [^114nXhrD]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation has critical roles in the nervous system and has been traditionally considered to be restricted to CpG dinucleotides in metazoan genomes. Here we show that the single base-resolution DNA methylome from adult mouse dentate neurons consists of both CpG (~75%) and CpH (~25%) methylation (H = A/C/T). Neuronal CpH methylation is conserved in human brains, enriched in regions of low CpG density, depleted at protein-DNA interaction sites and anticorrelated with gene expression. Functionally, both methylated CpGs (mCpGs) and mCpHs can repress transcription in vitro and are recognized by methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in neurons in vivo. Unlike most CpG methylation, CpH methylation is established de novo during neuronal maturation and requires DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) for active maintenance in postmitotic neurons. These characteristics of CpH methylation suggest that a substantially expanded proportion of the neuronal genome is under cytosine methylation regulation and provide a new foundation for understanding the role of this key epigenetic modification in the nervous system.

### The structural basis for selective binding of non-methylated CpG islands by the CFP1 CXXC domain [^1137cXwN]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

CpG islands contain a high density of CpG content and embrace the promoters of most genes in vertebrate genomes. In the human genome, ∼70% of promoters have a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides. Generally, the CpG dinucleotides in the CpG islands of promoters are non-methylated, irrespective of transcription status of the associated genes, with some exceptions, such as those CpG islands associated with X chromosome and imprinted genes. In spite of their conspicuous importance, the functional roles of the CpG islands in chromatin structure and transcription were unknown until recently. It has been shown that the CFP1 protein selectively binds non-methylated CpGs in vitro and in vivo, consistent with previous studies, which showed that CFP1 binds non-methylated CpG motifs. Furthermore, the non-methylated CpG islands (CGIs) coincide with sites of H3K4me3 in the mouse brain, and the H3K4me3 levels at CGIs were markedly reduced in CFP1-depleted cells — this is not surprising considering the fact that CFP1 is a component of the histone H3K4 methyltransferase and binds the non-methylated CpG islands through its CXXC domain. The study provided one of the first pieces of evidence that one major function of non-methylated CpG islands is to recruit chromatin-modifying complexes to modulate local chromatin structure through the CFP1- and CpG-island interactions. Blackledge et al. showed that CpG islands could directly recruit the H3K36-specific lysine demethylase enzyme KDM2A to create CpG island chromatin that is uniquely depleted of H3K36 methylation. Similar to CFP1, KDM2A contains a CXXC domain that selectively recognizes non-methylated CpG motif and this binding is disrupted when the CpG sites are methylated.

The CXXC domain is found in a variety of chromatin-associated proteins and is characterized by two CGXCXXC repeats. The CXXC domain contains eight conserved cysteine residues that bind two zinc ions and adopts an extended crescent-like structure. In the human genome, there are over ten CXXC domain-containing proteins, and some of them have been shown to possess CpG-motif-binding ability in addition to CFP1 and KDM2A. For instance, the CXXC domain in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and its fusion proteins specifically recognizes non-methylated CpG DNA, and this interaction is essential for the recruitment of MLL to HoxA9 and leukemogenesis. Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) 1 contains three CXXC domains besides a MBD. The third CXXC domain in MBD1 binds specifically to non-methylated CpG, responsible for its methylation-independent localization.

### Loss of activity-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 enhances synaptogenesis, LTP and spatial memory [^115jiVED]. Nature Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation-dependent epigenetic mechanisms underlie the development and function of the mammalian brain. MeCP2 is highly expressed in neurons and functions as a molecular linker between DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Previous in vitro studies have shown that neuronal activity-induced phosphorylation (NAIP) of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) precedes its release from the Bdnf promoter and the ensuing Bdnf transcription. However, the in vivo function of this phosphorylation event remains elusive. We generated knock-in mice that lack NAIP of MeCP2 and found that they performed better in hippocampus-dependent memory tests, presented enhanced long-term potentiation at two synapses in the hippocampus and showed increased excitatory synaptogenesis. At the molecular level, the phospho-mutant MeCP2 protein bound more tightly to several MeCP2 target gene promoters and altered the expression of these genes. Our results suggest that NAIP of MeCP2 is required for modulating dynamic functions of the adult mouse brain.

### Mechanisms of disease: neurogenetics of MeCP2 deficiency [^1133yW1t]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is unique among genetic, chromosomal and other developmental disorders because of its extreme female gender bias, early normal development, and subsequent developmental regression with loss of motor and language skills. RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a multifunctional protein that can act as an architectural chromatin-binding protein, a function that is unrelated to its ability to bind methyl-CpG and to attract chromatin modification complexes. Inactivating mutations that cause RTT in females are not prenatally lethal in males, but lead to profound congenital encephalopathy. Molecular diagnoses of RTT, through demonstration of a MECP2 mutation, made at an early stage of the disorder, usually confirm the sporadic nature and very low recurrence risk of the condition. A positive DNA test result, however, also predicts the inevitable clinical course, given the lack of effective intervention. Initial hypotheses indicating that the MeCP2 protein acts as a genome-wide transcriptional repressor were not confirmed by global gene expression studies in various tissues of individuals with RTT and mouse models of MeCP2 deficiency. Rather, recent evidence points to low-magnitude effects of a small number of genes — including the brain — derived neurotrophic factor pathway and glucocorticoid response genes-that might affect formation and maturation of synapses or synaptic function in postmitotic neurons.

### The role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1142RccK]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

DNA methylation

DNA methylation, which naturally occurs as a result of DNA replication, is the covalent addition of a methyl group (–CH 3) to the 5' position of the cytosine residue in the dinucleotide 5'-cytosine-phosphodiester bond-guanine-3' (5'-CpG-3') to form 5-methylcytosine (5mC). CpG DNA methylation is reversible. CpG islands have a high CpG density (> 50%) and are primarily located in the promoter region of genes but can also be found in enhancer and intragenic regions. Although 70% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in humans, CpG dinucleotides of germ-line cells and promoters of somatic cells are relatively unmethylated.

In general, promoter CpG island hypomethylation is associated with transcriptional activation, whereas the hypermethylation of CpG islands is associated with transcriptional silencing. However, the methylation of CpG sites in regulatory regions outside the gene promoter also plays a role in regulating gene expression in a tissue-specific manner, thus making gene expression regulation through DNA methylation considerably more complex than simple promoter methylation. The process of gene silencing by DNA methylation is required for critical biological processes, such as cellular differentiation, genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and retrotransposon silencing. To date, two mechanisms have been proposed on how DNA methylation silences gene expression. The first mechanism posits that methylation prevents the binding of transcription factors to cytosine in the major DNA groove. The second mechanism suggests that methylation recruits proteins containing the methyl-CpG-binding domain to the 5mC, which in turn recruits certain histone modifiers, such as histone deacetylases, that change the chromatin state in a way that leads to a compact chromatin structure.

### Non-CG DNA methylation is a biomarker for assessing endodermal differentiation capacity in pluripotent stem cells [^116wXEyp]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The functional consequence of non-CG methylation is currently unclear but its presence can directly inhibit the binding of specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Sp1 contributes to the maintenance of methylation-free CpG islandsand can increase promoter activity, as well as regulating a variety of cellular processes including tissue-specific transcriptional activity, cell differentiation and chromatin remodelling. Experiments carried out by Clark et al.have shown that methylation of the internal CpG site at the consensus Sp1-binding site core (5′- CCGCCC -3′) was able to inhibit Sp1 binding by up to 20% and when the 5′-non-CG site was methylated, Sp1 binding was inhibited by up to 40%. However, when both sites were methylated, Sp1 binding was virtually blocked (95% inhibition). In the case of Sp1, it is therefore feasible that non-CG methylation may act as a pluripotent stem cell-specific mechanism to keep some constitutively unmethylated genomic regions (for example, CpG islands) methylated.

Although the mechanistic actions of non-CG DNA methylation on differentiation are unknown, our results offer a novel, fast and economic approach for large-scale assessment of hiPSC lines for clinical utility and therapeutic applications. However, future work should include data mining for other putative regulatory sites affected by non-CG DNA methylation and testing the functional effect of occluded DNA-binding proteins in quantitative knockdown paradigms to simulate the intermediately methylated states seen at non-CG loci in pluripotent stem cells.

### Molecular genetics of Rett syndrome and clinical spectrum of MECP2 mutations [^111LUACQ]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that is a leading cause of mental retardation in females, is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MECP2 mutations have subsequently been identified in patients with a variety of clinical syndromes ranging from mild learning disability in females to severe mental retardation, seizures, ataxia, and sometimes neonatal encephalopathy in males. In classic Rett syndrome, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggest that X chromosome inactivation patterns have a more prominent effect on clinical severity than the type of mutation. When the full range of phenotypes associated with MECP2 mutations is considered, however, the mutation type strongly affects disease severity. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, and mutations in Rett syndrome patients are thought to result in at least a partial loss of function. Abnormal gene expression may thus underlie the phenotype. Discovering which genes are misregulated in the absence of functional MeCP2 is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of this disorder and related syndromes.

The major epigenetic mechanisms

DNA methylation

DNA can be covalently modified and the best-known modification is methylation of cytosine at its 5th carbon ring, which is mainly, although not exclusively, found at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides. The most well-established role of the me-CpG mark is when it occurs at high density within the so-called CpG islands which predominantly traverse 5′ promoter regions; methylation at these regions results in strong transcriptional repression. Importantly, methyl-CpG is a signal for recognition of DNA by specific proteins containing a so-called methyl binding domain (MBD). The MBD family (MBD1, MBD2, MeCP2 and MBD4) mediate transcriptional repression at CpG islands. The majority of methylated CpG islands are developmentally established and become stable in the adult. However in cancer, methylation can be acquired at normally unmethylated CpG islands and is usually accompanied by a second repressive epigenetic mark, methylation of histone H3 at its lysine 27 residue, which compacts chromatin and inhibits transcription. Genome-wide, single-base resolution mapping of DNA methylation has revealed that there is considerable dynamic turnover outside of CpG islands and suggests that the occupancy of transcription factors at these CpG sites is associated with loss of methylation. Despite this knowledge, there is at present inconclusive evidence that loss of methylation outside CpG islands instructs transcriptional information at a local level. Further insights may emerge now that the enzymes that instruct DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b) and demethylation (ten-eleven translocation enzymes [TET1–3]) are beginning to be functionally defined. DNMT1 is a maintenance methylase that during cell division recognises a hemimethylated site on a new DNA strand and regenerates the bimethylated state. In this way, CpG methylation patterns are faithfully maintained in daughter cells. However, de novo methylation does occur in the absence of cell division and is regulated by DNMT3a and DNMT3b. The TET enzymes catalyse the step-wise oxidation of methyl groups on DNA leading to the eventual restoration of the unmodified cytosine residue. Experimental deletion of the TET enzymes results in increased methylation at gene enhancers and subtle alterations in the expression of genes linked with these enhancer regions. Turnover of DNA methylation may therefore be an ongoing process in most cell types and has potential to be modulated via changes in the relative expression of DNMT and TET proteins. The discovery that vitamin C can enhance TET activity in cells supports this idea and indicates the existence of mechanisms for modulating DNA methylation in response to environmental cues.

### A mutation-led search for novel functional domains in MeCP2 [^1112f6oP]. Human Molecular Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the profound neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM #312750). The gene product, MeCP2 protein, is expressed in most cell types, but is especially abundant in neurons. Accordingly, loss of MeCP2 function has the most profound effect in the nervous system, with minimal phenotypic consequences in other tissues. Because of its association with intellectual disability in RTT and other disorders, the MECP2 gene is frequently screened for mutations in clinical cases of developmental delay. This has defined many amino acid changes as RTT-causing or as relatively benign or neutral variants that do not cause RTT. The MeCP2 protein sequence is 95% identical between rodents and humans, suggesting stringent purifying selection throughout. Nevertheless, RTT missense mutations are non-randomly distributed in two prominent clusters, whereas apparently neutral polymorphisms are broadly distributed across the remainder of the protein (Fig. 1). The implication that RTT mutational clusters mark critical domains is supported by biochemical studies, which show that mutations within the Methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) disrupt DNA binding, whereas mutations within the NCoR interaction domain (NID) prevent binding to the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complexes. High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of both these interactions support the view that MeCP2 bridges methylated sites on DNA with a histone deacetylase-containing co-repressor. Further evidence for the importance of these two domains comes from a recent study in which mice carried a pared down MeCP2 'minigene', ΔNIC, consisting of only the MBD, a nuclear localization signal and the NID. These mice survived for over a year with only mild symptoms. A simple interpretation is that this interaction restrains transcription; a view supported by recent transcriptomic analyses of MeCP2-depleted mouse brain.

### DNA sequence-dependent activity and base flipping mechanisms of DNMT1 regulate genome-wide DNA methylation [^111SXWSR]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

DNA methylation maintenance by DNMT1 is an essential process in mammals but molecular mechanisms connecting DNA methylation patterns and enzyme activity remain elusive. Here, we systematically analyzed the specificity of DNMT1, revealing a pronounced influence of the DNA sequences flanking the target CpG site on DNMT1 activity. We determined DNMT1 structures in complex with preferred DNA substrates revealing that DNMT1 employs flanking sequence-dependent base flipping mechanisms, with large structural rearrangements of the DNA correlating with low catalytic activity. Moreover, flanking sequences influence the conformational dynamics of the active site and cofactor binding pocket. Importantly, we show that the flanking sequence preferences of DNMT1 highly correlate with genomic methylation in human and mouse cells, and 5-azacytidine triggered DNA demethylation is more pronounced at CpG sites with flanks disfavored by DNMT1. Overall, our findings uncover the intricate interplay between CpG-flanking sequence, DNMT1-mediated base flipping and the dynamic landscape of DNA methylation.

### DNA methylation and Rett syndrome [^1138Cb6t]. Human Molecular Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Methylation of cytosine in human DNA has been studied for over 60 years, but has only recently been confirmed as an important player in human disease. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the MeCP2 protein, which has been shown to bind methylated DNA and repress transcription. This review will focus on experiments addressing the basic properties of MeCP2 and on mouse models of Rett syndrome that are starting to yield insights into this condition.

### Dissecting MECP2 function in the central nervous system [^112d4pgw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder and an important cause of mental retardation and autistic behavior in girls and in a small group of boys. In 1999, mutation of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene encoding a transcriptional repressor on the X chromosome was found to cause Rett syndrome. Since this discovery, significant research has focused on the elucidation of its specific role in the central nervous system. Recent studies revealed that MECP2 is expressed in more differentiated neurons rather than in less differentiated neuroblasts and that MECP2 is involved in the maturation and maintenance of neurons, including dendritic arborization and axonal projections, rather than in early cell fate decisions in the mammalian brain. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding regional, temporal, and cell type-specific MECP2 expression in the central nervous system; neurobiologic abnormalities in MECP2 -mutant mice; and MECP2 target genes in the central nervous system.

### MeCP2 and non-CG DNA methylation stabilize the expression of long genes that distinguish closely related neuron types [^114Qh9Ph]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

The diversity of mammalian neurons is delineated by subtle gene expression differences that may require specialized mechanisms to be maintained. Neurons uniquely express the longest genes in the genome and use non-CG DNA methylation (mCA), together with the Rett syndrome protein methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), to control gene expression. However, whether these distinctive gene structures and molecular machinery regulate neuronal diversity remains unexplored. Here, we use genomic and spatial transcriptomic analyses to show that MeCP2 maintains transcriptomic diversity across closely related neuron types. We uncover differential susceptibility of neuronal populations to MeCP2 loss according to global mCA levels and dissect methylation patterns driving shared and distinct MeCP2 gene regulation. We show that MeCP2 regulates long, mCA-enriched, 'repeatedly tuned' genes, that is, genes differentially expressed between many closely related neuron types, including across spatially distinct, vision-dependent gene programs in the visual cortex. Thus, MeCP2 maintains neuron type-specific gene programs to facilitate cellular diversity in the brain.

### BDNF exon IV promoter methylation and antidepressant action: a complex interplay [^1156FqSD]. Clinical Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Further, to differentiate the regulatory effect of methylation of individual CpGs from the whole promoter, we mutated the CpGs of interest to methylated CpGs in the BDNFIV-pCpGL basic construct and performed luciferase assays with or without ADs. We included CpG-87 to model the clinical findings and CpG-35 and -39 due to their proximity with CRE (CREB binding element). CREB has been shown to regulate BDNF protein and is involved in antidepressant response. We observed no difference in the BDNF exon IV promoter activity upon methylating CpG-35, and -87 in comparison with the unmethylated controls, but CpG-39 methylation increased the transcriptional activity of the promoter. Further plasmid harboring methylated CpG-39 showed a significant increase in promoter activity in the Venlafaxine- and Fluoxetine-treated cells, suggesting yet again possible drug–methylation interaction.

Methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2), an important epigenetic regulator, has been implicated in depression and other psychiatric disorders. MeCP2 can bind to both methylated cytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thereby acting as both transcriptional repressor and activator. Studies have shown that MeCP2 binds to methylated CpGs on BDNF exon IV promoter and represses transcription by blocking CRE or recruiting CREB to a repressor complex. Contradictorily, a strong line of evidence suggests MeCP2 physically and functionally interacts with CREB facilitating the interaction with CRE on the BDNF and other active promoters. Therefore, we speculate that the observed increase in transcriptional activity can be due to enhanced MECP2-CREB complex recruitment to the promoter (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6
Proposed molecular mechanism for methylation-specific BDNF exon IV transcriptional activation. CREB, a known transcriptional factor binds to cAMP response element (CRE) on BDNF exon IV promoter and upregulate transcription by recruiting co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP). MeCP2 binds across genome, preferably to methylated CpGs and functions as chromatin modifier. Site-specific methylation of BDNF exon IV promoter increases MeCP2 occupancy at the methylated CpGs. MeCP2 and CREB form a transcriptional activating complex. No increase in CREB–CRE interaction was observed, if methylated CpG is far from CRE as with CpG-87 (a) or at the 3′ end of CRE as observed with CpG-35 (b). Methylation at CpG-39 allows the recruitment of MeCP2-CREB protein complex and increases the transcriptional activity at BDNF exon IV promoter (c). Illustration was created with BioRender.com

### Brahma links the SWI / SNF chromatin-remodeling complex with MeCP2-dependent transcriptional silencing [^113FES3z]. Nature Genetics (2005). Medium credibility.

Transcriptional repression of methylated genes can be mediated by the methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2. Here we show that human Brahma (Brm), a catalytic component of the SWI/SNF-related chromatin-remodeling complex, associates with MeCP2 in vivo and is functionally linked with repression. We used a number of different molecular approaches and chromatin immunoprecipitation strategies to show a unique cooperation between Brm, BAF57 and MeCP2. We show that Brm and MeCP2 assembly on chromatin occurs on methylated genes in cancer and the gene FMR1 in fragile X syndrome. These experimental findings identify a new role for SWI/SNF in gene repression by MeCP2.

### Epigenetic and transgenerational mechanisms in infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders [^116DD4Lj]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

How can epigenetic modifications influence brain development?

A growing number of studies highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in normal brain development. Interestingly, transcriptional changes in the brain occur more frequently during prenatal life as compared to any other age in life. A temporally precise and specific regulation of gene expression thus seems indispensable for normal brain development. This regulatory process involves methylation-related epigenetic modifications, which allow a fine-tuning of fetal gene expression according to specific stages of brain development. A critical role for DNA methylation in early brain development is also supported by the dynamic expression of DNA methyltransferases during prenatal life, and by studies using transgenic mouse models showing neurodevelopmental deficits in mice with mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) gene. Furthermore, mice lacking distinct DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the forebrain have been found to display severe learning and memory deficits, as well as impaired synaptic plasticity.

In addition to epigenetic processes involving DNA methylation, several other epigenetic mechanisms appear to be critical for neuronal development and functions. For example, it has been shown that histone modifications can regulate the conversion of oligodendrocytes into neural stem cells. Furthermore, Fischer et al. demonstrated in a mouse model of neurodegenerative disorders that increasing histone acetylation could promote synaptogenesis and augment cognitive functions.

Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs may similarly play a role in central nervous system development. For example, it has been shown that miRNAs in specific neuronal or glial cell populations show a dynamic expression pattern during brain development. Moreover, a recent study reported distinct temporal patterns of miRNA expression in the brain throughout gestation, and from early neonatal to adult life. The developmentally regulated pattern of miRNA expression is indicative of a functional role of these molecules in normal brain development. However, our understanding of how miRNA can influence neurodevelopmental processes is still in its infancy and warrants further investigations.

### Rescue of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 dysfunction-induced defects in newborn neurons by pentobarbital [^111C2TnK]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

PB Rescues the Effects of MeCP2 Deficiency

The noncompetitive GABA A R antagonist, picrotoxin, ameliorates behavioral and synaptic impairments associated with overexpression of MeCP2. We therefore determined whether modulating GABA signaling could reverse the structural and electrophysiological phenotypes resulting from MeCP2 deficiency. We found that chronic PB treatment can reverse the morphological and functional defects caused by silencing MeCP2 in cultured primary hippocampal neurons, as well as the morphological effects observed in newly generated granule cells in vivo. The synaptic effects of MeCP2 loss also could be partially reversed by muscimol, a GABA receptor agonist. This suggests the involvement of GABA receptor signaling in the effects of PB.

PB is a barbiturate that binds to GABA A R and potentiates inhibition of GABA A -type receptors. Depending on its concentration, PB can potentiate (approximately 10–100 μM), activate (approximately 100–800 μM), or block (approximately 1–10 mM) the GABA A R channel. The mechanisms underlying these actions remain poorly understood. Moreover, these studies were done with acute PB treatment, and the effects may differ from those caused by chronic treatment, where processes such as adaptation and tolerance of neurons may also play important roles. There are only a few studies on chronic PB treatment, and these have mainly investigated its effects on expression of GABA receptor subunits. Collectively, these studies show that long-term PB treatment causes region-specific changes in the expression of GABA receptor subunits, with expression usually slightly downregulated or not significantly changed. There is also little change in the maximum number of binding sites for GABA agonists such as muscimol. Nonetheless, PB also has other targets in the brains, and exerts diverse effects on synaptic function apart from potentiating GABAergic transmission. A better understanding of which specific components in GABA signaling is regulated and influenced by MeCP2 will be important for finding a more appropriate drug or compound that can be use as treatment for RTT. It would also be of interest to study the effects of chronic PB treatment in other brain regions in the future, in part to determine whether PB treatment could ameliorate such effects on GABA signaling.

Our data demonstrate a role for MeCP2 in growth and maturation of newborn granule cells in developing fetal and adult hippocampus, likely through GABA signaling. However, it is not clear whether MeCP2 is acting by repressing genes involved in GABA signaling or has other roles that have yet to be identified. Our results suggest that PB and related drugs that modulate GABA signaling are potential therapeutic candidates for treating RTT.

### MeCP2 and MBD2 expression in human neoplastic and non-neoplastic breast tissue and its association with oestrogen receptor status [^116AjqqA]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in the DNA methylation status are one of the most common molecular alterations in human neoplasia. Hypermethylation of CpG islands, especially when located in the promoter region, generally causes a loss of expression on the part of genes possessing this structure at their 5′ end. The so-called methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBDs) are important constituents of the DNA methylation machinery, since they are directly involved in mediating the epigenetic signal. The five MBD proteins known to date share a conserved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), which is 70–75 amino acids in length and exhibits 50–70% similarity between the proteins. Four of them are associated with the transcriptional repression of methylated templates in vertebrates and bind methylated DNA. MeCP2 is the best studied member of the MBD family: MeCP2 is an abundant chromosome-binding protein that selectively binds 5-methyl cytosine residues in symmetrically positioned CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome. MeCP2 contains two functional domains, an 85-amino-acid MBD essential for its binding to 5-methylcytosine, and a 104-amino-acid transcriptional repression domain (TRD) that interacts with histone deacetylase and the transcriptional corepressor Sin3A.

In addition to MeCP2, MBD2 is another family member already studied in human neoplasia. MeCP2 and MBD2 differ in several ways with regard to their binding capacities: MeCP2 can recognise a single symmetrically methylated CpG. MBD2 can bind, in vitro, to DNA sequences containing a few methylated CpGs; however, the MeCP1 complex containing this protein binds only to densely methylated DNA. Invalidation of MeCP2 in mice indicates that MeCP1 cannot compensate for the absence of MeCP2, and, conversely, invalidation of MBD2 does not prompt the neurological disorders observed in MeCP2-null mice mutants. The absence of compensation between these proteins suggests that these two MBDs play specific roles in cellular physiology. Although the expression patterns of the MBDs are not yet fully determined, it has been shown in mouse and rat that these genes are expressed at various levels depending on the cell type and the differentiation state. In adult rodent somatic tissues, MeCP2 expression level varies between tissues. For example, the brain has the highest level and the testis the lowest.

### Mitochondrial DNA copy number in Rett syndrome caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 Variants [^111ns49P]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in peripheral blood in Rett syndrome caused by methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2) variants and explore the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in Rett syndrome.

Study Design

Female patients who were diagnosed with Rett syndrome and had an MECP2 variant (n = 142) were recruited in this study, along with the same number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. MtDNA copy number was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes. The differences in mtDNA copy number between the Rett syndrome group and the control group were analyzed using the independent-samples t test. Linear regression, biserial correlation analysis, and one-way ANOVA were applied for the correlations between mtDNA copy number and age, clinical severity, variant types, functional domains, and hot-spot variants.

Results

MtDNA copy number was found to be significantly increased in the patients with Rett syndrome with MECP2 gene variants compared with the control subjects. Age, clinical severity, variant types, functional domains, and hot-spot variants were not related to mtDNA copy number in patients with Rett syndrome.

Conclusions

MtDNA copy number is increased significantly in patients with Rett syndrome, suggesting that changes in mitochondrial function in Rett syndrome trigger a compensatory increase in mtDNA copy number and providing new possibilities for treating Rett syndrome, such as mitochondria-targeted therapies.

### Keeping methylation at bay [^1122P3uP]. Nature Genetics (2015). Medium credibility.

A hallmark of CpG islands is their unmethylated state, and determining how DNA methylation can invade these elements is therefore important for understanding developmental gene regulation and disease. A new study shows that FBXL10, a protein commonly altered by mutation in leukemia, is part of a mechanism that blocks methylation of CpG islands.

### A novel mutation p. A59P in N-terminal domain of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 confers phenotypic variability in 3 cases of Tunisian Rett patients: clinical evaluations and in silico investigations [^11465Vxw]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Rett syndrome is a monogenic X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder related to mutation in MECP2, which encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2. The aim of this study was to search for mutations of MECP2 gene in Tunisian Rett patients and to evaluate the impact of the found variants on structural and functional features of MeCP2. The result of mutation analysis revealed that 3 Rett patients shared the same novel heterozygous point mutation c.175G > C (p. A59P). The p. A59P mutation was located in a conserved amino acid in the N-terminal segment of MeCP2. This novel mutation confers a phenotypic variability with different clinical severity scores (3, 8, and 9) and predicted by Sift and PolyPhen to be damaging. Modeling results showed that p. A59P adds 2 hydrogen bonds and changes the structural conformation of MeCP2 with a significant root mean square deviation value (9.66 Å), suggesting that this mutation could probably affect the conformation, function and stability of MeCP2.

### Rescue of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 dysfunction-induced defects in newborn neurons by pentobarbital [^112CGZad]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

As the phenotypes of RTT manifest themselves over specific stages and develop gradually during childhood, MeCP2 deficiency has been most prominently linked to deficiencies in postnatal neuronal development. However, a study demonstrating effects of knocking out MeCP2 in adult animals indicates that MeCP2 is also required for adult neural function. The progression and pathology of RTT and MeCP2-related disorders are still poorly understood. Phenotypic reversal of MeCP2 deficiency was achieved by restoring MeCP2 function in a RTT syndrome mouse model (MeCP2 knockout), as well by systemic administration of an adeno-associated virus bearing MeCP2 cDNA, suggesting that RTT may be potentially treatable in humans. However, gene therapy for neurologic ailments in human patients has been difficult to achieve. Therefore, it is desirable to identify drugs that can overcome the defects associated with RTT. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin, have been shown to cause a partial read-through of nonsense mutations within MECP2. Gentamicin has also been shown to increase MeCP2 protein levels and synapse numbers in neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with RTT. Growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 can also partially reverse RTT-like symptoms and phenotypes in MeCP2 mutant mice and neurons differentiated from RTT induced pluripotent stem cells, while acute benzodiazepine treatment can transiently abolish the breathing defects of MeCP2-deficient mice and alter expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in mouse hippocampus. However, none of these approaches causes complete recovery of normal function, so that identification of better therapeutic agents for RTT is necessary.

It has been shown that MeCP2-related disorders display neurologic phenotypes that can be attributed, in part, to postnatal hippocampal dysfunction. We have therefore examined the cell-autonomous actions and functional role of MeCP2 in the development and maturation of newborn cells from the hippocampus of fetal brains, and also in newborn cells in the adult hippocampus in vivo. MeCP2 deficiency resulted in changes in dendritic structure, reduced synapse number and impaired synaptic transmission and reduced neuronal network activity. We also demonstrate that pentobarbital (PB) can reverse the structural and synaptic phenotypes resulting from MeCP2 deficiency, revealing the potential of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor (GABA A R) modulators such as PB as novel therapeutic treatments for RTT in the future

### MicroRNA-22 regulates smooth muscle cell differentiation from stem cells by targeting methyl CpG-binding protein 2 [^112rJ2ut]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

In this study, we attempted to uncover the functional impact of microRNA-22 (miR-22) and its target gene in smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and delineate the molecular mechanism involved.

Approach and Results

miR-22 was found to be significantly upregulated during SMC differentiation from embryonic stem cells and adventitia stem/progenitor cells. Enforced expression of miR-22 by its mimic, while knockdown of miR-22 by its antagomiR, promotes or inhibits SMC differentiation from embryonic stem cells and adventitia stem/progenitor cells, respectively. Expectedly, miR-22 overexpression in stem cells promoted SMC differentiation in vivo. Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) was predicted as one of the top targets of miR-22. Interestingly, the gene expression levels of MECP2 were significantly decreased during SMC differentiation, and MECP2 was dramatically decreased in miR-22 overexpressing cells but significantly increased when miR-22 was knockdown in the differentiating stem cells. Importantly, luciferase assay showed that miR-22 substantially inhibited wild-type, but not mutant MECP2–3' untranslated region-luciferase activity. In addition, modulation of MECP2 expression levels affects multiple SMC-specific gene expression in differentiated embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, our data showed that MECP2 could transcriptionally repress SMC gene expression through modulating various SMC transcription factors, as well as several proven SMC differentiation regulators. Evidence also revealed that enrichment of H3K9 trimethylation around the promoter regions of the SMC differentiation regulators genes were significantly increased by MECP2 overexpression. Finally, miR-22 was upregulated by platelet-derived growth factor-BB and transforming growth factor-β through a transcriptional mechanism during SMC differentiation.

Conclusions

miR-22 plays an important role in SMC differentiation, and epigenetic regulation through MECP2 is required for miR-22 mediated SMC differentiation.

### Context-dependent CpG methylation directs cell-specific binding of transcription factor ZBTB38 [^111FD8nX]. Epigenetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Other zinc finger proteins sense DNA methylation and bind in CGI shores

Initially described as a mark of transcriptional silencing memory, CpG methylation is emerging as a more complex mark. Herein, we identified a methylated E2F motif associated with several genes highly expressed and with metabolic functions that do not undergo cell cycle regulation. The CGIs associated with the promoter of these genes tend to be larger than regular CGI. In addition, these promoters exhibit intermediate levels of tissue specificity which typically require complex gene regulation mechanisms.

Our reanalysis of datasets of ZNF ChIP-sequencing produced by different labs identified a small number of other ZNFs that present binding features similar to ZBTB38. Among these, human ZFP57 shows a bias to methylated CpG sequences compared to unmethylated sequences consistent with previous work in mice. More intriguingly, ZNF284 and ZNF287 bind CGI-shore with higher frequency than CGI in 293 T cells and show preference for methylated CpG sequences. Applying similar search criteria as ZBTB38, we thus identify two additional candidate factors that may help convey information from proximal promoter regions. Study of these factors may help better comprehend the role of DNA methylation and the different layers of proteins involved in CpG methylation function.

### Disruption of DNA-methylation-dependent long gene repression in Rett syndrome [^115QZtcG]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Disruption of the MECP2 gene leads to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological disorder with features of autism. MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that has been proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but despite numerous mouse studies examining neuronal gene expression in Mecp2 mutants, no clear model has emerged for how MeCP2 protein regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in gene expression in MeCP2 mutant mouse models and human RTT brains. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses gene expression by binding to methylated CA sites within long genes, and that in neurons lacking MeCP2, decreasing the expression of long genes attenuates RTT-associated cellular deficits. In addition, we find that long genes as a population are enriched for neuronal functions and selectively expressed in the brain. These findings suggest that mutations in MeCP2 may cause neurological dysfunction by specifically disrupting long gene expression in the brain.

### MeCP2 and the enigmatic organization of brain chromatin. implications for depression and cocaine addiction [^111ZvPyn]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
a Gene organization of MeCP2. Two isoforms E1 and E2 result from alternative splicing. The red arrows indicate the starting sites of transcription. The domain organization of the resulting protein isoforms is also shown. CTD; C-terminal domain; ID: intervening domain; MBD: methyl-binding domain; NTD; N-terminal domain; TRD: transcriptional repression domain. b Number of publications since MeCP2 was first described

At the protein level, the common methyl binding domain (MBD) (Fig. 1a) is the only region of these proteins that shows a well-characterized tertiary structure within what it is one of the best examples of an intrinsically disordered protein. As such, the protein is subject to numerous PTMs, of which the phosphorylation of serine residues at position 80 (S80 of human E2 isoform) and 421 (S421of mouse E1 isoform), commonly referred to as S80 and S421, have been the most extensively characterized. Importantly, the levels of MeCP2 and its homeostasis in the brain (where the protein is more abundant) appear to be critical to its proper developmental function, although normal physiologically-relevant fluctuations can occur in a circadian-regulated manner.

It took seven years since the discovery of MeCP2 for the number of publications on this protein (Fig. 1b) and the general interest of the scientific community to pick up on Huda Zoghbi's team demonstration at the Baylor College of medicine, which demonstrated that RTT, for the most part, is due to mutations in MeCP2. Rett syndrome is an X-chromosome-linked neurodevelopmental disease predominantly affecting girls. It is related to autism and is characterized by intellectual disability and developmental regression. Studies published previous to the knowledge of the connection of MeCP2 with RTT included the characterization of the interaction of MeCP2 with histone de-acetylases (HDACs). Together with the interaction of MeCP2 with CpG methylated DNA, this finding reinforced the notion of a transcriptionally repressive role initially associated with this protein, while establishing the first link between MeCP2 and histone acetylation. This concept fits well with that of DNA CpG hypermethylation, which is usually found at the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes in many cancers where MBD proteins, including MeCP2, play an important role. A paper appeared during the interim period of time that preceded the RTT-MeCP2 association, which involved MeCP2 in the repression of the retinoblastoma gene, and it paved the way in terms of MeCP2's involvement in cancer. Indeed, MeCP2 has been recently recognized as playing the role of a bona fide oncogene.

### State-of-the-art therapies for Rett syndrome [^114JG5Q6]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations of the MECP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2) gene. Over two decades of work established MeCP2 as a protein with pivotal roles in the regulation of the epigenome, neuronal physiology, synaptic maintenance, and behaviour. Given the genetic aetiology of RTT and the proof of concept of its reversal in a mouse model, considerable efforts have been made to design therapeutic approaches to re-express MeCP2. By being at the forefront of the development of innovative gene therapies, research on RTT is of paramount importance for the treatment of monogenic neurological diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances and challenges of promising genetic strategies for the treatment of RTT including gene replacement therapies, gene/RNA editing strategies, and reactivation of the silenced X chromosome. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Recent advances shed light on the promises of gene replacement therapy with new vectors designed to control the levels of MeCP2 expression. New developments in DNA/RNA editing approaches or reactivation of the silenced X chromosome open the possibility to re-express the native MeCP2 locus at endogenous levels. Current strategies still face limitations in transduction efficiency and future work is needed to improve brain delivery.

### MeCP2 regulates gene expression through recognition of H3K27me3 [^115uu9rK]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

MeCP2 has been defined as a methylated DNA-binding protein. However, there are many exceptions in vivo as to the specificity of MeCP2 binding to methyl-cytosine. Particularly, maintaining MeCP2 bindings in chromatin in Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b triple knock out ES cells argue that MeCP2 interacts with chromatin via additional mechanisms. In the present study, we show that MeCP2 directly binds to the nucleosome complex and its binding is enhanced by the presence of modified H3, H3K27me3. Furthermore, MeCP2 interactions with H3K27me3 correlate with its role in transcriptional repression.

Under in vitro conditions, it was reported that the C-terminal region of MeCP2 contributes to the formation of complexes with nucleosomes and that the binding was enhanced with methylated DNA. An independent study using small angle X-ray scattering techniqueconfirmed that MeCP2 binds near the nucleosomal dyad, close to the linker DNA entry-exit region. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses of MeCP2 binding patterns have shown that MeCP2 enrichment co-occurred at nucleosome positionsor histone H1 binding sites. Recently, we also demonstrated that MeCP2 preferentially localizes at GC-rich regions and co-localizes with nucleosomes in a genome-wide study. However, the direct interaction between MeCP2 and nucleosomal protein and the effect of histone modifications on MeCP2 binding to chromatin has not been well studied.

### Removal of promoter CpG methylation by epigenome editing reverses HBG silencing [^1115GcmL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

CpG methylation is required for NuRD activity, but not BCL11A binding to the HBG promoters

To understand how changes in promoter CpG methylation regulate the HBG promoters, we modified CD34 + HSPCs with TETv4 + HBG sgRNAs, generated erythroblasts by in vitro differentiation, and used CUT&RUN to profile histone marks and chromatin occupancy by known regulators across the β-globin locus. Like observations in UHRF1 -depleted erythroblast cells derived from CD34 + HSPCs (see Fig. 2c), HBG promoter demethylation was associated with increases in the activating H3K4me3 mark and recruitment of transcription factors GATA1 and NF-Y (Fig. 5e). In contrast to the effect of UHRF1 depletion, HBG promoter demethylation resulted in decreased H3K4me3 levels at the HBB promoter. Interestingly, localization of the HBG repressor protein BCL11A, which functions at least partly through interactions with the NuRD co-repressor complex, appeared to be increased at the HBG promoters upon TETv4 treatment, aligning with the effects of UHRF1 disruption (see Fig. 2c). Thus, TETv4-directed CpG demethylation of the HBG promoters induces an active transcriptional state without impairing the binding of the key repressor BCL11A.

Given that TETv4-directed demethylation of HBG does not appear to disrupt repressor binding or act through a single CpG site, we tested the hypothesis that CpG methylation may be required for activity or recruitment of the NuRD complex, which interacts with methyl-CpG islands through its MBD2 subunit. MBD2-NuRD contributes to HBG repression in HUDEP2 cells and is reported to directly bind the HBG promoter, despite its relatively low CpG density. To extend these studies, we introduced a Y178F mutation into the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of MBD2 to resemble more closely the paralog MBD3, which exhibits low affinity to CpG methylation and has not been associated with the regulation of HBG (Fig. 6a). By precisely modifying MBD2 at this position, we hypothesized that we could introduce a methyl-CpG binding deficiency into the protein, without affecting its other functions.

### MBD4-associated neoplasia syndrome (PDQ ®) [^117STeFq]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

There are conflicting data from a limited number of studies on whether heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in MBD4 increase the risk of developing uveal melanoma.

Br J Haematol 198: 196–199, 2022. Genetics and Molecular Biology of MBD4-Associated Neoplasia Syndrome The MBD4 gene codes for a DNA glycosylase that is recruited in the base excision repair pathway. In mouse studies, MBD4 helped repair methylation damage incurred by spontaneous deamination of 5'-methylcytosine to thymine, which is characterized by mismatched CG > TG. Individuals with biallelic germline MBD4 pathogenic variants lack the ability to use MBD4 for BER of GT mismatches. In turn, cancer risk is increased.

Resulting cancers also appear to have elevated mutational burden and are enriched for this specific CG > TG signature. MBD4 presented with oligopolyposis. Cancers observed in affected individuals included UVM, CRC, and AML. Most of the adenomas that were found had an accumulation of CG > TG transitions in well-known CRC driver genes like APC, KRAS, and AMER1.

### Role of GADD45 α as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer… [^113SwEYC]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 10566 Background: Defects in the apoptotic pathway contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation of cancer cells and confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Understanding the mechanisms of deregulation of apoptosis related genes would enable targeted treatment methods to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. Growth Arrest and DNA Damage inducible, alpha mediates cytotoxicity of docetaxel chemotherapy. We examined the mechanism of regulation of GADD45a in prostate cancer cells and the effect of its upregulation on sensitivity to docetaxel chemotherapy. Results: Levels of expression of GADD45a in Du145 and LNCaP cells were lower than that in PC3. A 4 CpG region upstream of the proximal promoter region was methylated in Du145 and LNCaP cells.

Methylation was reversed by treatment of Du145 and LNCaP cells with DNA methyl transferase inhibitors such as 5- Azacytidine or 5- Aza deoxycytidine leading to reactivation of GADD45a expression in these cells. This region was also frequently methylated in prostate cancer tissues. Methyl binding protein, MeCP2 was associated with the methylated 4 CpGs in Du145 and knock down of MeCP2 by transfection of MeCP2 siRNA vector in Du145 cells led to increased expression of GADD45a, without affecting the methylation status of the gene. Enhanced sensitivity to docetaxel was observed by upregulation of GADD45a in Du145 cells by recombinant expression of GADD45a downregulation of MeCP2 and pretreatment with 5-Azacytidine. Conclusions: GADD45a is frequently deregulated in prostate cancer by methylation of 5' 4 CpG region and is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of prostate cancer.
