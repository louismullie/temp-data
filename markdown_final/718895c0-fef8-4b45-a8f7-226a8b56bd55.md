## Question

A 45 year old Physician Assistant is coming into the Employee Health Clinic for an intake evaluation. He has been hired as a new graduate to work as a surgical PA. He has no medical problems and takes no medications. He is in for review of his vaccinations, a FIT test (TB helmet fitting) drug testing, and a physical exam. Vaccinations are all UTD, except varicella. He says he is certain he had chicken pox when he was 10. He was born in 1973 and had infection as a child.

Which of the following is indicated?

Group of answer choices

Laboratory evidence of immunity

Oral confirmation of infection is sufficient evidence of immunity

He should be vaccinated

Birth before 1980 is acceptable evidence of immunity

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which action is indicated regarding varicella immunity for a 45-year-old healthcare worker who reports a history of chickenpox at age 10 and has no other documentation of immunity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the applicable guideline framework for healthcare personnel. Then, I should verify which forms of evidence of immunity are acceptable. Next, I will examine whether birth before 1980 applies and whether a self-reported history is sufficient. After that, I need to check the reliability of serologic testing and its role here. Finally, I will synthesize the correct action and the rationale, including implications for post-exposure management and documentation requirements [^11546KDS] [^116mBhzf].

> Let me first confirm the guideline framework. For healthcare personnel, occupational health guidance requires documented varicella immunity at preplacement, and acceptable evidence includes laboratory evidence of immunity, documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine, or clinician-documented history of varicella or zoster; those with negative, unknown, or undocumented histories should have a varicella IgG titer checked and be vaccinated if nonimmune, typically with two doses 4–8 weeks apart [^11546KDS].

> Wait, let me verify the "birth before 1980" rule before I jump ahead. I initially thought birth before 1980 might suffice for immunity, but hold on, I should verify the nuance. Birth before 1980 is considered presumptive evidence of immunity in the general population, yet healthcare personnel are an exception and still require documented immunity by vaccination, laboratory confirmation, or clinician-verified disease history; so for a 45-year-old born in 1973, birth before 1980 does not by itself meet HCP requirements [^111rxHhG] [^11546KDS].

> I need to check whether oral confirmation of infection is sufficient. The acceptable disease history must be verified by a healthcare provider; a self-reported history alone is not adequate documentation for healthcare personnel. Therefore, his statement that he had chickenpox at age 10 is insufficient without clinician documentation or laboratory confirmation [^11546KDS] [^112hm7oW].

> Next, I should review the role of serologic testing. For HCP with negative, unknown, or undocumented histories, obtaining a varicella IgG is recommended to establish immunity; if the titer is negative or equivocal, vaccination is indicated. But wait, what if the titer is positive? A positive varicella IgG would constitute acceptable evidence of immunity and obviate the need for vaccination in this context [^11546KDS] [^116ebQeH].

> Let me synthesize the correct action. Given that he lacks clinician-documented disease or vaccination, the indicated next step is to obtain laboratory evidence of immunity with a varicella IgG test; if positive, he is immune and no vaccination is needed, and if negative or equivocal, he should receive two doses of varicella vaccine 4–8 weeks apart. I should double-check that this aligns with both occupational health guidance and ACIP criteria for acceptable evidence of immunity, which it does [^11546KDS] [^111rxHhG].

> I should confirm the implications for post-exposure management to ensure completeness. Susceptible HCP exposed to varicella should be furloughed from day 8 through day 21 after exposure, whereas those with documented immunity, including a positive IgG, are not subject to routine furlough, underscoring why proper documentation matters operationally in healthcare settings [^112p4ucb] [^11546KDS].

> Final answer: Laboratory evidence of immunity is indicated; oral confirmation is not sufficient, birth before 1980 does not apply to healthcare personnel, and vaccination is indicated only if serology is negative or equivocal. The correct next step is to order a varicella IgG to document immunity status and proceed to vaccination if the result does not confirm immunity [^11546KDS] [^111rxHhG].

---

The correct answer is **laboratory evidence of immunity** [^11546KDS]. For healthcare personnel, including surgical PAs, a self-reported history of varicella is **not sufficient** [^116mBhzf]; immunity must be documented by either a positive varicella IgG serology [^116ebQeH] or two doses of varicella vaccine [^11546KDS]. Birth before 1980 is not accepted for healthcare workers, and oral confirmation alone is inadequate [^112hm7oW]. If serology is negative or unavailable, the PA should receive two doses of varicella vaccine 4–8 weeks apart [^11546KDS].

---

## Evidence of immunity for healthcare personnel

Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at **increased risk of exposure** to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and can transmit it to vulnerable patients [^1116mWTY]. Therefore, **strict immunity documentation** is required [^116XJoqa]. The CDC and occupational health guidelines specify that acceptable evidence of immunity for HCP includes:

- **Documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine**: Administered at least 4 weeks apart [^11546KDS].
- **Laboratory evidence of immunity**: Positive varicella IgG serology [^116ebQeH].
- **Laboratory confirmation of disease**: PCR or other validated laboratory test [^112iPhEL].
- **Diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella or herpes zoster by a healthcare provider**: This must be documented by a clinician [^11546KDS].

---

## Applicability of birth before 1980 rule

The "birth before 1980" rule applies to the general population, presuming immunity due to high pre-vaccine-era seroprevalence [^117ToDCn]. However, this presumption **does not apply to healthcare personnel** because of their increased exposure risk and the potential for transmission to vulnerable patients [^11546KDS]. Therefore, HCP must provide documented evidence of immunity regardless of birth year [^112hm7oW].

---

## Reliability of oral confirmation of varicella infection

Oral confirmation of varicella infection is **unreliable** and not accepted as evidence of immunity for healthcare personnel [^112hm7oW]. Studies show that self-reported history of varicella has a significant false-positive rate, particularly in adults from diverse geographic backgrounds or those born outside the United States [^116tM8fN] [^116KAwSW]. Therefore, **laboratory confirmation or documented vaccination is required** [^11546KDS].

---

## Recommended course of action for the physician assistant

Given the scenario, the PA lacks documented evidence of varicella immunity. The appropriate course of action is to **obtain laboratory evidence of immunity** through varicella IgG serology [^11546KDS]. If the serology is positive, the PA is considered immune, and no further action is needed. If the serology is negative or unavailable, the PA should receive two doses of varicella vaccine, administered 4–8 weeks apart [^11546KDS].

---

## Evidence of immunity for healthcare personnel

| **Evidence of immunity** | **Accepted for hcp?** |
|-|-|
| Birth before 1980 | No |
| Oral confirmation of infection | No |
| Laboratory evidence of immunity (positive IgG) | Yes |
| Documentation of two varicella vaccine doses | Yes |
| Clinician-documented history of varicella or zoster | Yes |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **laboratory evidence of immunity**. The PA should undergo varicella IgG serology to document immunity [^11546KDS]. If serology is negative or unavailable, he should receive two doses of varicella vaccine 4–8 weeks apart [^11546KDS]. Oral confirmation of infection is insufficient, and the "birth before 1980" rule does not apply to healthcare personnel [^11546KDS].

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes both varicella and herpes zoster. In 1995 a varicella vaccine was licensed in the United States and was incorporated into the routine vaccination programme for children; a decline of varicella among children and adults, and a reduction in associated hospitalisation, complications and mortality, has resulted. In the UK, a policy of targeted vaccination of at-risk groups has been in place since the vaccine was introduced. Here we review the evidence for the different approaches to VZV vaccination policy.

Varicella — preplacement immunity documentation and vaccination: Health care workers should have their varicella immune status documented at time of preplacement examination, with adequate evidence of immunity defined as documentation of positive varicella antibodies, receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine, or clinician-documented chicken pox or herpes zoster. Those with negative, unknown, or undocumented histories should have a varicella zoster virus titer checked. Health care personnel without evidence of immunity should receive two doses of varicella vaccine, 4–8 weeks apart. If post-vaccination skin lesions occur, the employee should be restricted from patient care until lesions are crusted; otherwise, work restrictions are not necessary for newly vaccinated personnel.

Varicella zoster virus primarily causes chickenpox, usually a mild self-limiting illness of childhood. However, complications occur in 1% with 4200 annual deaths. Since the first vaccination was developed in the 1970s, many countries have introduced universal mass immunisation, but the UK currently only routinely immunises 'at-risk' populations. With increasing availability of private varicella vaccination, this article reviews the pros and cons of whether parents should be immunising their children with the chickenpox vaccine privately.

### Screening healthcare workers for varicella-zoster virus: can we trust the history? [^116tM8fN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relationship between immunity and a history of chickenpox based on a self-administered questionnaire.

Methods

We investigated immunity to varicella-zoster virus in a cohort of newly recruited employees with different job categories and different nationalities using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgG.

Results

There were 1,058 new recruits. Of these, 890 (84%) were immune and 168 (16%) were susceptible. The susceptibility rate was 23% (n = 77) for Asian, 15% (n = 14) for South African, 13% (n = 66) for Middle Eastern, and 9% (n = 11) for Western employees. Physicians were more likely to be immune (93%) than were nurses (85%), medical technicians (75%), or administrative clerks (84%). Seropositivity was not affected by age or gender. The positive predictive value of a history of chickenpox for the seropositivity was 89% (511 of 574); the negative predictive value was 22% (105 of 484). History of chickenpox had a sensitivity of 57% (511 of 890) and a specificity of 63% (105 of 168).

Conclusions

The varicella-zoster virus seroprevalence among new employees was low, posing an important risk to existing employees and patients. Positive or negative history of chickenpox was an unreliable indicator of susceptibility among healthcare workers of different nationalities. Serologic screening of all employees and vaccination of those susceptible was recommended.

Opportunistic infection and vaccine-related screening in HIV — All persons with HIV born in 1957 or after should be tested for immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) by measuring antibodies, and varicella vaccine should be considered for persons who have not had chickenpox or shingles and who have not been previously vaccinated. Screening for toxoplasma IgG is recommended for asymptomatic persons with CD4 count < 200 cells/µL and for those with symptoms suggestive of toxoplasmosis. Testing for serum cryptococcal antigen is indicated in persons with CD4 count < 100 cells/µL and in symptomatic patients but is not routinely recommended in asymptomatic persons if CD4 count is ≥ 100 cells/µL. Screening for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and, for persons having vaginal sex, trichomonas should be performed at entry to care.

### Persistence of immunity to varicella-zoster virus after vaccination of healthcare workers [^116AJSMg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine is recommended to protect susceptible healthcare workers (HCWs) from serious disease and to prevent nosocomial spread of VZV. We evaluated clinical outcomes and serological responses in HCWs after immunization with live attenuated VZV vaccine.

Design

Vaccinees were immunized from 1979 to 1998 during VZV vaccine trials, as well as after licensure, and followed prospectively for 1 month to 20.6 (mean 4.6) years after vaccination. Sera were tested by fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA), latex agglutination (LA), and enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) to detect VZV-specific antibodies.

Study Participants

The median age of the 120 HCWs was 26 years; 51 (42%) were males.

Interventions

Ninety eight (82%) of these study subjects received vaccine prepared by Merck and 22 (18%) by SmithKline Beecham; 25, 81, and 14 vaccinees received one dose, two doses, and three doses, respectively.

Results

The crude attack rate was 10%; 12 of 120 HCWs developed chickenpox 6 months to 8.4 years after vaccination. The attack rates following household and hospital exposures were 18% (4/22) and 8% (6/72), respectively. All resulting illness was mild to moderate (mean 40 vesicles). Seroconversion after vaccination was documented by FAMA in 96% of HCWs, although 31% lost detectable antibodies. Compared with FAMA, LA and EIA were 82% and 74% sensitive and 94% and 89% specific, respectively.

Conclusions

The VZV vaccine effectively protected HCWs from varicella, particularly from serious disease. Currently available serological tests are not optimal, and improved assays are needed.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^114dB6Qw]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination — routine and catch-up recommendations state that children should have a 2-dose series of either MMR or measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) at 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years, and dose 2 of the MMR vaccine may be administered as early as 4 weeks after dose 1. Adults born in 1957 or later should have had either 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine unless they have other acceptable evidence to immunity to these three diseases, while adults born before 1957 can be considered to have immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps. Adults who received either the inactivated measles vaccine or an unknown vaccine type from 1963 to 1967 during childhood should receive 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, and adults who might be at increased risk for exposure or transmission of measles, rubella, or mumps and who do not have evidence of immunity should receive special consideration for vaccination; students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers without evidence of immunity or prior vaccination should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. For catch-up, unvaccinated children and adolescents should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) in pregnancy — risk, transmission, immunity requirements, and work restrictions are outlined: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) (the virus which causes chicken pox and herpes zoster) may cause fetal malformations when a non- immune pregnant mother is exposed, and VZV is spread by contact or via the airborne route. Patients with chicken pox or with disseminated herpes zoster should be cared for by personnel with established serological immunity using contact and airborne precautions. All health care personnel should have documented immunity to varicella, either through a positive varicella IgG, or two doses of a varicella-containing vaccine. Non-immune pregnant health care workers should be vaccinated in the post-partum period, and non- immune personnel, regardless of pregnancy status, should not care for patients with chicken pox or disseminated herpes zoster.

A 16-year-old varicella-seronegative resident at a chronic care facility received varicella vaccine; 15 days later he developed severe varicella. Subsequently, a 13-year-old resident and a 39-year-old health care worker developed mild varicella. We demonstrate that vaccine-strain virus was transmitted to both persons, and that transmission included at least 2 variant vaccine strains.

Chickenpox

Restrict individuals with suspected or active chickenpox from entrance to the family-centered residential facility.
Once the rash has crusted and the patient does not have a fever, they may be allowed to enter the facility. Prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician that confirms that the rash has completely crusted and the person is no longer contagious.
Supplementary Material Tabledefines "significant exposures to chickenpox". Restrict individuals with exposures to chickenpox until they meet the criteria in Supplementary Material, Table. Prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician that documents the reason(s) the exposed individual is not contagious (see Supplementary Material, Figure). To be considered not contagious, a person must meet 1 of 4 of these criteria (see Supplementary Material, Table): The person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a healthcare professional) The person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months The person has documented varicella antibodies (also known as a positive varicella IgG blood test) It has been at least 21 days since the person's last significant exposure to the person with chickenpox (if the exposed person received post-exposure prophylaxis, such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or varicella zoster immune globulin, it must be 28 days rather than 21 since their last exposure).
Request that individuals with suspected chickenpox leave the facility immediately and seek medical evaluation. Require written medical clearance to return.
Contact the referring medical facility and local public health department for further instruction and assistance with testing to confirm the chickenpox diagnosis.
Individuals with chickenpox are considered contagious 2 days before the first appearance of a rash. If an individual diagnosed with active chickenpox entered the facility any time during the 2 days before the rash appeared, notify the program manager immediately, who then must identify and notify exposed guests and instruct them to consult their primary care physician or licensed clinician immediately to determine need for post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis must be administered within 10 days of exposure to varicella.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^116rcB63]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) — entry, exposure, and clearance protocols for family-centered residential facilities specify the following: Restrict individuals with suspected or active chickenpox from entrance. Once the rash has crusted and the patient does not have a fever, they may be allowed to enter the facility, but prior to entry require written medical clearance confirming the rash has completely crusted and the person is no longer contagious. Restrict individuals with exposures to chickenpox until they meet criteria with written medical clearance; to be considered not contagious, a person must meet 1 of 4 criteria: past history of chickenpox or shingles diagnosed by a healthcare professional; documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine separated by at least 3 months; documented varicella antibodies (positive varicella IgG blood test); or at least 21 days since last significant exposure (28 days after exposure if post-exposure prophylaxis such as intravenous immune globulin or varicella zoster immune globulin was received). A person with chickenpox is highly contagious starting from 2 days before the first appearance of the rash until all the blisters have completely dried and crusted. If diagnosed, request suspected individuals leave for medical evaluation, require medical clearance for readmission, and immediately notify the local public health department; post-exposure prophylaxis must be administered within 10 days of exposure to varicella.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113wwHDk]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella (chickenpox) — For people with HIV and CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 with no evidence of immunity to varicella, give a two-dose (0.5 mL SQ) series of VAR 4–8 weeks apart (BIII). Varivax is contraindicated if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 (AIII) and Varivax is not recommended in pregnancy (AIII). Evidence of immunity includes documented receipt of two doses of Varivax or MMRV; diagnosis of varicella or zoster by a health care provider; or laboratory evidence of immunity or disease. If vaccination results in disease because of vaccine virus, treatment with acyclovir is recommended (AIII). ACIP alignment: no difference in recommendations.

### Immunization for hospital staff [^117JiUZk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review the recent literature on the topic of immunization of healthcare workers is assessed. The emphasis lies on immunizations that are directly related to the risks of healthcare workers in the workplace.

Recent Findings

Acceptance of influenza immunization by healthcare workers remains too low, whereas other preventive measures such as hepatitis B vaccination are usually not disputed. Efforts to improve the knowledge of healthcare workers about influenza, its epidemic potential and clinical consequences have contributed to higher immunization rates in some hospitals. Immunization against varicella zoster virus does not result in immunity in all vaccinated persons. This lack of complete protection has infection-control implications, namely the recommendation to wear a mask when caring for clinical cases, regardless of the immunization status. The topic of immunization of healthcare workers has recently been dominated by the discussion of smallpox vaccination, which was promoted by the American public-health authorities for some groups of healthcare workers.

Summary

Immunization is a preventive measure that is highly cost-effective. Healthcare workers are responsible for the safety and well-being of their patients and should do their utmost to prevent the transmission of infectious pathogens to them. Another positive result of the adherence of healthcare workers to the recommended immunization schedule is the improved self-protection at the workplace. Immunization against some highly contagious infectious agents has been recommended for many years. The list is now being expanded again by the recommendation of smallpox vaccination. Regarding this indication, several questions and safety issues must be resolved in order to positively influence the currently rather sceptical attitude of healthcare workers towards this vaccine.

### Healthcare maintenance in elderly patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115eBvTZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)

Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes no specific MMR vaccination recommendations for adults aged 60 or older, except for healthcare personnel. For unvaccinated healthcare personnel lacking immunity to any of these viruses, vaccination should be considered (2 doses for measles and mumps, 1 dose for rubella). Some authors suggest checking antibody titers in older IBD patients with an unknown vaccination history. In immunocompetent patients who lack immunity to any of these viruses, the vaccine should be administered.

Varicella

The absolute risk of primary varicella infection in older IBD patients is unknown. Cullen et al identified 20 reported cases of primary varicella infection in IBD patients, with 5 deaths. The risk of infection increased with immunosuppressive therapy, particularly with corticosteroids and combination immunosuppressive therapy.

Although adults born in the US before 1980 are considered immune to varicella, with the exception of pregnant women and healthcare personnel, IBD patients should be tested for varicella zoster virus antibody titers if there is uncertainty about their history of infection or vaccination. A two-dose varicella vaccine, with at least 4 weeks between doses, is recommended for seronegative, immunocompetent adults. In seronegative patients on immunosuppressive therapy, varicella vaccine may be administered 3–6 months following cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^112JBMgQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Varicella vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is given as a 2-dose series at age 12 months and 4–6 years with high uptake and effectiveness, and the varicella vaccine should be administered to all nonimmunosuppressed patients with IBD who lack prior chicken pox or a completed series; the vaccine series can be administered 4 weeks before starting immunosuppressive therapy, and if already on immunosuppressive therapy, experts from the CDC recommend waiting 3 months after discontinuation before administration. Epidemiologic and meta-analytic data show substantial population benefit, with an approximate 90% decline in varicella incidence after vaccine introduction and infection rates decreasing from 800–1,600 per 100,000 in 1995 to < 200 per 100,000 in 2016, and a meta-analysis of 42 studies showing 81% effectiveness for 1 dose increasing to 92% after a second dose. For determining immunity, the ACIP does not recommend using commercial assays if immunization history is available, and commercial ELISA had a 34% false-negative rate compared with a more sensitive assay.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111vZR4w]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept — Varicella immunity evaluation before immune-modifying therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Adults with IBD should be evaluated for varicella immunity before initiating immune-modifying therapy through either a documented history of chickenpox infection or completion of a 2-dose varicella vaccine series; serologic testing is not recommended in previously vaccinated individuals because of the high false-negative rates, and if nonimmune status is confirmed, vaccination should be completed before initiating immune-modifying therapy when possible.

### Outbreak of varicella-zoster virus infection among Thai healthcare workers [^112QU2tJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the correlation between self-report of a prior history of chickenpox and results of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G serologic test results in an outbreak of VZV infection among Thai healthcare workers (HCWs) and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of establishing routine VZV immunization as part of an occupational health program on the basis of the outbreak data.

Methods

All exposed patients received prophylaxis and the HCWs in our 3 intensive care units (ICUs) were prospectively evaluated. HCWs were assessed for disease history and serologic evidence of VZV IgG. A cost-benefit analysis was performed.

Results

After 140 HCWs and 18 ICU patients were exposed to VZV, 10 HCWs (7%) with active VZV infection were relieved from work until skin lesions were crusted. Acyclovir (ACV) was prescribed to all 10 HCWs with active disease, and all 18 exposed patients received prophylaxis with ACV. Of 140 HCWs, 100 consented to longitudinal follow-up. Twenty-three (100%) of the HCWs who reported a history of chickenpox also had serologic test results that were positive for VZV IgG, compared with 30 (39%) of 77 HCWs who reported no prior history of chickenpox, yet had test results that were positive for VZV IgG. Reported history of chickenpox had a sensitivity of 43%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 61% with respect to VZV infection immunity. The total cost estimate for this outbreak investigation was $23,087.

Conclusions

An HCW's reported history of chickenpox was a reliable predictor of immunity; a report of no prior history of chickenpox was unreliable. Our cost-benefit analysis suggests that the costs of an occupational health program that included VZV surveillance and immunization for the next 323 HCWs would be approximately equal to the excess costs of $17,227 for the ACV therapy, HCW furloughs, and staff overtime associated with this outbreak.

Varicella and zoster vaccination — adults and adolescents with HIV: Varicella vaccination (Varivax) should be considered as 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine administered 3 months apart for adults and adolescents with HIV with a CD4 count > 200 cells/μL on suppressive ART who do not have prior evidence of immunity to varicella and with a CD4 cell percentage ≥ 15%; persons without evidence of immunity at risk after exposure should receive varicella zoster IG within 10 days. Varicella zoster IG is not indicated for persons who received 2 doses of varicella vaccine and became immunocompromised later in life. RZV (Shingrix) should be administered to adults aged ≥ 18 years using 2 doses 2–6 months apart for prevention of herpes zoster; those with virus suppressed on ART with CD4 count > 200 cells/μL may respond better, but the vaccine can be safely given regardless of CD4 cell count, and those who have not had varicella exposure should not be offered this vaccine. Data indicate that 99% of those born prior to 1980 have had varicella, and studies in HIV have found the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic after 2 doses.

### Management and outcome of a varicella exposure in a neonatal intensive care unit: lessons for the vaccine era [^115GnWGk]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella exposure in health care settings poses a threat to susceptible, immunocompromised hosts. We describe the management and outcome of a varicella exposure in a neonatal intensive care unit.

Methods

We reviewed the history of the index case, determination of the exposed cohort, medical management of exposed neonates, and assignment of health care workers based on exposure and immune status. We present the results of serologic testing of health care workers related to their history of varicella disease.

Results

Of 427 health care workers assessed at the time of the exposure, 13.1% were seronegative for varicella. Among 180 employees recorded as having a previous history of varicella, 9 were seronegative. A total of 34 infants received prophylaxis with intravenous immune globulin; acyclovir prophylaxis was added for those born at < 28 weeks gestational age. The exposed cohort was isolated. No secondary cases of varicella occurred among patients or health care workers.

Conclusion

Nosocomial varicella exposures require rapid assessment and response, which can be guided by a checklist of actions. Varicella immunity in health care workers cannot be assumed even among those born before 1980; institutional policies should adhere to the 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of immunity to varicella for health care workers.

### Varicella seroprevalence among health care workers in Korea: validity of self-reported history and cost-effectiveness of prevaccination screening [^116CSwGX]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The validity of self-reported varicella history and cost-effectiveness of a prevaccination screening strategy have not been examined among health care workers (HCWs) living in Korea.

Methods

We investigated varicella-zoster virus immunity of all HCWs in high-risk departments. To determine the history of varicella, all applicants completed a standardized questionnaire at the time of blood sampling for serologic testing.

Results

Of the 550 HCWs, 526 (96%) were varicella seropositive. Although self-reported history was highly predictive of seropositivity (≥ 96%) among all age groups, the negative predictive value was extremely low (4%-5%) among all age groups. The prevaccination screening strategy was cheaper than vaccination without antibody screening if the varicella seroprevalence was > 28%.

Conclusion

Seroprevalence was high (≥ 95%) among HCWs born in Korea before 1988. The self-reported varicella history did not accurately predict immunity, especially for individuals who have negative or uncertain varicella history. Given the high seroprevalence of varicella in Korean HCWs, serologic screening before vaccination was more cost-effective than universal vaccination.

### Prevention of varicella: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116mBhzf]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Two live, attenuated varicella zoster virus-containing vaccines are available in the United States for prevention of varicella: 1) a single-antigen varicella vaccine (VARIVAX, Merck & Co, Inc, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which was licensed in the United States in 1995 for use among healthy children aged ≥ 12 months, adolescents, and adults; and 2) a combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (ProQuad, Merck & Co, Inc, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which was licensed in the United States in 2005 for use among healthy children aged 12 months-12 years. Initial Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for prevention of varicella issued in 1995 (CDC. Prevention of varicella: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1996;45 [No. RR-11]) included routine vaccination of children aged 12–18 months, catch-up vaccination of susceptible children aged 19 months-12 years, and vaccination of susceptible persons who have close contact with persons at high risk for serious complications (e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of immunocompromised persons). One dose of vaccine was recommended for children aged 12 months-12 years and 2 doses, 4–8 weeks apart, for persons aged ≥ 13 years. In 1999, ACIP updated the recommendations (CDC. Prevention of varicella: updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1999;48 [No. RR-6]) to include establishing child care and school entry requirements, use of the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine for certain children infected with human immunodeficiency virus, and vaccination of adolescents and adults at high risk for exposure or transmission. In June 2005 and June 2006, ACIP adopted new recommendations regarding the use of live, attenuated varicella vaccines for prevention of varicella. This report revises, updates, and replaces the 1996 and 1999 ACIP statements for prevention of varicella. The new recommendations include 1) implementation of a routine 2-dose varicella vaccination program for children, with the first dose administered at age 12–15 months and the second dose at age 4–6 years; 2) a second dose catch-up varicella vaccination for children, adolescents, and adults who previously had received 1 dose; 3) routine vaccination of all healthy persons aged ≥ 13 years without evidence of immunity; 4) prenatal assessment and postpartum vaccination; 5) expanding the use of the varicella vaccine for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte percentages of 15%-24% and adolescents and adults with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts ≥ 200 cells/microL; and 6) establishing middle school, high school, and college entry vaccination requirements. ACIP also approved criteria for evidence of immunity to varicella.

### Risk of herpes zoster after exposure to varicella to explore the exogenous boosting hypothesis: self controlled case series study using UK electronic healthcare data [^114cojrd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Capture of zoster cases is likely to be reliable and comprehensive. Zoster is typically a straightforward diagnosis, as it has a characteristic dermatomal distribution. Evidence suggests that most people with zoster seek out healthcare: a US based health and retirement survey among adults aged 55 and older reported that more than 91% who self reported herpes zoster had sought medical care; another US based survey about immunisation practices in the US among adults aged 60 and older found that 95% of those who knew they had zoster sought care; and a community based retrospective survey in Beijing, China (all ages) found that 92.4% of participants had sought healthcare for zoster. Varicella is similarly a straightforward diagnosis, so our records are likely to be reliable. We used a population based sample, representative of the UK population for age, sex, and ethnicityand therefore our findings are likely to be generalisable to the UK population.

This study also has some limitations. Varicella is likely to be under-ascertained in UK electronic health records; varicella tends to be a mild, self limiting condition that does not require a visit to the doctor, and consultations with doctors for varicella have been declining in the UK (between 2004 and 2014 by around 20% in 1–3 year olds and 6% in 4–6 year olds). This misclassification of varicella exposure might result in some true exposed time being misclassified as unexposed time (if the household contacts with varicella did not attend their general practice or our observation period did not cover the time of first exposure) and could therefore bias the effect estimate towards the null, thus potentially underestimating the effect of exogenous boosting. We were not able to capture occupational exposure to varicella, such as in healthcare or childcare workers: about two million people, or 5% of the population of England, during their work could be exposed to children with varicella. Household cases of varicella are, however, likely to cluster together; studies suggest that about 78% of healthy household contacts develop varicella. In this case, if only a second or subsequent child presented to the doctor, the true first exposure would likely be in the 60 day pre-exposure period (because household clusters tend to occur within a few weeks of each other). This would mean that our current estimate for 0- < 2 years is biased away from the null — that is, we have overestimated boosting effects in the 0- < 2 years' risk period.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: prevention of varicella and of zoster [^111rxHhG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of VZV Infections

During the time vOka was being tested, it became possible to use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify DNA encoding VZV genes in skin lesions. PCR is a much more sensitive and reliable means of identifying VZV than culture of the virus. It is also possible to use PCR and DNA sequencing to distinguish wild-type VZV from vOka in lesions. The availability and reliability of these assays enabled activity of vOka to be accurately analyzed in immunized individuals, enabling reactions to the vaccine to be distinguished from vaccine failures.

Currently Licensed Vaccines Against Varicella

Vaccines employing vOka have now been licensed around the world, including, Varivax (Merck), Varilrix (Glaxo Smith Kline), and Okavax (Biken). In addition, 4 different Oka vaccines are used in China. SuduVax is used in South Korea and is the only non-Oka strain vaccine. Amounts of VZV virus vary slightly in the different vaccines. Merck and Glaxo Smith Kline market a combination vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines (MMRV) for use in children at the ages of 12 months to 12 years. Because the measles component is immunosuppressive, a compensatory increase in the amount of vOka had to be used in MMRV. Although the change increased cost, it was worthwhile because the quadrivalent product greatly enhances convenience and thus vaccine uptake. Immunization of immunocompromised patients with vOka is not recommended. As with measles virus, protection from varicella in immunocompromised individuals mainly depends upon herd immunity, requiring widespread vaccine uptake.

According to the CDC, evidence of immunity to varicella includes any of the following: documented age-appropriate vaccination (1 or 2 doses depending on the age of the child), birth in the United States before 1980, or verified history of varicella or zoster. (Pregnant women, healthcare personnel, and immunocompromised individuals require a more thorough evaluation than the general population.) Measurement of levels of antibodies to VZV after immunization of children or adults adds to the expense of vaccination and does not necessarily provide useful information.

### Prevalence of measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella antibodies among healthcare workers in Japan [^111CyD71]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the immune status of healthcare workers (HCWs) against measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella in Japan, and to promote an adequate vaccination program among HCWs.

Setting

University of Tokyo Hospital.

Participants

Eight hundred seventy-seven HCWs.

Design

Serologic screening for measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella was performed on HCWs. Antibodies against measles, rubella, and mumps were detected using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay ($4.20 per test). If serum was negative by HI assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) was performed ($12.60 per test). Anti-varicella antibodies were detected by EIA only.

Results

Among tested HCWs, 98.5%, 90.4%, 85.8%, and 97.2% had immunity to measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella, respectively. All those born before 1970 were seropositive for measles. However, individuals susceptible to rubella, mumps, and varicella were present in all age groups. The sensitivities and negative predictive values of HI assay compared with EIA were 86.6% and 11.3% for measles, 99.1% and 92.2% for rubella, and 47.8% and 24.1% for mumps, respectively. For measles and mumps, prevaccination screening by HI assay in combination with EIA led to significant savings compared with EIA only. In contrast, it was estimated that prevaccination screening using only HI assay would be more economical for rubella.

Conclusions

Aggressive screening and vaccination of susceptible HCWs was essential regardless of age. Prevaccination serologic screening using a combination of HI assay and EIA was more economical for measles and mumps.

All seronegative subjects in contact with a newborn with VZV infection should be offered immunisation (two doses with a minimum of 6 weeks between injections) unless contraindicated (infants and immunodeficient persons) within the 72 hours of the infectious contact. This recommendation is particularly important for adolescents and adults who are at major risk of severe disease presentation.

### The impact of universal varicella vaccination on herpes zoster incidence in the United States: comparison of birth cohorts preceding and following varicella vaccination program launch [^115M2vbx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

When the US varicella vaccination program was introduced in 1995, its impacts on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ) were not precisely known. We used a large claims database to examine HZ incidence in the US during 1998–2019 among persons aged ≥ 30 years (the prevaccine cohort, born before 1990), and aged 1–29 years (includes the postvaccine cohort, born since 1990). We defined incident HZ as the first instance of an outpatient or emergency department (ED) claim with an HZ diagnostic code. Additionally, we examined the proportion of HZ visits among all ED visits as a complementary method to assess for healthcare-seeking artifacts in the findings. In persons aged ≥ 30 years (prevaccine cohort), we observed age-specific increases in HZ incidence during the earlier study years, with decelerations in later years, starting in 2007 with oldest age groups. Similar patterns were seen when we examined HZ visits as a proportion of all ED visits. For persons aged 1–29 years, age-specific HZ incidence increased early in the study period for the oldest age groups who were born prevaccine, but later declined in a stepwise pattern once each age group was comprised of persons born in the postvaccine period. Our results, corroborated with previously published studies, do not support prior modeling predictions that the varicella vaccination program would increase HZ incidence among adult cohorts who previously experienced varicella. Our findings also suggest that continued declines in age-specific HZ incidence as varicella-vaccinated cohorts age are likely.

### Vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks among healthcare workers: a scoping review [^112FuQDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Varicella

Sixteen (7%) articles described varicella outbreaks in HCWs (Supplementary Table 5). Four reported outbreaks in intensive care settings (25%). Interestingly, 2 (13%) outbreaks occurred in autopsy rooms through handling of a deceased infected patient. Seventy-eight varicella cases were reported in HCWs; all recovered without hospitalization and 1 experienced prolonged symptoms. Vaccinated cases were reported to be milder. Outbreaks caused significant disruption to healthcare activities, including the temporary closure of essential services (eg, chemotherapy unit) and healthcare absenteeism. Only 1 article discussed policy implications — universal vaccination for staff and visitors following the outbreak. Vaccination was used as part of outbreak response in 9 (56%) studies. Four (25%) studies reported using acyclovir for postexposure prophylaxis.

Tuberculosis

Exposure to TB can cause both latent TB infection and active TB disease. Of the 25 (12%) articles, 17 studies (68%) identified latent TB infection and 10 (40%) identified cases of active TB disease (Supplementary Table 6). One study identified all nosocomial cases of TB reported over a 38-year period. Tuberculosis treatment outcomes for HCWs were often missing, likely due to the prolonged treatment duration. Where TB treatment outcomes were known, all HCWs recovered without complications. One study measured interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) at monthly intervals and found the conversion followed by reversion to negative IGRA test results after an inadvertent laboratory sample exposure. Several active TB cases were described where HCWs were exposed to aerosol-generating procedures, without adequate infection-control procedures. Genomic testing was used to link clusters in 2 separate papers where outbreaks of active TB disease were reported in patients and HCWs; the genomic testing was able to determine that some of the reported HCWs' TB disease was likely unrelated to the described outbreak cluster.

### Use and limitations of varicella-zoster virus-specific serological testing to evaluate breakthrough disease in vaccinees and to screen for susceptibility to varicella [^116ebQeH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A plethora of tests for determining the presence of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been developed over the years, with a wide range of performance standards. There is general agreement that the presence of VZV antibodies in serum indicates immunity to varicella and protection from chickenpox, although the role of specific antibody in mediating protection remains unclear. Both antibodies and cellular immunity probably interact to mediate immunity to the virus. In any case, VZV-specific serum antibody is a useful indicator of protection against chickenpox in patients and persons at high risk of exposure, whether they have been immunized or naturally infected. Serological tests are also a useful implement for evaluating the length of time that immunity to varicella persists after vaccination and whether waning of vaccine-induced immunity occurs. The purpose of this review is to contrast the strengths and weaknesses of currently available VZV antibody assays. Although several of these methods are useful for various specific applications, simpler and more accurate tests to measure antibodies to VZV are a high priority for future research and development.

### Diagnostic and immunologic testing for varicella in the era of high-impact varicella vaccination: an evolving problem [^112iPhEL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of varicella in unvaccinated persons, with skin vesicles and scabs, has facilitated the use of rapid diagnostic methods for confirming disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are the diagnostic method of choice. The sharp decline in unmodified cases of varicella due to the US varicella vaccination program has led to fewer healthcare providers being familiar with varicella presentation and an increased reliance on laboratory diagnosis to confirm suspected cases. The mild, atypical presentation of the disease in vaccinated persons (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) has made it more challenging for providers to recognize and also to collect samples to detect the virus. Nonetheless, PCR is highly sensitive and specific in confirming modified disease if adequate samples are provided. While a positive PCR result is confirmatory, interpreting a negative result can prove to be more challenging in determining whether suspected varicella is falsely negative or attributable to other causes. Enhanced education of healthcare providers is critical for adequate specimen collection from modified varicella cases. In addition, more sensitive commercial serologic assays are needed in the United States for varicella immunity testing in the vaccine era.

### Updated recommendations for use of variZIG – United States, 2013 [^113sXvdv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

These recommendations reflect the ACIP work group discussions and review of scientific evidence related to use of varicella zoster immune globulin conducted during the development of the ACIP statements on prevention of varicella as well as a review of published literature to include reports with immune globulins with high anti–varicella-zoster virus antibodies used outside the United States > 4 days after exposure to varicella-zoster virus. When data were not available, expert opinion was considered.

### Influence of population immunosuppression and past vaccination on smallpox reemergence [^1168S5KG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccine-Induced Residual Immunity

In the United States, including New York, widespread smallpox vaccination occurred until 1970. In contrast, in the geographically isolated island continent of Australia, quarantine was used to protect the population because smallpox was never endemic. Widespread vaccination never occurred in Australia; only the armed forces and healthcare workers were vaccinated, which occurred until 1979, although reactive vaccination campaigns had been conducted during a smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1917.

For New York, we assumed 80% of the healthy population 40–69 years of age (born before 1975) were previously vaccinated. For Sydney, we estimated the proportion of persons vaccinated by estimating those born before 1980 in the following groups: healthcare workers in Sydney in 2015, members of the defense forces, and migrants (> 30% in the Sydney population), who might have been vaccinated in their country of origin (≈80,000 persons). We estimated that, in Sydney, at most 30% of the total population born before 1980 (persons 35–69 years of age) had been vaccinated. On the basis of a mathematical model that estimated waning immunity against severe smallpox as 1.41% per year after vaccination, we calculated the age-specific residual protection for vaccinated persons 40–69 years of age by multiplying that percentage by the number of years from vaccination and subtracting it from 100% starting protection.

Contact Mixing

In our model, we used the heterogeneous age-specific contact rates from the European mixing patterns study. We assumed that persons would greatly reduce their social contacts after becoming symptomatic with smallpox. To account for this change in social contact, we modified the normal contact matrix, multiplying the matrix by a factor (0 < x < 1) to reduce the number of contacts per day. Because of the lack of studies quantifying this reduction, we assumed x to be 0.5, as in a previous study. Considering severe smallpox types are more substantially prostrating, we applied the reduced contact matrix to hemorrhagic and flat smallpox infections from the first day of illness. For ordinary smallpox, we assumed the behavior change started on the second day and for vaccine-modified smallpox, on the third day.

Disease Types

We categorized smallpox disease into 4 different types defined by infectivity (R 0) and CFRs: hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary, and vaccine-modified. Age-specific and other model parameters (Technical Appendix Table 2) as well as further model details are explained in the Technical Appendix.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^115CSBvH]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunity and post-exposure management — health care workers should have documented immunity to measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), with adequate proof of immunity consisting of documented vaccination (2 doses MMR, > 28 days apart with first dose after 1st birthday), laboratory documentation of protective titers, laboratory documentation of disease, or birth before 1957. In the setting of a measles, mumps or rubella outbreak, vaccination with two doses of MMR also is recommended for those born before 1957 who do not otherwise have evidence of immunity. MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy and specific instructions should be provided regarding avoidance of conception for at least 3 months, and because it is a live virus vaccine, MMR should not be administered to individuals with severe immunosuppression. If inadvertent exposure occurs to an infected patient, non-immune health care workers should be furloughed from day 5 following first exposure until day 21 following last exposure for measles, from day 12 following first exposure until day 25 following last exposure for mumps, and from day 7 following first exposure until day 23 following last exposure for rubella (or seven days following onset of rash if the health care worker develops rubella).

### Varicella in adult foreigners at a referral hospital, central tokyo, Japan, 2012–2016 [^1152GGXw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

In an outbreak study of 18 varicella cases among Mexican-born workers in Alabama, USA, Mexican-born workers were 5 times more likely to be susceptible to VZV than US-born workers. Although postexposure prophylaxis vaccine was provided to susceptible workers, a second dose was not administered to many of those who needed it. This finding shows the difficulty in reaching these populations because of their lack of stable access to healthcare. Faced with a rapidly aging population, Japan has also been accepting nurses and caregivers from countries in Southeast Asia as medical personnel in healthcare facilities and nursing homes. Thus, nosocomial infection with VZV is also a matter of concern.

Japan had 208,000 international students during 2015. More than 90% of these students were from countries in Asia; most were from China (45%), Vietnam (19%), and Nepal (8%). The demographics of the case-patients in our study were consistent with these data. In general, colleges are suitable environments for communicable disease outbreaks because of highly dense interactions among students and staff, crowded living conditions, and an influx of students from many countries. Because 10%–20% of persons in Japan 15–30 years of age are susceptible to VZV, varicella outbreaks among international students might spread into the local student population. Despite these facts, Japan does not have any regulations or recommendations regarding the health of international students. In the United States, the American College Health Association strongly recommends institutional prematriculation immunizations. These guidelines recommend that all college students should have 2 doses of varicella vaccine unless they have other evidence of VZV immunity.

This varicella case series occurred in multifactorial contexts. However, little is known about the immunity against VZV among foreign residents in Japan. Educational institutions that receive international students need to consider varicella as a major preventable health issue among their students. Healthcare providers for immigrants and international students should also be aware of the risk for varicella and should verify VZV immunity or varicella vaccination status for students.

### Notes from the field: hospital contact investigation for a patient who developed a zoster vaccine-related rash-Maryland, February 2015 [^112hm7oW]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Development of a generalized rash following zoster vaccination is rare, but can occur. Circulation of wild type VZV has declined considerably during the era of varicella and zoster vaccines; however, given the delays and challenges in determining if a vesicular rash in a vaccine recipient is VZV, early institution of a contact investigation by clinicians and public health officials might mitigate the risk for VZV transmission. Potentially exposed contacts without evidence of VZV immunity should be vaccinated against varicella. Both varicella vaccination and varicella zoster immune globulin are most effective in preventing disease in susceptible persons when administered as soon as possible after exposure.

Health care settings should ensure that health care workers are immune to VZV. Documentation of immunity includes: 1) written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of varicella vaccine; 2) laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease; 3) diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella disease by a health care provider; or 4) diagnosis or verification of a history of herpes zoster by a health care provider. This case highlights the importance of maintaining vigilance for unusual events following the use of live vaccines in persons who receive immunosuppressant medications, the importance of vaccination for primary prevention of communicable diseases in hospital settings, and the value of a robust occupational health program as a critical component of hospital infection control efforts.

Shingles

Allow individuals with an active case of shingles to enter the family-centered residential facility only if they have written medical clearance documenting that these criteria are met: The blisters are localized on one side of the body and can be completely covered by a dressing and/or clothing The person has a normal immune system The person is not taking medications that can weaken their immune system The person is capable of frequent hand hygiene and understands the importance of caring for the blisters and the dressings to contain them.
If the person with shingles cannot meet all criteria above (see a-d), restrict them from the facility.
If the person with shingles meets criteria to allow entry, restrict the individual to a private room until the blisters have completely crusted.
Educate guests and visitors of the importance of frequent hand hygiene and appropriate disposal of potentially contaminated items (e.g. dressings, clothing, and linens).
People who are not immune to varicella can get chickenpox if directly exposed to shingles blisters. Interview individuals recently exposed to a person with shingles about the level of exposure to the blisters. If the person's exposure was significant (see Supplementary Material, Table), then require written medical clearance prior to entry to the facility (see Supplementary Material, Table). The documentation should include the reason the exposed individual is not contagious by meeting 1 of 4 of these criteria (see Supplementary Material, Table) The person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a licensed clinician) The person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months The person has documented varicella antibodies (also known as a positive varicella IgG blood test) It has been at least 21 days since the person's last contact with the blisters (if the exposed person received post-exposure prophylaxis [intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)] or varicella zoster immune globulin, it must be 28 days since last exposure).
Request that individuals suspected of having shingles leave the facility immediately and refer them for medical evaluation.
If medical evaluation rules out chickenpox and diagnoses the person with shingles, then refer to the above recommendations for managing a person with an active case of shingles.

### AGA clinical practice update on noncolorectal cancer screening and vaccinations in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113DLtkP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Best practice advice 5 — vaccination counseling in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Gastroenterology clinicians should discuss age-appropriate vaccines with adult patients who have IBD and share responsibility with primary care providers; patients with IBD should follow the adult immunization schedule advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for all vaccines with the exception of live vaccines, and patients receiving immune-modifying agents should be counseled against receiving live vaccines. Immunization history to the 2 live pediatric vaccines, varicella and measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine series, is presumptive evidence of immunity. All adults 18 to 26 years of age should receive human papillomavirus vaccine series, and those between 27 and 45 years of age should be vaccinated if they are likely to have a new sexual partner.

### Instituting a routine varicella vaccination program in Canada: an economic evaluation [^111YyvDA]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

After licensing of a varicella vaccine in Canada in 1998, Health Canada commissioned a study to evaluate options for a vaccination program. The evaluation of a program of vaccination of 12-month-old children, with and without a catch-up program for susceptible 12-year-olds, is presented here.

Methods

An economic model was developed simulating the expected experience, with and without vaccination, of cohorts of children susceptible to varicella. The cohorts were simulated for 70 years, and infection and complication rates were calculated along with the attendant costs, with an assumed vaccine cost of $60.

Results

With an 85% coverage rate vaccination is expected to reduce the number of chickenpox cases by approximately two-thirds and varicella-related complications by up to 75%. The overall costs of varicella are expected to drop by > $4 million (1998 Canadian dollars) per 100,000 eligible vaccinees, but costs to the health care system are expected to increase by > $2 million. From the health care system perspective, vaccination would cost approximately $42 per discounted case avoided.

Interpretation

Routine varicella vaccination would likely substantially reduce the overall costs of managing chickenpox but would result in an increase in health care expenditures. These findings are consistent with evaluations in other countries.

### Prevention and control of nosocomial varicella during the United States varicella vaccination program era [^1116mWTY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The United States varicella vaccination program has successfully reduced varicella incidence and hospitalizations by ≥ 90%, consequently reducing the risk of nosocomial exposures. However, patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) continue to introduce varicella zoster virus (VZV) into healthcare settings. Herpes zoster (HZ) is less contagious than varicella, but it can also result in exposures. Unrecognized varicella and HZ may lead to extensive contact investigations, control efforts, and HCP furloughs that result in significant disruption of healthcare activities as well as substantial costs. Robust occupational health and infection prevention programs that ensure healthcare personnel immunity and prompt recognition and isolation of patients with varicella or HZ will lower the risk of VZV transmission and reduce or eliminate the need to furlough exposed HCP and associated costs.

### Varicella immunity in vaccinated healthcare workers [^1115147p]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nosocomial spread of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection can cause severe disease among vulnerable patient-populations and healthcare personnel (HCP). Limited data are available on duration of varicella vaccine-induced protection among adults and to what extent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and antibody avidity contribute to protection.

Objective

Evaluate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of HCP who received a 2-dose regimen of varicella vaccine, and observe the responses to a 3rd vaccine dose among HCP who were seronegative after vaccination.

Study Design

A convenience sample of HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine was used to assess acquired VZV immune parameters (cytokine production, IgG avidity). HCP seronegative after 2 doses of vaccine were offered a third dose and evaluated further. Vaccine recipients' immune responses were compared with responses from persons with history of wild-type VZV infection.

Results

The convenience sample consisted of 101 HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine; 12 (11.9%) were seronegative post-vaccination. 11.5% of 61 seropositive 2-dose recipients produced low avidity antibody, suggesting suboptimal response to vaccine. Seven 2-dose vaccinees who were VZV seronegative seroconverted after a third dose; however, 3/7 (42.9%) produced low avidity IgG. 142 persons with a history of varicella were all VZV IgG seropositive, and all had moderate to high avidity IgG.

Conclusions

Measurements of serum IgG titers alone may not accurately reflect vaccine protection. Varicella vaccination of HCP remains important but further studies are needed to evaluate CMI and antibody avidity responses in HCP vaccinated with two doses of varicella vaccine.

### No consistent evidence of decreased exposure to varicella-zoster virus among older adults in countries with universal varicella vaccination [^112Q8PgS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we assessed humoral and CMI to determine whether VZV exposures are more common in adults aged ≥ 50 years in countries with widely circulating varicella versus countries with universal vaccination and good varicella control but found no consistent differences. Our results suggest a credible explanation why countries that have introduced varicella vaccination programs have not experienced postulated increases in herpes zoster incidence and can inform national authorities considering implementation of universal varicella vaccination. Repurposed immunological data from completed clinical trials can provide useful information with which to address important questions relating to the dynamics of infectious diseases.

SHEA practice update — varicella and shingles precautions in pediatric residential facilities — educate guests and visitors of the importance of frequent hand hygiene and appropriate disposal of potentially contaminated items. People who are not immune to varicella can get chickenpox if directly exposed to shingles blisters; interview individuals recently exposed about the level of exposure and, if the person's exposure was significant, require written medical clearance prior to entry, with documentation that the exposed individual is not contagious by meeting 1 of 4 criteria: the person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a licensed clinician), the person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months, the person has documented varicella antibodies (varicella zoster IgG), or it has been at least 21 days since the person's last contact with the blisters (if post-exposure prophylaxis with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or varicella zoster immune globulin was received, it must be 28 days since last exposure). Request that individuals suspected of having shingles leave the facility and stay isolated from children until they are healed and no longer contagious; if medical evaluation rules out chickenpox and diagnoses the person with shingles without pustular lesions or scabs, then the person can remain in the facility.

### Lessons learned: protection of healthcare workers from infectious disease risks [^111TyAos]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current concepts on preventing occupationally acquired infections in healthcare workers.

Design

Review of the pertinent medical literature.

Settings

Focus on healthcare workers practicing in acute care hospitals, especially intensive care units.

Subjects

Healthcare workers.

Measurements and Main Results

Key components of an effective infection control program include the following: 1) pre-exposure immunization with vaccines to prevent mumps, measles, rubella, varicella, pertussis, hepatitis B, and viral influenza; 2) adherence to standard precautions when providing patient care, especially the performance of hand hygiene before and after patient care; 3) rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate isolation precautions for patients with potentially communicable diseases; 4) proper use of personal protective equipment such as masks, N95 respirators, eye protection, and gowns when caring for patients with potentially communicable diseases; and 5) evaluation of personnel with exposure to communicable diseases for receipt of postexposure prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Risks of acquisition of infectious diseases by healthcare workers can be minimized by adherence to current infection control guidelines.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^114kp91e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Prevention recommendations — preventing exposure to varicella and HZ in households of children with HIV are specified. Children with HIV without evidence of immunity to varicella should avoid exposure to individuals with varicella or HZ, acknowledging that commercially available VZV antibody assays can have false-negative and false-positive results that limit certainty about immunity. Household contacts who lack evidence of immunity should receive varicella vaccine to reduce the possibility of transmitting wild-type VZV to their contacts who have HIV, and for the same reason, elderly household contacts should receive the HZ vaccine according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations.

### Evaluating the impact of moderate and severe varicella infections on Danish children under 18 years old: a comprehensive analysis from 2015 to 2023 [^114rHyRy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Varicella also known as chickenpox is a common pediatric disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It manifests as an itchy rash featuring vesicular blisters, often accompanied by mild-to-moderate fever and general malaise.VZV can assume a latent state within nerve ganglia after the primary infection and can be reactivated as herpes zoster (shingles) many years after primary infection.VZV is one of the most contagious pediatric diseases and approximately 90% of children contract the virus before reaching the age of 10. Immunity against the disease is considered lifelong.

In Denmark, varicella does not attain the status of a notifiable disease, and the disease is not part of the European surveillance portfolio managed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Consequently, there is no systematic surveillance system in place in Denmark to monitor the prevalence of varicella, rendering the precise burden of varicella disease in Denmark elusive. The annual incidence of varicella is estimated to be equivalent to the annual birth cohort, approximately 60,000 per year in Denmark, where most cases are children. While most varicella cases exhibit a mild and benign course, complications or hospitalizations are not infrequent.

Varicella is preventable by a live-attenuated vaccine. The varicella vaccination has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in impeding the onset of varicella, garnering the endorsement from the World Health Organization. The World Health Organization advocates for the consideration of varicella vaccines in countries where the disease exerts a substantial impact on public health and where there exists a potential for attaining high vaccination coverage, over 80%. Several countries have already successfully incorporated the varicella vaccine into their national immunization programs. In Denmark, varicella vaccines are currently procurable through the private market necessitating out-of-pocket expenditures.

European studies, where the vaccine is part of national immunization programs, show promising findings in the reduction of the incidence of varicella and related hospitalizations. A US study investigating the impact of the vaccine from 1993 to 2019 found a 97% reduction of varicella hospitalization for children. Noteworthy in Denmark, as in many other countries, concerns remain about the varicella vaccine. Specifically, there is apprehension about a potential age shift toward older age groups, which could lead to an increase in disease severity and elevated risk of herpes zoster later in life. Although current vaccine studies show promising benefits and encouraging evidence, its long-term effects, including potential drawbacks, remain uncertain and require further investigation to draw conclusive results.

### Varicella zoster virus immunity in multinational health care workers of a Saudi arabian hospital [^116KAwSW]. American Journal of Infection Control (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

The health care worker (HCW) is vulnerable to hospital-acquired varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, and thereafter may transmit infection to coworkers and patients who are susceptible and hospitalized. Interventions to prevent varicella transmission in HCW groups of uncertain immunity prove labor intensive, costly, and disruptive. Therefore, documentation of total varicella immunity in HCWs is desirable.

Setting

The National Guard King Abdulaziz Medical City is a 600-bed tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with a multinational staff.

Material and Method

A program to assess the VZV status of HCWs was initiated in 1999. The survey was confined to HCWs having direct patient contact. Questions elucidated previous history of varicella (chicken pox) infection, antibody testing against varicella, and varicella vaccination. HCWs with a negative or unknown history were subsequently tested for varicella antibodies (IgG).

Results

Seventy-six percent (2,047) of the HCWs responded to the questionnaire. Of these, 562 (28%) were physicians, 761 (37%) were nurses, 438 (21%) were medical technicians, and 286 (14%) were involved in clerical work. A total of 802 (39%) were from the Middle East including Saudi Arabia, 633 (31%) were from the Far East, 361 (18%) were from the West and from temperate areas, 138 (7%) were from South Africa, and 113 (5%) were from other nationalities. A previous history of VZV infection was reported by 1303 (64%); 262 (13%) had a history of positive test for varicella antibody, and only 44 (2%) had a history of varicella vaccination. Of the 744 (36%) HCWs who had a negative or unknown history of VZV infection, 217 (29%) underwent antibody testing. Of these, 181 (83%) proved to be immune (IgG ≥ 1.10), and 36 (17%) nonimmune (IgG < 1.2). The latter group have completed varicella immunization. Staff from the West (81%), Far East (78%), and South Africa (59%) reported more histories of VZV infection compared with the employees of Middle Eastern origin (46%) (P < .001) and disclosed a history of positive antibodies in 13%, 18%, 17%, and 8%, respectively (P < .001). In relation to occupation, nurses reported history of varicella infection (75%) and a history of positive varicella antibodies (16%) more than physicians (54% and 8%, respectively) (P < .05). Conversely, serologic immunity to VZV infection proved consistent among the different nationalities and among the 4 occupational groups.

Conclusion

Total varicella immunity of a multinational workforce can be realized through screening of HCWs and vaccination of susceptible individuals. It is preferred above repeated interventions after varicella exposure for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Knowledge of VZV infection varies between different nationalities and cannot be used as a true predictor of immunity. There is no difference in the immunity by antibody testing of staff recruited from temperate and tropical climates. Total varicella immunity should, therefore, be achieved through screening of all HCWs and vaccination of those susceptible.

### A cluster of primary varicella cases among healthcare workers with false-positive varicella zoster virus titers [^113CsNwH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Five cases of primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) we re diagnosed among hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). All had complied with a pre-employment VZV screening program and had been considered immune.

Objectives

To summarize the investigation of VZV among un-immunized HCWs and to provide recommendations for avoiding false-positive serologic tests.

Design

Risk of transmission of VZV to susceptible HCWs is minimized through serologic screening. Varicella vaccine is recommended for susceptible HCWs. A commercially available latex bead agglutination assay (LA) is widely used because it is rapid and easy to perform. LA was compared with the whole-cell varicella ELISA standardized in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Herpes Laboratory.

Setting/Population

Large inner-city, tertiary-employee population.

Results

In a year, 5 HCWs presented with laboratory-confirmed primary varicella infection. Four had VZV exposures 2 weeks prior to presentation. All had documented positive VZV titers by LA performed at hire. None were offered VZV vaccination. The original LAs were judged false-positives. INTERVENTION/FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION: Fifty-three consecutive VZV LA samples from the hospital laboratory were retested at the CDC. Forty-four samples concurred. Of the remaining 9, 4 were positive by hospital LA but negative by CDC IgG ELISA. Four were equivocal by hospital LA but negative by CDC IgG ELISA and LA. One was positive by hospital LA but negative by LA and equivocal by ELISA at the CDC.

Conclusion

LA may be prone to false-positive results and inappropriate for screening hospital HCWs.

### Varicella paediatric hospitalisations in Belgium: a 1-year national survey [^1171rRQR]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Varicella (chickenpox), caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), usually presents as a vesicular eruption associated with general symptoms like fever and malaise. Endemic worldwide, this infection is self-limiting in the vast majority of infected individuals. However, some complications are commonly described, mainly skin or disseminated bacterial superinfections, central nervous system disturbances, pneumonia and haematological disorders. Although these complications are more frequent and severe in high-risk subgroups (adults and adolescents, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients), they can also affect otherwise healthy children and subsequently increase the burden of the disease, in addition to its high societal and economic impact.

Safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines against varicella were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, varicella universal vaccination (UV) has been implemented for > 10 years in many countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, showing conclusive efficacy results. According to recent American and European studies, UV actually resulted in a decrease of at least 88% in varicella incidence, mortality, complicated cases and hospitalisations. Even though a slight shift of incidence peak was noticed towards older children, the vaccination's impact was demonstrated to be significant among all age groups. Based on long-term epidemiological surveillance, a global consensus was achieved to recommend a 2-dose schedule, in order to avoid breakthrough outbreaks and improve vaccine effectiveness and herd protection.

Nevertheless, most European countries remain hesitant to implement varicella UV (only implemented in 5 out of 28 European Union countries). The main reasons are a poorly defined cost–benefit balance in their own socioeconomic setting and important concurrent priorities for healthcare resource allocation. Additionally, some concern arose about a temporary increase in herpes zoster (HZ) after UV due to a lack of exogenous boosting. Although plausible and supported by mathematical models, this hypothesis remains a source of debate.

In Belgium, varicella incidence is estimated around 113 000 cases/year, leading to 28.8–35.7 general practitioners (GPs) visits/10 4 people per year. However, routine varicella vaccination is not yet recommended in our country. The vaccination coverage based on a subnational survey was estimated to be less than 2.5% (2-dose schedule). Few data are available on the real burden of varicella disease and on the potential benefits achievable from a national vaccination campaign in Belgium. In this study, we prospectively assessed the burden of varicella disease over the whole Belgian area through analysis of hospitalised cases during a 1-year period.

### Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent – Ohio, 2009 [^117VHUFV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The case described in this report can serve as a reminder of the importance of catch-up vaccination of older children and adolescents to prevent varicella and its serious complications later in life when disease can be more severe. Approaches that are used to implement catch-up vaccination include school-entry vaccination requirements and routine health-care provider visits. Ohio currently has a 2-dose varicella vaccination requirement for admission to kindergarten through 2nd grades, and a 1-dose requirement for admission to 3rd–6th grades. However, when the patient aged 15 years contracted varicella, no varicella vaccination school-entry requirements covered her grade. With continued implementation of the 2-dose requirement in Ohio, an additional grade will be added each school year so that, by 2022, the requirement will cover all grades; religious and medical exemptions will continue to be allowed. To cover cohorts of students enrolled in school before elementary school requirements took effect, implementation of varicella vaccination entry requirements for students entering middle school, high school, and college should be considered. Routine health-care provider visits, including the recommended visit at age 11–12 years, also provide an opportunity to evaluate vaccination status and administer recommended vaccinations.

Exposure to VZV can occur when persons are exposed to patients with varicella (chickenpox) or herpes zoster (shingles). Unvaccinated children, adolescents, and adults are at risk for acquiring varicella; severe varicella can develop among healthy persons, and which patients might develop an especially severe course often is unpredictable at disease onset. Health-care providers should remind parents about vaccination during routine visits for children and adolescents, and parents should be informed of the risks, including potentially severe complications, from vaccine-preventable diseases. Resources for discussions with parents regarding vaccination are available. † Adult patients who have no evidence of varicella immunity should be offered varicella vaccine. For otherwise healthy persons aged > 12 years who develop varicella, oral acyclovir is recommended. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within the first 24 hours. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is recommended for immunocompromised patients, and also in cases with serious, viral-mediated complications.

### Evaluation of varicella immune status in an obstetric population in relation to place of birth [^116XZsht]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Obstetric populations born in tropical or subtropical regions are likely to be seronegative for varicella virus; obstetric populations containing a large proportion of women born in tropical or subtropical regions will benefit greatly from being screened for varicella immunity. Physicians should therefore know the geographic origin of the community they serve and should consider testing varicella immunity in their obstetric patients born in tropical or subtropical regions. To ensure that passive immunization is received when indicated, physicians should obtain serostatus without relying on patients' recollection of their exposure to varicella virus.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^114dP5Pg]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Varicella vaccination — The varicella vaccine contains live attenuated virus and should be addressed before pregnancy. Those without evidence of immunity or previous infection should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine administered 1 month apart or a second dose if they previously received only 1 dose, and pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination. If exposed before pregnancy, the vaccine should be administered within 96 hours of exposure, and pregnancy should be avoided; during pregnancy, individuals should be assessed for immunity, and if nonimmune they should receive the first dose on completion or termination of pregnancy and before hospital discharge.

### Notes from the field: hospital contact investigation for a patient who developed a zoster vaccine-related rash-Maryland, February 2015 [^11459Kbj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Although zoster is less contagious than varicella (particularly if the rash is appropriately covered), the unusual presentation of the rash raised concerns for varicella. A contact investigation was initiated by the hospital's public health department to identify health care worker contacts as well as clinic waiting room patient contacts who might have been exposed to the patient during the outpatient clinic visit. Eight health care workers were identified as having had face-to-face contact with the patient; all had documented evidence of VZV immunity by antibody titer or documentation of receipt of 2 doses of varicella vaccine. The patient spent approximately 25 minutes in the clinic waiting room, resulting in potential exposure of 18 persons. Among these persons, 15 had evidence of VZV immunity and the three who did not were offered vaccination. None of the unimmunized waiting room contacts was pregnant, had an immunocompromising medical condition, or was undergoing immunomodulatory treatment. In accordance with current guidelines, exposed health care workers were instructed to remain vigilant for signs or symptoms of varicella (i.e. fever, headache, or other constitutional symptoms and skin lesions) for 21 days after exposure and to immediately report symptoms to the hospital's public health department if any occurred. No cases of varicella were identified in potentially exposed patients or health care workers after 21 days of surveillance. After the conclusion of the contact investigation, vesicular fluid collected and sent for genotyping at time of the initial patient evaluation demonstrated vaccine-type (Oka/Merck) virus.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^113ipmp4]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — immunizations: Women of reproductive age should have their immunization status assessed annually for Tdap, measles–mumps–rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella, and all patients should receive an annual influenza vaccination; those who are or will be pregnant during influenza season will have additional benefits. Adult women who have never received a dose of Tdap or whose Tdap vaccination status is unknown should receive a single dose, and Tdap vaccine should be given to all women during each pregnancy between 27–36 weeks regardless of prepregnancy immunization history. HPV vaccination currently is not recommended during pregnancy, and if the HPV vaccine series is started and a patient then becomes pregnant, completion should be delayed until that pregnancy is completed; HPV and cervical cancer screening should be performed in accordance with current guidelines. Vaccinations for rubella and varicella should be given at least 28 days before pregnancy or in the postpartum period if not previously given. Because two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended, and the CDC recommends that women not become pregnant for 1 month after being vaccinated, a woman who desires pregnancy should begin vaccination 2 months before attempting pregnancy. Those age 50 years and older should also be vaccinated against herpes zoster, and the need for other immunizations should be assessed during a prepregnancy visit by reviewing health, lifestyle, and occupational risks and administering required doses as indicated.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, immunocompetent adults, CDC 2018 guidelines recommend to counsel recombinant zoster vaccine recipients about expected systemic and local reactogenicity before vaccination. Encourage vaccine recipients to complete the series even if they experienced a grade 1–3 reaction to the first dose of recombinant zoster vaccine.

### Policy statement from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA): only medical contraindications should be accepted as a reason for not receiving all routine immunizations as recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention [^116XJoqa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

SHEA endorses adhering to the recommendations by the CDC and ACIP for immunizations of all children and adults. All persons providing clinical care should be familiar with these recommendations and should routinely assess immunization compliance of their patients and strongly recommend all routine immunizations to patients. All healthcare personnel (HCP) should be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases as recommended by the CDC/ACIP (unless immunity is demonstrated by another recommended method). SHEA endorses the policy that immunization should be a condition of employment or functioning (students, contract workers, volunteers, etc) at a healthcare facility. Only recognized medical contraindications should be accepted for not receiving recommended immunizations.

Special Populations

Persons with a history of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster can recur. Adults with a history of herpes zoster should receive RZV. If a patient is experiencing an episode of herpes zoster, vaccination should be delayed until the acute stage of the illness is over and symptoms abate. Studies of safety and immunogenicity of RZV in this population are ongoing.

Persons with chronic medical conditions. Adults with chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease) should receive RZV.

Immunocompromised persons. As with ZVL, the ACIP recommends the use of RZV in persons taking low-dose immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. < 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent or using inhaled or topical steroids) and persons anticipating immunosuppression or who have recovered from an immunocompromising illness. Whereas RZV is licensed for all persons aged ≥ 50 years, immunocompromised persons and those on moderate to high doses of immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from the efficacy studies (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70), and thus, ACIP has not made recommendations regarding the use of RZV in these patients; this topic is anticipated to be discussed at upcoming ACIP meetings as additional data become available.

Persons known to be VZV negative. Screening for a history of varicella (either verbally or via laboratory serology) before vaccination for herpes zoster is not recommended. However, in persons known to be VZV negative via serologic testing, ACIP guidelines for varicella vaccination should be followed. RZV has not been evaluated in persons who are VZV seronegative and the vaccine is not indicated for the prevention of chickenpox (varicella).

### The unnaturalistic fallacy: COVID-19 vaccine mandates should not discriminate against natural immunity [^117RVr6K]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There still some gaps in our understanding of the differences between natural and vaccine-induced immunity. For some, this uncertainty might lend support to a 'belt and braces' approach of ensuring that those with natural immunity also acquire vaccine-induced immunity. However, as we have argued, there are significant ethical costs with a precautionary strategy of mandating this. Our argument in this paper is based on a claim about the current evidence of the relative protection of vaccine-induced versus naturally acquired immunity against COVID-19, as it pertains to vaccine requirements that came into force in 2021. This means that if the evidence changes, our conclusions will also change. For example, if further studies are published that clearly show that vaccination is superior for reducing transmission of the virus, or that naturally acquired immunity wanes substantially over time, then that would (other things being equal) support a vaccine mandate in this group (potentially at least after a certain period has elapsed following infection). With some studies estimating that reinfection is likely to become increasingly common as the pandemic continues, it is crucial that infections among those with both natural and vaccine-induced immunity are closely monitored.

At the present time, however, it appears that requiring those with natural immunity to undergo vaccination is not clearly necessary to obtain a substantial public health benefit. If so, it is discriminatory to treat natural immunity differently to vaccine-mediated immunity, and this is something that ethical, evidence-based public health policy should reflect. This argument implies that if governments continue with mandates, they should allow (for example) healthcare workers with sufficient proof of natural immunity to continue working for as long as that immunity can reasonably be expected to endure. Such an exemption would prevent the unnecessary loss of valuable workers who do not pose an increased risk to vulnerable patients and residents.

### Varicella vaccination in Europe-taking the practical approach [^115d9Vo8]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Why vaccinate against varicella in Europe?

The clinical epidemiology of varicella in Europe is summarised in Table S1 (Additional file 1) (mortality) and Additional file 2 (incidence, hospitalisations and complications). It is noteworthy that differences in study methodology mean that epidemiological information cannot be easily compared across studies. Furthermore, the majority of studies were conducted in hospitals, with few data available from non-hospitalised patients. In many European countries, such as Belgium and the United Kingdom (UK), the true clinical impact of varicella remains to be determined because it is not a notifiable disease. In other countries, epidemiological data are available, but they may not accurately reflect the true burden of varicella given under-reporting to statutory notification systems. For example, in Italy, the age-standardised incidence of varicella in children 0 to14 years of age collected from a paediatric sentinel network of primary care physicians was 3.8-fold higher than that from statutory notifications (P < 0.0001).

Varicella incidence and seroprevalence

Population surveys described in Additional file 2 reveal that varicella is a common disease in European countries affecting nearly the entire birth cohort. For example, in Germany there was an annual incidence of approximately 760,000 new varicella cases in a birth cohort of around 800,000 prior to widespread vaccination in 1999.

In Europe, the sero-epidemiology of VZV characterises varicella as a disease of childhood, with rapid acquisition of antibodies to VZV during early life. By adolescence, the majority of individuals are seropositive for VZV antibodies. However, there are differences across the European region; seroprevalence appears to be slightly lower among children in southern European countries than in northern or central European countries (Table S2 in Additional file 1), which may be explained by different climates (Mediterranean vs. continental). Some European countries, such as the UK and Belgium, report a higher seroprevalence among children younger than 4 years of age than other parts of Europe, attributed to the high-level use of day-care nurseries and pre-school facilities.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112R3mJ2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Other considerations — vaccination in children and adolescents with HIV are as follows: For hepatitis A vaccine (HepA), "Postvaccination serology is recommended for patients with HIV following HepA, and, if lower than 10 mIU/mL, revaccination with a series of HepA can be considered". For hepatitis B vaccine, "postvaccination serology is recommended for people with certain risk factors, including HIV, and revaccination is recommended if levels are lower than 10 mIU/mL". Regarding measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), "Currently, the only vaccine for which there is a recommendation for revaccination is MMR, for which ACIP made specific recommendations for routine revaccination after initiation of ART", and individuals with perinatally acquired HIV vaccinated before effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) "should receive two appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine after effective ART has been established". For household contacts, "All members of a household who are aged > 6 months can receive yearly influenza vaccines", and contacts "can receive the LAIV or the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); there is no preference between LAIV and IIV"; for varicella, "Immunization against varicella is encouraged" for contacts without evidence of immunity, transmission of vaccine virus "is rare", and if smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) is needed, contact with the child or adolescent "should be avoided". For human papillomavirus (HPV), although immunocompetent initiators "between 9 and 14 years of age" may use a two-dose schedule "(0, > 6 months)", "a three-dose schedule (0, 1 to 2 months, > 6 months) is recommended for all children and adolescents who are immunocompromised, including those with HIV".

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112msmvB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diseases — epidemiology in adults with HIV: More than 95% of adults (aged > 20 years) born in the United States have immunity to VZV, and a varicella vaccine became available in the United States in 1995; most children born in the United States after 2005 are immune to varicella as a result of vaccination. In the general population, the incidence of herpes zoster is about 3.6 cases per 1,000 person-years. Before the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of herpes zoster was more than 15-fold higher among adults with HIV than among age-matched controls without HIV. Herpes zoster can occur at any CD4 T lymphocyte count, but with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 the risk is higher, and HIV viremia is associated with an increased risk for incident herpes zoster. ART has been shown to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster in adults with HIV, although the risk remains threefold higher than in the general population, and the risk is increased in the 6-month period immediately after initiation of ART.

### Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent – Ohio, 2009 [^111yArET]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Although varicella usually is a self-limited disease, it can lead to severe complications and death, even among persons without underlying conditions that put them at increased risk for severe disease. The varicella vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe varicella and death.

What is added by this report?

This report describes a varicella-related death that occurred in an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent aged 15 years. The case described in this report can serve as a reminder of the importance of catch-up vaccination of older children and adolescents to prevent varicella and its serious complications later in life when disease can be more severe. The case underscores the fact that severe complications of varicella and death can occur among persons without high-risk conditions for severe varicella.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Severe varicella can develop among unvaccinated healthy persons, and which patients might develop an especially severe course often is unpredictable. Persons without evidence of immunity to varicella should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine, or a second dose if they have received only 1 dose, to prevent varicella and its severe complications.

### Clinical and economic impact of various strategies for varicella immunity screening and vaccination of health care personnel [^117HZHaj]. American Journal of Infection Control (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Exposure to patients with varicella or herpes zoster causes considerable disruption to a health care facility's operations and has a significant health and economic impact. However, practices related to screening for immunity and immunization of health care personnel (HCP) for varicella vary widely.

Methods

A decision tree model was built to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 8 different strategies of screening and vaccinating HCP for varicella. The outcomes are presented as probability of acquiring varicella, economic impact of varicella per employee per year, and cost to prevent additional cases of varicella. Monte Carlo simulations and 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed to address the uncertainties inherent to the model. Alternative epidemiologic and technologic scenarios were also analyzed.

Results

Performing a clinical screening followed by serologic testing of HCP with negative history diminished the cost impact of varicella by > 99% compared with not having a program. Vaccinating HCP with negative screen cost approximately $50,000 per case of varicella prevented at the current level of U.S. population immunity, but was projected to be cost-saving at 92% or lower immunity prevalence. Improving vaccine acceptance rates and using highly sensitive assays also optimize cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

Strategies relying on screening and vaccinating HCP for varicella on employment were shown to be cost-effective for health care facilities and are consistent with current national guidelines for varicella prevention.

### Routine… [^112Cwsjj]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

In a physical examination, medical examination, clinical examination, or medical checkup, a medical practitioner examines a patient for any possible medical signs or symptoms of a medical condition. It generally consists of a series of questions about the patient's medical history followed by an examination based on the reported symptoms. Together, the medical history and the physical examination help to determine a diagnosis and devise the treatment plan. These data then become part of the medical record. Types Routine The routine physical, also known as general medical examination, periodic health evaluation, annual physical, comprehensive medical exam, general health check, preventive health examination, medical check-up, or simply medical, is a physical examination performed on an asymptomatic patient for medical screening purposes.

These are normally performed by a pediatrician, family practice physician, a physical therapist, physician assistant, a certified nurse practitioner or other primary care provider. This routine physical exam usually includes the HEENT evaluation. Nursing professionals such as Registered Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurses can develop a baseline assessment to identify normal versus abnormal findings. These are reported to the primary care provider. If necessary, the patient may be sent to a medical specialist for further, more detailed examinations. The term is generally not meant to include visits for the purpose of newborn checks, Pap smears for cervical cancer, or regular visits for people with certain chronic medical disorders. The general medical examination generally involves a medical history, a physical examination and sometimes laboratory tests. Some more advanced tests include ultrasound and mammography.

If done for a group of people the routine physical is a form of screening, as the aim of the examination is to detect early signs of diseases to prevent them. Some notable general health organisations recommend against annual examinations, and propose a frequency adapted to age and previous examination results. The specialist American Cancer Society recommends a cancer-related health check-up annually in men and women older than 40, and every three years for those older than 20. A systematic review of studies until September 2006 concluded that the examination does result in better delivery of some other screening interventions and less patient worry. Evidence supports several of these individual screening interventions.

The effects of annual check-ups on overall costs, patient disability and mortality, disease detection, and intermediate end points such a blood pressure or cholesterol, are inconclusive. A recent study found that the examination is associated with increased participation in cancer screening. Some employers require a mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate, even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients are statistically more likely to be "false positives" — that is, when test results suggest a problem that does not exist.

### Mantoux test… [^112qQQPA]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Procedure In the Mantoux test, a standard dose of tuberculin is injected intradermally on the forearm using a small syringe. The standard dose specified by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is 5 tuberculin units in 0. 1 mL of solution, while the U. K. Classification of tuberculin reaction The results of this test must be interpreted carefully. The person's medical risk factors determine at which increment of induration the result is considered positive. A positive result indicates TB exposure.
- 10 mm or more is positive in
- Recent arrivals from high-prevalence countries
- Injection drug users
- Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings
- Mycobacteriology lab personnel
- Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk. False positive result TST positive is measured by size of induration. The size of the induration considered to be a positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression. Therefore, a positive TST/PPD in a person who has received BCG vaccine is interpreted as latent TB infection. Due to the test's low specificity, most positive reactions in low-risk individuals are false positives. A false positive result may be caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria or previous administration of BCG vaccine.

Vaccination with BCG may result in a false-positive result for many years after vaccination. False positives can also occur when the injected area is touched, causing swelling and itching. If the swelling is less than 5 mm, it is possibly due to error by the healthcare personnel causing inflammation to the area. Another source of false positive results can be allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. Although rare, these reactions can be dangerous and precautions should be taken by having epinephrin available. False negative result Reaction to the PPD or tuberculin test is suppressed by the following conditions:

- Recent TB infection
- Infectious mononucleosis
- Live virus vaccine – The test should not be carried out within 3 weeks of live virus vaccination.
- Sarcoidosis
- Hodgkin's disease.
- Corticosteroid therapy/steroid use
- Malnutrition
- Immunological compromise – Those on immuno-suppressive treatment or those with HIV and low CD4 T cell counts, frequently show negative results from the PPD test. This is because the immune system needs to be functional to mount a response to the protein derivative injected under the skin. A false negative result may occur in a person who has been recently infected with TB, but whose immune system hasn't yet reacted to the bacteria. BCG vaccine and the Mantoux test The role of Mantoux testing in people who have been vaccinated is disputed. The US recommends that tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for BCG-vaccinated persons, and prior BCG vaccination should not influence the interpretation of the test. The UK recommends that interferon-γ testing should be used to help interpret positive Mantoux tests of over 5 mm, and repeated tuberculin skin testing must not be done in people who have had BCG vaccinations.

### Tuberculosis [^112FUYhN]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is spread from one person to the next through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. A latent infection is more likely to become active in those with weakened immune systems. There are two principal tests for TB: interferon-gamma release assay of a blood sample, and the tuberculin skin test. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Risk factors Risk factors for TB include exposure to droplets from people with active TB and environmental-related and health-condition related factors that decrease a person's immune system response such as HIV or taking immunosuppressant medications.

People living with HIV are estimated 16 times more likely to fall ill with TB than people without HIV; TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. Another important risk factor is use of medications which suppress the immune system; these include, chemotherapy, medication for lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and medication after an organ transplant. Other risk factors include: alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, silicosis, tobacco smoking, recreational drug use, severe kidney disease, head and neck cancer, low body weight. Children, especially those under age five, have undeveloped immune systems and are at higher risk. Extra-pulmonary TB infection can affect the kidneys, spine, brain, lymph nodes, or bones
- a sample cannot easily be obtained for culture. Tests based on the immune response are sensitive but are likely to give false negatives in those with weak immune systems such as very young patients and those coinfected with HIV.

Another issue affecting diagnosis in many parts of the world is that TB infection is most common in resource-poor settings where sophisticated laboratories are rarely available. A diagnosis of TB should be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. Diagnosis of TB, whether latent or active, starts with medical history and physical examination. Subsequently a number of tests can be performed to refine the diagnosis: A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Mantoux test The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB such as health workers or close contacts of TB patients, who may not display symptoms of infection. In the Mantoux test, a small quantity of tuberculin antigen is injected intradermally on the forearm. The result of the test is read after 48 to 72 hours.

A person who has been exposed to the bacteria would be expected to mount an immune response; the reaction is read by measuring the diameter of the raised area. Vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guerin may result in a false-positive result. Several factors may lead to false negatives; these include HIV infection, some viral illnesses, and overwhelming TB disease. Interferon-Gamma Release Assay The Interferon-Gamma Release Assay is recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. This test mixes a blood sample with antigenic material derived from the TB bacterium. If the patient has developed an immune response to a TB infection, white blood cells in the sample will release interferon-gamma, which can be measured. This test is more reliable than the Mantoux test, and does not give a false positive after BCG vaccination; however it may give a positive result in case of infection by the related bacteria M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii.
