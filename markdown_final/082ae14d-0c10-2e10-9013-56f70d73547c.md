## Question

Why is Pathway AMAZING?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why "pathway" is amazing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "pathway" the user means, because the term spans clinical care pathways, molecular/biological pathways, and regulatory or screening pathways. Then, I should verify the core benefits and mechanisms that make each type "amazing". Next, I will appraise the strength of evidence and note limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, clinically grounded answer that highlights what is truly compelling while acknowledging uncertainties and implementation needs.

> Let me first confirm the scope. "Pathway" in medicine can mean at least three distinct things: clinical care pathways that standardize multidisciplinary care, molecular or signaling pathways that reveal disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, and regulatory or screening pathways that structure access and evaluation. I need to ensure I address each in turn and cite representative evidence so I don't overgeneralize across domains [^991ebf84] [^4a6587e5] [^f241120b].

> Now, for clinical care pathways, I should verify the key benefits. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect sizes. The Cochrane review of 27 studies found fewer in-hospital complications and substantially improved documentation with pathways, and most studies reported shorter length of stay, though heterogeneity limited pooling for LOS and cost outcomes, which means I should be cautious about exact figures while still noting consistent directional benefits [^0357f60e]. I should also confirm condition-specific data: meta-analyses in joint replacement show fewer complications and shorter stays, and stroke pathways show improved comprehensiveness of care, reinforcing that benefits are real but context-dependent [^77d1cbd9] [^46138445].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms. I need to check what makes pathways work. The consistent themes are structured multidisciplinary plans, translation of guidelines into local workflows, time-bound or criteria-based progression, and standardization for a defined population; these features reduce unwarranted variation, improve reliability, and embed quality checks at each step, which aligns with pediatric and oncology quality frameworks emphasizing standardization and feedback loops [^991ebf84] [^1ea8b27b] [^88961526]. But wait, what if implementation is weak? Indeed, effectiveness depends on uptake, leadership, and measurement; otherwise, pathways can be paper exercises with limited impact, so I should emphasize that implementation quality is essential to realize benefits [^faf12371].

> Next, I should review molecular and signaling pathways. Let me consider cancer genomics first. Large-scale pathway and network analyses across thousands of tumors reveal that focusing on pathways rather than single genes uncovers recurrent drivers in both coding and non-coding regions, enabling better patient stratification and targeted therapy selection, which is a major advance over gene-centric views [^4a6587e5]. I should double-check the statistical rationale: pathway-based approaches aggregate small effects across functionally related genes, improving power in GWAS and helping explain missing heritability, though annotation quality and tissue specificity remain challenges [^35417501] [^05474d14]. Therapeutically, pathway targeting is central to modern drug discovery, with examples like WNT modulation for bone, PI3K/MET inhibition in oncology, and biomarker-guided strategies to match patients to pathway inhibitors, underscoring both promise and the need for predictive markers [^c2bdec22] [^a8ea397b] [^6f489b21].

> I will now examine regulatory and screening pathways. Adaptive pathways to patients (MAPPs) coordinate regulators, HTA bodies, payers, and clinicians to enable earlier, iterative access to promising therapies in high-need subgroups, with built-in evidence generation and reassessment; this addresses the evidence–access conundrum and is increasingly influential in policy discussions, though real-world uptake is still maturing [^151eecc2] [^2cac1b4a]. For screening, I should confirm that benefit depends on the entire cascade: invitation, test performance, diagnostic follow-up, and treatment; only when each step is reliable and equitable does the pathway deliver population benefit, which is why organized programs and quality metrics matter [^f241120b]. Similarly, same-day discharge after PCI and ERAS surgical pathways demonstrate that well-designed, condition-specific pathways can safely reduce length of stay and complications when operational details are right, reinforcing the need for stakeholder alignment and system readiness [^45f9de2c] [^187c4f58].

> But wait, what about limitations and implementation pitfalls? I need to ensure I don't overstate benefits. Evidence quality varies: many pathway studies are observational or before–after designs with heterogeneity, and some systematic reviews conclude that while process and utilization outcomes often improve, definitive clinical outcome gains are not guaranteed without high-fidelity implementation and measurement [^0357f60e] [^bc2ca23f]. Unintended consequences can occur, such as documentation burdens or strained relationships if pathways are imposed without clinician input, so co-design and iterative feedback are critical to avoid resistance and workarounds [^84b0eb69]. For molecular pathways, annotation bias, tissue specificity, and crosstalk can obscure true drivers, so orthogonal validation and functional studies remain necessary before clinical translation [^05474d14] [^643d5944].

> Let me synthesize why "pathway" is amazing, while keeping the caveats in view. Across domains, pathways convert complexity into actionable steps: they translate evidence into routine care, aggregate noisy signals into biologically coherent targets, and structure fragmented systems into coordinated journeys. This yields measurable gains in safety, efficiency, and sometimes outcomes, and opens the door to precision medicine by aligning interventions with disease biology and patient context [^0357f60e] [^4a6587e5] [^151eecc2]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating universality: benefits are contingent on rigorous development, stakeholder buy-in, and continuous evaluation, so the "amazing" label reflects potential realized when pathways are well-designed and well-implemented, not a blanket endorsement of all pathway initiatives [^faf12371] [^bc2ca23f].

> In practical terms, I need to ensure clinicians see how to act on this. For care pathways, start with high-volume, high-variation conditions, define clear inclusion criteria and time-bound steps, embed order sets and decision support, and track process and outcome measures with feedback loops. For molecular pathways, integrate pathway-aware diagnostics and biomarker strategies into treatment selection, recognizing that single-analyte models are often insufficient. For regulatory or screening pathways, align with national programs and quality standards to close the loop from detection to treatment and surveillance [^1ea8b27b] [^a8ea397b] [^f241120b]. If I notice low adherence or null outcomes, I should double-check implementation fidelity and adapt the pathway rather than abandoning the concept, because the mechanism is sound but execution is everything [^faf12371].

---

Pathways are "amazing" because they **standardize care** to reduce unwarranted variation [^1ea8b27b], **improve outcomes** by translating evidence into practice [^0357f60e], and **lower costs** through shorter length of stay and fewer complications [^77d1cbd9]. They also **enhance coordination** across multidisciplinary teams [^555f1537] and enable **rapid adoption** of new evidence via adaptive frameworks [^151eecc2]. While benefits depend on **implementation quality** [^54a4c944] and context [^bc2ca23f], well-designed pathways consistently deliver safer, more efficient, and more equitable care [^6c38c700].

---

## Standardization and reduction of variability

Pathways **translate guidelines into local practice**, reducing unwarranted variation and improving reliability [^991ebf84] [^1ea8b27b]. In joint replacement, pathways reduced complications and length of stay without harming satisfaction [^77d1cbd9]. In stroke, they improved comprehensiveness and appropriateness of care [^46138445].

---

## Improved patient outcomes

Pathways are associated with **fewer complications** [^0357f60e], **shorter length of stay** [^77d1cbd9], and **better adherence to evidence-based care** [^1ea8b27b]. In COPD, pathways reduced length of stay and readmissions [^notfound]; in surgery, they reduced complications and improved recovery [^187c4f58].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and resource utilization

Pathways reduce costs by shortening length of stay, decreasing complications, and avoiding unnecessary tests or treatments [^0357f60e] [^77d1cbd9]. In joint replacement, pathways lowered costs without compromising quality [^77d1cbd9]; in emergency care, they reduced admissions and resource use [^1229a93d].

---

## Enhanced coordination and communication

Pathways **foster multidisciplinary teamwork** and clear communication, reducing errors and improving care transitions [^555f1537] [^1ea8b27b]. In cancer, pathways improve coordination and timeliness of care [^6c38a700]; in chronic disease, they enhance continuity across settings [^bc2ca23f].

---

## Facilitation of evidence-based practice

Pathways **embed evidence into workflows**, making it easier for clinicians to deliver guideline-concordant care [^991ebf84] [^1ea8b27b]. In cardiology, expert consensus pathways accelerate adoption of new therapies and practices [^3c363d65] [^cb321190].

---

## Adaptability and continuous improvement

Pathways are **iteratively updated** as new evidence emerges, supporting learning health systems [^2cac1b4a] [^5010b1c8]. Adaptive pathways in drug development enable earlier patient access while evidence accrues [^151eecc2] [^7ce131a5].

---

## Addressing limitations and ensuring success

Benefits depend on **robust implementation**, stakeholder engagement, and ongoing evaluation [^54a4c944] [^84b0eb69]. Challenges include resistance to change, misalignment with local context, and lack of outcome measurement [^bc2ca23f] [^555f1537]. Success requires leadership, education, and feedback loops to sustain adherence and quality [^faf12371] [^1ea8b27b].

---

Pathways are "amazing" because they **systematically improve care** by standardizing practice, improving outcomes, reducing costs, and enabling rapid adoption of evidence — when thoughtfully designed and implemented [^0357f60e] [^77d1cbd9] [^3c363d65].

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^d0c7d199]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This paper described the developmental process undertaken to devise criteria to define a clinical pathway. Researchers who are developing and evaluating clinical pathways or attempting to synthesise the existing literature should consider the usefulness of these criteria for their studies. It is also recommended that these criteria be used as a basis for ongoing development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### Equity in cancer care: pathways, protocols, and guidelines [^6c35c653]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

The quality of patient care varies based on numerous factors, such as health care setting, geographic location, access to medications, insurance coverage, and treatment protocols. Recently, the issue of whether use of clinical pathways can reduce costs and inappropriate variability in care has been the subject of much debate. As clinical treatment guidelines and pathways are increasingly deployed in oncology practice, they have a growing impact on the quality of treatment and how it is delivered. To fulfill the current need to discuss the use of pathways and clinical treatment guidelines in oncology and to address how patient care is impacted by their use, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network convened the NCCN Oncology Policy Summit: Equity in Cancer Care-Pathways, Protocols, and Guidelines. The summit was a forum to discuss the use and implementation of pathways, including how much flexibility pathways should allow in care, pathways' impact on public and private health insurance benefit design, what data is used to select pathway regimens and protocols, and ultimately what impact pathways may have on variation in care. The use and implementation of clinical treatment guidelines in practice was also explored from a variety of perspectives.

### Pathways from science findings to health benefits [^20be382e]. Psychological Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

There have been numerous exhortations for more 'translational research'. A selective review of historical examples of research leading to health benefits is used to consider the various forms of successful interplay between basic science and clinical applications. This is followed by a consideration of key neuroscience findings that might be relevant for translation, and then by a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in relation to mental disorders. The time-frame for the pathway from science findings to health benefits is usually long, and generally requires an interactive interplay among different scientific strategies. There is a false dichotomy between so-called basic and applied research and translation needs to proceed from the bedside to the laboratory as well as in the opposite direction. There is a key need for bridging research of the hypothesis-testing experimental medicine variety. Health benefits may involve either public health considerations or the treatment of individual patients, or both. There are now some opportunities for direct translational research but there is a much greater need for hypothesis-based bridging studies that occupy a crucial mid-phase in the pathway from science findings to health benefits.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^1f6562b0]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Application of criteria

The weighted criteria were applied to 260 full text articles. Two review authors independently screened articles to assess which studies met the criteria for a clinical pathway and the Cochrane methodological quality criteria. The Cochrane methodological criteria relates to minimum quality standards for quantitative studies using randomised controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, controlled before and after and interrupted time series study designs. Unresolved disagreements on inclusion were referred to a third review author. In all, 63 papers were excluded as they did not meet the criteria defining a clinical pathway. Only two studies needed to be referred to a third review author because of disagreement on a study meeting the minimum definition criteria.

A total of 27 studies were included on both definition and methodological criteria in the final review. In all, 14 studies termed their intervention a clinical pathway whilst 8 others referred to their intervention as a 'protocol'. No other term was used more than once. The remaining terms used for what we included as a clinical pathway were 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', 'evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^53713b16]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The urgent need for therapies that treat the underlying pathology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and biological targets that change the trajectory of AD has spurred intense, decades‐long attempts to develop DMTs for AD. Recent trials, including large‐scale, phase 3 studies, have recruited patients in the early symptomatic stages of AD, such as those with MCI‐AD.To these patients and their care partners, the most desired outcomes (i.e. what matters most) of therapies were improvement or restoration of memory and stopping or slowing AD progression.It is important, therefore, to assess how traditionally measured treatment effects relate to these desired outcomes.

There are limitations to using traditional clinical outcome assessments in clinical trials of early AD. For example, floor and/or ceiling effects can occur in very mildly or rapidly progressing patients. It is important to note that the mean treatment exposure in phase 3 trials of AD was 105 weeks,,which may be insufficient to extrapolate the long‐term benefit of DMTs. Moreover, cognitive or functional changes measured within the early stages of the AD continuum can be subtle.Thus, defining what constitutes a meaningful benefit remains challenging. As a result, an integrative and comprehensive multidimensional approach is needed to define meaningful benefit in early AD. A number of solutions can be utilized to reduce these limitations and implement a structured methodology, including: (1) multidimensional clinical outcome assessments (COAs) comprising not only outcomes for cognition and function, but also neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), patient‐ and care partner–reported outcomes, quality‐of‐life questionnaires, and health and economic outcomes; (2) complementary analyses (e.g. time‐to‐event [TTE] or number‐needed‐to‐treat [NNT] analyses) to contextualize the results from COAs; and (3) assessments of cumulative and predictive benefits, where early changes in cognitive, functional, or biomarker assessments predict longer‐term clinical benefit.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^ee2b0721]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Method

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop evidence-informed and practical criteria to define a clinical pathway. The four stages were: (1) identify publications exploring the scope and definition of clinical pathways (or similar terms); (2) synthesise previously suggested components and derive draft criteria for testing; (3) pilot test the level of agreement between review authors when applying criteria to identified studies; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^b2f7f267]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, however, there is a need to reevaluate these concepts so that they are centered more around the complex and comprehensive understanding of biomarker‐guided, targeted therapies that have an impact on both the clinical and biological course of the disease. In the context of AD, there is a lack of precise criteria to distinguish one class of therapeutics from another. Although the newer generation of investigational compounds is often considered to be biomarker‐guided, neuroprotective interventions targeting underlying disease mechanisms,,the use of terms such as “biomarker‐guided therapies” or “molecular pathway‐targeting therapies” may better convey the richness and subtlety of emerging classes of drugs in AD. In the following sections, we use the term “DMTs” to address current therapeutics as referenced and discussed in the existing literature, whereas “biomarker‐guided therapies” will be used when alluding to future therapeutics and associated concepts. Ultimately, this terminology must be further differentiated to better describe the evolution of treatment options and combinations for diverse biological subgroups of patients in future clinical trials and the achievement of precision medicine in neurology and psychiatry.

It is critical that clinicians understand the potential benefits of new therapies and their effects on AD‐related biological changes, and better recognize treatment efficacy beyond measures used with previously approved AD treatments. Moreover, treatment decisions should be better informed by available biomarkers and diagnostic assessments that match the evolving understanding of AD. Implementing clear definitions and collecting necessary evidence will facilitate proper care of individuals treated with DMTs for AD and enhance the understanding of the precise meaningfulness and treatment effects such agents exert.

The current concept of clinical meaningfulness—which can be defined as descriptive and observable effects of treatment on aspects of cognition, function, and/or behavior—is limited and fails to take into account underlying biology, nosology, and patient centricity. In addition, finding consensus as to what constitutes treatment benefit for individuals with AD is challenging due to the complex and varied nature of the disease, different perspectives of important stakeholders, and the influence of measures and analyses used to explore meaningfulness. For instance, sporadic AD follows a nonlinear and dynamic progression pattern across a complex disease continuum. In AD, the clinical presentation of signs, symptoms, and diverse pathophysiological alterations affect different biological systems at different times. Therefore, an integrative, comprehensive, and multidimensional approach, taking into account spatial and temporal (ideally staging) information, is needed to define what constitutes meaningful biological and clinical benefits associated with biomarker‐guided targeted therapies for AD.

### Standardize to excellence: improving the quality and safety of care with clinical pathways [^1ea8b27b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Providing practitioners with locally developed, consensus-driven, evidence-based clinical pathways can improve the quality of care by (1) incorporating national guidelines and recommendations into routine care practices, increasing the use of validated practice; 2) reducing unnecessary variation in care by a single physician or group of physicians, improving efficiency and timeliness and reducing disparities; and (3) standardizing care processes, improving safety. Pathways make it easier to identify opportunities for future improvements in care processes while simultaneously making those improvements easier to enact. Pediatric hospitalists have a vital role in creating, implementing, evaluating, and improving clinical pathways. Involving house staff enriches the scholarly components of pathway development while actively engaging them in the science and practice of quality improvement.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^a0e13a51]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In 2003, it was reported that clinical pathways had been implemented in more than 80% of hospitals in the USA. This represents an enormous resource commitment both in the development of pathways, the training of staff, and in the ongoing implementation of pathways in the hospital setting. In this era of evidence informed practice, it is therefore problematic that individual studies of the impact of clinical pathways are varied and contradictory and that there is still no standardised definition of what a 'clinical pathway' actually constitutes. In fact, a recent literature review identified 84 different terms that may mean a clinical pathway. These included (amongst others) care map, care pathway, critical pathway, integrated care pathway, protocol and guideline.

This lack of a uniformly accepted definition of what constitutes a clinical pathway impacts on capacity to empirically test the evidence base and compromises planning, resourcing, development and implementation of clinical pathways. A lack of consensus regarding research outcomes is not surprising given the lack of agreement regarding what defines a clinical pathway.

Our team of researchers faced this issue when devising the protocol for a Cochrane systematic review of the impact of clinical pathways in hospitals. The development of minimum criteria to define a clinical pathway was required to ensure that appropriate studies were sourced and included in the review. The aim of this paper is to describe the developmental process undertaken and the resulting criteria so that other researchers who are developing and evaluating clinical pathways or attempting to synthesise the existing literature can consider the usefulness of these criteria for their studies.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^6bc50423]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

The pathway to recommending clinical practice–based prevention—direct randomization of young individuals to treat cardiovascular (CV) risk factors versus no treatment with long-term follow-up to determine whether CV events are prevented is described as attractive but unachievable; therefore an alternate stepwise evidence chain is used, linking studies from risk beginning before birth, to risk acquisition during childhood, to risk modification by reduction strategies, and finally to clinical disease in adulthood, with studies examining single links, connecting links, or evaluating specific interventions for risk-benefit analysis. The remaining evidence links assess whether interventions have health benefit and whether risks and costs are outweighed by reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality, with best evidence from randomized trials showing event reduction in adults, randomized trials in children showing risk reduction with change in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis or target organ damage and patient safety, genetic studies, and long-term observational studies demonstrating benefit of maintaining low risk on health and all-cause mortality.

### The broader economic impact of vaccination: reviewing and appraising the strength of evidence [^521400e4]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Microeconomic evaluations of public health programmes such as immunisation typically only consider direct health benefits and medical cost savings. Broader economic benefits around childhood development, household behaviour, and macro-economic indicators are increasingly important, but the evidence linking immunization to such benefits is unclear.

Methods

A conceptual framework of pathways between immunisation and its proposed broader economic benefits was developed through expert consultation. Relevant articles were obtained from previous reviews, snowballing, and expert consultation. Articles were associated with one of the pathways and quality assessed using modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

Results

We found 20 studies directly relevant to one or more pathways. Evidence of moderate quality from experimental and observational studies was found for benefits due to immunisation in improved childhood physical development, educational outcomes, and equity in distribution of health gains. Only modelling evidence or evidence outside the immunization field supports extrapolating these benefits to household economic behaviour and macro-economic indicators.

Conclusion

Innovative use of experimental and observational study designs is needed to fill evidence gaps around key pathways between immunisation and many of its proposed economic benefits.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^ba7336f2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Herein we explore a comprehensive and more holistic concept of clinical and biological meaningfulness to encompass biomarkers. This discussion contrasts from the traditional framework, which is based largely on clinical descriptive phenomenology. The aims of this article are to (1) articulate the need to redefine clinical meaningfulness to account for both clinical and biological information; (2) highlight that there are no gold standards for determining minimal biologically and clinically important differences (MBCIDs) in AD trials (and that existing approaches have limitations); (3) demonstrate that the treatment benefits of DMTs are cumulative and expected to increase over time; and (4) emphasize that the concept of meaningful benefits differs among key stakeholders (e.g. patients, physicians, care partners, and payors/regulators).

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^991ebf84]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are tools used to guide evidence-based healthcare that have been implemented internationally since the 1980s. However, there is widespread lack of agreement on the impact of clinical pathways on hospital resources and patient outcomes. This can be partially attributed to the confusion for both researchers and healthcare workers regarding what constitutes a clinical pathway. This paper describes efforts made by a team of Cochrane Review authors to develop criteria to assist in the objective identification of clinical pathway studies from the literature.

Methods

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop criteria to define a clinical pathway: (1) identify publications exploring the definition of a clinical pathway; (2) derive draft criteria; (3) pilot test the criteria; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Results

Previous literature and liaison with the European Pathways Association resulted in five criteria being used to define a clinical pathway: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression; and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population. After pilot testing it was decided that if an intervention met the first criteria (a structured multidisciplinary plan of care) plus three out of the other four criteria then it was included as a clinical pathway for the purposes of this review. In all, 27 studies were included in the final review. The authors of the included studies referred to these interventions as 'clinical pathways', 'protocols', 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

Conclusions

The criteria used for the identification of relevant studies for this Cochrane Review can be used as a foundation for the development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^cf48b646]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

To understand the potential benefits of emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies within and beyond clinical trial settings, there is a need to advance current outcome measurements into meaningful information relevant to all stakeholders. The relationship between the impact on disease biology and clinically measurable outcomes in cognition, function, and behavior must be considered when defining the meaningful benefit of early AD therapies. In this review, we discuss: (1) the lack of consideration for biomarkers in the current concept of meaningfulness in AD; (2) the lack of gold standards for determining minimal biologically and clinically important differences (MBCIDs) in AD trials; (3) how the treatment benefits of disease‐modifying treatments are cumulative and increase over time; and (4) the different concepts of meaningfulness among key stakeholders. This review utilizes the future clinical biological framework of AD and aims to further integrate and expand the parameters of meaningful benefits toward a precision medicine framework.

Highlights

Definition of meaningful benefit from Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment varies across disease stage and stakeholder perspectives.
Observable and meaningful outcomes must consider the clinical‐biological nature of AD.
Statistically significant effects or outcomes do not always equate to clinically meaningfulness.
Assessment tools must reflect stage‐specific subtle changes following treatment.
Real‐world evidence will support consensus, definition, and interpretation of clinical meaningfulness.

10 FUTURE OUTLOOK

Cumulative evidence suggests that a crucial step in the onset of AD is dysregulation, compensation, and decompensation in Aβ homeostasis. These produce a cascade of neuronal and glial molecular events that ultimately lead to complex systems failure with cognitive deficits (MCI‐AD) and ultimately the late‐stage AD dementia syndrome.A clearer picture of disease progression and biologically meaningful treatment‐related change, conceptually capturing target engagement, mechanism of action, impact on mechanism of disease, and surrogate function, may complement clinical outcomes in future clinical trials by serving as additional evidence of biological disease modification.

Future precision medicine in AD and in neurology more broadly may also be facilitated by differentiated multimodal and multidomain outcome development across the AD continuum. This can be achieved by taking into account meaningful subsets and groups (e.g. biological staging, molecular subtyping, genetics, ethnicities, sex, and other classifiers) as well as research into subgroups.Additional long‐term follow‐up of real‐world evidence‐generation studies is required to establish, develop, validate, and standardize biologically and clinically meaningful outcomes.The ROADMAP (Real‐world Outcomes across the AD continuum for better care: Multi‐modal Data Access Platform) project aims to evaluate the feasibility of using real‐world evidence to identify key disease and patient outcomes to enable stakeholders to make informed funding and treatment decisions. The project also aims to provide advice on data integration methods and standards, and to develop conceptual cost‐effectiveness and disease models to assess whether early treatment provides long‐term benefit.There is a need for registries (e.g. Alzheimer’s Network for Treatment and Diagnostics (ALZ‐NET), A personalized medicine approach for Alzheimer’s disease (ABOARD)) to act as a means of capturing more uniform data across therapies in the real world.

### The dichotomy of diagnostics: exploring the value for consumers, clinicians and care pathways [^f21a1568]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics play a crucial role in screening, detecting, and stratifying patients, yet can account for only 2–3% of healthcare spending. With advancements in wearable technology and direct-to-consumer testing, the market for consumer health continues to rise. The potential benefits of more holistic and continuous measurement offer a promising opportunity for earlier disease detection and proactive health management. Many health systems are in a parallel transition from legacy analogue approaches to digitally enabled infrastructures. The evolving role of the clinical workforce, including medical ethics, regulation, will be closely coupled and a critical lever in success. This includes on a patient and clinician level, balancing the benefits and risks of interventions, and care pathway level, promoting responsible data utilisation with greater contextualisation based on the latest evidence of clinical efficacy. Moving forward a balance may need to be struck between increased data capture, analysis and reuse, with proportionate ethics, regulation, trust and governance.

### Pathway and network analysis of more than 2500 whole cancer genomes [^4a6587e5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Because of limited power in individual cancer types, our pathway and network analysis focused on associations found across cancer and tissue types. Thus, we primarily utilized generic, tissue-independent network and pathway information. However, it is well known that gene–gene interactions vary across tissues and that cancer cells rewire signaling and regulatory networks. Future investigations that consider the variable landscape of regulatory and physical interactions across tissues may offer a new perspective on the data. Specifically, each cell type has a different epigenetic wiring and regulatory machinery, and non-coding mutations may target cell type-dependent vulnerabilities. Approaches that incorporate tissue-specific, cancer-specific, or patient-specific gene–gene regulatory information may reveal new classes of drivers unexplored with our current approaches.

Our pathway- and network-driven strategies enable us to interpret the coding and non-coding landscape of tumor genomes to discover driver mechanisms in interconnected systems of genes. This approach has multiple benefits. First, by broadening our mutation analysis from single genomic elements to pathways and networks of multiple genes, we identify new components of known cancer pathways that are recurrently altered by both coding and non-coding mutations, and thus likely to be important in cancer. Second, we identify new pathways and subnetworks that would remain unseen in an analysis focusing on coding sequences. Investigation of the coding and non-coding mutations that perturb these pathways and networks will enable more accurate patient-stratification strategies, pathway-focused biomarkers, and therapeutic approaches.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^7e837c36]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical pathways (CPWs) are a common component in the quest to improve the quality of health. CPWs are used to reduce variation, improve quality of care, and maximize the outcomes for specific groups of patients. An ongoing challenge is the operationalization of a definition of CPW in healthcare. This may be attributable to both the differences in definition and a lack of conceptualization in the field of clinical pathways. This correspondence article describes a process of refinement of an operational definition for CPW research and proposes an operational definition for the future syntheses of CPWs literature. Following the approach proposed by Kinsman et al. (BMC Medicine 8(1):31, 2010) and Wieland et al. (Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine 17(2):50, 2011), we used a four-stage process to generate a five criteria checklist for the definition of CPWs. We refined the operational definition, through consensus, merging two of the checklist’s criteria, leading to a more inclusive criterion for accommodating CPW studies conducted in various healthcare settings. The following four criteria for CPW operational definition, derived from the refinement process described above, are (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other ‘inventory of actions’ (i.e. the intervention had time-frames or criteria-based progression); and (4) the intervention aimed to standardize care for a specific population. An intervention meeting all four criteria was considered to be a CPW. The development of operational definitions for complex interventions is a useful approach to appraise and synthesize evidence for policy development and quality improvement.

### A case study evaluation of implementation of a care pathway to support normal birth in one english birth centre: anticipated benefits and unintended consequences [^84b0eb69]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The policy drive for the UK National Health Service (NHS) has focused on the need for high quality services informed by evidence of best practice. The introduction of care pathways and protocols to standardise care and support implementation of evidence into practice has taken place across the NHS with limited evaluation of their impact. A multi-site case study evaluation was undertaken to assess the impact of use of care pathways and protocols on clinicians, service users and service delivery. One of the five sites was a midwifery-led Birth Centre, where an adapted version of the All Wales Clinical Pathway for Normal Birth had been implemented.

Methods

The overarching framework was realistic evaluation. A case study design enabled the capture of data on use of the pathway in the clinical setting, use of multiple methods of data collection and opportunity to study and understand the experiences of clinicians and service users whose care was informed by the pathway. Women attending the Birth Centre were recruited at their 36 week antenatal visit. Episodes of care during labour were observed, following which the woman and the midwife who cared for her were interviewed about use of the pathway. Interviews were also held with other key stakeholders from the study site. Qualitative data were content analysed.

Results

Observations were undertaken of four women during labour. Eighteen interviews were conducted with clinicians and women, including the women whose care was observed and the midwives who cared for them, senior midwifery managers and obstetricians. The implementation of the pathway resulted in a number of anticipated benefits, including increased midwifery confidence in skills to support normal birth and promotion of team working. There were also unintended consequences, including concerns about a lack of documentation of labour care and negative impact on working relationships with obstetric and other midwifery colleagues. Women were unaware their care was informed by a care pathway.

Conclusion

Care pathways are complex interventions which generate a number of consequences for practice. Those considering introduction of pathways need to ensure all relevant stakeholders are engaged with this and develop robust evaluation strategies to accompany implementation.

### Clinical advantages and disadvantages of anabolic bone therapies targeting the WNT pathway [^c2bdec22]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

The WNT signalling pathway is a key regulator of bone metabolism, particularly bone formation, which has helped to define the role of osteocytes - the most abundant bone cells - as orchestrators of bone remodelling. Several molecules involved in the control of the WNT signalling pathway have been identified as potential targets for the development of bone-building therapeutics for patients with osteoporosis. Several of these molecules have been investigated in animal models, but only inhibitors of sclerostin (which is produced by osteocytes) have been investigated in phase III clinical studies. Here, we review the rationale for these developments and the specificity and potential off-target actions of WNT-based therapeutics. We also describe the available preclinical and clinical studies and discuss the benefits and risks of using sclerostin inhibitors for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^3abe8914]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Refined criteria for CPW operational definition

The four criteria derived from the refinement process described above are (1) Is it a structured multidisciplinary care plan? (2) Is it used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures? (3) Does it detail the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other ‘inventory of actions’ (i.e. the intervention had time frames or criteria based progression)? (4) Does it aim to standardize care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of care in a specific population?

Henceforth, an intervention was considered a CPW if it contained all of the four criteria in the new operational definition. Subsequently, the new definition will be applied to identify (1) relevant titles and abstracts for an on-going update of a Cochrane systematic review on CPWs in hospitals, and (2) a new Cochrane systematic review on CPWs in primary care.

Prospectively, the systematic review will follow the validated Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) methodology for complex interventions, and will consider randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before and after, and interrupted time series study designs.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^d45c11d3]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Worldwide CPW implementation and usage in healthcare is on the rise. The lack of an agreed-upon definition of a CPW and what is not a CPW remains a significant challenge for many CPW researchers and clinicians. This paper describes the process of developing, refining, and pilot testing a set of criteria to be used for a practical operational definition for CPWs in healthcare, following the Kinsman et al. and Wieland et al. approach.

Future researchers considering the development, implementation, and evaluation of CPWs should adopt the developed definition or modify them to fit into their future research. This will advance the discourse towards an internationally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a CPW in healthcare.

### Impact of clinical pathway on clinical outcomes in the management of COPD exacerbation [^1bcf8fa6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

A clinical pathway (CP) - also known as a care pathway or multidisciplinary action plan (MAP) – is defined as an interventional plan for the mutual decision making and organization of care processes for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period. The pathway outlines the main clinical interventions that are carried out in the hospital by a group of health care professionals responsible for the care of the patient. It incorporates locally agreed clinical standard practices as well as guidelines into a systematic approach for managing a specific group of patients with the aim of improving patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources.

COPD presents a significant disease burden in Malaysia and is reflected in hospital admission rates for COPD exacerbations. The management of COPD admissions is guided by local standard practices and clinical guidelines established by the Ministry of Health of Malaysia. However there are inconsistencies between guidelines and their application in daily clinical practice. While existing clinical guidelines for COPD provide evidence-based and consensus-derived statements of optimal care for patients with COPD, such guidelines do not provide an organizational framework for managing patients within a hospital setting, resulting in inconsistent application of clinical plans and variable patient outcomes. COPD CP has been successfully implemented in developed countries and previous studies suggest that its usage results in improved clinical outcomes. The adoption of COPD CP in Asia, however, lags behind and evidence of its effectiveness in developing countries is less clear.

To date, there has been no published study on the effectiveness or impact of COPD clinical pathway development and implementation in Malaysia and also very few studies worldwide. In view of the positive outcomes reported in the literature in decreased LOS and readmission, we decided to examine the benefits and its effectiveness.

In this study, we report the development and implementation of a COPD CP in a teaching hospital in Malaysia, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing the length of stay (LOS), complication rates, readmissions, and mortality between CP and non-CP COPD patients.

### Pathway map development for medical device event reporting in operating theatres: a human factors approach to improving the existing system [^19d7b766]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

What is required to improve the current system

Currently, there is limited ‘useful’ information transfer between healthcare and the medical device industry as shown by the stakeholder interviews. Furthermore, the existing system is too complex and not sufficient to capture all the required data on device performance and be of benefit to all stakeholders. This in turn effects the level of design improvements and innovations carried. In the long term this affects patient safety in relation to technology.

The analysis of the processes followed on the developed pathway (as per stage 4 in figure 1) led to first identification of pathway differences (figures 2 and 3) and second identification of the main issues on the existing pathway. Principles of lean six sigma were used at this point to suggest recommendations for improvement and presented in table 3.

### Clinical pathways: effects on professional practice, patient outcomes, length of stay and hospital costs [^0357f60e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are structured multidisciplinary care plans used by health services to detail essential steps in the care of patients with a specific clinical problem. They aim to link evidence to practice and optimise clinical outcomes whilst maximising clinical efficiency.

Objectives

To assess the effect of clinical pathways on professional practice, patient outcomes, length of stay and hospital costs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, NHS EED and Global Health. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted relevant professional organisations.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies comparing stand alone clinical pathways with usual care as well as clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all titles to assess eligibility and methodological quality. Studies were grouped into those comparing clinical pathways with usual care and those comparing clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care.

Main Results

Twenty-seven studies involving 11,398 participants met the eligibility and study quality criteria for inclusion. Twenty studies compared stand alone clinical pathways with usual care. These studies indicated a reduction in in-hospital complications (odds ratio (OR) 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.94) and improved documentation (OR 13.65: 95%CI 5.38 to 34.64). There was no evidence of differences in readmission to hospital or in-hospital mortality. Length of stay was the most commonly employed outcome measure with most studies reporting significant reductions. A decrease in hospital costs/ charges was also observed, ranging from WMD +261 US$ favouring usual care to WMD -4919 US$ favouring clinical pathways (in US$ dollar standardized to the year 2000). Considerable heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis of length of stay and hospital cost results. An assessment of whether lower hospital costs contributed to cost shifting to another health sector was not undertaken.Seven studies compared clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. No evidence of differences were found between intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinical pathways are associated with reduced in-hospital complications and improved documentation without negatively impacting on length of stay and hospital costs.

### How to develop and deliver pathway-based care [^88961526]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The results from the UPMC Cancer Center's experience with Via Pathways and those reported by other pathways programs suggest that these are effective models for improving quality, reducing unwarranted variability in care, and reducing the rate of growth in the cost of cancer care. A robust pathways program that reduces unwarranted variability can serve as the vehicle to improve the value of cancer care to patients, payers, and providers through increasing quality and decreasing costs. Oncologists must take an active role in defining and implementing cost-effective care for patients, payers, and referring physicians.

### Using natural experimental studies to guide public health action: turning the evidence-based medicine paradigm on its head [^1d0c086f]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Public health research is concerned with ‘generating discoveries and new knowledge within the public health field itself’.This implies an opportunity and need to complement the evidence-based practice pathway, described above, with innovative solutions—generated in and for the real world by policymakers and practitioners—that can also be rigorously evaluated to produce ‘practice-based evidence’ (as shown in the lower pathway of figure 1).In this latter pathway, the purpose of evaluation can be seen as more akin to adjusting the compass bearing followed by existing policy rather than enabling a binary decision to proceed or not with the widespread implementation of a particular intervention. Whereas the former pathway depends on multiple instances of evidence of effectiveness to justify action, the latter depends more on multiple instances of action from which to develop at least preliminary evidence of effectiveness. This may in turn support taking further evaluable action and the consequent, cumulative reduction of uncertainty about its effects.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^45f9de2c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Same-day discharge (SDD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)—introduction and benefits—states that in the context of an SDD clinical pathway, overnight monitoring can be avoided, allowing for SDD in selected patients with no increased rate of death, rehospitalization, or other complications and with the potential to increase safety; however, evidence is largely observational with only small randomized trials supporting SDD, so uncertainty remains. The expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) aims to address this uncertainty and provide guidance about key patient, clinical, and systems factors, such as operational resources, that must be in place to ensure the safety of SDD after PCI, and clarifies that ECDPs are not intended to provide a single correct answer but encourage clinicians to ask questions and consider important factors. The benefits section adds that same-day discharge after PCI benefits both patients and facilities.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 750: perioperative pathways: enhanced recovery after surgery [^187c4f58]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 750—Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) in gynecologic surgery—states that ERAS pathways were developed with the goal of maintaining normal physiology in the perioperative period, thus optimizing patient outcomes without increasing postoperative complications or readmissions. The basic principles include preoperative counseling and nutritional strategies with avoidance of prolonged perioperative fasting; perioperative considerations focusing on regional anesthetic and nonopioid analgesic approaches, fluid balance, and maintenance of normothermia; and postoperative strategies promoting early mobilization and appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Reported benefits include shorter length of stay, decreased postoperative pain and need for analgesia, more rapid return of bowel function, decreased complication and readmission rates, and increased patient satisfaction, and implementation has not been shown to increase readmission, mortality, or reoperation rates. These benefits have been replicated across open and minimally invasive approaches and benign and oncologic surgeries, and implementation requires collaboration from all members of the surgical team, with data demonstrating success when multiple components of the ERAS pathway are implemented together.

### From adaptive licensing to adaptive pathways: delivering a flexible life-span approach to bring new drugs to patients [^7ce131a5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

These considerations, as well as the move towards personalized medicine and the need for better described value propositions for payers, accelerate the transition from the blockbuster to the niche buster business model for drug developers 38 ; in other words, to transition from “big‐to‐small” towards “small‐to‐big,” as illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 
The transition from “big‐to‐small” towards “small‐to‐big” as proposed under an adaptive pathway. Under the blockbuster strategy, sponsors would initially aim to obtain a license and coverage population that is as broad as possible (symbolized by the large blue circle). Effects in identifiable patient subgroups that are nested within the broad population (symbolized by small colored circles) would be addressed subsequently, often for purposes of differentiation against incoming competitor products. By contrast, an adaptive approach would initially aim to show positive benefit–risk and added value in a defined subpopulation, followed by additional clinical trials and studies in other subpopulations. A potential beneficial effect of this staggered approach is use of more targeted extrapolation (where justified) and nontraditional (e.g. observational) studies which in turn may reduce the total number of patients required to enroll in interventional clinical trials. The total treatment‐eligible population will grow in sequential steps over time (symbolized by the light blue circles).

Combine this with other elements of the adaptive pathways concept (Table 2), and the risks of a given development program can be staggered, leading to, perhaps, a reduction in overall risk.

Adaptive pathways offer a unique opportunity to address another growing burden for the innovation ecosystem: over time, individual payers or HTA organizations have increased their evidence requirements. While regulators have achieved some degree of interregional harmonization of evidence standards, HTA bodies are at an earlier point in that dialog. 39 The lack of alignment results in different technical, scientific, and economic hurdles for drugs to be developed. The emphasis of the adaptive pathways approach on early planning with engagement from all invested stakeholders, including patients, is expected to catalyze important consensus building between different payers/HTA bodies within and perhaps across regions.

Acknowledging these challenges, a growing number of pharma executives are supporting the adaptive pathways approach, and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) is now calling for the creation of “the framework required to successfully implement ‘Medicines Adaptive Pathways for Patients’ (MAPPs).” 9

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^5e6d8e3f]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The criteria developed in this study were derived from a critical analysis of existing literature and pilot testing to ensure the practicality of their use. Though broadly inclusive, they were designed to have clear parameters in order to allow development of objective inclusion criteria. The search strategy used in the Cochrane review was also deliberately inclusive so that all possible literature was screened for inclusion. Subsequently the individual empirical studies included in the review often included interventions described by the primary authors as something other than a clinical pathway. This was borne out by the fact that only 14 out of the final 27 included studies used the term 'clinical pathway' to describe their intervention. The existence of interventions called something other than clinical pathways that met the same criteria is evidence of confusion around what constitutes a clinical pathway. This strongly suggests that the development of an acceptable, objective and applicable definition would overcome much confusion about what constitutes a clinical pathway. The criteria described here provide a sound basis for further discussion amongst researchers and clinicians with the desire being to move towards an internationally acceptable definition.

There was a high level of agreement between authors when criteria were applied, as shown by the fact only 2 studies were referred to a third author due to disagreement, whilst there was agreement on the exclusion of 63 other studies. Therefore, these criteria demonstrate strong potential to be clear and objective enough for broad agreement and use by publishers, researchers, clinicians and anyone else interested in the investigation of clinical pathways in healthcare.

The criteria developed for this review could be used as a framework for describing interventions that may be considered a clinical pathway. This would strengthen the capacity of clinicians, researchers, educators and policymakers to locate and apply relevant evidence regarding the use of clinical pathways.

### An efficient strategy for evaluating new non-invasive screening tests for colorectal cancer: the guiding principles [^f241120b]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

2. Screening is a multistep process

The screening test is just one step in a coordinated multistep process that includes initial and repeated participation by the intended-use population, quality-assured testing, diagnostic follow-up, treatment and referral to high-risk surveillance programmes when appropriate, together with monitoring of key indicators along the screening pathway. Goals for each step in the process should be defined and agreed on by providers.

Explanatory text

Performing a screening test is just one event in a complex process that starts with an invitation to get tested and proceeds through diagnostic follow-up, and treatment for identified lesions, with further screening and surveillance as indicated. Key aspects of the multistep screening process necessary to ensure population and individual benefit have been describedand are shown diagrammatically in figure 1. The main, but not only, test-dependent components of the screening pathway are test accuracy and test participation (willingness of invited individuals to do the test). Demonstrating the value of a screening test must be rigorous and demonstrated at all relevant steps of the screening pathway.

Figure 1 
The multistep screening pathway characteristic of organised screening programmes and demonstrating the one-step and two-step strategiesas discussed in principle 2. How the principles relate to steps and outcomes are identified by the numbers in parentheses. Colours identify important outcomes relevant to detection.

How different countries go about screening and set standards varies widely.Established standards will depend on the nature of a healthcare system, what it wants to achieve and what is feasible. For instance, limitations in colonoscopy capacity could lead providers to set the positivity threshold (‘analytical specification’), to match colonoscopic capacity, even though test sensitivity might be compromised (see principle 8). Consequently, it will be essential to demonstrate how a new test meets programme goals at each step in these different healthcare settings. The target population should be informed of estimated test accuracy and its expected benefit using well-designed communication strategies to empower individuals to make their own decision.How the principles established in this consensus process relate to steps in the screening pathway are shown in figure 1.

2 STAGING ACROSS THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CONTINUUM

The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA),U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),and an international working group (IWG)have each proposed various AD staging systems. The latest 2024 updateof the NIA‐AA 2018 research frameworkfurther defines the disease by combining clinical and biological staging to separate syndrome from etiology. All of these staging schemes categorize the disease based on a combination of the presence or absence of biomarker changes.,,Some approaches are based exclusively on biomarkers, whereas others include clinical manifestations plus biomarkers. For example, preclinical AD is defined as an individual who is cognitively normal but with biomarker evidence of AD pathology, whereas mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI‐AD) refers to an individual with symptomatic cognitive changes, maintenance of functional independence, and biomarker evidence of AD. Individuals with preclinical or MCI‐AD with similar phenotypes may have varying combinations of biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. Dementia of the AD type, meanwhile, applies to individuals with cognitive deficits, loss of functional independence, and biomarker(s) indicative of AD pathology.

Advice to quit—clinicians are instructed that “The second step is to provide strong, clear, personalized advice to the smoker to quit all tobacco use as soon as possible,” and the advice “should be tailored to the individual’s specific health situation and should emphasize the benefits of stopping smoking” rather than harms; an example phrase is, “As your doctor (or healthcare provider), I want you to know that quitting smoking now is the best way for you to improve your health.” For smokers who are post-myocardial infarction, the clinician “can emphasize the rapid reduction in the chance of future CV morbidity and mortality” by saying, “Quitting smoking now is the best way for you to avoid another heart attack,” and after percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or interventions for peripheral artery disease, the clinician “can emphasize the importance of quitting to preserve stent or graft patency.”

### Alignment with indices of a care pathway is associated with improved survival: an observational population-based study in colon cancer patients [^6c38c700]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Despite improvements in treatment and the development of centers of excellence, variations in survival persist in many cancers when benchmarked both within and across countries,,. The rising burden of cancer and persistent disparities in outcomes in developed countries has driven research into the delivery of more affordable, high quality and equitable cancer care,,. Factors underlying outcome disparities between similar countries have remained elusive, with the contribution of health system dynamics to these disparities difficult to measure.

Cancer care pathways define optimal trajectories through health systems and have been implemented in many countries,,,. These pathways are generally designed for rapid referral, institutional conformity of practice and cost efficiencies,. The American Society of Clinical Oncology published a policy statement on clinical pathways in oncology. However, a meta-analysis of clinical pathway publications failed to show significant clinical benefits and the question of whether this approach to health systems improves overall outcomes remains open.

Over the last decade, the cancer reform agenda in Australia has concentrated on creating a uniform pathway of care for individual forms of cancers, the Optimal Care Pathway (OCP). The OCP are based on the best available evidence, with input from expert multidisciplinary clinical groups and broad consultation to define a consensus standard of optimal cancer care. The OCP describe seven phases of the pathway from prevention through to follow-up or end-of-life care. Critical elements of quality care, including time-frames for action, are described for each phase.

The concept of the OCP must be distinguished from the use of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) which encourage standardised care at each step on the pathway. The OCP provides a guide for standards and performance of the health system and was designed to support the patient in finding the appropriate expert care, which includes CPG use.

Health care in the United States is plagued by errors, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. It is also extremely costly. Clinical pathways can drive high-value care and high reliability within a health care organization. Clinical pathways are much more than just guidelines or order sets as a part of a protocol of care, however; they must incorporate multiple elements that are critical to their successful implementation and sustainability. Additionally, clinical pathways can be utilized to accomplish strategic goals of the organization while fulfilling the quality, safety, and clinical aspects of the organization's mission.

### Analysing biological pathways in genome-wide association studies [^35417501]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2010). Medium credibility.

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have typically focused on the analysis of single markers, which often lacks the power to uncover the relatively small effect sizes conferred by most genetic variants. Recently, pathway-based approaches have been developed, which use prior biological knowledge on gene function to facilitate more powerful analysis of GWA study data sets. These approaches typically examine whether a group of related genes in the same functional pathway are jointly associated with a trait of interest. Here we review the development of pathway-based approaches for GWA studies, discuss their practical use and caveats, and suggest that pathway-based approaches may also be useful for future GWA studies with sequencing data.

### Prospective, randomized, controlled trial between a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet and traditional postoperative care after laparotomy and intestinal resection [^8a7bc25f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

In an era of dwindling hospital resources and increasing medical costs, safe reduction in postoperative stay has become a major focus to optimize utilization of healthcare resources. Although several protocols have been reported to reduce postoperative stay, no Level I evidence exists for their use in routine clinical practice.

Methods

Sixty-four patients undergoing laparotomy and intestinal or rectal resection were randomly assigned to a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet or to traditional postoperative care. Time to discharge from hospital, complication and readmission rates, pain level, quality of life, and patient satisfaction scores were determined at the time of discharge and at 10 and 30 days after surgery. Subgroups were defined to evaluate those who derived the optimal benefit from the protocol.

Results

Pathway patients spent less total time in the hospital after surgery (5.4 vs. 7.1 days; P = 0.02) and less time in the hospital during the primary admission than traditional patients. Patients younger than 70 years old had greater benefits than the overall study group (5 vs. 7.1 days; P = 0.01). Patients treated by surgeons with the most experience with the pathway spent significantly less time in the hospital than did those whose surgeons were less experienced with the pathway (P = 0.01). There was no difference between pathway and traditional patients for readmission or complication rates, pain score, quality of life after surgery, or overall satisfaction with the hospital stay.

Conclusions

Patients scheduled for a laparotomy and major intestinal or rectal resection are suitable for management by a pathway of controlled rehabilitation with early ambulation and diet. Pathway patients have a shorter hospital stay, with no adverse effect on patient satisfaction, pain scores, or complication rates. Patients younger than 70 years of age derive the optimal benefit, and increased surgeon experience improves outcome.

### Can improved use of biomarkers alter the fate of PI3K pathway inhibitors in the clinic? [^a8ea397b]. Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The high frequency of PI3K pathway alterations in cancer has motivated numerous efforts to develop drugs targeting this network. Although many potent and selective inhibitors have been developed and evaluated in preclinical models, their progress to clinical approval has been limited. Here we discuss the pressing need to develop improved biomarker strategies to guide patient selection and improve assessment of patient responses to PI3K pathway inhibitors to address unresolved issues surrounding the efficacy and tolerability of these compounds in patients with cancer.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathway timeline and scope—The timeline for development is more compressed than a Clinical Practice Guideline, usually in the range of 8 to 12 months, during which time the Work Group tracks emerging evidence and incorporates it into the pathway. Determination of the scope is a critical early step, and the Work Group should keep the scope wide enough to provide guidance on the most important clinical questions yet not so broad as to be unmanageable within the narrow timeframe typically allotted for content development.

If not performed in humans, the pathway asks “Has the intervention been attempted in animals?” and, if not, “Should it be tried first in animals?”, with terminal outcomes “Animal Research” or “Do not proceed.” For human experience, the pathway asks “How strong is the evidence for use in this population group under consideration?” under “Levels of Evidence,” and then determines “Is the intervention being proposed with the primary intent of creating new knowledge?” with terminal actions “Refer to IRB” or “Innovative Therapy.”

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And metabolism [^5c404a94]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

FDA APPROVAL PATHWAYS

The FDA currently supports commercial drug development in NASH with advanced stage fibrosis as these patients are at a higher risk for liver‐related adverse clinical outcomes. There are two types of regulatory approval pathways: traditional (also known as regular or “full”) and accelerated approval. Traditional approval relies on clinical benefit end‐points which directly measure how a patient feels, functions and survives (eg morbidity and mortality) and would require durations in the order of decades for trials in precirrhotic NASH patients.

Accelerated approval 2 is one of FDA's expedited programmes intended to facilitate drug development for serious medical conditions, for example those with unmet need, lack available therapy or where lengthy trials would be required to measure the direct clinical benefit of a drug. This pathway ensures that therapies for serious conditions are available to patients as soon as it can be concluded that the therapies' benefits justify their risks. Accelerated approval relies on appropriate surrogate or intermediate clinical end‐points that are more readily measured and considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A post‐market study to further define the clinical benefit and confirm the prediction is generally underway at the time of accelerated approval. Due to the long duration needed to assess NASH outcomes, an accelerated approval pathway using biopsy‐based surrogate end‐points that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in noncirrhotic NASH has been recommended as discussed below.

### Pathway analysis approaches for rare and common variants: insights from genetic analysis workshop 18 [^05474d14]. Genetic Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathway analysis, broadly defined as a group of methods incorporating a priori biological information from public databases, has emerged as a promising approach for analyzing high-dimensional genomic data. As part of Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, seven research groups applied pathway analysis techniques to whole-genome sequence data from the San Antonio Family Study. Overall, the groups found that the potential of pathway analysis to improve detection of causal variants by lowering the multiple-testing burden and incorporating biologic insight remains largely unrealized. Specifically, there is a lack of best practices at each stage of the pathway approach: annotation, analysis, interpretation, and follow-up. Annotation of genetic variants is inconsistent across databases, incomplete, and biased toward known genes. At the analysis stage insufficient statistical power remains a major challenge. Analyses combining rare and common variants may have an inflated type I error rate and may not improve detection of causal genes. Inclusion of known causal genes may not improve statistical power, although the fraction of explained phenotypic variance may be a more appropriate metric. Interpretation of findings is further complicated by evidence in support of interactions between pathways and by the lack of consensus on how to best incorporate functional information. Finally, all presented approaches warranted follow-up studies, both to reduce the likelihood of false-positive findings and to identify specific causal variants within a given pathway. Despite the initial promise of pathway analysis for modeling biological complexity of disease phenotypes, many methodological challenges currently remain to be addressed.

### Developing biomarkers to predict benefit from HGF / MET pathway inhibitors [^6f489b21]. The Journal of Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Activation of the MET signalling pathway is critical in regulating multiple cellular processes underlying tumourigenic growth and has represented an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Early stage clinical studies of multiple agents targeting this pathway have been undertaken, frequently in unselected patient cohorts with variable results. Promising data in patient subgroups in these studies indicate the need for predictive biomarkers to identify the patients most likely to benefit from these therapies. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of mechanisms of MET activation, the status of the clinical evaluation of MET-targeted therapies, the associated efforts to identify and validate biomarkers, and the considerations and challenges for potential development of companion diagnostics.

### A framework for pathway knowledge driven prioritization in genome-wide association studies [^35913b64]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we introduced a new efficient analytic pipeline to enable pathway‐guided search in a GWAS. Using this pipeline we illustrated that substantial power improvement can be achieved in GWAS by using knowledge of biologically meaningful categorization of genes, for example, pathways, ontology terms and so forth. The power gain is highlighted by the “novel loci” (i.e. crossover loci) detected in the pathway‐guided reanalyses of real GWAS data sets. Using, whole‐genome simulations, the “pathway‐guided GWAS” is shown to have correct global false‐positive rate, and improved power for well connected SNPs. As expected, there is loss of power for isolated SNPs, but we found such power loss to be less common and also much less in magnitude. Moreover, with better prior annotation strategies and as annotation databases become more comprehensive and accurate, most “isolated” true SNPs are likely to be connected with other causal genes, further reducing this concern. Isolated SNPs involving novel biological mechanisms (without known connections in annotation databases) would have higher power to be detected by primary (unbiased) GWAS analysis.

Our pipeline consists of a new method called PMLR for adaptively estimating “enrichments” (i.e. prior probabilities) followed by optimal p value weighting to control FWER. The primary advantage of PMLR over existing methods for enrichment estimation in GWAS is that it involves two simple steps, local FDR calculation followed by a (penalized) logistic regression. Thus it can be implemented using standard GLM and penalized GLM software in any statistical package. Also, compared to some existing prioritization algorithms requiring high‐dimensional MLE or posteriors, it is faster, scalable to large number of annotations and less likely to encounter numerical problems such as nonconvergence, making it suitable for routine use.

A limitation of our method, which is not specific to the method proposed here, is that the local FDR approach ignores the association (i.e. LD) structure of the SNPs in deriving the marginal PPAs. To our knowledge, all other existing prior‐incorporation methods assume independence across SNPs or SNP blocks. In the future, we plan to overcome this limitation by allowing for correlations among SNPs in the mPPA estimation step in a computationally efficient manner. A key benefit of our modular approach is that our pipeline can be easily adapted to be used in conjunction with other alternative methods for mPPA estimation and/or Type 1 error allocation methods in future.

Conclusions

This study adds evidence in favor of the notion that, compared with UC, CPs can help to provide better, comprehensive, and more specialized care to patients affected by stroke. However, additional studies are needed to further understand the cost-effectiveness of CPs and how to pass the critical point at which adherence to a pathway decreases [-].

FIGURE 1 
Theoretical biological and clinical changes associated with the initiation of biomarker‐guided therapy. The x‐axis indicates time; this general period/duration shows progression of clinical and biological changes and intentionally does not correlate with any disease stage. Disease stage benchmarks are highly individualized, and more data are required to better reflect clinical realities. The two y‐axes portray biological changes (A, right; in green) and clinical changes (left; in blue). Evidence suggests that biological changes occur earlier in the disease course than symptomatic clinical changes. This is shown with plus signs, where the biological inflection point comes before the clinical inflection point. Another consideration is the plateau (saturation) period, where biological changes also precede clinical changes: shown with stars. The dotted lines at two distinct time points indicate the theoretical changes in disease progression with continuous biomarker‐guided treatment intervention. The earlier treatment would theoretically result in a larger treatment–no treatment difference over time and considerably larger benefit. Conversely, delaying treatment initiation is expected to result in smaller treatment–no treatment differences over time. Overall, this graph takes into account the non‐linear progression of disease along with the time‐dependent deviations and cumulative changes in underlying pathophysiology and complexity. (B) Shows a magnified portion of A where earlier treatment would theoretically result in a larger treatment–no treatment difference over time and considerably larger benefit. (C) Conversely shows that delaying treatment initiation is expected to result in smaller treatment–no treatment differences over time.

### The impact of COVID-19 on the patient, clinician, healthcare services and society: a patient pathway review [^317628ee]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The spread of COVID-19 infection has changed the world. Population-based studies of COVID-19 are limited because it is unknown why events happen or why certain outcomes occur. An alternative approach called the patient pathway review evaluates what happens to individuals in detail. In the "ideal" pathway patients with COVID-19 will seek medical attention and COVID-19 will be identified and they will either be admitted to hospital, managed in the community or they will self-care. However, in the "real-world" pathway, patients may delay seeking medical attention and it is variable who the patient decides to seek help from and some patients may be initially misdiagnosed. The eventual outcome will be recovery from the acute infection or death but there may be a spectrum of healthcare needs for patients from those who care for themselves in the community to those who are hospitalized and require intensive care. The patients may or may not have short- and long-term adverse effects. People infected with COVID-19 can take on different paths which depend on the patient's decision making, clinical decision making, and the patient's response to the infection. Desirable pathways are those where patients have good outcomes and also limit the transmission of the virus.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and multimorbidity—general clinical assumptions: This ECDP applies to the patient with ASCVD and multimorbidity and is primarily focused on outpatient management; the writing committee endorses ACC/AHA evidence-based approaches but recognizes that stacking disease-specific Clinical Practice Guidelines may lead to unintended consequences and that following all possible recommendations may not be practical. CV clinicians should consider the whole patient and the patient’s life expectancy and other patient-specific domains when making treatment decisions, and clinicians should regularly review and reconcile conditions and treatments to prioritize high-value interventions aligned with the patient’s goals, priorities, and preferences. Expected benefits, potential harms, and burdens should be considered, priority should often be given to treatments that address multiple conditions, and optimal patient care should reflect the patient’s goals and the clinician’s medical knowledge. Deprescribing one or more medications or therapies may be the best option for some patients; this ECDP is not intended to supersede good clinical judgment and the treating clinician should seek input as needed. Team-based care should be used to address various treatment domains to attain the best possible outcomes, health systems and clinicians should leverage electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate care coordination among clinicians while promoting patient engagement, and healthcare organizations should advocate for legislative efforts to reward holistic, patient-centered care. This ECDP is based on currently available data and information, and clinicians should incorporate pertinent information published after this ECDP.

### Mixed-methods evaluation of an enhanced asthma biologics clinical pathway in the west midlands UK [^966bd73c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Benefits of the enhanced severe asthma pathway

All interview participants highlighted multiple benefits of the enhanced pathway for patients and staff. The standard severe asthma pathway was felt to be disjointed, with many patients with severe and difficult asthma managed in primary care without being referred to specialist services:

“I think we have failings throughout the whole of the pathway, and that is the responsibility of both primary care and secondary care. It’s a mess.” (Respiratory consultant, secondary care)

Interviewees felt that the time between patient referral from primary care and the first appointment at the severe asthma clinic in secondary care had been shortened considerably by the enhanced pathway. Members of the secondary care respiratory team felt that the enhanced pathway had also improved the proportion of patients appropriately referred into secondary care for assessment, although potential future capacity issues were recognised associated with a greater number of referrals being made:

“ I think one of the positives, because of the way the clinic was set up is you didn’t get caught up in the whole waiting list system for secondary care, but I think that is going to become more of a problem as you refer more patients in.” (General practitioner, primary care)

A significant strength of the enhanced pathway was agreed by several participants to be the proactive element in a nurse educator supporting general practices to identify patients who may be eligible for biologic treatments by working closely with the practices and searching practice lists:

“So this project is absolutely amazing – what it’s doing is it proactively goes out to the GP practices, and – I am going to use the word in a friendly term – hunts down patients. So they are really out to scoop up those patients and refer them to secondary care.” (Operational manager, non-clinical)

The training and education component of the enhanced pathway was favourably received by those working in primary care, and was felt to be effective in helping to identify patients with severe asthma who would benefit from specialist assessment:

“ So I think certainly the education that’s been provided in primary care now is highlighting that need, that unmet need if you like…they get an appointment quicker than they would have done if they had gone through the traditional route.” (Asthma nurse, secondary care)

### A systematic review of clinical pathways for lower back pain and introduction of the Saskatchewan spine pathway [^555f1537]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review of spine care pathways and case study of the Saskatchewan Spine Pathway (SSP).

Objective

(1) What are the differences between clinical pathways and clinical guidelines? (2) Are there examples of clinical pathways in the management of lower back pain (LBP)? Is there evidence that they are successful? (3) What is the SSP, and what are its key features?

Summary Of Background Data

Adherence to evidence-based guidelines for LBP produces superior outcomes and may improve efficiency by reducing unnecessary imaging, ineffective treatments, and inappropriate surgical referrals. A clinical pathway is an attempt to bridge the "translation gap" between guidelines and clinical practice.

Methods

A qualitative review was performed for question 1. For question 2, a systematic review of the English language literature was performed for articles published through March 31, 2011. A case study is provided for question 3.

Results

(1) Evidence for clinical pathways is mainly derived from guidelines, but pathways are distinguished by several features including the coordination of multidisciplinary care, facilitation of communication among care providers, resources for ongoing quality improvements, and a central focus on the patient experience. (2) Five articles describing four clinical pathways met the a priori criteria, but none tested comparative effectiveness. (3) The SSP is unique in that it is (a) inclusive for all types of LBP, (b) based on a classification system, (c) patient-focused mostly at primary care rather than in specialized clinics, (d) implemented in the health care system of a geopolitically defined region, and (e) includes all of the defining features of modern care pathways.

Conclusion

Several clinical pathways for LBP have been described, but effectiveness has not been tested.

Clinical Recommendations

Clinical pathways for LBP need to be further developed and investigated as a means to facilitate guidelines-concordant practice and improve patient outcomes.

Level Of Evidence

Insufficient.

Recommendation

Weak.

### Mapping the evidence on dementia care pathways – A scoping review [^28b0796b]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

One way of standardizing practice and improving patient safety is by introducing clinical care pathways; however, such pathways are typically geared towards assisting clinicians and healthcare organizations with evidence-based practice. Many dementia care pathways exist with no agreed-upon version of a care pathway and with little data on experiences about their use or outcomes. The objectives of the review were: (1) to identify the dementia care pathway's purpose, methods used to deploy the pathway, and expected user types; (2) to identify the care pathway's core components, expected outcomes, and implications for persons with dementia and their care partners; and (3) determine the extent of involvement by persons with dementia and/or their care partners in developing, implementing, and evaluating the care pathways.

Methods

We systematically searched six literature databases for published literature in the English language in September 2023 utilizing Arskey and O'Malley's scoping review framework.

Results

The findings from the dementia care pathways (n=13) demonstrated assistance in dementia diagnostic and management practices for clinicians and offered structured care processes in clinical settings. For this reason, these pathways emphasized assessment and interventional post-diagnostic support, with less emphasis on community-based integrated dementia care.

Conclusion

Future dementia care pathway development can seek the involvement of persons with dementia and care partners in designing, implementing and evaluating such pathways, ensuring that outcome measures properly reflect the impact on persons with lived dementia experience and their care partners.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^1c67f517]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Literature

A search of electronic databases and communication with the European Pathways Association revealed three 'sentinel' articles that described the characteristics of a clinical pathway: Campbell et al. De Bleser et al. and Vanhaecht et al. De Bleser et al. surveyed the multiple terms used to describe a clinical pathway via a comprehensive review of the literature and derived key characteristics in attempting to address international confusion regarding the definition of a clinical pathway. Campbell et al. described clinical pathways in the context of their relationship to clinical guidelines, whilst Vanhaecht et al. summarised previous studies to determine whether their review of audit tools elicited common characteristics of clinical pathways. A summary of the characteristics identified by these studies is provided in Table 1.

Table 1 
Characteristics of clinical pathways derived from sentinel articles

Criteria

The following five criteria were derived from the three sentinel articles mentioned above: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression (that is, steps were taken if designated criteria were met); and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population.

Level of agreement and final criteria

These criteria were tested by three of the team on five papers. If the intervention described in the paper met all five criteria then it was considered a clinical pathway. This resulted in agreement between reviewers on only two out of the five papers. It was apparent that the main obstacle to agreement on all five criteria was the poor reporting of the intervention. To address this issue the criteria were unchanged but their relative importance was adjusted. An intervention was defined as a clinical pathway if it was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care and at least three of the remaining four criteria were met (that is, it met the first criteria and any three of the remaining four). This amended schedule of essential criteria was then tested by applying them to a further five papers. Following the application of the amended schedule of criteria, there was 100% agreement between the three review authors regarding whether an intervention was a clinical pathway. This schedule was then adopted by the review group and applied to studies identified by the search strategy for the systematic review.

### Medicines adaptive pathways to patients: why, when, and how to engage? [^2cac1b4a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder groups and especially payers insisted that such uncertainties need to be mitigated if they are to engage in the MAPPs process. Variants of some of these uncertainties apply today in select circumstances outside of the MAPPs construct, e.g. conditional marketing authorizations (CMA) and implementation of risk management plan measures. Therefore, the consortium also assessed experience‐based knowledge to gain insights for MAPPs.

With this shared understanding, the consortium developed a set of “engagement criteria for MAPPs”. 9 These criteria are question‐based and are designed to guide stakeholder groups in their consideration of using a MAPPs process for a given product (Table 1). They are elaborated below, in the context of the proposed adaptive pathway moments.

Table 1 
Framework of questions to be addressed by stakeholders when considering MAPPs for a given medicinal product

The MAPPs concept is predicated on coordinated and iterative dialog among the stakeholders. The aim of these interactions is to jointly chart a course of actions for drug development, authorization, HTA, pricing and reimbursement (P&R), utilization, and monitoring across the entire product life‐span. While some current drug developments programs have “adaptive elements” such as targeted development to achieve early approval, MAPPs is different from the traditional, sequential approach with limited concerted multistakeholder interactions and only partly overlapping processes. It aims to address the information needs of all decision‐makers in a single, efficient evidence generation plan and to enable rapid action by sequential decision‐makers (e.g. regulators, HTA bodies, payers).

The consortium's reflections on how to best manage multistakeholder interactions, and how they differ from the current process, are described as a seamless process with defined consultations milestones, termed “adaptive pathway moments.” 10 Each of the initial consultation moments may be followed by one or more reassessment moments where new data and information is reviewed and decisions refined based on the collected data. A pictographic representation of the proposed medicine life‐span, process steps, and core “adaptive pathway moments” is shown in Figure 2.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^3c363d65]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology—purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing “the how,” including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology’s “actionable knowledge” strategy and are an important component of “solution sets,” articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

### Designing the next-generation clinical care pathway for Alzheimer's disease [^5010b1c8]. Nature Aging (2022). High credibility.

The reconceptualization of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a clinical and biological construct has facilitated the development of biomarker-guided, pathway-based targeted therapies, many of which have reached late-stage development with the near-term potential to enter global clinical practice. These medical advances mark an unprecedented paradigm shift and requires an optimized global framework for clinical care pathways for AD. In this Perspective, we describe the blueprint for transitioning from the current, clinical symptom-focused and inherently late-stage diagnosis and management of AD to the next-generation pathway that incorporates biomarker-guided and digitally facilitated decision-making algorithms for risk stratification, early detection, timely diagnosis, and preventative or therapeutic interventions. We address critical and high-priority challenges, propose evidence-based strategic solutions, and emphasize that the perspectives of affected individuals and care partners need to be considered and integrated.

### Medicines adaptive pathways to patients: why, when, and how to engage? [^5a89897a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

There remains another challenge not be underestimated: MAPPs is a life‐span approach to learning about and utilizing a drug product. This will necessarily require all stakeholders to not only adopt the concept but also adopt a long‐term view to achieve “collective and cumulative learning” 18 along the journey.

What impact has the MAPPs concept made to date? While there are products currently in a “MAPPS‐like” development, MAPPs is too novel for a product to have already gone through successfully and product‐specific information is not yet in the public domain. However, there is at least one product in preauthorization development for which MAPPs interactions have been publicly released by the sponsor 19 and for which MAPPs may help achieve timely access for patients—provided the results from ongoing studies meet expectations.

While this may be a hoped‐for outcome in the future, we argue that MAPPs has even today stimulated progress on the level of public debate and stakeholder perceptions. Some of the building blocks of MAPPs (Figure 1) have become mainstream: a focus on patient groups with high unmet need (as opposed to the blockbuster approach), the need for iterative development and assessment throughout the product life‐span, and the need for multistakeholder collaboration along the entire product life‐span are now widely accepted in principle, and partly implemented (consider, for example, the joint early regulator‐HTA dialogs in the EU). 20 Other building blocks will take longer to be fully accepted and implemented; for example, the appropriate use of real‐world data, frameworks to allow for adaptive pricing and reimbursement, or ways to ensure appropriate on‐market utilization. We remain confident that these outstanding issues will gradually be resolved and MAPPs can be applied in the best interest of patients.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^99d66e0d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco cessation pathway—scope and care approach addresses the management of cigarette smokers seen in the outpatient clinic setting and includes recommendations for smokers who are hospitalized with acute CVD processes and those in whom surgery is planned. The document focuses on adults and does not address tobacco cessation treatment for adolescents or for pregnant women. Content centers on cigarette smoking and other combustible tobacco products because inhalation of smoke generated by tobacco conveys a greater cardiovascular risk than products in which tobacco is not burned. Effective treatment is best achieved and managed by a team approach in which physicians work with other healthcare providers and key smoking cessation stakeholders, including nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, certified tobacco treatment specialists, and health department quit services (e.g., telephone quitlines 1-800-QUIT NOW), and clinical decisions should be governed by clinical judgment and patient preferences. The recommendations and algorithms may be superseded by new evidence.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^3831c767]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Developmental process and refinement of an operational definition for CPWs

In 2010, a team of Cochrane review authors undertook a four-stage process to develop a list of criteria to generate an operational definition for CPWs in hospitals. This followed a methodology proposed by Kinsman et al. and Wieland et al. The process required (1) identification of articles exploring the scope and definition of CPWs (or similar terms); (2) synthesis of previously suggested components and generation of draft criteria for testing; (3) pilot testing the level of agreement between review authors when applying criteria to identified studies; and (4) modification of the criteria to maximize agreement between review authors.

The rigorous testing of the criteria with 10 CPW articles, and with 100 % agreement among review authors, led to the development of a practical operational definition for CPWs: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other ‘inventory of actions’; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression (that is, steps were taken if designated criteria were met); and (5) the intervention aimed to standardize care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population.

An intervention was considered to be a CPW if it met the first criterion together with three of the other four criteria. The operational definition further supported the identification of relevant full text studies that were eventually used in finalizing the first systematic review on CPWs in hospital care in 2010.

### A powerful pathway-based adaptive test for genetic association with common or rare variants [^5ed0221c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of the success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), only a small proportion of heritability for each complex trait has been explained by identified genetic variants, mainly SNPs. Likely reasons include genetic heterogeneity (i.e., multiple causal genetic variants) and small effect sizes of causal variants, for which pathway analysis has been proposed as a promising alternative to the standard single-SNP-based analysis. A pathway contains a set of functionally related genes, each of which includes multiple SNPs. Here we propose a pathway-based test that is adaptive at both the gene and SNP levels, thus maintaining high power across a wide range of situations with varying numbers of the genes and SNPs associated with a trait. The proposed method is applicable to both common variants and rare variants and can incorporate biological knowledge on SNPs and genes to boost statistical power. We use extensively simulated data and a WTCCC GWAS dataset to compare our proposal with several existing pathway-based and SNP-set-based tests, demonstrating its promising performance and its potential use in practice.

### Clinical pathways for the management of low back pain from primary to specialised care: a systematic review [^bc2ca23f]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical pathways for low back pain (LBP) have potential to improve clinical outcomes and health service efficiency. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the evidence for clinical pathways for LBP and/or radicular leg pain from primary to specialised care and to describe key pathway components.

Methods

Electronic database searches (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) from 2006 onwards were conducted with further manual and citation searching. Two independent reviewers conducted eligibility assessment, data extraction and quality appraisal. A narrative synthesis of findings is presented.

Results

From 18,443 identified studies, 28 papers met inclusion criteria. Pathways were developed primarily to address over-burdened secondary care services in high-income countries and almost universally used interface services with a triage remit at the primary-secondary care boundary. Accordingly, evaluation of healthcare resource use and patient flow predominated, with interface services associated with enhanced service efficiency through decreased wait times and appropriate use of consultant appointments. Low quality study designs, heterogeneous outcomes and insufficient comparative data precluded definitive conclusions regarding clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Pathways demonstrated basic levels of care integration across the primary-secondary care boundary.

Conclusions

The limited volume of research evaluating clinical pathways for LBP/radicular leg pain and spanning primary and specialised care predominantly used interface services to ensure appropriate specialised care referrals with associated increased efficiency of care delivery. Pathways demonstrated basic levels of care integration across healthcare boundaries. Well-designed randomised controlled trials to explore the potential of clinical pathways to improve clinical outcomes, deliver cost-effective, guideline-concordant care and enhance care integration are required.

### Unbiased discovery of cancer pathways and therapeutics using pathway ensemble tool and benchmark [^5a3f477e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathogenesis of complex diseases is often underpinned by dysregulation of several cellular pathways. This is well exemplified by neoplastic diseases, where abnormalities in multiple pathways contribute to cancerous transformation or in which cancer-disposing events perturb multiple cellular pathways. Despite notable successes in some cancers, limited therapeutic gains have been made by identification and targeting of single contributory genes. Precisely pinpointing key dysregulated celluar pathways in cancer and ranking them by order of importance is, therefore, of major biological and clinical significance. Doing so would enable molecular subtyping, determination of diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and inform choice of effective and cancer-specific drug regimens. This is especially important at the present time because the incidence of cancer is increasing.

The contemporary approach to elucidate aberrations in biological pathways is dominated by omics methods, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). As expected, vast amounts of omics data have been generated for most cancers. However, unlocking their full potential has remained challenging. Biological pathway analysis, a computational search to identify and rank by importance the key relevant and/or dysregulated pathways among the thousands of known potential biological pathways, is a critical means for deciphering these data. Numerous in silico methods (reviewed here,), for example GSEAand Enrichr, have been developed and broadly applied to conduct pathway analyses. One common application of these methods has been to test whether specific pathways hypothesized by researchers are, in fact, enriched in a dataset. In this approach, pathway enrichment analyses have generally proven successful, but pre-suppose a priori knowledge or hypothesis. An alternative, highly desired application, especially in the context of exponentially growing omics datasets, is the adoption of unbiased discovery-based approaches. Here, the objective is to rank the “correct pathways” above all other pathways in the reported results without imparting bias from a priori knowledge. However, the performance and suitability of existing pathway analysis methods for this form of blinded or unbiased discovery remains largely unknown. In other words, it is not known how often the top pathway(s) returned by an analysis method represent(s) the most important perturbation. This is likely due to the fact that most methods were developed and evaluated (“benchmarked”) using computer simulated pathwaysor verified only in very small scale biological datasets from historical, low-resolution microarray technology,–. Therefore, a key limitation is lack of proper benchmarking and assessment of the capacity of these tools for pathway discovery under experimental settings, which often contain substantial “noise” due to stochastic events and biological variations. Such lack of a suitable evaluation platform predicated on large-scale experimental data significantly impedes informed deployment of pathway analysis tools for blinded discovery of perturbations in cancer.

### Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway – A report from the American Gastroenterological Association institute HCV care pathway work group [^4ff4ac7f]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway—prevalence, DAA efficacy, and birth-cohort screening: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects more than 2.7 million individuals in the U.S., and direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatments have resulted in sustained virological response in 90-100% of patients. Recent updates in HCV screening guidelines recommend one-time testing for all persons born between 1945 and 1965. The goal of the HCV Clinical Pathway is to provide guidance on the cascade of care and best practices for managing US-based patients with HCV, and the pathway encompasses the entire care spectrum from outreach and screening to initial evaluation, antiviral treatment, and post treatment follow up care.

### Imaging pathways: will they be well trodden or less traveled? [^2214e750]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence of inappropriate investigations is not hard to find, and these result in a range of adverse clinical and economic outcomes. An online, evidence-based education and decision support application called Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) has been developed to assist clinicians to request the most appropriate examinations in the best sequence to achieve diagnoses. The development of the clinical and academic content of DIP and its continuous review and revision involve a network of specialists and general practitioners coordinated by an editorial panel. A research fellow is employed to search the literature, evaluate the evidence, and draft pathways for review. An information technologist develops the Web site, including new functionality, as the scope of the application is expanded. Dissemination is straightforward, with DIP being freely available on the Web (http://www.imagingpathways.health.wa.gov.au). Raising awareness of DIP beyond the immediate clinical environment is challenging. This is assisted through the development of partnerships with national and international entities, which have the core purpose of encouraging evidence-based clinical practice. The greatest challenge, however, is implementation; that is, achieving compliance between requesting practice and recommendations. There is a need to embed DIP into the clinical workflow such that clinicians are guided to choose the "correct" examination. One strategy is to replace paper-based referral processes with an electronic process and to progressively link "electronic requesting" to decision support. Evaluated trials are planned to bring the strategy to the stage of "proof of concept" in Australia.

### Effects of clinical pathways in the joint replacement: a meta-analysis [^77d1cbd9]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of clinical pathways for hip and knee joint replacements when compared with standard medical care. The impact of clinical pathways was evaluated assessing the major outcomes of in-hospital hip and knee joint replacement processes: postoperative complications, number of patients discharged at home, length of in-hospital stay and direct costs.

Methods

Medline, Cinahl, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. The search was performed from 1975 to 2007. Each study was assessed independently by two reviewers. The assessment of methodological quality of the included studies was based on the Jadad methodological approach and on the New Castle Ottawa Scale. Data analysis abided by the guidelines set out by The Cochrane Collaboration regarding statistical methods. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software, version 4.2.

Results

Twenty-two studies met the study inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis for a total sample of 6,316 patients. The aggregate overall results showed significantly fewer patients suffering postoperative complications in the clinical pathways group when compared with the standard care group. A shorter length of stay in the clinical pathway group was also observed and lower costs during hospital stay were associated with the use of the clinical pathways. No significant differences were found in the rates of discharge to home.

Conclusion

The results of this meta-analysis show that clinical pathways can significantly improve the quality of care even if it is not possible to conclude that the implementation of clinical pathways is a cost-effective process, because none of the included studies analysed the cost of the development and implementation of the pathways. Based on the results we assume that pathways have impact on the organisation of care if the care process is structured in a standardised way, teams critically analyse the actual organisation of the process and the multidisciplinary team is highly involved in the re-organisation. Further studies should focus on the evaluation of pathways as complex interventions to help to understand which mechanisms within the clinical pathways can really improve the quality of care. With the need for knee and hip joint replacement on the rise, the use of clinical pathways might contribute to better quality of care and cost-effectiveness.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^475bc1ea]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale for refinement of the operational definition for CPWs

A recent attempt by the review team to conduct a systematic review on CPWs in primary care was hampered by the challenge of applying the above operational definition in a primary care setting, with the major problem during the protocol development for the systematic review being the identification of relevant CPW studies in a primary care context.

This is due to the requirements of criteria numbers 3 and 4. The application of these two criteria is problematic, because several articles explicitly met criterion 3 but not criterion 4, or vice versa, and thus had to be excluded.

TR and LK pilot tested the new criteria on five CPWs studies in primary care identified during the protocol development for a systematic review on CPWs in primary care. Consensus was reached among review authors that, by merging the two criteria, the definition would be more inclusive. Thus, the new operational definition for CPWs was narrowed to a four criteria checklist.

### Effects of clinical pathways in the joint replacement: a meta-analysis [^2ba1a0f7]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The use of hip and knee joint replacement (JR) has been steadily increasing during the last few years. It is also expected that the pressure for use of JR will further increase in healthcare systems worldwide because of the ageing population and the related increased prevalence of osteoarthritis. Although JR is a cost-effective treatment both from the clinical and patients' perspective, JR represents a significant cost to hospitals due to the continuous advances in prosthetic design and materials. This could be a critical issue in healthcare systems because of the decline in available funds for public healthcare. As a result, from a public health perspective, adjustments in the care process are necessary for cost containment without compromising the quality of patient care.

Several methodologies to reduce the costs and to improve the management of these patients have been advocated. A major organisational strategy is a clinical pathway [-]. Clinical pathways, also known as care pathways or critical pathways, are a methodology for the mutual decision making and organisation of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period [,,-].

Although clinical pathways have been used since the 1980s, there is increasing debate about what they are and how they affect patients' care and outcomes. As a consequence their use in healthcare systems in high volume and costly care like JR is still jeopardised and evidence is needed to support public health decision makers in understanding the real impact of this methodology [,,-].

Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of JR clinical pathways when compared with standard medical care. Based on a previous review the impact of clinical pathways was evaluated assessing the major outcomes of in-hospital JR processes: postoperative complications, number of patients discharged at home, length of in-hospital stay (LOS) and direct costs.

### The black box illuminated: signals and signaling [^833c1972]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Unraveling the signaling pathways that transmit information from the cell surface to the nucleus has been a major accomplishment of modern cell and molecular biology. The benefit to humans is seen in the multitude of new therapeutics based on the illumination of these pathways. Although considerable insight has been gained in understanding homeostatic and pathological signaling in the epidermis and other skin compartments, the translation into therapy has been lacking. This review will outline advances made in understanding fundamental signaling in several of the most prominent pathways that control cutaneous development, cell-fate decisions, and keratinocyte growth and differentiation with the anticipation that this insight will contribute to new treatments for troubling skin diseases.

### PTMNavigator: interactive visualization of differentially regulated post-translational modifications in cellular signaling pathways [^7365db18]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Current PEAs are far from ideal for analyzing PTM data sets, and their outcomes must be taken with considerable caution. Nonetheless, PEAs currently provide the best starting point, so PTMNavigator uses PEA to pre-sort pathways by putative relevance. The initial ranking should help users prioritize pathway engagement, but users should keep in mind that some high-ranked pathways are not biologically relevant and are PEA artifacts. This is often rooted in pathway annotations being highly redundant (i.e. the same well-studied proteins show up in many well-studied pathways). On the other hand, pathways with non-significant scores are often worth examining, and additional resources, such as previous literature, should be considered when selecting diagrams for visualization. If better pathway ranking procedures are developed in the future, PTMNavigator can easily be updated to use those. We emphasize that PTMNavigator is a visualization tool and that interpreting the results remains the user’s responsibility. While we believe the current work constitutes a substantial advance, we point out several caveats: i) Differential or dose-response analysis is not part of PTMNavigator, and users must perform this before data upload. PTMNavigator only shows what its users already deemed significantly regulated. This is also a benefit, as it makes PTMNavigator flexible to many experimental settings. ii) The currently available canonical pathway diagrams are heterogeneous in structure, and, for PTM research, they may sometimes even be misleading. One example is the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation annotations in KEGG diagrams (“±p”). A phosphorylating connection from kinase A to protein B means that at least one site on B is a substrate of A, not necessarily (actually not likely) all of them. Still, for a user, the latter may seem implied. Furthermore, we could only retain those details of the pathway diagram that were also represented in the KGML or GPML files. Some of the pathways resemble drawings rather than formal diagrams, and the relationships between pathway members are not encoded as edges in the graph (consider, for example, the KEGG pathway “Nucleocytoplasmic transport – hsa03013” and the WikiPathways D. melanogaster pathway ‘Homologous recombination – WP1205’). In PTMNavigator, these pathways contain few or no edges and can only serve as a collection of functionally related proteins. iii) Pathway definitions are typically generalized from a large amount of heterogeneous data. Consequently, they cannot be specific for a particular tissue or cell type, and some proteins depicted in a pathway might not be expressed or active in the cells in which an experiment was performed. iv) A single node may represent a single gene or gene product. Still, it can also summarize a subfamily of proteins (such as MAPK) or even an entire class of proteins (such as all receptor tyrosine kinases). Conversely, a “group” node can represent a protein complex and a set of alternatives for a step in the pathway. Users of the pathway diagram need to be wary of these disparate definitions. v) The current knowledge of pathways is limited, and many relationships are not yet discovered. PTMNavigator can only show what is already known, and its use for discovering novel signaling cascades or nodes is necessarily limited. As a consequence, PTMNavigator will become more potent as pathway databases become more comprehensive in the future.

### Crowding in the emergency department: challenges and best practices for the care of children [^68027544]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric emergency department (ED) crowding—clinical pathways and patient experience—The use of clinical practice pathways is supported by CMS as a method that may improve not only efficiency but also quality of patient care, and the development of clinical pathways that address pediatric issues is especially important in general EDs, including pathways for triage and reassessment of pediatric patients alongside adult patients, to ensure that children receive appropriate prioritization of care. Financially incentivized pathways, including pay-for-performance pediatric-specific metrics, may have a positive effect on prioritizing the triage and reassessment of children, as well as ensuring standardized quality care for children, and efforts directed at patient-centered care, such as respectful behavior and explanation for wait times, can improve patient experience.

### Molecular pathways: extracting medical knowledge from high-throughput genomic data [^faec625d]. Clinical Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

High-throughput genomic data that measures RNA expression, DNA copy number, mutation status, and protein levels provide us with insights into the molecular pathway structure of cancer. Genomic lesions (amplifications, deletions, mutations) and epigenetic modifications disrupt biochemical cellular pathways. Although the number of possible lesions is vast, different genomic alterations may result in concordant expression and pathway activities, producing common tumor subtypes that share similar phenotypic outcomes. How can these data be translated into medical knowledge that provides prognostic and predictive information? First-generation mRNA expression signatures such as Genomic Health's Oncotype DX already provide prognostic information, but do not provide therapeutic guidance beyond the current standard of care, which is often inadequate in high-risk patients. Rather than building molecular signatures based on gene expression levels, evidence is growing that signatures based on higher-level quantities such as from genetic pathways may provide important prognostic and diagnostic cues. We provide examples of how activities for molecular entities can be predicted from pathway analysis and how the composite of all such activities, referred to here as the "activitome," helps connect genomic events to clinical factors to predict the drivers of poor outcome.

### Dissecting the perioperative care bundle [^9fa7dc47]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are comprehensive perioperative care pathways designed to mitigate the physiologic stressors associated with surgery and, in turn, improve clinical outcomes and lead to health care cost savings. Although individual components may differ, ERAS protocols are typically organized as multimodal care "bundles" that, when followed closely and in their entirety, are meant to generate amplified cumulative benefits. This manuscript examines some of the critical components, describes some areas where the science is weak (but dogma may be strong), and provides some of the evidence or lack thereof behind components of a standard ERAS protocol.

### Critical pathways for post-emergency outpatient diagnosis and treatment: tools to improve the value of emergency care [^1229a93d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The decision to admit a patient to the hospital after an emergency department (ED) visit is expensive, frequently not evidence-based, and variable. Outpatient critical pathways are a promising approach to reduce hospital admission after emergency care. Critical pathways exist to risk stratify patients for potentially serious diagnoses (e.g., acute myocardial infarction [AMI]) or evaluate response to therapy (e.g., community-acquired pneumonia) within a short time period (i.e., less than 36 hours), to determine if further hospital-based acute care is needed. Yet, such pathways are variably used while many patients are admitted for conditions for which they could be treated as outpatients. In this article, the authors propose a model of post-ED critical pathways, describe their role in emergency care, list common diagnoses that are amenable to critical pathways in the outpatient setting, and propose a research agenda to address barriers and solutions to increase the use of outpatient critical pathways. If emergency providers are to routinely conduct rapid evaluations in outpatient or observation settings, they must have several conditions at their disposal: 1) evidence-based tools to accurately risk stratify patients for protocolized care, 2) systems of care that reliably facilitate workup in the outpatient setting, and 3) a medical environment conducive to noninpatient pathways, with aligned risks and incentives among patients, providers, and payers. Increased use of critical pathways after emergency care is a potential way to improve the value of emergency care.

### Inequalities in health impact of alternative reimbursement pathways for nirsevimab in the United States [^36b4eb3c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Table 3 presents the distribution of use and health benefits by insurance coverage if nirsevimab were introduced in a cohort of infants in the United States under 2 alternative reimbursement pathways. The proportion of commercially insured infants receiving nirsevimab is higher whether nirsevimab is reimbursed through a pharmaceutical or a vaccine pathway compared with the proportion of publicly insured infants accessing nirsevimab. However, the difference between the publicly and the commercially insured groups’ use becomes smaller if nirsevimab were reimbursed through a vaccine pathway compared with the pharmaceutical pathway. Commercially insured infants benefit from more outpatient visits being averted, whereas publicly insured infants are estimated to benefit more from emergency department visits averted. Both groups benefit similarly from hospitalizations averted. These distributions are similar whether we model a pharmaceutical or a vaccine reimbursement pathway.

Table 3. 
Use of Nirsevimab and Health Benefit Distribution by Reimbursement Pathway and Insurance Coverage

When comparing the incremental use and incremental benefits due to an expansion in access (represented by the shift from a pharmaceutical to a vaccine reimbursement pathway), we observed an increase in access for all infants, with a higher increase for use (49% vs 21%) and benefit (44% vs 19%) among publicly insured infants as compared with commercially insured infants, respectively. The shares of the incremental use and the incremental benefits attributable to the shift from a pharmaceutical to a vaccine pathway are illustrated in the percentages in Table 3 (and in Supplementary Figure 1). Although there are fewer publicly insured live births, the shares in incremental use and incremental benefits (emergency visits and hospitalizations averted) are larger among publicly insured infants compared with those commercially insured infants. We also observed commercially insured infants receiving a larger share of those benefits as measured in outpatient visits averted.

We validated these disaggregated results by comparing the use and benefits with the estimates using the original inputs. The resulting aggregated results corresponded to an average of the results by subpopulation (Supplementary Table 4). The sensitivity analysis showed that although our results are robust to the assumptions, the main source of uncertainty is the assumptions of underlying burden distribution of RSV LRTI by health system level (Supplementary Table 6).

### Opportunities and challenges provided by crosstalk between signalling pathways in cancer [^643d5944]. Oncogene (2016). Low credibility.

During evolution, connections between the major signalling pathways were established to provide cells with an ability to deal with perturbations of homeostasis. However, these feedback and crosstalk mechanisms can become a liability in the treatment of cancer, as the inhibition of one cancer-relevant signalling pathway can lead to the activation of a secondary survival pathway that interferes with cancer drug efficacy. In this review, we discuss connections between signalling pathways in relation to cancer therapy and we evaluate the use of genetic approaches to identify pathway crosstalk. We also discuss how insight into connections between signalling pathways can be exploited to design powerful synthetic lethal drug combination therapies for the treatment of cancer.

### Rationally reduced libraries for combinatorial pathway optimization minimizing experimental effort [^b6622de3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Synthetic biology is the forward engineering of biological systems, a process in which well characterized, predefined parts are combined in a rational manner to create a desired behaviour or function. However, even well characterized parts can create unpredictable behaviour when introduced into new contexts, for instance when a recombinant pathway causes metabolic imbalances, thus leading to impaired growth and reduced product yields. A possible reason for this dilemma are regulatory mechanisms that ensure optimal balance of a pathway in its natural context but are absent or non-functional in the new host. In fact, recombinant pathways are frequently only poorly understood and important information is missing such as the specific activity of enzymes, intermediate toxicity and/or sinks and occurrence of branching points in the pathway, to name but a few. Consequently enzyme levels have to be optimized to improve the desired properties.
