## Question

A 52-year-old man underwent orthotopic liver transplantation 10 days ago for end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C. He is now presenting with sudden onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, mild fever, and a rising serum transaminase level. On examination, he is mildly jaundiced and has localized tenderness over the liver graft. The surgical team is concerned about a possible vascular complication involving the hepatic artery.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial imaging study to assess for hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis in this patient, and what further imaging may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and plan therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging test should be obtained first to evaluate suspected hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis after liver transplantation, and what confirmatory imaging should follow if the initial study is inconclusive or if intervention is planned. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why hepatic artery complications are urgent. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed first-line modality and its rationale. Next, I will review the key Doppler ultrasound criteria that raise suspicion. After that, I need to check what to do if ultrasound is equivocal, including the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography. Finally, I should confirm when catheter angiography is indicated for diagnosis and therapy, and synthesize a practical algorithm with timing considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes. At 10 days post-transplant, sudden RUQ pain, fever, rising transaminases, and jaundice with graft tenderness raise concern for hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, which are among the most common and devastating early complications and can rapidly lead to graft ischemia, biliary necrosis, and graft loss if not diagnosed and treated promptly [^ad89867b] [^434c4065].

> I should confirm the first-line imaging. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on Doppler ultrasound as the initial test to screen for hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis because it is noninvasive, avoids contrast, is widely available, and can detect flow abnormalities and the tardus-parvus pattern that suggest stenosis or absence of flow indicating thrombosis [^72a6ccb1] [^278601c1] [^49fd4352] [^bdb9caf6].

> Wait, let me verify the Doppler criteria that should trigger concern. Suspicious findings include absent arterial signal suggesting thrombosis, and for stenosis: peak systolic velocity greater than 200 cm/s at the anastomosis, resistive index less than 0.5 in the poststenotic segment, and a parvus et tardus waveform with prolonged acceleration time, which together indicate hemodynamically significant narrowing and downstream ischemia [^bdb9caf6] [^65ae79fd] [^91c5fe4e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if the ultrasound is technically limited or equivocal. I need to check the next steps. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can rescue non-diagnostic Doppler by improving detection of low-velocity flow and has shown high accuracy for HAT and stenosis in the immediate postoperative window, potentially averting unnecessary catheter angiography when flow is clearly demonstrated or absent [^6e07e5b9] [^6d0fd6dd] [^bdb9caf6].

> Next, I should review cross-sectional imaging when ultrasound is non-diagnostic or when detailed vascular mapping is needed. CT angiography is generally preferred for its speed, availability, and high spatial resolution for arterial patency and stenosis quantification, while MR angiography is a reasonable alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated or radiation avoidance is prioritized, though availability and motion artifacts can limit utility in the early postoperative period [^49fd4352] [^781ff4f6] [^8c0a9db9].

> I will now examine when to proceed to catheter angiography. If noninvasive imaging confirms HAT or a high-grade stenosis, or if clinical suspicion remains high despite negative or equivivalent ultrasound, diagnostic and therapeutic angiography is indicated to confirm the lesion and enable endovascular therapy such as thrombolysis, angioplasty, or stenting, with surgical options reserved for failure or unsuitable anatomy, and early HAT may warrant urgent surgical or endovascular revascularization to salvage the graft [^72a6ccb1] [^278601c1] [^64b808b3] [^781ff4f6].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound shows a tardus-parvus pattern without a clear stenosis on color Doppler? I should double-check whether microbubble contrast can localize a focal stenosis. Microbubble-enhanced Doppler can identify the culprit lesion and guide targeted angiography, though some data suggest that even with a tardus-parvus waveform, angiography may still be necessary to define anatomy and plan intervention, so I need to balance the added value of CEUS against the potential delay if definitive therapy is urgently needed [^a43089e9] [^6d0fd6dd].

> Let me synthesize the algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Immediately obtain Doppler ultrasound of the hepatic artery and intrahepatic branches. If ultrasound is diagnostic for HAT or high-grade stenosis, proceed to angiography for confirmation and intervention. If ultrasound is equivocal or nondiagnostic, use contrast-enhanced ultrasound to clarify flow, and if still indeterminate or if detailed mapping is required, obtain CT angiography or MR angiography, followed by catheter angiography for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning when indicated [^72a6ccb1] [^49fd4352] [^781ff4f6] [^6e07e5b9].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line. The most appropriate initial imaging study is Doppler ultrasound, and if ultrasound is inconclusive or if intervention is anticipated, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, CT angiography, or MR angiography should be used to characterize the lesion, with catheter angiography reserved for confirmation and endovascular therapy when a stenosis or thrombosis is confirmed or strongly suspected despite noninvasive studies [^72a6ccb1] [^49fd4352] [^781ff4f6].

---

The most appropriate initial imaging study for suspected hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis after liver transplantation is **Doppler ultrasound** [^72a6ccb1] because it is noninvasive, widely available, and can rapidly detect arterial flow abnormalities [^49fd4352]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or shows suspicious findings, **CT angiography (CTA)** is the next best test to confirm the diagnosis and define anatomy for intervention planning [^ad89867b] [^8c0a9db9]. Catheter angiography is reserved for cases requiring definitive diagnosis or endovascular treatment [^278601c1] [^64b808b3].

---

## Initial imaging modality: Doppler ultrasound

Doppler ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** for evaluating suspected hepatic artery complications after liver transplantation [^72a6ccb1] [^49fd4352]. It is noninvasive, does not require contrast agents, and can be performed rapidly at the bedside, making it ideal for early postoperative assessment [^49fd4352]. Doppler ultrasound evaluates hepatic artery patency, flow velocity, and waveform characteristics, allowing detection of thrombosis or stenosis [^bdb9caf6].

Key Doppler findings suggestive of hepatic artery thrombosis include:

- Absence of arterial flow signal in the hepatic artery [^49001369].
- No detectable flow in the intrahepatic arterial branches [^49001369].

Key Doppler findings suggestive of hepatic artery stenosis include:

- Elevated peak systolic velocity (> 200 cm/s) at the anastomotic site [^bdb9caf6] [^91c5fe4e].
- Tardus-parvus waveform in the intrahepatic arteries (delayed systolic acceleration and diminished amplitude) [^bdb9caf6] [^a43089e9].
- Resistive index < 0.5 in the post-stenotic segment [^bdb9caf6] [^91c5fe4e].

Despite its advantages, Doppler ultrasound has limitations, including operator dependence, poor acoustic windows, and potential false positives or negatives, particularly in the immediate postoperative period [^8c0a9db9] [^66acbc8f]. Therefore, **confirmatory imaging may be necessary** if ultrasound findings are inconclusive or clinical suspicion remains high [^ad89867b].

---

## Secondary imaging modality: CT angiography (CTA)

CT angiography (CTA) is the **preferred secondary imaging modality** when Doppler ultrasound is inconclusive or shows suspicious findings [^ad89867b]. CTA provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the hepatic artery, allowing accurate assessment of patency, degree of stenosis, and identification of collateral vessels [^8c0a9db9]. It is particularly useful for:

- Confirming the presence and extent of hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis [^49001369].
- Evaluating the hepatic artery anatomy, including the anastomotic site and any kinks or twists [^8c0a9db9].
- Assessing parenchymal perfusion defects and biliary complications associated with hepatic artery compromise [^434c4065].

CTA is noninvasive, widely available, and can be performed rapidly, making it suitable for urgent evaluation in the early postoperative period [^ad89867b]. However, it requires iodinated contrast, which may be contraindicated in patients with renal impairment or contrast allergies [^notfound].

---

## Tertiary imaging modality: catheter angiography

Catheter angiography remains the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning in cases of confirmed or strongly suspected hepatic artery complications [^278601c1]. It provides real-time, high-resolution images of the hepatic artery and allows simultaneous endovascular interventions, such as thrombolysis, angioplasty, or stent placement [^64b808b3]. Indications for catheter angiography include:

- Confirmation of diagnosis when noninvasive imaging is inconclusive or conflicting [^278601c1].
- Planning for endovascular intervention (angioplasty, stenting, thrombolysis) [^64b808b3].
- Evaluation of complex vascular anatomy or multiple stenoses [^66acbc8f].

Catheter angiography is invasive and carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and contrast-related complications; therefore, it is typically reserved for cases where intervention is anticipated or noninvasive imaging is inconclusive [^notfound].

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Early detection of hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis is critical because these complications can lead to graft ischemia, biliary strictures, and graft loss if not promptly treated [^434c4065]. Management strategies include:

- **Immediate anticoagulation**: Initiate anticoagulation therapy if thrombosis is detected [^64b808b3].
- **Endovascular intervention**: Angioplasty, stenting, or thrombolysis may be required to restore arterial flow [^64b808b3].
- **Surgical intervention**: In cases of extensive thrombosis or failed endovascular therapy, surgical revascularization or retransplantation may be necessary [^64b808b3].

---

Doppler ultrasound is the **initial imaging modality** of choice for suspected hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis after liver transplantation, with CTA as the secondary modality if ultrasound is inconclusive. Catheter angiography is reserved for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning. Early and accurate imaging is essential for timely intervention and graft preservation [^72a6ccb1].

Other than rejection, hepatic artery and portal vein thrombosis are the most common complications in the immediate postoperative period with hepatic arterial thrombosis more common and more devastating. Hepatic artery stenosis is more common 1 month after transplantation, whereas portal and hepatic vein stenosis is more often seen as a late complication. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging examination to diagnose vascular complications with contrast-enhanced CT useful if ultrasound findings are equivocal. MR cholangiography is often most helpful in diagnosing bile leaks, biliary strictures, and biliary stones.

AASLD/AST guideline — vascular complications after liver transplantation (Question 5) states that in adult liver transplant recipients, hepatic artery or portal vein stenosis or thrombosis should be managed in a timely fashion to prevent graft loss, which is particularly urgent in the setting of hepatic artery involvement. Surgical or percutaneous endovascular intervention and anticoagulation should be considered for cases detected in the immediate post-operative period, while percutaneous endovascular interventions and/or anticoagulation should be considered for diagnoses made later (Strong, Level 4). In adult liver transplant recipients, timely retransplantation should be considered when vascular complications result in severe allograft injury or allograft failure (Strong, Level 2).

### Multimodality imaging after liver transplant: top 10 important complications [^434c4065]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who have undergone liver transplant are now regularly seen in day-to-day radiology practice. All surgical techniques for liver transplant require arterial, portal venous, hepatic venous and caval, and biliary anastomoses. This review is focused on the 10 "not to be missed" complications of liver transplant that affect the health and life of the graft and graft recipient. Arterial complications are the most common and devastating. Early hepatic artery thrombosis may be catastrophic because the biliary tree is solely dependent on the hepatic artery after transplant and collateral vessels have not yet formed. In contrast, delayed hepatic artery thrombosis may be more insidious as collateral arteries develop. US findings of delayed hepatic artery thrombosis may be similar to those of hepatic artery stenosis and celiac artery stenosis. Splenic artery steal syndrome is an increasingly recognized cause of graft ischemia. Venous complications are much less common. Hepatic venous and caval complications are notable for their increased incidence in living-donor and pediatric transplants. Biliary complications often result from arterial ischemia. Biliary cast syndrome is a notable example in which ischemic biliary mucosa sloughs into and obstructs the duct lumens. Neoplasms also may occur within the hepatic graft and may be due to recurrent malignancy, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or metastases. US is the initial imaging modality of choice, particularly in the acute postoperative setting. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced US, CT, or MRI; catheter angiography; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; and/or nuclear medicine studies is performed as needed.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^781ff4f6]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation (LT) — vascular imaging and management of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and portal vein thrombosis are outlined as follows: Most centers obtain at least one doppler ultrasound within the first five days after LT, and contrast-enhanced CT angiography or venography provides more detail when doppler ultrasound is inconclusive; MR imaging (MRI) can be used as an alternative test when there is a contraindication to contrast-enhanced CT scan. Early HAT within five days of LT is usually corrected surgically or endovascularly, with anticoagulation, and endovascular management can confer some risk of hepatic artery injury and rupture in the very early post-operative period but can be the first line therapy when the patient's condition precludes surgery; when early HAT leads to progressive liver failure, urgent retransplantation (re-LT) is needed to avoid a high mortality risk. If HAT is identified within seven days of LT, patients are prioritized as status 1 on the transplant waitlist. Late onset HAT can be addressed with percutaneous interventions and/or anticoagulation alone, but gradual cases may develop adequate collateralization allowing graft survival without intervention, although ischemic cholangiopathy that may require re-LT may still develop. Early portal vein thrombosis or stenosis can be addressed surgically or endovascularly with anticoagulation, whereas later cases are managed endovascularly with or without anticoagulation, or with anticoagulation alone, and the choice of intervention is mainly driven by center practice and the condition of the patient.

Biliary tract strictures and leaks are the second most common complications following orthotopic liver transplantation. Nonanastomotic bile duct complications are most often caused by hepatic artery thrombosis and can result in fulminant hepatic necrosis, bile duct strictures, and bile duct leaks that increase the risk of cholangitis, sepsis, and abscess. The emergency physician and radiologist should strongly suspect biliary disease in a post-transplant patient presenting with elevated liver function tests, jaundice, fever, and/or abdominal pain in order to achieve diagnosis and treatment rapidly. We present the case of a liver transplant patient who developed bile duct necrosis and hepatic infarction secondary to hepatic artery thrombosis 5 months after surgery. In addition, we discuss a new contrast-enhanced MR cholangiographic technique that has the potential to be performed in the emergency setting as the only diagnostic test prior to appropriate therapy.

### Complications of liver transplantation: multimodality imaging approach [^1b3a5c85]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation is currently an accepted first-line treatment for patients with end-stage acute or chronic liver disease, but postoperative complications may limit the long-term success of transplantation. The most common and most clinically significant complications are arterial and venous thrombosis and stenosis, biliary disorders, fluid collections, neoplasms, and graft rejection. Early diagnosis is crucial to the successful management of all these complications, and imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of all but graft rejection. A multimodality approach including ultrasonography and cross-sectional imaging studies often is most effective for diagnosis. Each imaging modality has specific strengths and weaknesses, and the diagnostic usefulness of a modality depends mainly on the patient's characteristics, the clinical purpose of the imaging evaluation, and the expertise of imaging professionals.

An important consideration

It is important to remember that, in the first 3 days after liver transplantation, an increased resistance index of the hepatic artery (greater than 0.8) is found in approximately 50% of the patients.

If found, it should be monitored until it has normalised, typically in the fourth day after the transplantation.

Although the severity of the described findings correlates with the degree of the stenosis, ultrasound does not allow proper quantification of this: the technique of choice is CT angiography. In addition, CT allows proper evaluation of patients with a poor sonographic window. Multiplanar and three-dimensional curved reformatting are useful to measure the vessel lumen.

MRI angiography is a limited technique because of a relatively high false-positive rate.

Hepatic artery stenosis requires early treatment. First, an angiography and an angioplasty should be made. If this procedure fails, surgery is required. Once again, retransplantation has a better outcome, but is preferred as a second-line treatment, to use when endovascular therapy does not work.

### Role of imaging in the evaluation of vascular complications after liver transplantation [^db70e01a]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of liver transplantation complications can be subtle and non-specific. Medical imaging, mainly Doppler ultrasound, plays an important role to detect and grade these. Colour Doppler ultrasound exams are routinely performed at 24-48h, on the 7th day, the first and third month after transplantation. MDCT and MR images are acquired based on the Doppler ultrasound (DUS) findings, even in the absence of abnormal liver function. As vascular complications appear early after surgery, DUS should be performed by experience personnel. Diagnostic angiography is seldom performed. This pictorial review illustrates the key imaging findings of vascular complications in patients with liver transplantation: hepatic artery complications (such as thrombosis, stenosis of the anastomosis and pseudoaneurysms), portal vein abnormalities (such as occlusion and stenosis) and hepatic veins and/or inferior vena cava flow changes (Budd-Chiari syndrome).

AASLD/AST guideline — diagnosis of vascular complications after liver transplantation emphasizes that the diagnosis of vascular complications after liver transplantation (LT) is based on radiologic imaging such as doppler ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography or venography, or catheter angiography. Doppler ultrasound is widely used as a screening tool to assess liver graft vasculature in the immediate post-operative period, due to its non-invasive nature, lack of contrast exposure, accessibility and lower cost. Most cases of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) are detected within five days after LT.

Introduction

Vascular complications rank among the most common and severe causes of liver graft dysfunction. Among these, hepatic arterial complications involving the anastomosis are the most frequent causes of vascular compromise given the potential for stenosis, thrombosis or pseudoaneurysm formation. This paper focuses on hepatic artery stenosis (HAS), a pathologic entity usually diagnosed within 3–4 months of adult liver transplantation, with a reported incidence ranging from 3.5–9.3%. Common causes of HAS include structural (abnormal kinking/angulation, donor-recipient arterial size mismatch), vascular (clamp injury, vaso-vasorum disruption) and immunologic (fibrosis, intimal hyperplasia) complications. Typically, HAS is first detected on noninvasive imaging studies such as spectral Doppler ultrasound (US) or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Although easily identifiable, the management of HAS is not straightforward. If left untreated, HAS may cause insidious graft dysfunction or graft death owing to the high incidence of thrombosis. Treatment options are broad and multifaceted, including anticoagulation, endovascular intervention, surgical revascularization, and re-transplantation.

The current treatment paradigm leans towards conservative management, with intervention pursued only in clinically significant cases (i.e. transaminitis). Historically, the treatment involved surgical revision with unfavorable outcomes; thus, there has been a recent and sharp turn favoring an endovascular approach. Endovascular interventions include direct hepatic artery angioplasty and/or stent placement, with prior studies demonstrating improved arterial flow on post-procedural ultrasound and significant reductions in elevated liver enzymes. However, direct hepatic artery interventions have high re-intervention rates and may lead to major complications. There is increasing literature involving non-hepatic visceral artery embolization (commonly splenic artery embolization) in the post-liver transplant population for indications such as nonocclusive arterial hypoperfusion syndrome (i.e. 'splenic artery steal'), portal hyperperfusion and refractory ascites.

Steno-occlusive disease (arterial obstructive disease) of the transplant hepatic artery is a collective term that can be used to include hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, and hepatic arterial kinks. The latter 2 can be referred to collectively as arterial anatomical defects. This chapter details the angiographic techniques and definitions required to make an accurate angiographic diagnosis of these arterial transplant complications. In addition, the chapter focuses on detailed technical aspects of the endoluminal management of these arterial complications. The chapter discusses the role and technical results of endoluminal management of these arterial complications and, when possible, the lesion morphologies most amenable to endoluminal management.

Results

The initial search produced 72 procedures, of which 48 interventions met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Procedures that met the exclusion criteria included intra-procedural findings of thrombosis (7) or pseudoaneurysm (3), auto-immune rejection (1), conservative management (3), or patients who underwent repeat intervention in different treatment arms within the 1-year post-procedural period (10). The HAI treatment arm included 21 procedures in 18 patients and the EHAI treatment arm included 27 procedures in 22 patients. Most EHAI's involved splenic artery embolization. Out of the 21 HAI's, six involved angioplasty (of which two had concomitant EHAI) while fifteen involved angioplasty and stenting (of which four had concomitant EHAI).

### Imaging of the transplant liver [^8bfd2599]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

As the number of patients with liver transplants continues to increase, radiologists need to be aware of the normal post-operative appearance of the different liver transplants currently performed along with the wide variety of complications encountered. The complications commonly affect the biliar and vascular systems and can include anastomotic bile leakage and biliary stenosis along with stenosis or obstruction of the hepatic artery, portal or hepatic veins and IVC. Other complications include parenchymal abnormalities such as hepatic infarction, organ rejection, localized collections and post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. This article reviews and illustrates the role of imaging for pediatric transplantation including the role of interventional radiology.

### Review of imaging findings in hepatic veno-occlusive disease [^87811bfd]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), is a potentially life-threatening complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients present with right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, jaundice, weight gain, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Early diagnosis of VOD is essential to promptly initiate defibrotide therapy, which has been demonstrated to enhance survival and achieve complete resolution of disease in some patients. Historically, VOD was diagnosed by the modified Seattle or Baltimore criteria, which are both based on clinical symptoms. Alongside advancements in medical imaging over the last 40 years, the diagnosis of VOD has evolved to include the use of ultrasound, elastography, cross-sectional imaging, and image guided biopsy. Identification and interpretation of findings of VOD across imaging modalities is now a critical aspect of post-HSCT care. This review will outline the imaging findings and recommendations for the use of imaging in the management of VOD including gray-scale, color and spectral Doppler ultrasound, ultrasound elastography, CT, MRI, and liver biopsy.

### Postoperative imaging in liver transplantation: what radiologists should know [^fa009808]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Liver transplantation is now frequently used in the treatment of end-stage liver disease. Therefore, it is important that radiologists be aware of common anastomotic techniques and expected postoperative imaging findings. Imaging is most useful in evaluating for posttransplantation complications, which are broadly classified into vascular, biliary, and other complications. Hepatic artery thrombosis is the most significant complication and is often associated with graft failure. Radiologists have multiple modalities at their disposal for optimal evaluation. Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the preliminary imaging modality for gross evaluation of the liver parenchyma, biliary tree, and vasculature for abnormalities. When US findings are indeterminate or there is persistent clinical suspicion for an abnormality, computed tomography (CT) is often performed. The major indications for CT are detection of bile leak, hemorrhage, and abscess, but CT is also useful in the assessment of the vasculature. T-tube cholangiography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are the best noninvasive imaging tools for evaluating for biliary stricture. Some investigators would argue that endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a better diagnostic imaging modality; however, ERCP is invasive. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is optimal for the evaluation of biliary leakage. Early detection of posttransplantation complications will help lower morbidity rates and will likely allow graft salvage in selected cases.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^091fbc3a]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Vascular complications after liver transplantation — hepatic artery thrombosis lists risk factors including hepatic artery dissection, splenic artery steal syndrome, decreased luminal diameter, variant anatomy requiring back-table reconstruction, and graft injury due to ischemic reperfusion injury; presentation includes elevated liver enzymes, graft dysfunction, and bile leak; diagnosis uses Doppler ultrasound, CTA, MRA, and angiography. Treatment is described as Early: Surgical thrombectomy and revascularization with anticoagulation, re-LT and Late: IR thrombolysis, possible stenting and/or anticoagulation, re-LT. Long-term sequelae include biliary complications (bile leak, biliary stricture, ischemic cholangiopathy) and graft loss requiring re-LT.

### Doppler ultrasound findings in the hepatic artery shortly after liver transplantation [^1de44341]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the Doppler waveform findings in the hepatic artery in the early posttransplantation period, both in the absence and presence of arterial complications.

Conclusion

The presence of transient high-resistance Doppler waveforms in normal hepatic arteries is a common finding after grafting. Hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis, and arterial steal syndromes can be diagnosed by Doppler in the early liver transplantation period.

### Complications of orthotopic liver transplantation: spectrum of findings with helical CT [^91e810d0]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Orthotopic liver transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage nonmalignant liver disease. The surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapy for this procedure have improved considerably. Nevertheless, there are still significant complications, particularly those of vascular origin, which can lead to graft failure and require retransplantation unless prompt treatment is instituted. These complications include arterial and venous thrombosis and stenosis; arterial pseudoaneurysm; biliary leakage, stricture, and obstruction; liver ischemia, infarction, and abscess; fluid collections and hematomas; lymphoproliferative disorders; recurrent tumors; hepatitis C virus infection; and splenic infarction. Since the clinical presentation of posttransplantation complications is frequently nonspecific and varies widely, imaging studies are critical for early diagnosis. Helical computed tomography (CT) is a valuable complement to ultrasonography (US) in the postoperative period and is a safe, accurate, and noninvasive method of demonstrating hepatic vessels (hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic veins, and inferior vena cava) and evaluating nonvascular complications (in the hepatic parenchyma and bile duct abnormalities) and extrahepatic tissues. Knowledge and early recognition of these complications is essential for graft salvage, and CT can provide valuable information, particularly for patients with indeterminate US results or in whom US examination is difficult.

### Imaging post liver transplantation part I: vascular complications [^3323222e]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation continues to rise in frequency, with over 1,000 procedures performed in the UK in 2018. Complications are increasingly uncommon but when they occur, early recognition and intervention is vital to save grafts. Imaging after the perioperative period is often performed at patients' local hospitals meaning that all radiologists and sonographers need to have an understanding of how to assess a transplant liver. Part I of this series will focus on vascular complications, including the normal postoperative vascular anatomy following liver transplantation, normal post-transplantation vascular imaging findings and abnormal findings that may prompt further investigation. Vascular complications following liver transplantation will be illustrated using a collection of cases.

### Liver transplantation for acute intermittent porphyria is complicated by a high rate of hepatic artery thrombosis [^4ef5641a]. Liver Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Complications

Two patients required further surgery for early hemorrhaging, and 1 patient experienced a biliary leak at 36 days. HAT occurred in 4 patients. In 1 patient, this necessitated retransplantation 13 days after the original procedure; in the other 3 patients, HAT occurred 1, 8, or 9 months after transplantation. HAT was detected in the first patient on day 3 by an ultrasound scan performed for impaired liver function; the scan failed to show a donor hepatic artery. This was subsequently confirmed by an angiogram, which demonstrated an occlusion of the hepatic artery from just distal to the origin. This patient had received a right split liver graft; a small hepatic artery from the donor's superior mesenteric artery was noted perioperatively. Ultrasound and Doppler scans, which were repeated 1, 10, and 31 days after retransplantation, confirmed that the vessels remained patent. The second patient with HAT presented with fever, abnormal liver function, and abdominal pain 1 month after transplantation. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated donor HAT with central ischemic changes in the liver. Subsequent ultrasound scans and a repeat CT scan confirmed these findings and revealed thrombosis of the hepatic artery 1 cm from its origin, some small collaterals at the porta hepatis, and bilomas in both liver lobes. At the time of this writing, the patient was awaiting retransplantation. The patient whose HAT was detected at 9 months also had a split liver graft and initially presented with jaundice. Initial imaging studies revealed a biliary stricture, and a subsequent CT scan suggested that this was secondary to HAT with collateralization. An angiogram demonstrated an occlusion of the common hepatic artery from its origin with several collaterals supplying the liver. Although this patient was initially relisted for retransplantation, subsequent clinical improvement and the normalization of liver function tests led to the patient's removal from the waiting list. Similarly, the patient who developed HAT at 8 months also developed good collateral circulation associated with normal liver function and thus did not require retransplantation. The presence of collaterals at the time of the HAT diagnosis in these 2 patients suggests that this complication may have occurred at an earlier time point but was undetected. Routine ultrasound scans are not usually performed for patients after transplantation in the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver function. However, these findings suggest that early and late posttransplant ultrasound scans should be considered in this group of patients to exclude asymptomatic HAT. Notably, the patient whose HAT was detected at 9 months had been taking both aspirin and fixed-dose warfarin since transplantation because of the nature of the hepatic arterial anastomosis, although the international normalized ratio was not in the therapeutic range. The 2 patients with early HAT detection took neither of these agents. None of the 3 HAT patients for whom perioperative details were available received any intraoperative transfusions of blood, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets.

### Diagnosis and management of post-liver transplant biliary obstruction: 1, 300 patient single-center experience [^6db322a9]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biliary tract obstruction (BTO) is a common complication following liver transplantation (LT) with high potential for morbidity. A comprehensive assessment of post-LT BTO, including patient and intraoperative characteristics predictive of postoperative obstruction, remains lacking.

Study Design

A prospectively collected database of all LTs performed at a single-center institution from 2014–2022 was analyzed. Diagnostic methods utilized in the evaluation of post-LT biliary obstruction were correlated with clinical data to identify high-yield diagnostic modalities. Subsequently, management strategies were analyzed to identify therapeutic approaches associated with optimal patient outcomes.

Results

Of 1,302 primary LT recipients, 137 (10.5%) experienced a post-transplant biliary obstruction event. Median time to post-LT BTO was 150 (68–275) days. 119 obstruction events (86.9%) were attributable to anastomotic strictures, 11 (8.03%) to ischemic cholangiopathy, and 7 (5.1%) to T-tube or stent obstruction. On receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) demonstrated superior predictive power (AUC 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.91) in the detection of post-LT BTO as compared to total bilirubin (AUC 0.64, 95% CI 0.50–0.78) and alkaline phosphatase (AUC 0.57, 95% CI 0.41–0.72). History of coronary artery disease (OR 4.26, p = 0.03) and postoperative hepatic artery thrombosis (OR 6.01, p = 0.001) independently predicted stricture recurrence following an attempted stent-free trial.

Conclusion

Obstruction of the biliary ductal system remains a common complication post-LT, with most cases occurring within one year of transplant. GGT demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity in the detection of post-LT BTO and may be of significant diagnostic utility. Following an initial stent-free trial, several key risk factors may identify patients who merit additional monitoring for stricture recurrence.

### Role of imaging in the management of splenic artery steal syndrome [^4e7d61f2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to discuss the etiology and role of imaging in the management of splenic artery steal syndrome (SASS) following orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT).

Methods

Hepatic arterial thrombosis and stenosis have been the most commonly recognized arterial complications following OLT. Splenic artery steal syndrome is a recently described entity in the transplant literature and thought to be an under-recognized cause of graft ischemia. It is characterized by hepatic arterial hypoperfusion accompanied by splenic arterial and portal venous hyperperfusion and leads to various vascular and biliary graft complications. Because the clinical manifestations of SASS are so non-specific, imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of this condition.

Results

This article discusses the role of imaging in the management of this potentially reversible cause of graft ischemia.

Conclusions

Awareness of the imaging features and having a high index of suspicion are essential for the early diagnosis and prompt management of this condition.

### Hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation: evaluation of different endovascular treatment approaches [^471d9a65]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included all orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant recipients at our institution, from September 1, 2012, to September 1, 2021, who underwent hepatic artery angiography for suspected HAS presenting with transaminitis. The radiology database (Montage; Nuance, Burlington MA) was searched for visceral angiography reports including "hepatic artery stenosis", and such reports were cross-referenced for prior liver transplantation. All reports were manually checked for eligibility. Patients who underwent endovascular interventions within 1-year of transplantation with hepatic artery stenosis confirmed on conventional angiography and/or contrast enhanced cross-sectional imaging were included. The exclusion criteria were findings different from, or in addition to, HAS, including hepatic artery thrombosis or concomitant pseudoaneurysm, significant cellular rejection on biopsy, or the presence of an aorto-hepatic jump graft. Patients with imaging characteristics of splenic artery steal phenomenon on US Doppler, such as low or absent diastolic flow in the main hepatic artery, were excluded. Patients who underwent a repeat intervention involving the opposite treatment arm within 1-year of the first intervention (i.e. 'crossed over' interventions) were also excluded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB-2021–662 and IRB-2022–939) and was compliant with the standards set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

### Tricky findings in liver transplant imaging: a review of pitfalls with solutions [^9c26da65]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Orthotopic liver transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage liver disease. Imaging plays an important role in the follow-up of transplant recipients by identifying a variety of complications. Posttransplant liver imaging can be challenging with altered vascular and nonvascular postoperative findings closely mimicking pathologies. A thorough knowledge of these common imaging findings in a posttransplant liver is essential for the radiologist to avoid erroneous diagnoses and unnecessary workup. We focus on such imaging findings and provide tips to avoid misinterpretation.

### Transplant hepatic artery complications [^4c6deaff]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatic artery complications can be divided into 2 different categories, nonocclusive and steno-occlusive disease. Steno-occlusive disease is a collective term that encompasses hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, and hepatic arterial kinks, while nonocclusive arterial disease encompasses less than 5% of complications and is a collective term used to describe arteriovenous fistulae, pseudoaneurysms, arterial rupture and nonocclusive hepatic artery hypoperfusion syndrome. This article details the angiographic techniques and definitions needed to accurately diagnose arterial transplant complications and describes the technical aspects and results of endoluminal management of these arterial complications. In addition, this article discusses the presentation, etiology and indications for treatment, including surgical management of these various complications.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^1602f3e1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) — We recommend Doppler US as the initial diagnostic test for evaluation for BCS, and contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be obtained to assess thrombus extension, rule out tumor thrombus, determine response to anticoagulation therapy, evaluate indeterminate hepatic nodules, and when there is high clinical suspicion of BCS despite negative or inconclusive Doppler US. Management is stepwise from least to most invasive, with systemic anticoagulation as the initial treatment of choice; if medical therapy fails, endovascular therapies such as angioplasty or TIPS are recommended, and LT is reserved for TIPS failure and BCS presenting as fulminant liver failure. For surveillance, we suggest surveillance for HCC with abdominal ultrasound and serum AFP levels every 6 mo in patients with chronic BCS, and patients are best referred to centers of expertise for diagnosis.

Fig. 6
Hepatic artery stenosis leading to splenic artery steal syndrome. Postsurgical US shows a turbulent flow of the hepatic vein. The hepatic artery cannot be clearly identified (a). An arterial phase CT is performed, showing severe focal stenosis of the hepatic artery and filiform enhancement of its branches (b, c). The increased size of the splenic artery should also be noted. Increased splenic artery blood flow explains the increased turbulent portal flow. Angiography confirms both stenosis of the hepatic artery and the increased size of the splenic artery (d, e). Distal embolisation of the splenic artery was performed as a treatment

Stenosis may progress to thrombosis. So, stenosis and thrombosis are two entities of the same spectrum of vascular complications of liver transplantation.

Stenosis can lead to splenic steal artery syndrome.

It usually occurs in the first 3 months (median time to diagnosis 90 to 120 days), but this time shows differences between patients, describing cases that happen even several years after surgery.

Doppler ultrasound is the most useful technique to show this complication, as explained for thrombosis.

It shows a characteristic pattern, depending on the segment studied and its relationship with stenosis. Power Doppler is also useful to quantify blood flow and study spectral curves.
Prestenotic segment shows elevation of resistance index (more than 0.8) and low flow.
Stenotic segment displays a very high flow rate and aliasing artefact, due to the turbulent flow. Blood systolic peak is more than 200 cm/s.
Poststenotic segment presents a low resistance index (less than 0.5) and a parvus et tardus morphology of the spectral curves with long systolic acceleration time (more than 0.08 s). It has also a turbulent flow.

### Endovascular treatment of hepatic artery stenosis after liver transplantation [^e1b2f051]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after orthotopic liver transplantation is a significant risk factor for subsequent hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). HAT is associated with a 30%-50% risk of liver failure culminating in retransplantation or death. Traditional treatment of hepatic artery complications has been surgical, with hepatic artery revision or retransplantation. Endovascular therapy of HAS, described primarily in the interventional radiology literature, may provide a less-invasive treatment option.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of all endovascular interventions performed for HAS after orthotopic liver transplantation over a 31-month period (August 2009 to January 2012). Patients with duplex ultrasound imaging evidence of severe main HAS (peak systolic velocity of > 400 cm/s, resistive index of < .5) underwent endovascular treatment with either primary stent placement or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone. Patients were followed with serial ultrasound imaging to assess for treatment success and late restenosis. Reintervention was performed if significant restenosis occurred.

Results

Thirty-five hepatic artery interventions were performed in 23 patients. Over the 31-month study period, 318 orthotopic liver transplantations were performed, yielding a 7.4% (23/318) rate of hepatic artery intervention. Primary technical success was achieved in 97% (34/35) of cases. Initial treatment was with PTA alone (n = 10) or primary stent placement (n = 13). The initial postintervention ultrasound images revealed improvements in hepatic artery peak systolic velocity (267 ± 118 [posttreatment] vs 489.9 ± 155 cm/s [pretreatment]; P < .0001) and main hepatic artery resistive index (0.61 ± 0.08 [posttreatment] vs 0.41 ± 0.07 [pretreatment]; P < .0001). At a mean follow-up of 8.2 ± 1.8 months (range, 0–29), there were 12 reinterventions in 10 patients for recurrent HAS. Thirty-one percent (n = 4/13) of patients undergoing initial stent placement required reintervention (at 236 ± 124 days of follow-up) compared with 60% (n = 6/10) of patients undergoing initial PTA (at 62.5 ± 44 days of follow-up). Primary patency rates (Kaplan-Meier) after primary stent placement were 92%, 85%, and 69% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively, compared with 70%, 60%, and 50% after PTA (P = 0.17). Primary-assisted patency for the entire cohort was 97% at 6 and 12 months. Major complications were one arterial rupture managed endovascularly and one artery dissection that precipitated HAT and required retransplantation. The overall rate of HAT in the entire cohort was 4.3% (1/23).

Conclusions

Endovascular treatment of HAS can be performed with high technical success, excellent primary-assisted patency, and acceptable morbidity. Initial use of a stent may improve primary patency when compared with PTA. The need for reintervention is common, placing particular importance on aggressive surveillance. Longer follow-up and a larger cohort are needed to confirm these encouraging early results.

### Hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation: evaluation of different endovascular treatment approaches [^c10587c8]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Demographic data included sex, age, time of transplantation, and time of intervention. Pre-procedural clinical data included hemoglobin, creatinine, International Normalized Ratio (INR), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). Spectral Doppler ultrasound measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistive index (RI) of the hepatic artery at the porta hepatis were collected within a 48-h period immediately prior to and following intervention. The degree of hepatic artery stenosis was quantified, retrospectively, using catheter angiography images to measure luminal diameter at the stenosis compared to a segment of non-affected distal hepatic artery. Major biliary ischemic events and 1-year liver-related survival outcomes were collected. A major biliary ischemic event was counted when intervention for sequelae of biliary tract ischemia, such as percutaneous biliary drainage, was required. Peri-procedural complications were compiled and categorized based on minor and major complications according to the Society of Interventional Radiology Clinical Practice Guidelines. Post-procedural clinical data included the highest ALT and AST values at intervals of 1–7 days, 8–14 days, 15–21 days, and 22–28 days following intervention.

Definitions and criteria

Clinically significant hepatic artery stenosis requiring intervention was defined as a triad including: (1) transaminitis, (2) suspicion of stenosis on US Doppler and (3) stenosis confirmed with catheter angiography and/or contrast enhanced cross-sectional imaging.

Imaging characteristics on US Doppler suspicious of HAS included decrease in peak systolic velocity, decrease in RI and 'parvus-tardus' waveform of the distal hepatic artery, assessed at the porta hepatis. Direct hepatic artery intervention (HAI) was defined as hepatic artery angioplasty with or without stent placement. Indirect extra-hepatic arterial intervention (EHAI) was defined as embolization of a visceral artery originating from the celiac axis, excluding the hepatic artery.

### Viral hepatitis Basics… [^16b75d27]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Viral hepatitis is a disease of the liver caused by a virus.
- Untreated, viral hepatitis can lead to serious liver problems, like scarring or cancer.
- Even if you don't have any symptoms, you can spread viral hepatitis.
- Getting tested is the only way to know you have viral hepatitis.
- Vaccines can prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B and medications can cure hepatitis C. About viral hepatitis Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. The liver is one of the largest and most important organs in a person's body. The liver is about the size of a football and, on average, weighs about 3 pounds. It is located on the upper right side of a person's body, behind the lower ribs. Almost all the blood in a person's body passes through the liver.

The liver performs hundreds of functions, including: storing nutrients; removing waste products and worn-out cells from the blood; filtering and processing chemicals in food, alcohol, and medications; and producing bile, a solution that helps digest fats and eliminate waste products. When the liver is inflamed or damaged, it can't do its job effectively. Heavy alcohol use, toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions can cause hepatitis. However, hepatitis is often caused by a virus. Cases can range from mild to severe, with many people not even realizing they are infected. The most common types of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Tens of thousands of people are newly infected with viral hepatitis every year in the US. It is a serious public health threat that kills thousands of Americans annually and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Hepatitis B
- Caused by the hepatitis B virus.
- Contagious and spreads through bodily fluids.
- Infection can result in acute or chronic illness.
- Vaccination is the best way to prevent infection. Hepatitis C
- Caused by the hepatitis C virus.
- Many people with hepatitis C don't look or feel sick, so they might not know they have the virus.
- Untreated, hepatitis C can lead to serious liver problems, like damage, scarring, or cancer.
- There isn't a vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be cured with oral medication. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of all types of viral hepatitis are similar and can include one or more of the following:

- Dark urine or clay-colored stools
- Diarrhea
- Feeling tired
- Fever
- Joint pain
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea, stomach pain, throwing up
- Yellow skin or eyes Symptoms of chronic viral hepatitis can take decades to develop. Learn more about specific signs and symptoms of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

How it spreads Viral hepatitis is infectious and can spread before a person knows they are sick. Each type of hepatitis spreads differently. Hepatitis A Hepatitis A is spread when someone ingests the virus – even in microscopic amounts. This usually occurs through close personal contact with an infected person, or by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink. Learn more about hepatitis A prevention and control. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is primarily spread when blood, semen, or certain other body fluids – even microscopic amounts – from a person infected with HBV enter the body of someone who is not infected. Learn more about hepatitis B prevention and control. Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is spread when blood from a person infected with HCV – even microscopic amounts – enters the body of someone who is not infected.

### Impact of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the study of hepatic artery hypoperfusion shortly after liver transplantation: contribution to the diagnosis of artery steal syndrome [^6e07e5b9]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the absence of hepatic artery signal on Doppler ultrasound (DUS) in the immediate postoperative period after liver transplant.

Methods

This prospective study included 675 consecutive liver transplants. Patients without hepatic artery signal by DUS within 8 days post-transplant were studied with CEUS. If it remained undetectable, a thrombosis was suspected. In patent hepatic artery, a DUS was performed immediately after CEUS; if low resistance flow was detected, an arteriography was indicated. Patients with high resistance waveform underwent DUS+/CEUS follow-up. Arteriography was indicated when abnormal flow persisted for more than 5 days or liver dysfunction appeared.

Results

Thirty-four patients were studied with CEUS. In 11 patients CEUS correctly diagnosed hepatic artery thrombosis. In two out of 23 non-occluded arteries, a low resistance flow lead to a diagnosis of stenosis/proximal thrombosis. Twenty-one patients had absence of diastolic flow, which normalized in the follow-up in 13 patients. In the remaining eight patients, splenic artery steal syndrome (ASS) was diagnosed.

Conclusions

CEUS allows us to avoid invasive tests in the diagnostic work-up shortly after liver transplant. It identifies the hepatic artery thrombosis and points to a diagnosis of ASS.

Key Points

- CEUS is useful in the diagnostic work-up shortly after liver transplant
- CEUS identifies the hepatic artery thrombosis with reliability
- There is little information about DUS and CEUS findings in the ASS
- DUS and CEUS offer functional information useful in the diagnosis of ASS.

### Role of imaging in the evaluation of vascular complications after liver transplantation [^49001369]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic artery complications

Related to their onset, hepatic artery complications can be defined as early (within the first month) or late (later than 1 month) complications. Early complications are the most important for patient prognosis because they are associated with graft loss and a high mortality rate.

Thrombosis (Figs. 2 and 3)

Artery thrombosis is the most serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, occurring approximately in 4 to 12% of cases. Thrombosis represents more than 50% of all arterial complications, being the first cause of non-functional liver transplant. Usually, an early complication, it can occur even up to 4 months after transplantation.

Fig. 2
Anastomotic thrombosis. Artery thrombosis is the most serious complication of orthotopic liver transplantation. It can be demonstrated as an absence of flow in Doppler ultrasound examination (a). CT can depict the thrombus and also the absence of distal flow (b). Multiplanar reconstructions and volume rendering images can be useful to ensure diagnosis (c – e)

Fig. 3
a, b After treatment control. Control performed after thrombolysis and angioplasty of patient in Fig. 2. Normal arterial flow is seen. Resistive index shows normal values (0.6)

Pulsed and power CDUS has a high sensitivity and specificity to detect the thrombus and grade the degree of stenosis and flow properties, not only at the hepatic artery but also at the intrahepatic branches. Parameters to be considered are hepatic artery diameter, hepatic artery peak systolic velocity and hepatic artery resistance index. Intraoperative ultrasound examination has high sensitivity and specificity for early detection of these findings. Proper quantification of flow velocity within the stenosis by CDUS requires the use of a suitable angle. If the transducer is placed at a parallel or perpendicular angle to the artery whose speed is to be measured, quantified speeds would be lower than actual. Because of the impaired anatomy and generally poor sonographic window, it is usually difficult to find the correct angle. However, resistance index and spectral curve morphology are not affected by angle, being easier to study.

### Surgical versus image-guided interventions in the management of complications after liver transplantation [^ec115894]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation is a technically demanding surgical procedure with known complications, and the optimal approach to addressing vascular and biliary complications requires a coordinated effort between surgical and interventional radiology teams. Vascular complications involving the hepatic artery, portal vein, or hepatic veins can be characterized by their mechanism, chronicity, and timing of presentation. These factors help determine whether the optimal therapeutic approach is surgical or endovascular. Very early presentation in the perioperative period favors surgical revision, while later presentation is best addressed endovascularly. Biliary complications can be categorized as leaks or strictures, and coordinated surgical, endoscopic, and percutaneous management is needed to address these types of complications. Through advances in technique and the management of complications, outcomes after liver transplantation continue to improve.

### Hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation: evaluation of different endovascular treatment approaches [^fff3af7a]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study compared the safety and efficacy of direct hepatic artery intervention with non-hepatic visceral artery embolization for the treatment of symptomatic hepatic artery stenosis. The treatment modality was primarily determined by the degree of hepatic artery tortuosity such that the stenosis was located less than 2 cm from an acute arterial curvature/kink (see Fig. 4). The results indicate an improved safety profile with EHAI, as demonstrated by decreased liver-related deaths and complications rates when compared to HAI. These conclusions remain consistent when excluding the 'combination' procedures from the HAI treatment arm (see Table 3).

Pre-operative hemoglobin levels were statistically different between both treatment arms; however, this was considered an incidental occurrence that did not impact the post-procedural outcomes. Pre-procedural resistive indices measured distal to the stenosis showed statistically significant differences between the groups (see Table 4). However, the other pre-procedural data points used to quantify stenosis, including percentage stenosis, severity of transaminitis, and peak systolic velocity, showed no significant differences between the treatment arms. This homogeneity between patient cohorts in both treatment groups lends support to the notion that celiac blood flow diversion is a valid strategy in the management of HAS.

Previous studies on direct hepatic artery interventions considered progression to hepatic artery thrombosis separate from other procedural complications such as dissection, rupture, or hematoma. When excluding thrombosis, our complication rate of 9.5% (2/21) following hepatic artery angioplasty and/or stenting was similar to previously reported rates of 5.3–12%. When comparing the rates of hepatic artery thrombosis following angioplasty and/or stenting for HAS, our rate of 19% (4/21) was slightly lower than previously reported rates of 27–28%. Previous retrospective reviews reported an increase in RI between 0.1 to 0.2 following direct hepatic artery interventions, which is concordant with the + 0.11 change in RI within our HAI treatment group.

Regarding the EHAI treatment arm, direct comparisons to existing literature are limited owing to differences in indications for intervention. Previously reported increases in hepatic arterial flow and low complication rates following splenic artery embolization in liver transplant recipients are consistent with our results. To our knowledge, the literature regarding visceral artery embolization to maintain hepatic perfusion in the setting of hepatic artery pathology has been limited to case reports.

Doppler ultrasound is useful in the emergent evaluation of the liver and kidney transplant patient. Arterial stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, and venous thrombosis are treatable causes of allograft failure that can be detected easily with color and spectral Doppler. Doppler has a limited but important role in the emergent evaluation of the native liver and kidneys, usually involving prior biopsy or instrumentation.

### European society of pediatric radiology survey of perioperative imaging in pediatric liver transplantation: (3) postoperative imaging [^73385cd8]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional cross-sectional imaging is used as a problem-solving technique when specific complications occur or are suspected. Abdominal CT is effectively used in about one-fifth (21.5%) of all pediatric liver transplantations during the postoperative phase. Some centers utilize abdominal CT imaging more frequently than others, which may be attributed to variations in the occurrence of certain postoperative complications, availability of CT at short notice, local practices, and the use of alternative diagnostic pathways. The main indications to perform a postoperative abdominal CT were either suspected vascular problems (ruling out thrombosis, grading of stenosis) or characterization of fluid collections not well seen on US, possibly with CT-guided drainage. Especially in smaller children, some centers will directly pursue a repeat operation when there is a high index of suspicion for hepatic artery thrombosis on Doppler US. CE-US, which has been suggested as a bedside alternative to CT to rule out hepatic artery or portal vein thrombosis, is routinely used at only four European sites participating in this survey (18.2%). Postoperative abdominal MRI is applied by two sites to further assess vascular problems (9.1%). The general availability of MRI is lower than CT (eight sites, 36%), and abdominal MRI is predominantly applied for characterization of biliary problems representing the most frequent complications during this period.

This and the other two papers on perioperative imaging in pediatric liver transplantation are subject to several limitations, some of which are inherent to the use of survey data including issues with respondent selection and response accuracy. (1) Of the 26 European centers for pediatric liver transplantation known to the Abdominal Taskforce, 22 returned the survey. The papers only reflect the views of centers who participated in the survey. Taking a survey return rate of 84% into account, the number of pediatric liver transplantation performed at the participating centers aligns with the numbers published from the European Liver Transplant Registry Database and indicates the sample of invited institutions to be representative. (2) Issues with response accuracy and incomplete coverage were addressed by callbacks. (3) A single respondent was asked to fill out the survey questions representing the position of their center and coauthored the manuscripts to ensure that these views are adequately presented. However, the responses may not fully reflect the position of each medical discipline in detail. To arrive at valid imaging recommendations applicable to all medical disciplines, specific needs and constraints have to be addressed through a consensus approach.

### Graft complications following orthotopic liver transplantation: role of non-invasive cross-sectional imaging techniques [^2ff4a2d2]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in adult patients with endstage liver disease. Survival of both graft and patient has progressively improved over time due to improvements in surgical and medical treatment. However, post-transplant complications still have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality associated with transplant surgery. The most common adverse events of the graft include vascular (arterial and venous stenosis and thrombosis), biliary (leakage, strictures, stones) and parenchymal complications (hepatitis virus C infection, HCC recurrence, liver abscesses). The diagnosis of these adverse events is often challenging because of the low specificity of clinical and biologic findings. Different diagnostic algorithms have been proposed for the detection of graft complications and, in this setting, radiological evaluation plays a key role in differential diagnosis of graft complications and the exclusion of other adverse events. Ultrasound examination is established the first-line method of identifying adverse events in liver transplant recipients but a normal or a technically unsatisfactory study cannot exclude the presence of biliary, vascular and/or parenchymal complications. In these circumstances, before planning any treatment, multi-detector CT and/or MR imaging and MR cholangiography should be performed for the evaluation of vascular structures, biliary system, liver parenchyma and fluid collections. The aim of this review is to illustrate the role and state-of-the-art of non-invasive cross-sectional imaging techniques in the diagnosis and management of complications which primarily affect the graft in patients after liver transplantation.

### Role of imaging in the evaluation of vascular complications after liver transplantation [^66acbc8f]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

When the blood flow is not identified by CDUS, some different conditions should be considered such as slow flow secondary to vasospasm or low cardiac output. Also, many of these patients have a poor sonographic window due to the surgical dressing materials. Use of a contrast agent (contrast-enhanced US, CEUS) will improve the US diagnostic performance in these cases with a near perfect accuracy.

CT angiography is the best technique to further evaluate difficult cases due to its high accuracy, short examination time and facility to be performed with poor patient condition. MRI has proven to have a diagnostic accuracy similar to ultrasound, while CT angiography is equivalent or even better.

If thrombosis is suspected, a diagnostic arteriography will confirm the diagnosis and allow the best treatment decision. Some endovascular treatments are available to these patients, such as intraarterial thrombolysis (IAT), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement. If treatment fails, retransplantation should be considered as soon as possible. Studies have shown retransplantation has a better survival rate than endovascular treatment. Nevertheless, because of its less invasive nature, endovascular treatments should be performed as first-line treatment.

Stenosis (Figs. 4, 5, and 6)

The most frequently affected location is the anastomosis (2 to 13% of patients). Therefore, this region should me carefully evaluated.

They show a characteristic pattern before and after the stenosis. In the prestenotic segment (b), we can appreciate high peaks and an elevated resistive index. In the poststenotic segment (c), we can see a parvus et tardus pulse and a low resistive index. Angiography can help confirm the diagnosis (d) and perform the treatment (e)

### Hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation: evaluation of different endovascular treatment approaches [^54024f47]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

However, current literature lacks a comparative study involving both direct hepatic artery interventions (HAI) and indirect extra-hepatic arterial interventions (EHAI) in the setting of HAS. At our institution, management of HAS begins with an inter-disciplinary case-by-case approach involving transplant surgery and interventional radiology. Our working hypothesis is that non-hepatic visceral artery embolization may effectively treat HAS via redistribution of celiac blood flow to mitigate ischemic damage to the liver, as well as reduce the rates of complications associated with HAI. The option to treat symptomatic HAS with EHAI would be particularly helpful in cases of HAS where hepatic arterial anatomy is unfavorable to instrumentation. This study aimed to review the efficacy and safety of indirect and direct hepatic arterial interventions for hepatic artery stenosis to suggest a reasonable treatment algorithm.

When considering that there was a repeat intervention within each of the six 'combination' procedures (EHAI immediately followed by HAI), the total proportion of procedures requiring repeat intervention for EHAI grows to 33% (11/33) versus HAI 14% (3/21), p = 0.06.

### Early detection of hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation by Doppler ultrasonography: prognostic implications [^d5487db3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We assessed the usefulness of routine Doppler ultrasonography for early detection of hepatic artery thrombosis after orthotopic liver transplantation and repercussions in patient prognosis. Seventeen confirmed cases of early hepatic artery thrombosis initially diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography (10 of them before clinical indication) were reviewed. All patients underwent Doppler ultrasonographic studies in the first 3 days after orthotopic liver transplantation. Twelve cases of hepatic artery thrombosis (70.6%) were detected by this early Doppler ultrasonography. All 10 unsuspected cases of hepatic artery thrombosis and 5 of the 7 cases diagnosed after clinical indication were treated by revascularization. Grafts were salvaged in 80% of asymptomatic patients and in 42.8% of symptomatic patients. Furthermore, biliary complications were less serious in the first group. In conclusion, Doppler ultrasonography performed routinely in the first 3 days after orthotopic liver transplantation may permit early detection of hepatic artery thrombosis, even before clinical indications. This allows hepatic artery repermeabilization before liver function damage, improving graft rescue and patient prognosis.

### Unexpected hepatitis B virus infection after liver transplantation… [^e0130fc5]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Unexpected donor-derived hepatitis B virus infection after organ transplantation is rare and is associated most commonly with donor injection drug use. What is added by this report. During 2019, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and CDC received an increased number of reports of HBV infection among liver recipients from HBV-negative donors; 12 of 14 implicated donors had evidence of recent injection drug use, and 13 donors were hepatitis C virus –seropositive. 1). During 2014–2019, CDC received 20 reports of HBV infection among recipients of livers from donors who had no evidence of past or current HBV infection. Investigation included review of laboratory data and medical records. Fourteen of these new HBV infections were detected during 2019 alone; infections were detected a median of 38 weeks after transplantation.

Of the 14 donors, 13 were hepatitis C virus –seropositive † and had a history of injection drug use within the year preceding death, a positive toxicology result, or both. Because injection drug use is the most commonly reported risk factor for hepatitis C, § providers caring for recipients of organs from donors who are HCV-seropositive or recently injected drugs should maintain awareness of infectious complications of injection drug use and monitor recipients accordingly. 1, 2). Confirmed cases were defined as unexpected, new, reproducible laboratory evidence of HBV infection occurring in liver recipients after transplantation that were reported to CDC during 2014–2019. All recipients who received organs from the same donor as the liver recipient were evaluated for donor-derived HBV infection using the same criteria. Available archived donor serum, plasma, or liver biopsy samples were tested for HBV DNA.

State and local health departments shared information about recipient behavioral risk factors and outbreaks of health-care–associated HBV infection. Median age at death of the 20 donors was 31 years; 11 were male, and 19 were White. The most common cause of death was drug intoxication. Injection drug use and positive toxicology were each reported for 18 donors. Sixteen donors, including 13 of 14 reported in 2019, were HCV antibody –seropositive; among these 13 donors, 12 had positive drug toxicology, 12 had a history of injection drug use, and 11 had both. New HBV infection was identified in 18 liver and two liver-kidney recipients at a median of 41 weeks after transplantation. Among cases reported during 2019, hepatitis B test conversion was first identified at a median of 38 weeks after transplantation. None of 31 recipients of nonliver organs* from the 20 donors developed a new infection with hepatitis B.

No behavioral risk factors or health care–associated hepatitis B outbreaks were reported in association with any case. Hepatitis B vaccination status was unavailable for the majority of recipients. Discussion HBV infection among transplant recipients can occur from reactivation of previous HBV infection, primary infection after transplantation, or donor-derived transmission. This report provides evidence that transmission of HBV from donors occurred despite negative organ donor HBV DNA, HBsAg, and total anti-HBc results before organ procurement. Among 14 cases reported during 2019, all donors but one were HCV-seropositive with a history of injection drug use, a positive toxicology result, or both.

### Endovascular therapies for hepatic artery stenosis post liver transplantation [^91c5fe4e]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

A retrospective review of all endovascular interventions for HAS after liver transplantation that occurred between June 2013 and November 2020 was performed at a single institution that performs 70–80 liver transplants per year.

The patients were selected utilizing a procedural database (X-plore) using the different keywords (stenting, hepatic artery, transplant, liver, PBA).

Approval for this retrospective review study was obtained from the institutional review board.

To provide the optimal treatment for the patients, we used a score that combines the following criteria (Kodama et al; Hamby et al.):
Us: resistive index < 0.5, systolic accelerating time > 10 ms, peak systolic velocity > 200 cm/s
CT, MR or angiography

A significant artery stenosis was suspected when typical tardus parvus pattern, defined by a RI < 0.5 and SAT > 10 ms, was identified in the hepatic parenchyma (left, right lobe or both) associated or not with a PSV > 200 cm/s Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Typical tardus parvus (IR = 0,48, TAS = 0,11 s) and confirmation of a significant arterial stenosis with angio CT and angiography

During the follow-up, all patients had Us exploration (every 3 months). When a significant stenosis was suspected a CT or MRI was systematically realized to confirm or unconfirm the stenosis.

Hepatic artery stenosis was defined as focal diameter narrowing of the hepatic artery measuring > 70% by visual estimate (Sabri et al.).

Initial technical success was defined as < 30% residual stenosis of the treated hepatic artery by visual estimation of the final arteriogram (Hamby et al.). Neither intravascular ultrasound imaging nor pressure gradients were used in this series. Follow up occurred from 1 month to 4 years (median 15 months).

### Role of imaging in the evaluation of vascular complications after liver transplantation [^b36588fa]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Complications of hepatic veins (Fig. 14)

These are rare complications. As in the rest of the vessels, characteristic complications are thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) and stenosis.

Fig. 14
a, b Thrombosis of the right hepatic vein. The right suprahepatic vein is more echogenic than the middle hepatic vein. After contrast administration, there is an enhancement of the middle hepatic vein, showing normal flow. The right hepatic vein does not enhance because of thrombosis

In the case of living donor transplantation, knowledge of the surgical anatomy is very important. Usually, the right hepatic vein is preserved in the right lobe of the graft, but the middle hepatic vein is usually left for the safety of the donor. Sometimes, the middle hepatic vein is also included in the graft, and therefore, it should be assessed in the postoperative control.

### Role of MDCT in the detection of early abdominal complications after orthotopic liver transplantation [^464d4c59]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to assess the role of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for detecting early abdominal complications after orthotopic liver transplantation.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively enrolled 170 subjects with clinical laboratory and/or echo-color Doppler abnormalities who underwent MDCT within the first 90 days after transplantation. All images were reviewed by two radiologists in conference and imaging results were correlated with digital subtraction angiography, conventional cholangiography, surgery, clinical laboratory, and/or imaging follow-up.

Results

No significant complication was found in 142 patients, while vascular complications (hepatic artery thrombosis, n = 5 and stenosis, n = 5; portal vein thrombosis, n = 4; cava vein thrombosis, n = 1; arterial bleeding, n = 1), biliary complications (anastomotic leak with biloma, n = 6), parenchymal complications (abscess, n = 1; extended areas of impaired perfusion, n = 3), adrenal hemorrhage (n = 1), and bowel perforation (n = 1) were identified in the remaining 28 cases. Four false-positive cases (three hepatic artery stenoses and one hepatic artery dissection) and one false-negative case (biloma) were diagnosed on MDCT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in the identification of various complications were 96%, 97%, 87%, 99%, and 97%, respectively.

Conclusion

MDCT is a reliable diagnostic technique in the identification of early abdominal complications of liver recipients.

### Management of hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis after pediatric liver transplantation: variability and agreement in management practices [^78bcb27a]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for managing hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and stenosis (HAS) after pediatric liver transplantation (pLT) are lacking, with heterogeneous local practices. This study aims to evaluate management practices for HAT and HAS after pLT.

Methods

An online and paper-based survey was sent to 36 international pLT centers. The survey included 36 questions covering center experience, screening protocols, diagnostic criteria, preventive management, post-procedural care, and follow-up. Treatment strategies were explored through hypothetical case scenarios categorized by early (≤ 14 d after pLT) and late onset complications (> 14 d after pLT).

Results

Responses from 36 centers showed that 60% applied interrupted sutures and 76% used a surgical loupe during transplantation. Additionally, 89% followed a specific anticoagulation protocol after uncomplicated pLT. All centers initiated Doppler ultrasound (DUS) within 24 hours after pLT, with 60% conducting it daily during the first week. Immediate re-transplantation was preferred for early HAT with pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) (61% vs. 11% for non-PALF, p < 0.001), and surgical revascularization was more frequently chosen for non-PALF cases (51% vs. 24% for PALF, p < 0.001). Endovascular therapy was selected in 35% of cases for both late HAT and HAS, with conservative management chosen in 51% for late HAT and 61% for late HAS (all p < 0.001, compared to early cases).

Conclusion

Internationally, there is agreement on the importance of early DUS screening in current management practices. Immediate re-transplantation was preferred for early HAT with PALF, while surgical revascularization was favored for non-PALF cases. Conservative management and endovascular therapy emerged as potential strategies for late-onset cases. This worldwide survey on real-world practice provides a basis for developing and implementing guidelines.

ACR–AIUM–SPR–SRU liver transplant ultrasound — Doppler vascular evaluation: Clarification of vascular surgical anatomy is essential because variant anastomoses may be present, and the typical vessels that should be examined include the main hepatic artery and right and left intrahepatic arteries, hepatic veins, inferior vena cava (IVC), main portal vein, and intrahepatic portal veins in whole-liver transplants. In segmental or partial liver transplants, the extrahepatic main hepatic artery, solitary hepatic artery, hepatic vein, and portal vein should be evaluated, and the vascular anastomoses (hepatic arterial, portal venous, hepatic venous, and IVC) should be interrogated. The hepatic arteries should be interrogated to confirm normal flow and exclude complications such as thrombosis, stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula; both the main hepatic artery and the intrahepatic arteries should be evaluated when possible. The main hepatic artery should be imaged along its length when possible, and an attempt should be made to interrogate the native artery, region of the anastomosis.

### Complications after liver transplant related to preexisting conditions: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^3bff5244]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging after orthotopic liver transplant focuses primarily on depicting complications related to surgical hepatic vascular and biliary anastomoses. Less common preexisting vascular conditions include congenital anatomic variants, atherosclerosis, chronic portal venous thrombosis, splenic artery and variceal steal phenomena, and transarterial embolization (TAE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). If unappreciated or left untreated preoperatively, these conditions negatively impact the transplant by impairing hepatic arterial or portal vascular inflow. Many of the complications related to preexisting vascular conditions can be prevented or mitigated by proper performance and careful evaluation of preoperative imaging studies. The authors describe the diagnosis and treatment of complications arising from narrowing of the celiac axis by atherosclerosis and the median arcuate ligament, variant anatomy of the hepatic artery, insufficiency of the portal vein requiring surgical conduits, and large varices or an enlarged splenic artery and spleen that may steal blood and compromise hepatic arterial or venous inflow. While preoperative evaluation primarily involves CT and MRI, postoperative diagnosis involves screening with sonography and confirmation with other modalities. We propose the use of a preoperative checklist of vascular status and measurements in patients undergoing liver transplant. Reports of imaging studies in recipients after transplant should include details of surgical vascular anastomoses and conduits, any history of HCC and preoperative TAE, details of the preoperative α-fetoprotein levels, and any unusual procedures or pathologic findings in the explanted liver that may affect postoperative surveillance. The authors review the pretransplant imaging evaluation of vascular and HCC issues that may affect surgical outcomes and methods to help recognize complications after transplant that can arise from these conditions. © RSNA, 2020.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) liver transplantation — technical challenges, complications, and pretransplant considerations are detailed as follows: Alternative treatment options should be explored by patients and physicians before liver transplantation is considered, given the complexity and invasiveness of this procedure. PLD is considered one of the most technically challenging indications for liver transplantation, and the massive hepatomegaly complicates manipulation of the liver for explantation, with risk of tearing fragile liver or caval veins that may result in massive blood loss and intraoperative death. The procedure can be further complicated by postoperative bile leakage, bile duct stenosis, and/or hepatic artery thrombosis, and explantation may be complicated or even impossible in the presence of adhesions after previous PLD surgeries, in particular liver resection.

### Adult liver transplantation: UK clinical guideline-part 2: surgery and post-operation [^315a2db1]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation surgery and the post-operative period

The recipient's LT operation commences when the surgeon is assured of donor organ size, quality and anatomy. Hence, some recipients will experience a 'false start' if the organ quality is poor; however, if the organ is suitable, surgery will proceed (figure 2 outlines the order of surgery).

Figure 2
Order of liver transplantation surgery. PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Figure 3 and online supplementary appendix 1 outline the post-LT complications. These can be broadly divided into immediate and early complications. Any major abdominal procedure carries a risk of bleeding and infection in the immediate post-operative period. The additional, more specific, surgical complications relate to the various vessel anastamoses (figure 2), including portal vein thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary leak or stricture. Live donor liver transplant (LDLT) and DCD allograft recipients are more prone to biliary and vascular complications. Hepatic artery stenosis and rare complications such as primary non-function may require re-graft, so all listed recipients are warned of this possibility. Conversely, portal vein thrombosis and biliary complications can usually be managed without the need for further surgery. These 'immediate' complications arise in the first few days and hence will all be managed in the liver transplant unit (LTU). Complications arising after the first week or so (see figure 3) include the ever-present risk of hepatic artery thrombosis, the emerging risk of organ rejection and diverse infections, including those related to graft transmission and immunosupression.

### Hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation: evaluation of different endovascular treatment approaches [^4524f55c]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, 22 of the 40 patients with clinically significant HAS were successfully managed with EHAI and were able to avoid direct hepatic artery intervention. Therefore, we suggest that in cases of difficult hepatic arterial anatomy, extra-hepatic visceral artery embolization can be considered as an alternative intervention before attempting instrumentation of the hepatic artery. Further research involving a multi-center registry with long-term results would be helpful in establishing this alternative treatment approach for hepatic artery stenosis following adult liver transplantation.

Liver transplant — hepatic artery Doppler evaluation states that Color Doppler evaluation should be obtained to demonstrate the presence of flow, configuration of the vessel evaluating for redundancy, and any possible areas of color Doppler aliasing, Spectral Doppler waveform morphology should be assessed, and Velocity measurements may be obtained at the anastomosis and within the native and donor portions of the hepatic artery and at any areas of color-flow aliasing; Doppler indices may include the peak systolic velocity (PSV), the resistive index (RI = systolic velocity-diastolic velocity/systolic velocity), and acceleration time (AT = time between end diastole and the first systolic peak). For intrahepatic arteries, The presence of flow should be confirmed in the intrahepatic (right and left hepatic) arteries, RI should be calculated from spectral Doppler waveforms obtained at these locations, Spectral Doppler waveform morphology should be assessed visually, and ATs can also be measured if the waveform appears abnormal, as in a tardus parvus waveform. Comparison should be made with prior examinations when possible, and although the hepatic arterial waveform may normally change with time, some changes in waveform configuration, RI, or PSV may require further evaluation. If there is difficulty in confirming hepatic arterial flow on routine grayscale and Doppler examinations, contrast-enhanced ultrasound may be helpful in evaluating hepatic artery thrombosis, stenosis, or hepatic artery hypoperfusion syndrome/splenic arterial steal, and Ultrasound contrast in this setting can improve flow detection in the hepatic artery and may be helpful in other vessels as well.

### Current endovascular management of arterial complications after pediatric liver transplantation in a tertiary center [^8fcaf8a2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stenosis represents a slightly different condition, rarely manifesting as a clinical urgency, with mild or absent clinical and laboratory alterations. Literature reports effective treatment of stenosis of the HA in adult LT patients. The decision between PTA alone or stenting should be based on features like morphology of the stenosis, tortuosity and kinking of the arteries, reserving PTA for shorter and focal stenoses. A recent retrospective study showed comparable outcomes of PTA with or without stenting, with slightly higher stenosis relapse after PTA alone. However, no robust evidence supports primary stenting versus PTA alone, nor superiority of the operative approach versus the conservative one for asymptomatic or late-onset stenosis. A recent retrospective analysis performed on adult liver transplants showed that patients treated for symptomatic stenosis had a longer biliary stricture-free survival compared to conservatively managed patients, although without statistical significance. Moreover, asymptomatic and late-onset stenosis patients that did not receive an endovascular treatment did not develop any biliary stricture. This data supports the hypothesis of collateral vessels suppling the intrahepatic circulation in non-acute-onset obstructions. Although we never considered stenting as the first option, it was frequently performed in our series of stenosis due to failure of simple angioplasty or the presence of pseudoaneurysms. In particular, pseudoaneurysm management with stent graft allowed to preserve HA vascularization (Fig. 5). Even though HA stent grafting to treat pseudoaneurysm is feasible as already reported, embolization may be considered an alternative in unfavorable situations.

### Imaging of vascular complications and their consequences following transplantation in the abdomen [^eb73a09d]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Transplantation is the surgical treatment of choice for end-stage organ failure. Transplantation procedures performed in the abdomen include liver, renal, pancreas, islet, intestinal, and multivisceral transplantations. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the posttransplantation setting for monitoring the transplant allograft and screening for complications. Knowledge of the surgical techniques employed in abdominal transplantation is essential because it facilitates radiologic understanding and interpretation of the posttransplantation anatomy. This article includes a basic description of the standard surgical techniques performed in the abdomen, with emphasis on the relevant vascular anastomotic reconstructions used. Posttransplantation complications can be broadly classified as vascular or nonvascular in origin. Many of these complications can be accurately depicted and characterized at imaging and dealt with definitively by using interventional radiology techniques, which can be graft- and life-saving and can obviate further complex surgical intervention. The article discusses imaging appearances of vascular complications and their consequences after transplantation in the abdomen. These vascular complications include arterial thrombosis, arterial stenosis, venous thrombosis and stenosis, arteriovenous fistula formation, and pseudoaneurysm formation. The relevant predisposing factors, clinical features, imaging appearances, and potential treatment options for vascular complications of various types of transplantation are presented in a logical and integrated fashion. Knowledge and imaging recognition of the posttransplantation vascular complications discussed in this article will aid radiologists in accurate imaging characterization and thereby facilitate appropriate clinical management and therapy.

Intrahepatic pseudoaneurysms

Characteristically, it is a complication of percutaneous liver biopsy, the usual cause, but also may be secondary to bile duct infections. In case of rupture of such aneurysms, a portal or biliary fistula can appear. Pseudoaneurysms and fistulas secondary to percutaneous liver biopsies are much more frequent if the biopsy is done in the first days or weeks after transplantation. In fact, according to some reports, the risk of developing an arterioportal fistula is approximately 50% for biopsies performed in the first week, dropping to 10% if performed approximately 1 month after surgery.

In both cases, treatment consists of coil embolisation and stent placement to prevent inflow to the pseudoaneurysm. If the results of this treatment are not satisfactory, surgical resection can be performed.

Ischaemia/liver infarction

Hepatic infarction is very rare in normal patients, since the liver is a richly vascularised organ with blood from different circuits: the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Inside the liver, there are numerous anastomotic vessels and collateral branches.

However, in liver recipient patients, anastomoses are stopped, so hepatic infarction is much more common. It is usually associated with arterial occlusion (85% of cases), and, rarely with portal vein occlusion. Bile ducts are especially sensitive to arterial blood flow impairment because they receive all their blood supply from the hepatic artery.

Ischaemia and liver infarction can be consequences of all three described alterations of the hepatic artery: thrombosis, stenosis and pseudoaneurysm.

### Imaging of preoperative liver transplantation in adults: what radiologists should know [^e365d883]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Therapeutic strategies for treating patients with liver failure, particularly optimization of liver transplantation, are constantly being refined, with the goal of improving long-term survival with the lowest risk for toxicity in donors and recipients. Optimal planning for liver transplantation requires a multidisciplinary collaboration between the radiologist, hepatologist, clinical oncologist, and transplant surgeon. Radiologists play an essential role in identifying normal and abnormal variant anatomy and other conditions that may be present, a task that is critical for accurate surgical planning. Radiologists also must understand how their findings affect patient preparation. An awareness of the range of indications for liver transplantation, imaging modalities, and current surgical techniques is important to properly evaluate a patient who may undergo liver transplantation. Establishing a pretransplantation definition of the extent of liver disease and thoroughly evaluating the vascular and biliary anatomy are paramount for proper assessment of potential recipients and donors for liver transplantation.

Aberrant hepatic arterial anatomy

One of the most dreaded posttransplant complications is acute hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), which can lead to primary nonfunction and prompt emergent retransplant. Thus, careful consideration of the quality of donor and recipient vessels, size match, and orientation must be taken into account during the transplant procedure. Similar to the other anastomoses, an ideal arterial anastomosis is tension free but has limited redundancy. The hepatic artery lumen can be quite small; therefore, the anastomosis is often made between branch points in the arteries as they have relatively more arterial wall to lumen size, which prevents the artery from narrowing at the anastomosis from the sutures. It is not uncommon to encounter variant arterial anatomy. Some retrospective studies of CT angiograms performed on patients for various reasons suggest that conventional hepatic arterial anatomy may be found in as low as 50%–55% of cases. The two most common variants found are a replaced hepatic right artery, which comes off the superior mesenteric artery and courses laterally in the porta hepatis and is posterior to the common bile duct, and a replaced left artery, which comes off the left gastric artery and courses through the gastrohepatic ligament. In these cases, either the replaced artery or proper artery may be used depending on the lumen size match of donor to recipient. If none of the arteries available are of adequate size, an aortic conduit, often using a cadaveric iliac artery, may be used to provide inflow to the donor artery directly from the aorta. Depending on the anatomy of the patient and his or her surgical history, a supraceliac or infrarenal aortic conduit may be constructed. Evaluation of hepatic arterial flow is done with an intraoperative Doppler assessment. Sometimes low arterial flow can result from abnormally high portal flows, a homeostatic mechanism referred to as the hepatic artery buffer response. In these cases, ligation of the splenic artery or even a splenectomy can be considered for flow modulation.

Clinical manifestations from arterial complications occur across a spectrum from acute HAT to chronic stenosis or kinking. These may not manifest with severe aberrations in liver biochemistries. Therefore, an evaluation of the hepatic vasculature by Doppler ultrasound is a useful tool, especially in the early postoperative period, to evaluate the arterial anastomosis. If an arterial stenosis or thrombosis is identified, surgical revision or interventional radiology‐guided angioplasty with or without a stent is generally performed.

Complications of the inferior vena cava

Inferior vena cava complications are in frequent. They affect less than 2% of liver transplantations. Coronal reconstructions are especially useful in measuring the extension of the thrombus.

Thrombosis (Fig. 12)

Usually, they occur because of the surgical technique or a hypercoagulable state. Diagnosis and treatment are similar to that of portal vein thrombosis.

Fig. 12
a, b Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava. Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava was discovered through an axial ultrasound examination. Sagittal examination helps to asses its extension.

Stenosis (Fig. 13)

Just as in the other vessels, the most common site is the anastomosis. It is also possible that extrinsic compression stenosis occurs, secondary to oedema of the graft or fluid collections, hematomas or abscesses. The diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are similar to those described in the portal vein.

Budd–Chiari syndrome — diagnostic work-up and imaging recommendations: Investigation for acquired and inherited thrombotic conditions should be performed in all patients with BCS. Owing to the high prevalence of two or more risk factors in BCS, investigation for secondary prothrombotic factors is recommended even in the presence of 1 conspicuous thrombophilia disorder. The hepatic venous outflow tract should be investigated in all patients with acute or chronic liver disease without an obvious cause, particularly in the setting of new-onset ascites and/or abdominal pain. Hepatic venogram and/or liver biopsy are rarely required to make a diagnosis of BCS. For imaging selection in new-onset ascites, the guideline asks, "Should Doppler US, contrast-enhanced CT scan, or MRI be obtained to diagnose BCS in patients with new-onset ascites?" and states, "We recommend Doppler US as the initial diagnostic test for evaluation for BCS. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans should be obtained to assess thrombus extension, rule out tumor thrombus, determine response to anticoagulation therapy, evaluate indeterminate hepatic nodules, and whenever there is high clinical suspicion of BCS despite negative or inconclusive Doppler US results (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence)".

Hepatic artery aneurysms — epidemiology, imaging, and management: Most HAAs are true arterial aneurysms. The primary causes are atherosclerosis, mediointimal degeneration, trauma, and, less commonly, infection. Most true HAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging obtained for other reasons. The reported incidence of rupture in patients with true HAAs is up to 25%, and the mortality rate from rupture of an HAA is > 30%. Doppler ultrasound studies and CT readily demonstrate HAAs, and multidetector CT arteriography is the optimal tool for defining these lesions, assessing the collateral circulation, and planning treatment. In a retrospective review of 22 patients with a mean HAA diameter of 2.3 cm (range, 1.5–5.0) who were followed up and untreated for a mean of 68.4 months (range, 1–372), no complications were identified. Patients treated using endovascular approaches appear to have less morbidity and mortality; however, the actual benefit-to-risk ratio of treating aneurysms deemed to be at higher risk of rupture has not been evaluated, and there are no data on which to base recommendations for surveillance of HAAs in the setting of expectant management.

### Endovascular therapies for hepatic artery stenosis post liver transplantation [^aeb3f2e8]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Stenosis has been found to occur at the anastomotic site in 70% of cases (Kodama et al.) and within 3 months after transplantation (Wozney et al; Abbasoglu et al; Kodama et al; Mondragon et al; Dodd et al; Glockner et al.).

Stenosis of the hepatic artery causes thrombosis because the hepatic arterial flow is static, resulting in hepatic necrosis (Wozney et al; Abbasoglu et al; Orons et al; Cotroneo et al.). Ischemia of the bile duct is also caused by hepatic artery stenosis, as the bile duct is fed primarily by the hepatic artery.

Our study suggests that PBA and stenting are similarly effective and safe in the treatment of HAS after liver transplantation. This might be contrary to the idea that stenting may be superior to PBA, but the results were consistent in terms of all short- and long-term outcomes of procedural success, complications, long-term patency, and graft and patient survival. Moreover, reinterventions were similarly in the three groups of patients.

Huang et al. (Huang et al.) suggests that PBA is superior to stent placement; Saad et al. (Saad et al.) suggests the same efficiency of these treatments. In contrast, Ueno et al. (Ueno et al.) reported 26 patients with stent placement who had fewer complications and shorter length of hospital stay compared to PBA, although restenosis was seen more often in the stent group.

However, PBA seems to offer safe results as long as the acute phase after transplant has passed (Orons et al; Rostambeigi et al; Kodama et al.).

Therefore, secondary considerations may be more important in making decisions about which treatment to use. For example, in the case of short concentric stenosis in a straight segment of the vessel, a simple PBA is a good option. Hamby et al. (Hamby et al.) have suggested that tortuous or kinked vessels may benefit from stent placement. On the other hand, a tortuous vessel proximal to the stenosis may make stent advancement to the stenotic site difficult, and angioplasty would be a better option. Until now, there have been not prospective randomized studies to define specific criteria for the choice between stenting, PBA, or both.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^8d1f3075]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation of Jaundice Patients with jaundice may present with no symptoms at all, or they may present with a life-threatening condition. The wide range of possibilities is based on the variety of underlying causes and whether disease onset is quick or slow moving. Patients presenting with acute illness, which is frequently caused by infection, may seek medical care because of fever, chills, abdominal pain, and flu-like symptoms. For these patients, the change in skin color may not be their greatest concern. Patients with noninfectious jaundice may complain of weight loss or pruritus. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom in patients with pancreatic or biliary tract cancers. 2 Even something as nonspecific as depression may be a presenting complaint in patients with chronic infectious hepatitis and in those with a history of alcoholism. 3, 4.

10 Hemolytic anemias usually result in mild bilirubin elevation, to about 5 mg per dL, with or without clinical jaundice. Hemolytic anemias result from abnormal red blood cell survival times. These anemias may occur because of membrane abnormalities or enzyme abnormalities. Other etiologies of hemolysis include autoimmune disorders, drugs, and defects in hemoglobin structure such as sickle cell disease and the thalassemias.
11. 1 Typically, the disease results in a mild decrease in the activity of the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase, causing an increase in the indirect fraction of serum bilirubin. Gilbert syndrome is typically an incidental finding on routine liver function tests, when the bilirubin level is slightly increased and all other liver function values are within normal limits.

Jaundice and further elevation of the bilirubin level may occur during periods of stress, fasting, or illness. However, these changes are usually transient, and there is no need to pursue treatment or liver biopsy.

1. Hepatitis A is usually a self-limited illness that presents with acute onset of jaundice. Hepatitis B and C infections often do not cause jaundice during the initial phases but can lead to progressive jaundice when chronic infection has progressed to liver cirrhosis. Epstein-Barr virus infection occasionally causes transient hepatitis and jaundice that resolve as the illness clears. 1, 8 Alcohol has been shown to affect bile acid uptake and secretion, resulting in cholestasis. Chronic alcohol use may result in fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis, with varying levels of jaundice. Fatty liver, the most common pathologic liver finding, usually results in mild symptoms without jaundice but occasionally progresses to cirrhosis.

Hepatitis secondary to alcohol use typically presents with acute onset of jaundice and more severe symptoms. Liver cell necrosis is indicated by highly elevated serum liver transaminase levels. 13 Two serious autoimmune diseases that directly affect the biliary system without causing much hepatitis are primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rare progressive liver disease that typically presents in middle-aged women. Fatigue and pruritus are common initial complaints, while jaundice is a later finding. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, another rare cholestatic entity, is more common in men; nearly 70 percent of patients also have inflammatory bowel disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis may lead to cholangiocarcinoma.
8. POSTHEPATIC CAUSES Cholelithiasis, or the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder, is a relatively common finding in adult patients, with or without symptoms of obstruction.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of hepatic artery stenosis after liver transplantation: potential role in changing the clinical algorithm [^6d0fd6dd]. Liver Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) is a common complication in liver transplant patients. Conventional angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has begun providing real-time angiographic-like images of vessels and allowing the accurate diagnosis of arterial diseases such as hepatic artery thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CEUS in depicting HAS after liver transplantation. Forty-seven liver transplant recipients underwent CEUS examinations with the intravenous injection of microbubble contrast agents. The reference standard was conventional angiography for 15 patients and computed tomographic angiography for 32 patients. The presence, degree, location, and type of HAS were evaluated. For the detection of HAS by CEUS, the following was found: an accuracy of 91.5% (43/47), a sensitivity of 92.3% (36/39), a specificity of 87.5% (7/8), a positive predictive value of 97.3% (36/37), and a negative predictive value of 70% (7/10). CEUS corrected false-positive findings on color Doppler ultrasound in 7 of 47 cases (14.9%). The accuracy of CEUS in identifying the location and type of HAS was 92.3% (36/39) and 84.6% (33/39), respectively. CEUS is a useful noninvasive technique for the detection of HAS in liver transplant patients because it provides comprehensive information, including the presence, location, degree, and type. A positive CEUS finding suggests angiography as the next step rather than a computed tomography scan and may thereby alter the clinical imaging algorithm.

### Hepatic artery stenosis following liver transplantation: significance of the tardus parvus waveform and the role of microbubble contrast media in the detection of a focal stenosis [^a43089e9]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the role of microbubble ultrasound contrast media in detecting stenosis of the post-liver transplant extrahepatic hepatic artery (HA) in the presence of the tardus parvus spectral Doppler waveform of the intrahepatic HA.

Materials and Methods

All post-liver transplant patients with a prolonged systolic acceleration time (SAT > 0.08s) and/or a reduced resistant index (RI < 0.50) of the HA (the tardus parvus waveform) on colour Doppler ultrasound (CDUS), were assessed with microbubble contrast medium for a focal arterial stenosis. Following microbubble contrast-enhanced CDUS, patients underwent arteriography or follow-up CDUS.

Results

A total of 2038 examinations were performed in 529 liver transplant recipients; 16 (3.02%) tardus parvus waveforms were identified. The median SAT of the intrahepatic HA was 0.18s (range 0.11–0.38s) and the RI 0.47 (range 0.22–0.58). No extrahepatic elevated peak systolic velocity (PSV), defined as above 1.00m/s, was detected on the baseline examinations. Following the administration of microbubble contrast, medium, PSV in the extrahepatic HA was elevated in 14 of 16 patients, (median = 2.15m/s, range = 1.44–3.10m/s); flow was not identified in two patients. Arteriography was performed in 10 patients and confirmed stenosis in eight (median grade of stenosis 93%, range 60–99%) and occlusion in two. The measured median PSV at contrast-enhanced CDUS in the stenosis group was 2.03m/sec (range 1.44–2.71m/sec). Repeat CDUS in six patients not undergoing arteriography showed resolution in four; one underwent re-transplantation before arteriography and one patient maintains a tardus parvus waveform. In transplant recipients undergoing arteriography during the study period (n = 55), no hepatic artery stenosis without a tardus parvus waveform was seen.

Conclusion

The tardus parvus waveform pattern is an excellent screening test for the presence of post-liver transplantation hepatic artery stenosis. There is only a limited role for microbubble ultrasound contrast agent in the presence of a tardus parvus waveform. It could be used following equivocal colour Doppler ultrasound, but arteriography will still be necessary.

### Hepatic artery stenosis after liver transplantation: is endovascular treatment always necessary? [^cc91657d]. Liver Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) is thought to predispose patients to biliary complications secondary to ischemic injury. Despite this, the clinical significance of HAS remains poorly defined. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and outcomes of HAS and to define which patients might benefit from endovascular treatment. From a prospective database of 662 adult patients undergoing liver transplantation between 2000 and 2011, we identified 54 patients who developed HAS. HAS was defined as any stenosis > 70% that was seen during multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) or digital subtraction angiography. The benefit of endovascular therapy was evaluated with propensity score matching. New biliary complications occurred in 17 patients (31.4%), and 23 of the 54 study patients with HAS received endovascular treatment. Among the propensity score-matched patients, the biliary stricture-free survival time was significantly longer for those who received endovascular therapy (P = 0.03). An incidental diagnosis (P = 0.07) and a time from transplantation > 6 months (P = 0.021) were associated with a reduced risk of developing biliary stricture. Patients with symptomatic HAS who received treatment had better biliary stricture-free survival than patients who were treated conservatively, although no significant difference was recorded (P = 0.11). No patient with asymptomatic HAS and normal liver function tests developed biliary strictures. In conclusion, HAS intervention was associated with improved biliary stricture-free survival. In patients with late-onset HAS (≥ 6 months) and asymptomatic patients, endovascular treatment is not warranted.

Procedures

Liver transplant recipients presenting with transaminitis underwent spectral Doppler ultrasound (US) and liver biopsy to determine the etiology of liver injury. Patients without immunological rejection who were suspected to have hepatic artery stenosis underwent conventional angiography to confirm the diagnosis. The decision to intervene directly in the hepatic artery versus embolization of an extra hepatic visceral artery was decided intra-procedurally between the interventional radiologist and the transplant surgeon. The primary factor favoring EHAI was hepatic artery tortuosity such that the stenosis was located within 2 cm of an acute arterial curvature/kink. Additionally, recent transplantation (less than 1 month after surgery) heavily favored EHAI to avoid the risk of hepatic artery anastomotic disruption.

During HAI procedures, the patient was fully anticoagulated with heparin prior to attempted crossing of a HAS, with a goal activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250 s or double the patient's baseline. The stenotic segment was crossed with gentle use of a coaxial system including microcatheters 2.4 French or smaller and microwires 0.018 inches or smaller. Verapamil (2.5 mg) was administered intra-arterially via a catheter in cases of hepatic artery spasm. The primary balloon used for angioplasty was the Sterling Monorail (Boston Scientific; Marlborough, MA). Stenting was pursued in cases where angioplasty was insufficient (residual stenosis greater than 20%). The primary stents used included the Rebel bare-metal stent (Boston Scientific; Marlborough, MA) and Viabahn covered stent-graft (Gore; Newark, DE). Following stent placement, the patient was immediately administered 300 mg clopidogrel and continued 75 mg clopidogrel daily for at least 3 months. HAI was considered technically successful when there was less than 20% residual stenosis of the treated hepatic artery, by visual estimate.
