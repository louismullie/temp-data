## Question

Is milrinone indicated only for stable angina?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether milrinone is indicated only for stable angina. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and whether angina is included. Then, I should review contemporary stable angina guidelines to see where milrinone fits, if at all. Next, I will consider the drug's mechanism of action and whether it aligns with antianginal goals. After that, I should examine clinical trial evidence for any angina-related outcomes. Finally, I need to assess safety considerations in ischemic patients and synthesize a clear, clinically grounded conclusion [^1134rPWd] [^115mKpYr] [^112CMae5].

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled indication, because I need to ensure we are not missing any official use-cases. Milrinone lactate injection is indicated for short-term intravenous treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure, with most controlled experience limited to 48 hours and no approval for oral formulations or long-term therapy; there is no mention of stability of angina, unstable angina, or any angina indication on the label, and long-term use has been linked to increased hospitalization and mortality in heart failure populations [^1134rPWd] [^113n3r8d] [^115i9rAR].

> Next, I should review guideline-based therapy for chronic stable angina to see if milrinone appears anywhere; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I check multiple sources. Standard antianginal regimens emphasize beta-blockers, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers, with adjuncts such as ranolazine or ivabradine when needed; device-free inotropes like milrinone are not part of symptom-control strategies for stable angina in major reviews or guidance, and approved antianginal labels include agents such as diltiazem rather than PDE3 inhibitors like milrinone [^115mKpYr] [^112CMae5] [^111sJbYG] [^11713b2i] [^112Jhvog].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action and ask whether it plausibly treats angina physiology. Milrinone is a selective PDE3 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, yielding positive inotropy with vasodilation and minimal direct chronotropy; while those hemodynamic effects improve cardiac output in heart failure, they do not directly address the core antianginal targets of reducing myocardial oxygen demand via heart-rate lowering or reliably improving coronary supply-demand balance as achieved by established antianginals, so the pharmacology does not map to first-line ischemia relief strategies in stable angina [^111gULLn] [^113cbL6D].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical trial landscape to ensure there aren't angina data that would change practice. Large randomized trials of milrinone evaluated heart failure or cardiogenic shock, not stable angina, and did not demonstrate patient-centered benefits; for example, OPTIME-CHF showed no improvement in days hospitalized and more hypotension and atrial arrhythmias, the PROMISE trial found increased mortality with oral milrinone in chronic HFrEF, and DOREMI in cardiogenic shock found no advantage over dobutamine; systematic reviews in critically ill cardiac populations likewise fail to show benefit on key outcomes, and there are no randomized trials here demonstrating antianginal efficacy [^116AbuuV] [^114LJkHf] [^115w6vzk] [^113QrPnk].

> But wait, what if there are perioperative or niche data in angina patients that I'm overlooking. A small randomized perioperative CABG study in patients with stable angina showed milrinone improved diastolic relaxation indices immediately after bypass, but that setting reflects intraoperative hemodynamic optimization rather than chronic antianginal therapy, so it does not establish an indication for treating angina symptoms in ambulatory care [^112YyPik].

> I need to assess safety in the context of myocardial ischemia because adverse hemodynamics could aggravate angina. The FDA label reports ventricular arrhythmias in about 12 percent of treated patients and includes hypotension and chest pain/angina among adverse events; I initially assumed the inotropic effect might increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen ischemia, but wait, let me verify the label's physiologic statements — interestingly, in heart failure studies the sponsor notes no increased effect on myocardial oxygen consumption, although the risks of hypotension and arrhythmias remain clinically relevant in ischemic patients and may destabilize supply-demand balance during episodes, which argues against use for stable angina symptom control [^1178EBJk] [^113cbL6D].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my conclusion against guidelines and labeling one more time. There is no FDA indication for milrinone in stable angina, major angina reviews and guideline frameworks do not include milrinone as an antianginal, the mechanism does not align with core antianginal targets, and clinical trials do not demonstrate angina benefits; conversely, there are meaningful safety concerns in ischemic populations, so milrinone should not be used for stable angina, and management should rely on established therapies such as beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and adjuncts like ranolazine or ivabradine as clinically indicated [^1134rPWd] [^115mKpYr] [^112CMae5] [^111sJbYG] [^11713b2i].

Milrinone is **not indicated for stable angina** [^115mKpYr]. It is approved only for short-term intravenous use in acute decompensated heart failure [^1134rPWd] and is not recommended for chronic or outpatient therapy [^113n3r8d] because of risks of ventricular arrhythmias, hypotension, and increased mortality with long-term use [^1178EBJk] [^114LJkHf]. For stable angina, use **guideline-directed antianginals** [^112CMae5] [^115mKpYr] (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, ranolazine, ivabradine) [^11713b2i] [^111sJbYG] and reserve milrinone for acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock when indicated [^1134rPWd] [^115w6vzk].

---

## Pharmacological profile of milrinone

Milrinone is a **selective phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor** [^111gULLn] with positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, increasing intracellular cAMP to enhance contractility and reduce afterload [^113cbL6D]. It has minimal chronotropic effect and is structurally distinct from catecholamines and digitalis glycosides [^1141xrSa].

---

## Clinical indications and approved uses

Milrinone is approved for **short-term intravenous treatment** of acute decompensated heart failure, typically for up to 48 hours [^1134rPWd]. It is used in critical care and perioperative settings [^111x6Zxh] for acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock [^115w6vzk], and as a bridge to transplant or mechanical circulatory support in advanced heart failure [^112M47vB].

---

## Evidence regarding milrinone in stable angina

There is **no evidence supporting milrinone for stable angina** [^112CMae5] [^115mKpYr]. Its hemodynamic profile (inotropy, vasodilation) does not address the core pathophysiology — an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand due to fixed coronary obstruction [^114eteL7].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Milrinone carries significant risks, especially with prolonged use; **these outweigh any theoretical benefit** in stable angina, where safer, evidence-based therapies exist:

- **Ventricular arrhythmias**: Reported in 12.1% of patients [^1178EBJk], including nonsustained VT (2.8%), sustained VT (1%), and ventricular fibrillation (0.2%) [^1178EBJk].
- **Hypotension**: Occurs in 2.9% of patients [^1178EBJk].
- **Angina/chest pain**: Reported in 1.2% of patients [^1178EBJk].
- **Increased mortality**: Long-term use is associated with higher mortality in chronic heart failure [^113n3r8d] [^114LJkHf].

---

## Comparison with standard antianginal therapies

Standard antianginal therapies are **effective and safer** than milrinone:

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Reduce HR and contractility | - First-line [^115mKpYr] <br/> - Reduce angina and improve outcomes [^112CMae5] | Well-established |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Vasodilation <br/> - Reduced afterload | - Effective [^112Jhvog] <br/> - Improve exercise tolerance [^111sJbYG] | Well-established |
| Nitrates | - Vasodilation <br/> - Reduced preload | - Effective [^11713b2i] <br/> - Improve symptoms [^115mKpYr] | Well-established |
| Ranolazine | Reduces myocardial ischemia [^111sJbYG] | - Effective <br/> - Improves exercise tolerance [^112CMae5] | Well-established |
| Ivabradine | Lowers HR [^114eteL7] | Effective in selected patients [^111sJbYG] | Well-established |

---

Milrinone **does not match these therapies in efficacy or safety** for stable angina [^1134rPWd] [^116AbuuV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **do not recommend milrinone for stable angina** [^115mKpYr] [^112CMae5]. It is reserved for acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock [^1134rPWd] [^115w6vzk]; using it for stable angina is unsupported and potentially harmful [^113n3r8d].

---

## Clinical scenarios where milrinone might be considered

Milrinone may be considered only when stable angina coexists with acute decompensated heart failure [^1134rPWd] or cardiogenic shock [^115w6vzk], or as a bridge to transplant or mechanical support in advanced heart failure [^112M47vB] [^115L2YMV]. It is **not appropriate for isolated stable angina**.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Milrinone is **not indicated for stable angina** because of a lack of evidence [^115mKpYr] and significant risks, including arrhythmias, hypotension, and increased mortality with long-term use [^1178EBJk] [^113n3r8d]. Use **guideline-directed antianginals** for stable angina [^112CMae5], and reserve milrinone for acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock when indicated [^1134rPWd] [^115w6vzk].

### Stable angina pectoris: Antianginal therapies and future directions [^111sJbYG]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011).

Advances in pharmacotherapy for stable angina have produced a wide choice of drugs with various mechanisms of action, potentially enabling individualized, patient-specific treatment strategies to be developed. In this review, the various treatment options for patients with stable angina are discussed. Data from randomized clinical trials of established and novel drugs are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the proposed mechanisms of action, benefits of therapy, and adverse-effect profiles.

- **Role of coronary revascularization**: The role of coronary revascularization in conjunction with optimal medical therapy as a treatment strategy is discussed, although drug therapy might reduce the need for prompt revascularization if the procedure is being considered solely for the purpose of alleviating angina.

- **Stimulation of angiogenesis**: Finally, trials to investigate stimulation of angiogenesis using growth-factor, gene, and cell therapy are used to illustrate the challenges of chemically inducing the growth of adequate, durable blood vessels.

Coronary heart disease is a chronic, systemic disease with a wide range of associated symptoms, clinical outcomes, and health care expenditure. Adverse events from coronary heart disease can be mitigated or avoided with lifestyle and risk factor modifications and medical therapy. These measures are effective in slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease and in reducing the risk of thrombosis in the setting of plaque disruptions. With increasing effectiveness of prevention and medical therapy, the role of coronary artery revascularization has decreased and is largely confined to subgroups of patients with unacceptable angina, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or high-risk coronary anatomy. There is a compelling need to allocate resources appropriately to improve prevention. Herein, we review the scientific evidence in support of medical therapy and revascularization for the management of patients with stable coronary heart disease and discuss implications for the evaluation of patients with stable angina and public policy.

- **Adverse reactions**:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: In patients receiving milrinone during Phase II and III clinical trials, ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 12.1% of cases. Breakdown of these events includes ventricular ectopic activity (8.5%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (2.8%), sustained ventricular tachycardia (1%), and ventricular fibrillation (0.2%). Two patients experienced more than one type of arrhythmia. Holter recordings indicated that in some patients, the injection of milrinone increased ventricular ectopy, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Life-threatening arrhythmias were infrequent and, when present, were associated with certain underlying factors such as preexisting arrhythmias, metabolic abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia), abnormal digoxin levels, and catheter insertion. Milrinone was not shown to be arrhythmogenic in an electrophysiology study. Supraventricular arrhythmias were reported in 3.8% of the patients receiving milrinone. The incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias has not been related to the dose or plasma milrinone concentration. Other cardiovascular adverse reactions include hypotension (2.9%) and angina or chest pain (1.2%). In the post-marketing experience, there have been rare cases of "torsades de pointes" reported.

- **CNS effects**: Headaches, usually mild to moderate in severity, have been reported in 2.9% of patients receiving milrinone.

- **Other effects**: Additional adverse reactions reported, though not definitively related to milrinone administration, include hypokalemia (0.6%), tremor (0.4%), and thrombocytopenia (0.4%).

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^1134rPWd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Milrinone lactate injection is indicated for the short-term intravenous treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Patients receiving milrinone should be observed closely with appropriate electrocardiographic equipment. The facility for immediate treatment of potential cardiac events, which may include life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, must be available. The majority of experience with intravenous milrinone has been in patients receiving digoxin and diuretics. There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^113n3r8d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Whether administered orally or by continuous or intermittent intravenous infusion, milrinone has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for long-term treatment (exceeding 48 hours) in patients with heart failure. In a multicenter trial involving 1,088 patients with Class III and IV heart failure, long-term oral treatment with milrinone showed no symptom improvement and was linked to increased hospitalization and mortality. Patients with Class IV symptoms faced a particular risk of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions. Evidence does not suggest that milrinone, when given by long-term continuous or intermittent infusion, does not carry a similar risk.

Use of milrinone, both intravenously and orally, has been associated with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Long-term oral usage has been linked to an elevated risk of sudden death. Consequently, patients receiving milrinone should be monitored closely through continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to enable the prompt detection and management of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Management of persistent angina after myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: Insights from the TRANSLATE-ACS study [^113nnyeE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, physicians may fail to recognize the importance of treating angina or the effectiveness of existing antianginal medications, as evidenced by a consistent lack of treatment, even in the face of very frequent or persistent symptoms. Despite guidelines recommending the use of at least two classes of antianginal medications (a β‐blocker plus one additional agent) for patients with chronic angina, there is no evidence that non–β‐blocker antianginal medications reduce cardiovascular mortality or clinical events in the post‐MI setting.

However, all three classes of non–β‐blocker antianginal medications increase exercise duration and time to electrocardiographic ischemia in patients with stable angina. We found that patients with angina have a worse quality of life across multiple domains than those without angina, and antianginal medications may help patients increase activity level and exercise capacity and, in turn, improve quality of life. Angina is also the factor most strongly associated with hospitalization within the 12 months following an index MI.

Furthermore, there may be cost or logistical barriers to the prescription of ranolazine, which is not yet available in generic form; however, low rates of prescription of nitrates and calcium channel blockers argue against cost being a major driver of this finding. Lastly, treatment inertia may be playing a role: among patients with angina over the entirety of the study period, those who were treated with a non–β‐blocker antianginal medication at the time of their index MI discharge were 30-fold more likely to continue using the same treatment.

### Therapeutic approaches for the no-option refractory angina patient [^111jbsvw]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

The combination of an aging population and improved survival rates among patients with coronary artery disease has resulted in an increase in the number of patients with refractory angina or anginal equivalent symptoms despite maximal medical therapy. Patients with refractory angina are often referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory; however, they have often exhausted conventional revascularization options; thus, this population is often deemed as having "no options". We review the definition, prevalence, outcomes, therapeutic options, and treatment considerations for no-option refractory angina patients and focus on novel therapies for this complex and challenging population. We propose a multidisciplinary team approach for the evaluation and management of patients with refractory angina, ideally in a designated clinic. The severe limitations and symptomatology experienced by these patients highlight the need for additional research into the development of innovative treatments.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^115i9rAR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Following intravenous injections of 12.5 mcg/kg to 125 mcg/kg to patients with congestive heart failure, milrinone had a volume of distribution of 0.38 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.3 hours, and a clearance of 0.13 liters/kg/hr. Following intravenous infusions of 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.7 mcg/kg/min to the same patient group, the drug had a volume of distribution of about 0.45 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.4 hours, and a clearance of 0.14 liters/kg/hr. These pharmacokinetic parameters were not dose-dependent, although the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve following injections was significantly dose-dependent.

Milrinone has been shown, through equilibrium dialysis, to be approximately 70% bound to human plasma protein.

- **Excretion**: The primary route of excretion of milrinone in humans is via urine. The major urinary excretions of orally administered milrinone are milrinone (83%) and its O-glucuronide metabolite (12%). Elimination in normal subjects via urine is rapid, with approximately 60% recovered within the first two hours following dosing and approximately 90% recovered within the first eight hours. The mean renal clearance of milrinone is approximately 0.3 liters/min, indicative of active secretion.

### Repetitive milrinone therapy in ambulatory advanced heart failure patients [^116CHn3v]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

In this small cohort of advanced heart failure (HF) patients, we demonstrated the safety and potential efficacy of repetitive intermittent intravenous (IV) milrinone therapy in stabilizing advanced HF patients and allowing them to better tolerate neurohormonal therapy. Our findings are reinforced by the fact that, compared with recent HF trials, our small registry comprised advanced HF patients and included elderly, ischemic patients with a high prevalence of significant kidney disease.

Hemodynamic studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effect of inotropes in HF. Specifically, cyclic AMP-based inotropes (e.g. milrinone) were found to decrease systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, improve cardiac output, and induce a smaller increase in oxygen consumption compared with dobutamine or epinephrine, making them compelling agents for HF management. Unfortunately, large-scale clinical trials showed that despite these hemodynamic effects, long-term inotropic therapy was associated with increased mortality rates. Consequently, guideline documents advocate against the use of inotropes in most clinical scenarios and recommend considering inotropic support either as a short-term tool for clinical stabilization or as a means to improve quality of life in end-stage HF patients.

Contemporary small-scale (usually single-center) registries have reported better-than-expected clinical results in advanced HF patients receiving continuous inotropic support. These findings might be explained by the prevalent use of beta-blocking agents and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in practice.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^113cbL6D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In patients with heart failure due to depressed myocardial function, milrinone produced a prompt dose- and plasma concentration-related increase in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and vascular resistance. These changes were accompanied by mild-to-moderate increases in heart rate. Notably, there is no increased effect on myocardial oxygen consumption. In uncontrolled studies, hemodynamic improvement during intravenous therapy with milrinone was accompanied by clinical symptomatic improvement. However, the ability of milrinone to relieve symptoms has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The great majority of patients experience improvements in hemodynamic function within 5 to 15 minutes of the initiation of therapy.

In studies on patients with congestive heart failure, milrinone, when administered as a loading injection followed by a maintenance infusion, produced significant mean initial increases in cardiac index. The increases were 25 percent, 38 percent, and 42 percent at dose regimens of 37.5 mcg/kg/0.375 mcg/kg/min, 50 mcg/kg/0.5 mcg/kg/min, and 75 mcg/kg/0.75 mcg/kg/min, respectively. Over the same range of loading injections and maintenance infusions, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased by 20 percent, 23 percent, and 36 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased by 17 percent, 21 percent, and 37 percent. Mean arterial pressure fell by up to 5 percent at the two lower dose regimens, but by 17 percent at the highest dose. Patients evaluated for 48 hours maintained improvement.

### Old drug, new trick? Oral milrinone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^117LqrRo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The discussion of drug efficacy is unavoidable but should be tempered by the reminder that this study was quite small and primarily designed to assess safety. In this regard, it clearly succeeded. Evaluation of the effectiveness is most helpful in considering how future studies might be designed, including continued evaluation of its safety profile. This work serves as a reminder that there may be old tools long since retired for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction that may hold mechanistic and even therapeutic relevance when applied to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where help is so urgently needed. We could only hope to be so fortunate if "the old is new again".

### Palliative inotropes in advanced heart failure: Comparing outcomes between milrinone and dobutamine [^115FBj73]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Low credibility.

We sought to describe and compare outcomes among advanced patients with heart failure (not candidates for orthotopic heart transplant/left ventricular assist device) on long-term milrinone or dobutamine, which are not well-studied in the contemporary era.

- **Methods and results**: We included adults with refractory stage D heart failure who were not candidates for orthotopic heart transplant or left ventricular assist device and were discharged on palliative dobutamine or milrinone. The primary outcome was 1-year survival. A 6-month predictor of survival analysis was conducted. A total of 248 patients (133 on milrinone, 115 on dobutamine) were included. There were no differences in baseline comorbidities between milrinone and dobutamine cohorts, except for the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which was higher in the dobutamine group. On discharge, the proportion of patients on beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists was higher in the milrinone group. Overall, the 1-year mortality rate was 70%. The dobutamine cohort had a significantly higher 1-year mortality rate (84% vs 58%, P < 0.001). The type of inotrope did not predict survival at 6 months when adjusted for discharge medications and comorbidities. Beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor continued at discharge predicted survival at 6 months.

- **Conclusions**: The 1-year mortality from palliative inotropes remains high. Compared with dobutamine, use of milrinone was associated with improved survival owing to better optimization of guide.

### Repetitive milrinone therapy in ambulatory advanced heart failure patients [^112YHhVH]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Following repetitive milrinone therapy, a significant reduction in brain natriuretic peptide levels was noted.

During IV milrinone therapy, we observed an improvement in symptoms and functional class, with the number of patients classified as NYHA III and IV reduced from 71% and 29% to 54% and 0% (p = .027 and .01, respectively). The number of heart failure hospitalizations per year, pre- and post-milrinone therapy, remained stable (1.17 ± 1.17 vs. 1.16 ± 1.7, p = .98). Notably, during the pre-milrinone period, 16 patients had a total of 28 hospitalizations, whereas in the post-milrinone period, 11 patients had a total of 22 hospitalizations. Out of these 22 hospitalizations, 8 were for one patient.

Although the 6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were not part of our scheduled follow-up, CPET results in 13 patients demonstrated a significant increase in exercise duration (238 ± 51 to 264 ± 57 seconds, p = .04). There was a trend toward improvement in workload (119 ± 28 to 129 ± 36 watts, p = .11) and ventilatory efficiency (37.6 ± 3.8 to 36.2 ± 3.9, p = .11) following milrinone therapy.

- **Examining the treatment effect on arrhythmias**: Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred in six versus four patients pre- and post-milrinone therapy, respectively. Two patients (in both time periods) required implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock therapy.

### Heart failure etiology and response to milrinone in decompensated heart failure: Results from the OPTIME-CHF study [^112AHGjC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to assess the interaction between heart failure (HF) etiology and response to milrinone in decompensated HF. Etiology has prognostic and therapeutic implications in HF, but its relationship to response to inotropic therapy is unknown.

The Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study randomized 949 patients with systolic dysfunction and decompensated HF to receive 48 to 72 hours of intravenous milrinone or placebo. The primary endpoint was days hospitalized from cardiovascular causes within 60 days. In a post-hoc analysis, the interaction between response to milrinone and etiology of HF was evaluated.

The primary endpoint was 13.0 days for ischemic patients and 11.7 days for nonischemic patients (p = 0.2). Sixty-day mortality was 11.6% for the ischemic group and 7.5% for the nonischemic group (p = 0.03). After adjustment for baseline differences, a significant interaction between etiology and the effect of milrinone was observed. Milrinone-treated patients with ischemic etiology tended to have worse outcomes than those treated with placebo in terms of the primary endpoint (13.6 days for milrinone vs. 12.4 days for placebo, p = 0.055 for interaction) and the composite of death or rehospitalization (42% vs. 36% for placebo, p = 0.01 for interaction). In contrast, outcomes in nonischemic patients treated with milrinone tended to be improved in terms of the primary endpoint (10.9 vs. 12.6 days placebo) and the composite of death or rehospitalization.

### Extended release oral milrinone, CRD-102, for advanced heart failure [^114MdyK9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Although heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are effective therapies for patients with advanced heart failure (HF), many patients are ineligible due to co-morbidities. Continuous home intravenous therapy with positive inotropes, such as milrinone, is used in these patients to improve quality of life. We hypothesized that, unlike previous studies with oral milrinone, a slow-release formulation that provides stable lower plasma levels may be better tolerated and provide symptomatic benefit. Accordingly, we developed an extended release milrinone formulation (CRD-102) and evaluated its effects in 26 patients with no-option Stage D HF. One month after open-label therapy, there were significant improvements in NYHA class, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score, and 6-minute walk distance. There was no evidence of hypotension or increased arrhythmic burden. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates evidence of beneficial actions of extended release milrinone in advanced HF. Longer-term randomized clinical trial data are required.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^113QrPnk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Milrinone is an inotrope widely used for the treatment of cardiac failure. Because previous meta-analyses had methodological flaws, we decided to conduct a systematic review of the effect of milrinone in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction.

- **Methods**: This systematic review was performed according to The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Searches were conducted until November 2015. Patients with cardiac dysfunction were included. The primary outcome was serious adverse events (SAE) including mortality at maximum follow-up. The risk of bias was evaluated and trial sequential analyses were conducted. The quality of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria.

- **Results**: A total of 31 randomised clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 16 provided data for our analyses. All trials were at high risk of bias, and none reported the primary composite outcome SAE. Fourteen trials with 1611 randomised patients reported mortality data at maximum follow-up (RR 0.96; 95% confidence interval 0.76–1.21). Milrinone did not significantly affect other patient-centred outcomes. All analyses displayed statistical and/or clinical heterogeneity of patients, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and/or settings and all featured missing data.

- **Discussion**: The evidence on the use of milrinone in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction suffers from considerable risks of both bias and random error and demonstrates no benefits.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^1135XBEn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The duration of therapy should depend upon patient responsiveness.

Milrinone exhibits a favorable inotropic effect in fully digitalized patients without causing signs of glycoside toxicity. Theoretically, in cases of atrial flutter or fibrillation, milrinone may increase ventricular response rate due to its slight enhancement of AV node conduction. In these situations, digitalis should be considered prior to the initiation of therapy with milrinone.

Improvement in left ventricular function in patients with ischemic heart disease has been observed without inducing symptoms or electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia.

The steady-state plasma milrinone concentrations, after approximately 6 to 12 hours of consistent maintenance infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, are approximately 200 ng/mL. Near maximum favorable effects of milrinone on cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are observed at plasma milrinone concentrations in the 150 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL range.

### Treatment of patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112P14SA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of patients who present with suspected unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is especially challenging. Therapies that demonstrate benefit in patients who experience proven disease may not be indicated in patients who present with suspected disease. The emergency practitioner must have a clear understanding of the benefit and harm of each therapy, allowing formulation of a simple approach to treatment selection based on disease presentation. This article reviews literature and discusses the treatment recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) for patients who experience UA and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

### Home milrinone in pediatric hospice care of children with heart failure [^116S1rX1]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Low credibility.

The symptom profile of children dying from cardiac disease, particularly heart failure, differs from those with cancer and other non-cardiac conditions. Treatment with vasoactive infusions at home may be a superior therapy for symptom control for these patients, rather than traditional pain and anxiety management with morphine and benzodiazepines.

- **Objectives**: We report our experience using outpatient milrinone in children receiving hospice care for end-stage heart failure.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a contemporary cohort of all patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford, who were discharged on intravenous milrinone and hospice care between 2008 and 2021 was conducted. Clinical data, including cardiac diagnosis, milrinone dose and route of administration, total milrinone days, symptoms reported, rehospitalization rates, therapies, and complications were analyzed.

- **Results**: Among 8 patients, the median duration of home milrinone infusion was 191 (33, 572) days, with the longest support duration of 1,054 days. All patients (100%) were also receiving diuretics at the time of death. Five patients (63%) were receiving no other pain control medications until the active phase of dying. From milrinone initiation to the last outpatient assessment, a reduction in the number of patients reporting respiratory discomfort, abdominal pain, weight loss/lack of appetite, and fatigue was observed. Six patients (75%) died at home.

- **Conclusion**: We used milrinone with oral diuretics effectively for symptom control in children with heart failure on palliative care. Our experience was that this combination of treatments significantly aided in symptom management.

### Safety of outpatient milrinone infusion in end-stage heart failure: ICD-level data on atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias [^113aM7NZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Milrinone infusion is one of a few select "non-device" therapies for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, stage D heart failure, which has been associated with an increase in ventricular tachyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation. Milrinone improves hemodynamics and provides symptomatic relief. Many patients with end-stage heart failure die from cardiac pump failure, and the impact of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation on their mortality is unclear.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of 98 consecutive patients receiving outpatient milrinone in a single center from 2008 to 2016. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival on milrinone. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of post-milrinone implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks and development of ventricular tachyarrhythmia or atrial fibrillation.

- **Results**: Median survival was 581 ± 96 days with no difference between those with prior ventricular tachyarrhythmia and those without at 1 month (92% vs 97%, P = 0.34), 6 months (67% vs 73%, P = 0.75), and 12 months (67% vs 61%, P = 0.88). Seven out of 12 (58%) patients with prior ventricular tachyarrhythmia had ICD shocks, as compared to 5 out of 78 (6.4%) (P < 0.001). Thirty-five patients had atrial fibrillation prior to starting milrinone, which decreased to 72% (P < 0.05) by the third follow-up time period (7–9 months). Amiodarone use was protective against new onset atrial fibrillation.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with stage D heart failure with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia have similar survival on.

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116UrJMN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In a pilot study of patients with HFpEF, a short duration of treatment with extended-release oral milrinone appeared to be safe and resulted in improved quality of life and functional capacity without an increase in adverse events. Further, longer-term studies are warranted to establish the potential role of this therapeutic approach in HFpEF.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^114LJkHf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Two landmark trials examined the benefit of milrinone therapy in heart failure. The Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation (PROMISE), published in 1991, randomized 1,088 ambulatory patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and NYHA class III–IV symptoms to receive either 40 mg of oral milrinone daily or a placebo, following the patients for a median of 6.1 months. Patients with chronic heart failure were on contemporaneous therapy of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Compared with placebo, milrinone therapy was associated with a 28% increase in all-cause mortality and a 34% increase in cardiovascular mortality. Patients treated with milrinone also experienced more hospitalizations and more serious adverse reactions, including hypotension and syncope. The investigators concluded that "despite its beneficial haemodynamic actions, long-term therapy with oral milrinone increases the morbidity and mortality of patients with severe chronic heart failure".

The Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) trial was published in 2002 and randomized 951 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic heart failure to 48-hour infusions of either milrinone (initially at 0.5 μg/kg/min) or a saline placebo. The results did not significantly differ in mortality or readmission endpoints. However, those randomized to milrinone experienced more clinically relevant hypotension and atrial arrhythmias, and patients with ischaemic heart disease had significantly elevated risks.

### Old drug, new trick? Oral milrinone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1176MdSc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

One may also question the reasoning behind the utilization of a known inotrope in HFpEF, where the above-noted precedent would warn of more potential for harm than good. The work described here is, of course, not just a last-ditch effort because of the HFpEF syndrome's growing burden on the healthcare system and status as one of cardiology's lasting enigmas. In fact, there is reasonable rationale for the use of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone for this phenotypically diverse syndrome. The search for common pathophysiologic underpinnings that could serve as therapeutic targets received a blueprint with the paradigm set forth by Paulus et al. in 2013.

In this model, the prominent form of HFpEF was attributed to vascular endothelial inflammation and dysfunction secondary to comorbidities, manifesting in the multiorgan dysfunction seen in the HFpEF syndrome. The proposed culprit in this model was a loss of the key effector molecule, nitric oxide, where in the setting of widespread inflammation and reactive oxygen species, a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability could lead to several detriments. Among these detriments is cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and deposition of interstitial collagen that result in diastolic dysfunction, as well as vascular dysfunction characterized by resting vasoconstriction and impaired sensitivity to nitric-oxide-mediated vasodilation. Amelioration of such a pathway provided hope for a potential silver bullet or at least a first effective therapy.

As is well known, the series of trials targeting this pathway in HFpEF — in particular, the pho-

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112fPopj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In the absence of a clear influence of milrinone on resting measures of left ventricular (LV) filling pressures, it is relevant to consider other means by which phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition may have improved quality of life. First, assessments of LV diastolic performance were conducted only at rest. It is possible that the actions of low-dose oral milrinone on LV filling may be evident only during physical activity.

Second, milrinone exerts several other potentially favorable actions on key pathophysiologic targets, including left and right ventricular contractility and pulmonary and systemic vascular impedance. For example, in previous work from our group, we randomized HFpEF patients to intravenous milrinone or saline in patients undergoing exercise hemodynamic evaluation. Milrinone administration was associated with a significant reduction in right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures at rest and during exercise. Furthermore, the positive inotropic effects of milrinone may potentiate reductions in filling pressure. Previous work has demonstrated coexistent systolic impairment in HFpEF despite a preserved ejection fraction, with reductions in LV global longitudinal strain and exercise LV stroke work index. Further work is required to define the pharmacodynamic relationship between milrinone levels and key physiologic parameters.

Oral formulations of milrinone have previously been trialed in HFrEF with disappointing outcomes. The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Chest Pain Evaluation) trial, published in 1991, did not show favorable results.

### Treatment of stable angina pectoris with ivabradine in everyday practice: A Pan-Hellenic, prospective, noninterventional study [^114N4URg]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Stable angina pectoris (AP) is a common clinical expression of myocardial ischemia. Angina significantly limits the ordinary activities of most of these patients and worsens their quality of life (QOL) in terms not only of physical activity/pain but also mental health. Medical treatment is the main clinical strategy for controlling ischemia and angina symptoms while restoring a satisfactory level of usual activities and improving QOL.

Ivabradine is a heart rate–lowering agent that inhibits the sinus node I f pacemaker but does not directly affect other cardiac or hemodynamic parameters. By reducing heart rate, ivabradine reduces oxygen demand, and by prolonging diastolic time and enabling coronary vasodilation, it maximizes myocardial oxygen supply and facilitates diastolic left ventricular (LV) filling during exercise. Ivabradine is currently indicated for patients with chronic stable angina who are intolerant to or inadequately controlled by β‐blocker therapy, as well as for patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes II–IV) with systolic dysfunction, in combination with standard therapy. The indication in chronic stable angina is based mainly on the results of several studies that have proven the antianginal and anti‐ischemic effect of ivabradine in patients with CAD. In the ADDITIONS study and several others, the addition of ivabradine not only reduced heart rate and the number of angina attacks but also significantly improved QOL for these patients.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^117Ecq2A]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Co-interventions with medications that have an efficacy profile similar to milrinone might have obscured the results. Trials evaluating milrinone versus placebo could also be considered add-on trials since co-interventions were allowed. The largest trial evaluating milrinone versus placebo allowed at least co-interventions with dobutamine in their randomized patients; other inotropes were not reported. The results of this trial suggest that milrinone may be harmful in patients with heart failure (LVEF < 40%) compared with standard treatment (ACE inhibitor and diuretics). Furthermore, the sickest patients were excluded from this trial.

For daily practice, it is of utmost interest to know which vasopressor, inotrope, vasodilator, or any combination is indicated for which patient and at what target. We found that for milrinone and levosimendan in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction, evidence from trials with a low risk of bias and low risk of random error is lacking to support its use. Other interventions are currently being evaluated in systematic reviews, which might feed future evidence-based guidance for clinicians or substantiate new trials.

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112586gA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent form of heart failure, representing half of the total burden of the condition. We hypothesized that modulation of the phosphodiesterase type 3/cyclic AMP pathway using a novel oral formulation of milrinone might exert favorable effects via pulmonary and systemic vasodilation and enhancement of ventricular relaxation. We assessed the safety and efficacy of oral milrinone on quality of life and functional outcomes in patients with HFpEF.

- **Methods and results**: The Mil (Extended-release Oral Milrinone for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in 23 patients with symptomatic HFpEF. Efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score and 6-minute walk distance. The primary safety endpoint was the development of clinically significant arrhythmia. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score improved significantly in milrinone-treated patients compared with placebo (+10 ± 13 versus −3 ± 15; P = 0.046). The 6-minute walk distance also tended to improve in the treatment group compared with placebo (+22 [−8 to 49] versus −47 [−97 to 12]; P = 0.092). Heart rate (−1 ± 5 versus −2 ± 9 bpm; P = 0.9) and systolic blood pressure (−3 ± 18 versus +1 ± 12 mm Hg; P = 0.57) were unchanged. Early filling velocity/early mitral annular velocity (−0.3 ± 3.0 versus −1.9 ± 4.8; P = 0.38) was unchanged. One patient in the placebo arm was hospitalized for heart failure. Holter monitoring did not demonstrate any significant findings.

### The use of continuous milrinone therapy as bridge to transplant is safe in patients with short waiting times [^112M47vB]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

The limited availability of donor organs creates a need for more effective management of heart disease when bridging a patient to cardiac transplant. Inotropic therapy is becoming more commonly used long term to maintain baseline function. The effectiveness and complications associated with their use have not been fully evaluated, and indications for mechanical versus medical therapy as a bridge have not been delineated.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milrinone as a bridge to transplant. This was a retrospective study of 60 patients listed for a cardiac transplant and committed to home intravenous milrinone therapy. A subgroup of patients who eventually progressed to the use of a ventricular assist device were analyzed. Complications and survivals were analyzed for each group. Forty-six patients (76%) were successfully bridged to transplant with milrinone alone, while 14 patients' (24%) conditions deteriorated and required a left ventricular assist device (LVAD); 1-year survivals were 83% and 71%, respectively. The mean waiting time was 59.5 days (9–257 days) for patients receiving milrinone who did not require an LVAD and 112 days (24–270 days) for those whose conditions deteriorated to require an LVAD.

This study suggests that chronic intravenous milrinone provides an adequate strategy as a bridge to transplant if the waiting time is short (< 100 days), whereas an elective ventricular assist device implantation may be a safer strategy for patients expected to wait longer.

### A randomized multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous milrinone and intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with advanced heart failure [^116t6jUh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

A randomized, open-label, parallel-group design was employed to determine the percentage of patients achieving improvements in predetermined baseline hemodynamic endpoints, which included a greater than 20% to 30% increase in cardiac index, depending on baseline values, and a greater than 25% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. These were assessed at hour 0 (end of initial dose titration) and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after the infusion of milrinone or nitroglycerin.

In total, 125 patients (60 received milrinone, 65 received nitroglycerin) were enrolled in the study, with 119 patients (58 milrinone, 61 nitroglycerin) being evaluable for the efficacy analysis. A significantly greater proportion of milrinone-treated patients reached (45% vs. 14%, P = .005) and maintained (24% vs. 6%, P = .026) hemodynamic goals compared to nitroglycerin-treated patients. The time to achieve hemodynamic goals was significantly shorter for milrinone-treated patients (33 ± 2 vs. 54 ± 10 minutes, P < .001).

Milrinone was also significantly more effective in decreasing systemic vascular resistance (P = .004), increasing stroke volume (P = .008), and improving global clinical status. Inodilator therapy with milrinone appears to be more efficacious in achieving sustained hemodynamic improvement than pure intravenous vasodilator therapy with nitroglycerin in treating patients with decompensated heart failure.

### Repetitive milrinone therapy in ambulatory advanced heart failure patients [^1131gs1B]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) represents the extreme of HF and bears a grave prognosis. These patients usually poorly tolerate guideline-directed HF medical therapy (GDMT) and may need to undergo definitive treatments, such as left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation. Many of them, however, are found unsuitable for such therapies due to severe comorbidities or inappropriate settings related to the patients and their surroundings. In this case, supportive care is applied with an expectation to maintain a reasonable quality of life, and many times incorporates the use of inotropic therapy. The choice of inotropic agents, their mode of delivery, the adjunct therapy, and, importantly, the goal of treatment may differ significantly between HF centers. In this small cohort of ambulatory advanced HF patients, we evaluated for the first time the use of repetitive, intermittent short-term, intravenous (IV) milrinone therapy with an aim to relieve symptoms and introduce and up-titrate GDMT therapy.

### Milrinone improves diastolic function in coronary artery bypass surgery as assessed by acoustic quantification and peak filling rate: a prospective randomized study [^112YyPik]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2010). High credibility.

To compare the effects of a bolus dose of milrinone (50 microg/kg) to placebo on diastolic function (active relaxation) in patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at a university hospital.

Twenty-four patients with stable angina and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 30% scheduled for elective CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were included. Patients were randomized to receive either 50 microg/kg of milrinone (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12) after aortic declamping. The diastolic function of the left ventricle (LV) was measured as the peak filling rate (dA/dt [maximal diastolic area change over time]) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using acoustic quantification (AQ) before CPB and 10 minutes after termination of CPB. The normalized peak filling rate (dA/dt)/EDA was also calculated. Active relaxation was statistically significantly increased in the milrinone group compared with the placebo group after CPB.

Patients undergoing CABG surgery and treated with milrinone after aortic declamping had better diastolic function following cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Angina and future cardiovascular events in stable patients with coronary artery disease: Insights from the reduction of atherothrombosis for continued health (REACH) registry [^115iqLQr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Stable angina affects more than 8 million people in the United States each year. Patients with stable angina have reduced quality of life and utilize greater healthcare resources. The extent to which angina is independently associated with future cardiovascular events, or is just a marker of disease severity, has long been debated. While several studies have demonstrated that angina is independently associated with cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction (MI), others have not found a compelling association between angina and "hard" cardiovascular endpoints.

In addition, large-scale trials have shown that the alleviation of anginal symptoms by pharmacological treatment or by coronary revascularization improves quality of life measures but does not tend to decrease the rates of future MI or mortality. Furthermore, in outpatients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), most cardiovascular events actually occur in patients without prior angina. We therefore aimed to examine the independent association between angina at baseline and future cardiovascular events in patients with stable CAD who were included in a large international outpatient registry.

### Short-term intravenous milrinone for acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: A randomized controlled trial [^116AbuuV]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Little randomized evidence is available to guide the in-hospital management of patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Although intravenous inotropic therapy usually produces beneficial hemodynamic effects and is labeled for use in the care of such patients, the effect of such therapy on intermediate-term clinical outcomes is uncertain.

- **Objective**: To prospectively test whether a strategy that includes short-term use of milrinone, in addition to standard therapy, can improve clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of chronic heart failure.

- **Design**: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from July 1997 through November 1999.

- **Setting**: Seventy-eight community and tertiary care hospitals in the United States.

- **Participants**: A total of 951 patients admitted with an exacerbation of systolic heart failure not requiring intravenous inotropic support (mean age, 65 years; 92% with baseline New York Heart Association class III or IV; mean left ventricular ejection fraction, 23%).

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 48-hour infusion of either milrinone, 0.5 microg/kg per minute initially (n = 477), or saline placebo (n = 472).

- **Main outcome measure**: Cumulative days of hospitalization for cardiovascular cause within 60 days following randomization.

- **Results**: The median number of days hospitalized for cardiovascular causes within 60 days after randomization did not differ significantly between patients given milrinone (6 days) compared with placebo (7 days; p = 0.71).

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1149qCKz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Our systematic review evaluating the effects of milrinone for critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction found few data on outcomes critical for decision-making. Thirty-one randomised clinical trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All included trials had a high risk of bias, mostly due to not reporting bias protection, and nearly all trials had large risks of random errors. Fifteen trials only reported surrogate outcomes. No trial reported the primary outcome, SAE (including mortality). All-cause mortality was reported in 14 trials with 1,611 patients, and no significant effect on any patient-centred outcome was found.

A general issue is that systematic reviews depend on the strengths of the included randomised trials. Trials with unclear or high risks of bias are associated with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms. The unknown true intervention effect may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Previous meta-analyses on milrinone differ in design from our systematic review and come to different conclusions. One study focused only on patients with myocardial infarction and two only on cardiac surgery patients, in which the latter was an update. The meta-analysis on patients with myocardial infarction observed no significant effect on mortality but stated that milrinone increased left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output. The first meta-analysis evaluating patients having cardiac surgery suggested an increase in mortality using milrinone, which disappeared in the updated meta-analysis.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^114bjmHr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

During the process of the systematic review, we were non-adherent to our prepublished protocol for several reasons. We rephrased the title and terminology for an improved description of the cardiac state of the patients of interest (i.e. cardiac dysfunction instead of cardiac support or myocardial dysfunction). We divided subgroup comparisons into inactive versus (potentially) active control interventions. Since no data was found on the predefined subgroup comparison of milrinone versus vasopressors, we were unable to report this comparison. There were also no data on the composite outcome of SAE (mortality included), and therefore, all-cause mortality became the most important outcome. The outcome of hypotension was regarded as a surrogate outcome and therefore omitted.

We frequently found significant statistical heterogeneity, but even when absent, there was still considerable clinical heterogeneity in patients, interventions, comparators, outcomes, or settings. Pooling the data was frequently considered disputable, even in the absence of statistically significant tests of interactions. One example is the pooled intervention effect estimate of mortality (comparison 1), which has low statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0%; P = 0.50) and no subgroup differences, but the clinical heterogeneity is obvious, also reflected by control event rates for all-cause mortality varying from 3.6% to 12.0%. The large variety in types of control interventions further increases clinical heterogeneity.

Milrinone dose and duration varied among the included trials.

### Pharmacodynamic effects of milrinone with and without a bolus loading infusion [^112Rbwqn]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Milrinone is a positive inotropic agent with vasodilatory and lusitropic activity. It, when dosed as a 50 microg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion, provides an immediate and sustained hemodynamic response. However, the comparative pharmacodynamics of a placebo bolus versus a milrinone bolus followed by a continuous milrinone infusion in patients with decompensated heart failure are unknown.

- **Methods**: Nineteen patients with decompensated heart failure underwent right heart catheterization and were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of milrinone at a rate of 0.50 microg/kg/min, either with (n = 9) or without (n = 10) a preceding 50 microg/kg bolus. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, and plasma milrinone levels were measured serially over 24 hours.

- **Results**: In the milrinone bolus group, maximal effects on plasma concentration (352.3 ng/mL), cardiac index (+0.97 L/min/m^2, P = .02), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-11.25 mm Hg, P < 0.001) were observed after the loading dose. In contrast, the placebo loading dose group exhibited significant hemodynamic effects starting at 30 minutes after the commencement of the continuous infusion. Similar changes were noted in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (placebo -8.6 vs. milrinone -8.78 mm Hg, P not significant [NS]) at 2 hours, and in cardiac index (placebo loading +0.81 vs. milrinone loading +0.78 L/min/m^2, P NS) and milrinone levels (placebo loading 168.0 vs. milrinone loading 165.6 ng/mL, P NS) at 3 hours. Notably, one patient randomized to a milrinone bolus demonstrated a marked decrease.

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115Yo6Vj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Noninvasive estimation of filling pressure is often assessed using the ratio of the peak E/e′ and is recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography and European Society of Cardiology in the evaluation of HFpEF. In this study, baseline E/e′ was elevated across the cohort; however, there was no significant between‐group difference in the change in E/e′ over the course study. Despite its validity in HFrEF, multiple studies have demonstrated the limited accuracy of septal and lateral E/e′ in HFpEF, with poor correlations with direct measures of filling pressure. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence for its use as a measure of filling pressure following intervention in HFpEF. There were no other changes in cardiac structure or function noted; however, the relatively short duration of the trial may not have allowed adequate exposure to observe a favorable effect.

The lack of success with previous trials of pharmacologic therapy is in part attributable to the diverse range of mechanisms and phenotypic heterogeneity. Primarily, an elevated filling pressure at rest or exercise promotes dyspnea, principally attributable to diastolic dysfunction; however, multiple other mechanisms have been implicated. Coexistent systolic dysfunction, left atrial dysfunction, ventricular‐vascular stiffening, chronotropic incompetence, and impaired peripheral oxygen handling have all been implicated. Arguably, HFpEF represents a multisystem disorder with varying physiologic pathways, with single‐pathway therapies unlikely to succeed without careful phenotype selection.

Overdosage of milrinone can lead to hypotension due to its vasodilator properties. In such cases, it is advised to reduce the administration of milrinone or temporarily discontinue it until the patient's condition stabilizes. While there is no specific antidote, general measures for circulatory support should be implemented.

### Reassessment of dobutamine, dopamine, and milrinone in the management of acute heart failure syndromes [^115L2YMV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The appropriate role of intravenous inodilator therapy (inotropic agents with vasodilator properties) in the management of acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) has long been a subject of controversy, mainly due to the lack of prospective, placebo-controlled trials and alternative therapies. The use of intravenous inodilator infusions remains common, but highly variable. As new options emerge for the treatment of AHFS, it is crucial to review available information to determine which approaches are supported by evidence, which are used empirically without evidence, and which should be considered inappropriate.

Data from randomized controlled trials on the short-term, intermittent, and long-term use of intravenous inodilator agents (dobutamine, dopamine, and milrinone) in AHFS were reviewed. These trials failed to show benefits with these medications and suggested that the acute, intermittent, or continuous use of inodilator infusions may increase morbidity and mortality in patients with AHFS. Their use should be restricted to patients who are hypotensive as a result of low cardiac output despite a high left ventricular filling pressure.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^1141xrSa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Milrinone lactate injection is a member of a class of bipyridine inotropic/vasodilator agents with phosphodiesterase inhibitor activity, distinct from digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone lactate is designated chemically as 1,6-dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-[3,4'-bipyridine]-5‑carbonitrile lactate.

Milrinone is an off-white to tan crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 211.2 and a molecular formula of C12H9N3O. It is slightly soluble in methanol and very slightly soluble in chloroform and in water. As the lactate salt, it is stable and colorless to pale yellow in solution. Milrinone lactate is available as sterile aqueous solutions of the lactate salt of milrinone for injection or infusion intravenously.

- **Sterile, single dose vials**: Single dose vials of 10, 20, and 50 mL contain, in each mL, milrinone lactate equivalent to 1 mg milrinone and 47 mg dextrose anhydrous, USP, in water for injection, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid or sodium hydroxide. The total concentration of lactic acid can vary between 0.95 mg/mL and 1.29 mg/mL. These vials require preparation of dilutions prior to administration to patients intravenously.

- **Pre-mix flexible containers**: The flexible containers provide two ready-to-use dilutions of milrinone in volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL of 5% dextrose injection. Each mL contains milrinone lactate equivalent to 200 mcg (0.2 mg) milrinone. The nominal concentration of lactic acid is 0.282 mg/mL. Each mL also contains 49.4 mg dextrose anhydrous, USP. The pH is adjusted.

### Diagnosis and management of stable angina: A review [^115mKpYr]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Nearly 10 million US adults experience stable angina, which occurs when myocardial oxygen supply does not meet demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is associated with an average annual risk of 3% to 4% for myocardial infarction or death. Diagnostic tests and medical therapies for stable angina have evolved over the last decade with a better understanding of the optimal use of coronary revascularization.

- **Observations**: Coronary computed tomographic angiography is a first-line diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with stable angina due to higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with imaging-based stress testing. Moreover, coronary computed tomographic angiography allows detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis that would not be identified with other noninvasive imaging modalities, improving risk assessment and potentially triggering more appropriate allocation of preventive therapies.

Novel therapies treating lipids (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl) and type 2 diabetes (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) have improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable ischemic heart disease when added to usual care. Randomized clinical trials showed no improvement in the rates of mortality or myocardial infarction with revascularization (largely by percutaneous coronary intervention) compared with optimal medical therapy alone, even in the setting of moderate to severe ischemia.

### Old drug, new trick? Oral milrinone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116TnKgM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Among 12 patients assigned to twice‐daily oral milrinone, the medication was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events and, notably, no atrial or ventricular arrhythmias reported in either arm. Subjects randomized to milrinone had a significantly greater improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores compared with placebo, and a trend towards improvement in the 6‐minute walk test and glomerular filtration rate. However, there was no difference in the level of measured activity, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide levels, or echo measures of systolic or diastolic function between the two groups.

In a syndrome for which so many therapeutic efforts have been unsuccessful, the authors should be applauded for this novel investigation of a drug with a somewhat notorious track record despite its alluring biological plausibility. After all, oral milrinone did not just show lack of efficacy; the PROMISE (Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation) study had to be stopped early because of excess morbidity and mortality associated with the drug, likely because of its arrhythmogenicity and potent vasodilatory effects.

- **How is the drug different**: The authors have previously published on their uniquely formulated extended‐release milrinone formulation and have tested its safety in a small cohort of Stage D heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients, identifying no hypotension or increased arrhythmic burden in this at‐risk population. The improved safety of the extended‐release formulation when compared with the immediate‐release version is noteworthy.

### Milrinone as compared with dobutamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock [^115w6vzk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The DOREMI study, published by Rebecca Mathew and colleagues in 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine, investigated cardiogenic shock. The trial questioned whether milrinone is superior to dobutamine for treatment. It was a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 192 patients (70 female, 122 male). Adult patients with cardiogenic shock were included, while pregnancy, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and healthcare team preference for a specific inotrope were key exclusion criteria.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 96 received milrinone (dose of 0.125 mcg/kg/min to > 0.500 mcg/kg/min).
	- n = 96 received dobutamine (dose of 2.5 mcg/kg/min to > 10.0 mcg/kg/min).

- **Primary outcome**:
	- No significant difference was found in in-hospital death from any cause, resuscitated cardiac arrest, receipt of a cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support, nonfatal myocardial infarction, TIA or stroke diagnosed by a neurologist, or initiation of RRT (49% vs. 54%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.19).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in in-hospital death (37% vs. 43%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.21).
	- No significant difference in resuscitated cardiac arrest (7% vs. 9%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.07).
	- No significant difference in the receipt of mechanical circulatory support (12% vs. 15%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.71).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant differences were observed.

Overall, the study concluded that there is no significant difference in outcomes between milrinone and dobutamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^115ZYAAR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: No untoward clinical manifestations have been observed in limited experience with patients in whom milrinone was used concurrently with the following drugs: digitalis glycosides; lidocaine, quinidine; hydralazine, prazosin; isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin; chlorthalidone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone; captopril; heparin, warfarin, diazepam, insulin; and potassium supplements.

- **Chemical interactions**: There is an immediate chemical interaction evidenced by the formation of a precipitate when furosemide is injected into an intravenous line of an infusion of milrinone. Therefore, furosemide should not be administered in intravenous lines containing milrinone.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Twenty-four months of oral administration of milrinone to mice at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 50 times the human oral therapeutic dose in a 50 kg patient) was unassociated with evidence of carcinogenic potential. Neither was there evidence of carcinogenic potential when milrinone was orally administered to rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 6 times the human oral therapeutic dose) for twenty-four months or at 25 mg/kg/day (about 30 times the human oral therapeutic dose) for up to 18 months in males and 20 months in females. Whereas the Chinese Hamster Ovary Chromosome Aberration Assay was positive in the presence of a metabolic activation system, results from the Ames Test, the Mouse Lymphoma Assay, the Micronucleus Test, and the in vivo Rat Bone Marrow Metaphase Analysis indicated an absence of mutagenic potential.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: The multinational CLARIFY study [^1145BBRj]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Angina pectoris is a common manifestation of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and negatively affects quality of life. Lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, and coronary revascularization can improve symptoms. However, in most randomized trials exploring antianginal strategies or drugs in stable CAD, the burden of angina improved over time in the control group. Although this improvement could be a result of optimization of medical treatments and cardiovascular risk factors during the trial, it could also reflect the natural history of the condition.

Angina pectoris is also associated with poor outcomes. However, antianginal treatments have not been proven to improve outcomes in chronic stable angina. Even β-blockers, largely used on the basis of a mortality reduction after myocardial infarction, have not been associated with improved outcomes in stable angina. Likewise, invasive management with a view to coronary revascularization does not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina or myocardial ischemia, although it improves symptoms.

In the era of effective antianginal treatments, evidence-based secondary prevention therapy, and widespread use of coronary revascularization, we sought to describe the prevalence and time course of angina in patients with stable CAD as well as the effect of changes in anginal status on outcomes.

### Intravenous milrinone in cardiac surgery [^111x6Zxh]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including milrinone, produce positive inotropic effects by slowing the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the myocardium. With a loading dose of 50 micrograms per kilogram followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, milrinone increases stroke volume index and left ventricular velocity of circumferential fiber shortening after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Milrinone has potential for the treatment and prevention of internal mammary artery spasm because of its vasodilative effect, which is similar to that of papaverine, and is a potent pulmonary vasodilator for patients with right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Low-dose milrinone may have anti-inflammatory properties and potentially can improve splanchnic perfusion.

### Efficacy of the I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina receiving beta-blocker therapy: a 4-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114eteL7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Angina pectoris is typically caused by myocardial ischemia owing to an imbalance between myocardial perfusion and oxygen demand. Elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and limits tissue perfusion by reducing the duration of diastole, during which most myocardial perfusion occurs. The long-term prognosis for patients with chronic stable angina pectoris is favorable, and medical and interventional therapies show similar benefits. Thus, treatment guidelines advocate an initial approach with medical therapy. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial ischemia and prevent angina pectoris largely by lowering heart rate, and are recommended as an initial therapy for stable angina pectoris unless contraindicated.

In modern clinical practice, however, many patients with stable angina pectoris require treatment with more than one anti-anginal drug, in addition to short-acting nitrates. Ivabradine is a pure heart rate-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting I(f), an important ion current involved in the pacemaker activity in cells of the sino-atrial node. Ivabradine reduces the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization in these cells and lowers heart rate at rest and during exercise. When given as monotherapy (with short-acting nitrates allowed as required), ivabradine has demonstrated anti-ischemic and anti-anginal efficacy in randomized trials in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris when compared with placebo and has been shown to be non-inferior to atenolol or amlodipine. The drug has been recommended for the medical management of patients.

### Angina and future cardiovascular events in stable patients with coronary artery disease: Insights from the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) registry [^111je381]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of stable angina has been historically linked to the classic chronic condition caused by epicardial coronary stenosis. Nevertheless, stable angina includes other less common presentations such as microvascular angina, vasospastic angina, and angina caused by ischemic cardiomyopathy. In each of these conditions, myocardial ischemia is present, albeit each with a different burden and mechanism.

The association between angina, ischemia, and cardiovascular outcome is complex and is probably not consistent across all patients. In the BARI 2D trial, among patients with diabetes mellitus, myocardial ischemia, rather than anginal symptoms, appeared to be prognostic for future cardiovascular events. These results are consistent with our findings in diabetic patients in whom angina by itself was not predictive of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke.

Interestingly, in the CLARIFY registry, patients who had only ischemia without angina had adjusted risks for cardiovascular outcomes comparable to patients without either condition, whereas patients who had both angina and ischemia had the worst outcomes. Moreover, more than half of the cardiovascular death and MI events in the CLARIFY study occurred in patients without detectable ischemia or angina at baseline.

In our study, ischemia status during follow-up was not available and could not be accounted for. Nevertheless, angina, regardless of ischemia status, was independently associated with more cardiovascular hospitalization and coronary revascularization procedures. Of interest, the association between angina and these outcomes persisted throughout the study.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112w6WtS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The pooled intervention effect estimates, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the outcomes, are specified according to control intervention and setting. All pooled estimates are reported using risk ratio and calculated using a random-effects model, unless stated otherwise. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) adjusted risk ratios with the predefined α = 0.05 (two-sided), β = 0.10 (power 90%), and an anticipated relative risk increase of 10% could not be calculated in any outcome with less than 5% of the diversity adjusted required information size (DARIS) accrued.

In the absence of trials that reported the primary composite outcome of serious adverse events (SAE) including mortality, all-cause mortality at maximum follow-up was chosen as the most important outcome. There were insufficient data for time-specific analyses of mortality. Meta-regression was not performed because of insufficient data. Additionally, subgroup analyses according to risk of bias were not performed as no trial was assessed as having low risk of bias. All analyses were conducted with stratification by control intervention, unless stated otherwise.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: A systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^111UTKug]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the quantity and quality of evidence regarding the benefits or harms of milrinone in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction are very low, largely due to high risks of systematic and random errors. Future randomized clinical trials should be large and well-designed, adhering to SPIRIT guidelines and reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Currently, the widespread use of milrinone in critical care cannot be advocated or refuted based on the existing evidence.

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115fsmSd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The prevalence of HFpEF has risen significantly over the past two decades and is projected to become the most prevalent form of heart failure over the coming decade. A significant area of unmet need exists regarding the availability of oral therapy for HFpEF. In this phase Ib study, extended-release oral milrinone improved quality of life without a significant increase in adverse events.

In the study, we demonstrated a clinically meaningful and significant effect of milrinone on quality of life as reflected by the KCCQ. In milrinone-treated patients, there was an improvement in the KCCQ score of +10 ± 13 compared with a fall of −3 ± 15 (P = 0.046) in placebo-treated patients. Consistent with this, the quality-of-life subdomain improved substantially with milrinone (+22 ± 19 versus −7 ± 21; P = 0.004). The KCCQ is one of the most widely used instruments to assess quality of life in heart failure and has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid in both HFrEF and HFpEF. Although reduction of hospitalization burden and mortality are important endpoints in heart failure, quality of life remains a primary goal in HFpEF, particularly when the competing risk of death from comorbid conditions is significant in the context of a different demographic compared with HFrEF. In a secondary analysis of patients from the NEAT-HFpEF (Nitrate's Effect on Activity Tolerance in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, KCCQ scores were strongly correlated with baseline functional status parameters, including 6-minute walk distance and accelerometry.

### Milrinone for cardiac dysfunction in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1128CWNx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Milrinone is an inotrope widely used for the treatment of cardiac failure. Because previous meta-analyses had methodological flaws, we decided to conduct a systematic review of the effect of milrinone in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction.

- **Methods**: This systematic review was performed according to The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Searches were conducted until November 2015. Patients with cardiac dysfunction were included. The primary outcome was serious adverse events (SAE) including mortality at maximum follow-up. The risk of bias was evaluated, and trial sequential analyses were conducted. The quality of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria.

- **Results**: A total of 31 randomised clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 16 provided data for our analyses. All trials were at high risk of bias, and none reported the primary composite outcome SAE. Fourteen trials with 1,611 randomised patients reported mortality data at maximum follow-up (RR 0.96; 95% confidence interval 0.76–1.21). Milrinone did not significantly affect other patient-centred outcomes. All analyses displayed statistical and/or clinical heterogeneity of patients, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and/or settings and all featured missing data.

- **Discussion**: The evidence on the use of milrinone in critically ill adult patients with cardiac dysfunction suffers from considerable risks of both bias and random error and demonstrates no benefits.

### Is chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 cardioprotective and safe? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1177YiyF]. BMC Medicine (2014). High credibility.

- **Results**: The study involved conducting a comprehensive literature search process across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and SCOPUS, spanning from March 2012 to December 2013, with an update in May 2014.

	- **Study selection**: Initially, 9,168 studies were identified as potentially relevant. Out of these, 8,727 were subsequently excluded based on the title and abstract content. Additionally, 417 out of the remaining 441 studies were excluded after full-text analysis due to various reasons such as being in a non-English language, involving non-human subjects, not being RCTs, lacking outcomes of interest, or involving co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors with other drugs. Furthermore, RCTs where PDE5 inhibitors were administered on demand or for less than 30 consecutive days were also excluded. Ultimately, a total of 24 RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review, comprising 18 studies administering sildenafil, 4 administering tadalafil, and 2 administering vardenafil.

### Pharmacological and emerging therapies in the treatment of chronic angina [^11713b2i]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic angina is a common manifestation of ischemic heart disease. Medical treatments are the mainstay approach to reduce the occurrence of angina and improve patients' quality of life. This series paper focuses on commonly used standard treatments (e.g. nitrates, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers), emerging anti-angina treatments (which are not available in all parts of the world), and experimental treatments. Although many emerging treatments are available, evidence is scarce about their ability to reduce angina and ischemia.

### Milrinone lactate in dextrose [^111gULLn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Milrinone is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity, differing in structure and mode of action from either the digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. At relevant inotropic and vasorelaxant concentrations, milrinone is a selective inhibitor of peak III cAMP phosphodiesterase isozyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. This inhibitory action is consistent with cAMP-mediated increases in intracellular ionized calcium and contractile force in cardiac muscle, as well as with cAMP-dependent contractile protein phosphorylation and relaxation in vascular muscle. Additional experimental evidence indicates that milrinone is not a beta-adrenergic agonist, nor does it inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity as do the digitalis glycosides.

Clinical studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that milrinone produces dose-related and plasma drug concentration-related increases in the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Studies in normal subjects have shown that milrinone increases the slope of the left ventricular pressure-dimension relationship, indicating a direct inotropic effect of the drug. Milrinone also produces dose-related and plasma concentration-related increases in forearm blood flow in patients with congestive heart failure, indicating a direct arterial vasodilator activity of the drug. Both the inotropic and vasodilatory effects have been observed over the therapeutic range of plasma milrinone concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL.
