## Question

What is screening test reliable source

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a reliable source for screening tests and how to identify and evaluate such sources in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which organizations are most authoritative for screening recommendations. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and study designs that make a source reliable. Next, I will examine the core methodological standards that define reliability for diagnostic accuracy studies. After that, I need to check how to appraise individual studies and systematic reviews using established tools. Finally, I will consider population applicability, spectrum effects, and how to integrate these into a practical, clinically grounded approach to source selection and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative sources. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is the premier national body issuing evidence-based recommendations on preventive services, including screening, and its methods and ratings are widely adopted as a benchmark for reliability in U.S. practice, so USPSTF recommendation statements and evidence reviews are primary sources I should prioritize [^113PfXAF] [^113uJwQ8]. I should also consider other national bodies with rigorous processes, such as the American Cancer Society (ACS), the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for infectious disease screening, and specialty guidelines that use GRADE or similar frameworks, for example the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for lung cancer screening, because these groups synthesize high-quality evidence using transparent, standardized methods [^116y7gaw] [^notfound] [^116GQicJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single study; I need to check the evidence hierarchy. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that randomize before screening and measure hard health outcomes (mortality, morbidity) provide the most reliable evidence for screening effectiveness, whereas diagnostic accuracy studies establish test performance but do not by themselves prove outcome benefit, so I should weigh them differently when judging reliability for practice change [^112SZURz] [^111TkxeS]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs or diagnostic accuracy studies, especially when they use appropriate models and account for heterogeneity, are generally more reliable than single studies, and modeling can inform decisions when direct RCTs are lacking, though modeling evidence is indirect and should be interpreted cautiously [^116uGzst] [^113uJwQ8].

> Next, I should review the methodological standards that make a diagnostic accuracy study reliable. I need to ensure patient selection is consecutive or randomly sampled from the intended screening population, that the reference standard is appropriate and applied blinded to index test results, and that flow and timing reflect real-world referral pathways. QUADAS-2 and its adaptations operationalize these domains and signaling questions, and adherence to STARD reporting helps me judge applicability and bias risk [^117WsTi2] [^115fm8UF] [^1149L7rW]. Wait, let me verify a common pitfall: spectrum bias inflates accuracy when cases are severe and controls are healthy; reliable sources either avoid case-control designs or explicitly address and weight back to the target population to mitigate this problem [^1149L7rW] [^112LCiFe].

> I will now examine how to appraise individual studies and reviews. For diagnostic accuracy, I should confirm sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values are reported with confidence intervals, assess whether all participants received an appropriate reference standard or had adequate follow-up, and check for differential verification or incorporation bias; QUADAS-2 ratings and transparent reporting of patient flow are essential for this judgment [^117WsTi2] [^115fm8UF]. For systematic reviews, I should confirm a comprehensive search, prespecified inclusion criteria, risk of bias assessment, and appropriate meta-analytic models such as bivariate or HSROC that account for threshold effects and correlation between sensitivity and specificity; poor reporting in diagnostic reviews is common, so I need to be cautious when these elements are missing [^116uGzst] [^1175cvyk].

> But wait, what if the test was validated in a different population than mine? I need to ensure external validity by matching study populations to my intended use setting, because the spectrum effect can materially alter sensitivity, specificity, and especially predictive values across prevalence strata and case-mix differences; reliable sources either derive estimates from representative populations or provide enough detail to allow extrapolation and calibration [^1149L7rW] [^113MPixj]. Let me reconsider a tempting shortcut: overall accuracy is prevalence-dependent and can be misleading; I should avoid relying on it and instead interpret sensitivity and specificity in the context of the local prevalence and clinical question [^115Qt4YS].

> Next, I should review how guidelines synthesize and grade evidence, because this shapes reliability at the policy level. The USPSTF uses an analytic framework and grades certainty and net benefit, often integrating indirect evidence when direct RCTs are unavailable; GRADE-based approaches similarly rate quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, and transparency about indirectness and assumptions is crucial for reliability [^113PfXAF] [^1142q8or]. Hold on, I should verify whether a recommendation is based on direct RCTs or modeling; when indirect, I need to communicate uncertainty and potential biases clearly in shared decision-making [^113PfXAF].

> Let me think about concrete examples to anchor this. For colorectal cancer, multiple RCTs and modeling support screening effectiveness, and comparative evaluations of new noninvasive tests against proven comparators like FIT are considered efficient early-phase evidence. This is why paired or parallel comparative designs are often used when mortality RCTs are not feasible for every new modality [^113izFry] [^113uJwQ8]. For HIV, antigen/antibody assays have near-perfect sensitivity and specificity in screening settings, which supports their reliability for population screening when coupled with appropriate confirmatory algorithms [^115PArAq]. For lung cancer, the ACS and USPSTF rely on systematic reviews and CISNET modeling to balance benefits and radiation harms, illustrating how high-quality evidence synthesis and modeling inform reliable recommendations [^116y7gaw] [^115bLDgA].

> I should double-check special contexts where "reliable" means something different. In newborn screening, residual dried blood spots are a reliable source for assay validation and quality assurance because they enable prospective test development and retrospective performance checks; this is a different sense of "source" than guideline recommendations, but it is central to ensuring screening test reliability in programs [^117UjBBY]. For mental health screening, reliability also depends on psychometric rigor and appropriate use-context; APA guidance emphasizes multiple sources of information and psychometric principles, which I should apply when evaluating instruments and their evidence base [^115N9S39] [^1151LBbi].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure a layered approach: prioritize national guidelines with transparent, GRADE-aligned methods (USPSTF, ACS, CDC/ACIP, specialty society guidelines using GRADE), then verify whether the cited evidence includes high-quality RCTs for effectiveness or well-conducted diagnostic accuracy studies using QUADAS-2/STARD, and finally confirm applicability to my population and setting, watching for spectrum effects and prevalence-dependent performance. If the evidence is indirect or modeling-based, I should communicate uncertainty explicitly and align with patient preferences [^113PfXAF] [^117WsTi2] [^1149L7rW]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never use case-control accuracy studies"; hold on, I should verify and correct that: case-control studies can generate hypotheses and early estimates, but they are prone to spectrum bias and should not be the sole basis for adopting a screening test in practice without confirmatory prospective evidence in the target population [^1149L7rW] [^112LCiFe].

---

A reliable screening test source is one with **high sensitivity and specificity** [^112SZURz], validated in the target population [^1149L7rW], and supported by **randomized controlled trials** or high-quality systematic reviews showing improved health outcomes [^111TkxeS]. Reliability also depends on **consistent performance across settings** [^113MPixj], minimal false positives/negatives [^114ZPfFG], and clear, reproducible methods [^117WsTi2]. Authoritative guidelines from USPSTF, ACS, CDC, and WHO [^111JsFx6] [^113PfXAF] provide evidence-based recommendations and are considered reliable sources for screening tests.

---

## Characteristics of a reliable screening test source

A reliable screening test source typically exhibits the following characteristics:

- **High sensitivity and specificity**: The test accurately identifies individuals with the condition (sensitivity) and excludes those without it (specificity) [^112SZURz].

- **Validated in target population**: The test has been validated in the specific population in which it will be used, accounting for prevalence and demographic factors [^1149L7rW].

- **Evidence-based**: The test is supported by robust evidence, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [^112SZURz] or high-quality systematic reviews demonstrating improved health outcomes [^notfound].

- **Consistent performance**: The test demonstrates consistent performance across different settings and populations [^notfound].

- **Minimal false positives and negatives**: The test minimizes false positives and false negatives, reducing unnecessary anxiety, interventions, and missed diagnoses [^111JpdFh].

- **Clear and reproducible methods**: The test's methodology is clearly documented and reproducible, allowing for consistent application and interpretation [^117WsTi2].

## Evidence supporting reliability of screening tests

The reliability of screening tests is supported by various types of evidence, including:

| **Evidence type** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) | Gold standard for evaluating screening effectiveness, providing direct evidence of benefits and harms [^112SZURz] | - RCTs on fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for colorectal cancer screening [^notfound] <br/> - RCTs on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening [^notfound] |
| Systematic reviews and meta-analyses | Summarize evidence from multiple studies, providing comprehensive assessments of test accuracy and effectiveness [^1175cvyk] | - Systematic reviews on cervical cancer screening methods [^11643pTs] <br/> - Meta-analyses on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer [^117NQaqY] |
| Validation studies | Assess test performance in specific populations, providing evidence of external validity [^1149L7rW] | - Validation of HIV screening tests [^115PArAq] <br/> - Validation of hepatitis B screening tests [^115npcz9] |
| Guidelines and recommendations | Authoritative bodies provide evidence-based recommendations, synthesizing available evidence and expert consensus [^113PfXAF] | - USPSTF recommendations [^116sw93R] <br/> - American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines [^11643pTs] <br/> - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines [^116GQicJ] |

## Examples of reliable screening test sources

Several screening tests are widely recognized as reliable based on robust evidence and validation:

- **Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)**: Highly sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer screening, supported by RCTs and systematic reviews [^115pBTnf].

- **Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)**: Effective for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations, supported by RCTs and guidelines [^115bLDgA].

- **Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing**: Highly accurate for cervical cancer screening, supported by extensive validation studies and guidelines [^notfound].

- **HIV screening tests**: Highly accurate with excellent sensitivity and specificity, validated in multiple populations [^115PArAq].

---

## Limitations and challenges in determining reliability

Despite the availability of evidence, several challenges exist in determining the reliability of screening test sources:

- **Variability in study design**: Differences in study design, population, and methodology can lead to variability in test performance estimates [^11163iQQ].

- **Spectrum bias**: Variations in test performance across different populations and disease severity levels can affect reliability [^113MPixj].

- **False positives and negatives**: Screening tests may yield false positives and negatives, leading to potential harms such as anxiety, unnecessary interventions, or missed diagnoses [^111JpdFh].

- **Lack of direct evidence**: In some cases, indirect evidence or modeling studies are used to infer test effectiveness, which may introduce uncertainty [^113PfXAF].

---

## Role of authoritative organizations and guidelines

Authoritative organizations play a crucial role in establishing reliable screening test sources by:

- **Conducting systematic reviews**: Organizations such as the USPSTF, ACS, and CDC conduct rigorous systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate screening tests [^116y7gaw].

- **Developing guidelines**: These organizations develop evidence-based guidelines and recommendations, providing clinicians and policymakers with reliable guidance [^11643pTs].

- **Monitoring and updating recommendations**: Regularly updating recommendations based on emerging evidence ensures continued reliability [^116y7gaw].

---

A reliable screening test source is characterized by **high accuracy**, validation in the target population, and robust evidence supporting its effectiveness. Authoritative organizations such as the USPSTF, ACS, and CDC play a critical role in evaluating and recommending screening tests, ensuring their reliability and guiding clinical practice.

### Systematic reviews of diagnostic tests in cancer: review of methods and reporting [^1175cvyk]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess the methods and reporting of systematic reviews of diagnostic tests.

Data Sources

Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and five other databases identified reviews of tests used in patients with cancer. Of these, 89 satisfied our inclusion criteria of reporting accuracy of the test compared with a reference test, including an electronic search, and published since 1990.

Review Methods

All reviews were assessed for methods and reporting of objectives, search strategy, participants, clinical setting, index and reference tests, study design, study results, graphs, meta-analysis, quality, bias, and procedures in the review. We assessed 25 randomly selected reviews in more detail.

Results

75% (67) of the reviews stated inclusion criteria, 49% (44) tabulated characteristics of included studies, 40% (36) reported details of study design, 17% (15) reported on the clinical setting, 17% (15) reported on the severity of disease in participants, and 49% (44) reported on whether the tumours were primary, metastatic, or recurrent. Of the 25 reviews assessed in detail, 68% (17) stated the reference standard used in the review, 36% (9) reported the definition of a positive result for the index test, and 56% (14) reported sensitivity, specificity, and sample sizes for individual studies. Of the 89 reviews, 61% (54) attempted to formally synthesise results of the studies and 32% (29) reported formal assessments of study quality.

Conclusions

Reliability and relevance of current systematic reviews of diagnostic tests is compromised by poor reporting and review methods.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, more specifically with respect to choice of screening test, cell-free DNA, ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for common fetal aneuploidies; however, it has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results and is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^113S7hwk]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, health screening recommendations have gone beyond screening for early-stage, asymptomatic disease to include "screening" for presently experienced health problems and symptoms using self-report questionnaires. We examined recommendations from three major national guideline organizations to determine the consistency of recommendations, identify sources of divergent recommendations, and determine if guideline organizations have identified any direct randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the effectiveness of questionnaire-based screening.

Methods

We reviewed recommendation statements listed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UKNSC), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as of 5 September 2016. Eligible recommendations focused on using self-report questionnaires to identify patients with presently experienced health problems or symptoms. Within each recommendation and accompanying evidence review we identified screening RCTs.

Results

We identified 22 separate recommendations on questionnaire-based screening, including three CTFPHC recommendations against screening, eight UKNSC recommendations against screening, four USPSTF recommendations in favor of screening (alcohol misuse, adolescent depression, adult depression, intimate partner violence), and seven USPSTF recommendations that did not recommend for or against screening. In the four cases where the USPSTF recommended screening, either the CTFPHC, the UKNSC, or both recommended against. When recommendations diverged, the USPSTF expressed confidence in benefits based on indirect evidence, evaluated potential harms as minimal, and did not consider cost or resource use. CTFPHC and UKNSC recommendations against screening, on the other hand, focused on the lack of direct evidence of benefit and raised concerns about harms to patients and resource use. Of six RCTs that directly evaluated screening interventions, five did not report any statistically significant primary or secondary health outcomes in favor of screening, and one trial reported equivocal results.

Conclusions

Only the USPSTF has made any recommendations for screening with questionnaires for presently experienced problems or symptoms. The CTFPHC and UKNSC recommended against screening in all of their recommendations. Differences in recommendations appear to reflect differences in willingness to assume benefit from indirect evidence and different approaches to assessing possible harms and resource consumption. There were no examples in any recommendations of RCTs with direct evidence of improved health outcomes.

### Diagnostic methods I: sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy [^111yQ8iv]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

For most physicians, use of diagnostic tests is part of daily routine. This paper focuses on their usefulness by explaining the different measures of accuracy, the interpretation of test results, and the implementation of a diagnostic strategy. Measures of accuracy include sensitivity and specificity. Although these measures are often considered fixed properties of a diagnostic test, in reality they are subject to multiple sources of variation such as the population case mix and the severity of the disease under study. Furthermore, when evaluating a new diagnostic test, it must be compared to a reference standard, although the latter is usually not perfect. In daily practice diagnostic tests are not used in isolation. Several issues will influence the interpretation of their results. First, clinicians have a prior assumption about the patient's chances of having the disease under investigation, based on the patient's characteristics, symptoms, and the disease prevalence in similar populations. Second, diagnostic tests are usually part of a diagnostic strategy. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine the accuracy of a single test; one also needs to determine its additional value to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, or outcome as part of a diagnostic strategy.

### Screening for hepatitis B virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115npcz9]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF supporting evidence and scope — the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 recommendation and is strengthened by trials and cohort studies reporting that antiviral therapy reduces risk of mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma and improves intermediate outcomes; the USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review on screening for HBV infection in persons at increased risk, examined new randomized clinical trials and cohort studies published from 2014 to August 2019 assessing benefits and harms of screening and antiviral therapy and links between intermediate and health outcomes, added key questions on the yield of alternative screening strategies and the accuracy of tools to identify persons at increased risk, and previously found serologic testing with HBsAg to be accurate.

### Comparison between the sofia SARS antigen FIA test and the PCR test in detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1132hEMk]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite its shortcomings, rRT-PCR is still considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2. Sources, however, point to shortcomings in diagnostics that rely solely on the detection of nucleic acids, mainly the large inconsistencies and a high rate of false-negative values. As a solution, they suggest combining testing with imaging of thoracic organs and other clinical signs. We wondered whether combining the Sofia test with the rRT-PCR test would reduce these shortcomings. Due to the low detection limit of the Sofia test, combining these 2 methods would probably not significantly help to improve these deficiencies; however, the Sofia test can serve as a rapid screening test, as it can be performed at the point of care in significantly less time than rRT-PCR.

Our results therefore show that the Sofia test meets the standards of a reliable screening test according to the World Health Organization criteria. It shows high sensitivity and specificity, and perhaps most importantly, a high negative predictive value. This study confirms that the Sofia test can be used as a screening test, especially in circumstances that require rapid treatment and triage of patients, as the test can be quickly carried out at the point of care.

### Screening for depression: recommendations and rationale [^113CDAJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for screening for depression and the supporting scientific evidence and updates the 1996 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. At that time, the USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine use of standardized questionnaires to screen for depression in primary care patients. The complete information on which the current statement is based, including evidence tables and references, is available in the accompanying article in this issue and in the systematic evidence review on this topic, which can be obtained through the USPSTF Web site (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm) and in print through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Publications Clearinghouse (800–358–9295).

### A systematic review of noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy [^116yAkPq]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive and minimally invasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is a tool that may one day become the gold standard for embryonic chromosomal screening. Investigations on this topic have ranged from studying the culture media of embryos to the fluid inside the blastocoel, all in an attempt to find a reliable source of DNA without the need to biopsy the embryo. There is great interest across the board, both from those for and against biopsy, in a reliable test process that would give the patient and provider the same information possible from a biopsy without the risk. We aim to explore the current available research to better understand the utility and accuracy of PGT-A with these new sampling techniques. General concordance rates in comparison with biopsy-based PGT-A are promising, but it is clear that additional research and understanding are needed before adopting noninvasive and minimally invasive PGT-A as a widely used tool with strong clinical utility.

### Screening for lung cancer: 2023 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116y7gaw]. CA (2023). High credibility.

Evidence used in formulating the guideline — The primary evidence source was a systematic review of lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) conducted for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) by the RTI International–University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center, which was published in 2021; the Guideline Development Group (GDG) also commissioned an additional systematic review on continuing lung cancer risk in individuals who quit smoking by the American Cancer Society Cancer-related Evidence Synthesis Team (CrEST) and requested a study reviewing and updating benefit-to-radiation-risk ratios for LCS and follow-up imaging using modern ionizing radiation dose levels. The GDG examined disease burden data on age-specific incidence, mortality, and incidence-based mortality provided by the ACS Surveillance and Health Equity Science Department, used decision analyses from four Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Lung Cancer Working Groups that were commissioned by the USPSTF to inform its 2021 update of LCS recommendations (including the Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Lung Model from Erasmus University Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Medical School model, Lung Cancer Outcomes Simulation model from Stanford University, and the University of Michigan model), and commissioned a supplemental analysis using two CISNET models (Erasmus and Michigan).

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116GQicJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for New Recommendations

Chronic HBV infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality but is detectable before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests. Routine monitoring and treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality, supporting the importance of early detection of HBV infection. In addition, although not quantifiable, management of chronic infection through prevention efforts can prevent further transmission to others. These recommendations consider a simpler and less stigmatizing implementation strategy than previous risk-based HBV screening recommendations. The recommendations also provide guidance that is complementary to the 2022 ACIP recommendations to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years against HBV infection by providing a means to establish immunity or any history of infection or the need for vaccination to protect from future infection. Specific rationales for recommendations are as follows:

### Quantifying and monitoring overdiagnosis in cancer screening: a systematic review of methods [^1142q8or]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Strength of evidence assessment

We developed criteria to evaluate overall strength of evidence for the body of literature for each study type based on criteria used by the USPSTFand the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Each individual study was evaluated for risk of bias, directness (see below), external validity, and precision. Ecological and cohort studies and randomized controlled trials were also rated on the appropriateness of their analysis and time frame. For these studies, analysis is a central consideration because a study can be well designed and performed with minimal bias but still provide an unreliable estimate of overdiagnosis because of a faulty analysis. Two reviewers independently determined ratings for each of these criteria, and we resolved discrepancies by consensus. We adapted criteria for evaluating external validity of individual studies from the USPSTF procedure manual. Although we initially assessed the external validity of studies based on their relevance to a general US adult population, we then reassessed external validity based on relevance to a Western European population, finding no change in our conclusions.

The GRADE working group defines directness as the extent to which the evidence being assessed reflects a single direct link between the interventions of interest and the ultimate outcome. In this review, we evaluated the extent to which the evidence links the screening test directly to the health outcome of excess cases of cancer attributable to screening without making assumptions. A study with good directness requires minimal assumptions to draw conclusions about the magnitude of overdiagnosis and avoids extrapolating over gaps in the evidence.

We combined the ratings for risk of bias, directness, analysis, time frame, external validity, and precision with an evaluation of the consistency of the results to determine the strength of evidence for the overall body of evidence for each study design and cancer type. Table 2outlines our definitions of these terms; a complete list of criteria used to evaluate risk of bias and strength of evidence by study design can be found in the online supplemental tables 3 and 4.

Table 2
Definitions of criteria for evaluating strength of evidence among studies quantifying overdiagnosis from cancer screening

Based on the criteria above, we rated the strength of evidence for each study type as being high (that is, met all criteria), moderate (did not meet all criteria but had no fatal flaw), or low (had at least one fatal flaw that made estimates highly uncertain). We give general deficiencies of the literature for each study type studies in the appropriate section, including examples of what we regarded as fatal flaws.

### Type 1 diabetes risk factors, risk prediction and presymptomatic detection: evidence and guidance for screening [^117CaGFP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SCREENING

3.1 The importance of a priori risk — The case for multiple tests

Most medical diagnoses rely on multiple clinical or biomarker values to ensure certainty of disease. The mathematics are simple and based on Bayes' theorem, which, for our purpose, infers that the likelihood that a positive test accurately indicates disease increases when the test is applied in populations with high disease prevalence. For instance, a test for diagnosing disease in individuals with classic symptoms typically yields high diagnostic certainty. Conversely, applying the same test in a low‐prevalence population, such as screening for a disease with a prevalence of 3 in 1000, results in more false positives than true positives (Figure 1). The trade‐off between certainty (positive predictive value) and sensitivity (the proportion of true cases detected) often defines the diagnostic strategy. For severe, highly contagious diseases requiring immediate action, high sensitivity is prioritized, even at the cost of certainty. Conversely, in conditions where treatment can be delayed or has significant side effects, high diagnostic certainty is preferred, even at the expense of sensitivity. The first would require a test that identifies close to 100% of cases quickly and the second can perform multiple tests consecutively to reach a diagnosis. Diagnosing early‐stage type 1 diabetes falls into the high‐certainty category and is best achieved through multiple sequential tests.

FIGURE 1
Effect of a priori probability on screening. The example shows the application of an islet autoantibody screening test that has a threshold for positivity set to the 99th centile of healthy controls (99% specificity). The threshold identifies 90% of the disease group (90% sensitivity). In a case‐control setting often used to evaluate the performance of a test (A), false positives are infrequent. Case B shows the performance of the same test in general population screening, where the a priori disease prevalence is 0.4% (4000 from 1 million tested). With 99% specificity in health and 90% sensitivity in disease, the test is expected to identify 3600 type 1 diabetes cases (90% of the total cases) plus another 9960 who will not develop type 1 diabetes, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27%.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^114ZPfFG]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Multiallergen screening tests — utility and limitations: Tests coupling multiple allergens to a single solid-phase substrate have been developed; if the multiple allergen test result is positive, there is a high probability that the patient is allergic to at least 1 of the allergens included, and additional tests that use individual allergens can then determine other sensitivities. In general, these multiallergen screening tests have shown acceptable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared with skin tests, but their clinical value depends on the selection of patients. In a symptomatic self-selected population, a positive result significantly increases the probability of allergy, whereas in an unselected population there would be an unacceptable number of false-positive and false-negative results. By itself, a positive multiple allergen test result does not provide sufficient information to make a specific clinical diagnosis or to initiate therapy, and a negative result does not exclude clinical sensitivity because commercially-available multiallergen screening tests only screen for approximately 15 aeroallergens. Recommendations concerning the number of specific IgE tests for confirmation of suspected clinical sensitivity correspond to those discussed for prick/puncture tests in Summary Statement 43.

### Uses and abuses of screening tests [^112SZURz]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests are ubiquitous in contemporary practice, yet the principles of screening are widely misunderstood. Screening is the testing of apparently well people to find those at increased risk of having a disease or disorder. Although an earlier diagnosis generally has intuitive appeal, earlier might not always be better, or worth the cost. Four terms describe the validity of a screening test: sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative results. For tests with continuous variables — eg, blood glucose — sensitivity and specificity are inversely related; where the cutoff for abnormal is placed should indicate the clinical effect of wrong results. The prevalence of disease in a population affects screening test performance: in low-prevalence settings, even very good tests have poor predictive value positives. Hence, knowledge of the approximate prevalence of disease is a prerequisite to interpreting screening test results. Tests are often done in sequence, as is true for syphilis and HIV-1 infection. Lead-time and length biases distort the apparent value of screening programmes; randomised controlled trials are the only way to avoid these biases. Screening can improve health; strong indirect evidence links cervical cytology programmes to declines in cervical cancer mortality. However, inappropriate application or interpretation of screening tests can rob people of their perceived health, initiate harmful diagnostic testing, and squander health-care resources.

### Test-retest reliability of colorectal testing questions on the Massachusetts behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS) [^1163bBoc]. Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Information on use of colorectal cancer tests, particularly for the purpose of population surveillance, is often obtained through self-report. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a major source for population-based estimates and is used by health professionals, public health organizations, and researchers to identify and quantify self-reported utilization of screening procedures.

Methods

We provide estimates of the reliability of responses among persons age ≥ 50 to questions on the 1999 BRFSS questionnaire addressing two colorectal cancer testing procedures, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (endoscopy), based on responses of 868 persons who responded to a callback survey.

Results

We found moderate reliability for questions addressing ever having an FOBT exam, (Kappa [K] = 0.55, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.49–0.61) and good reliability for questions addressing ever having an endoscopy exam (K = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.65–0.74). Questions addressing the timing of the most recent exam were only slightly less reliable (K = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.43–0.55 and K = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.57–0.67, respectively). We observed comparable reliability across levels of most demographic and risk factor characteristics for both ever having and recency of exam.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that colorectal cancer testing questions on the BRFSS display a reasonable level of test-retest reliability.

### Reporting and assessing the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies for cervical cancer screening and management [^112dTgBP]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Considerations for specific indications — screening and triage designs and verification are described: Clinical or registration trials typically refer all individuals positive for any test to colposcopy immediately and control follow-up for at least 3 years; for studies integrated in clinical practice, referral algorithms and times may be different, therefore the reference standard may not be applied to the whole population; if their screening results are negative, it is acceptable to assume no precancer or cancer in these individuals.

### Prevention screening and counseling: strategy for integration into medical education and practice [^112Kv4uY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Providing optimal preventive services across the life span is integral to improving the nation's health. However, teaching future health professionals evidence-based prevention screening and counseling has notable limitations. Applying the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force) preventive services recommendations is necessary but not sufficient to teach comprehensive and practical preventive services delivery. Certain important health topics have not yet been investigated by the Task Force; other Task Force health topics have insufficient evidence or nonspecific recommendations. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a strategy and develop a tool to educate future healthcare professionals in recommendations for prevention screening and counseling. Age-specific preventive history charts for children and adults were created using a total of 60 recommendations from the following sources (with number of recommendations shown): the Task Force (n = 37); four primary care professional organizations (n = 15); and a representative panel of experts (n = 8). Using a systematic approach that incorporates other accredited organizations and inclusion criteria (as described) yielded a practical tool that is applicable in both educational and clinical settings.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® lung cancer screening: 2022 update [^115bLDgA]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality for men and women in the United States. Screening for lung cancer with annual low-dose CT is saving lives, and the continued implementation of lung screening can save many more. In 2015, the CMS began covering annual lung screening for those who qualified based on the original United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung screening criteria, which included patients 55 to 77 year of age with a 30 pack-year history of smoking, who were either currently using tobacco or who had smoked within the previous 15 years. In 2021, the USPSTF issued new screening guidelines, decreasing the age of eligibility to 80 years of age and pack-years to 20. Lung screening remains controversial for those who do not meet the updated USPSTF criteria, but who have additional risk factors for the development of lung cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Noninvasive prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis using circulating trophoblasts: detection of the 50 most common disease-causing variants [^112d8wuW]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common severe autosomal recessive disorders. Prenatal or preconception CF screening is offered in some countries. A maternal blood sample in early pregnancy can provide circulating trophoblasts and offers a DNA source for genetic analysis of both the mother and the fetus. This study aimed to develop a cell-based noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) to screen for the 50 most common CF variants.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from 30 pregnancies undergoing invasive diagnostics and circulating trophoblasts were harvested in 27. Cystic fibrosis testing was conducted using two different methods: by fragment length analysis and by our newly developed NGS-based CF analysis.

Results

In all 27 cases, cell-based NIPT provided a result using both methods in agreement with the invasive test result.

Conclusion

This study shows that cell-based NIPT for CF screening provides a reliable result without the need for partner- and proband samples.

### High sensitivity of five colorectal screening programmes with faecal immunochemical test in the veneto region, Italy [^115pBTnf]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Although guaiac-based faecal occult blood test screening has been shown to be effective in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, it has been criticised mostly for its low sensitivity. Italian CRC screening programmes are based on immunochemical tests (iFOBT). We collected and analysed the interval cancers (ICs) found by five screening programmes to estimate their sensitivity.

Methods

ICs were identified in subjects who had a negative result in a screening examination from 2002 to 2007 (N = 267,789); data were linked with 2002–2008 hospital discharge records. Analysis was based on the follow up of 468,306 person-years. The proportional incidence-based sensitivity was estimated overall and by sex, age class, time since last negative iFOBT result, anatomical site, and history of screening (first or subsequent test).

Results

Overall, 126 ICs were identified, compared to 572 expected cancers. The proportional incidences were 15.3% and 31.0% in the first and the second interval-years, respectively, with an overall episode sensitivity of 78.0% (95% CI: 73.8 to 81.6). Sensitivity was higher for males than females (80.1% vs 74.8%); no differences were observed by age, anatomical site or between programmes. The test sensitivity of iFOBT was 82.1% (95% CI 78.1% to 85.3%).

Conclusions

iFOBT-based screening programmes showed a high performance in terms of sensitivity as estimated through the IC rates. The screening schedule utilised in our programmes (single iFOBT, positivity threshold of 100 ng Hb/ml of sample solution, inter-screening interval of 2 years) shows low rates of missed cancers that are diagnosed during the interval. HDR are a convenient and reliable source of data for IC studies.

### Cancer screening test use-United States, 2013 [^112HrPf2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

For this report, screening histories were examined only for persons in age groups recommended for routine screening. However, nearly one fourth of persons aged 51–65 years and 30% of those aged 65–75 years reported no recent cervical cancer and CRC screening, respectively, thus some might reach upper age limits for routine screening without adequate prior screening. Although USPSTF does not recommend routine screening for cervical cancer among average-risk women aged > 65 years or for CRC among adults aged 76–85 years, †† screening might be indicated for some adults in these older groups who were not screened adequately when they were in a younger age group for which routine screening was recommended.

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, NHIS data are self-reported and not verified by medical records. Second, the response rate was 61%, and nonresponse bias is possible despite adjustments for nonresponse. Third, although age-adjusted percentages for screening are presented that are consistent with Healthy People 2020 targets overall, percentages for subgroups are not age-adjusted. Fourth, Pap test data for 2003 were excluded because hysterectomy status was unknown. Fifth, screening guidelines and NHIS screening questions have changed over time. Sixth, confidence intervals were wide for some subgroups, indicating estimate imprecision. Finally, diagnostic tests rather than screening tests might have been reported by some respondents, possibly leading to overestimates of screening.

Increased efforts are needed to reach Healthy People 2020 cancer screening targets and reduce disparities. More intensive or focused efforts might be required to overcome persistent barriers among specific population subgroups. Making available all recommended CRC screening options might increase alignment of tests with individual needs and preferences, and facilitate screening completion. Evidence-based interventions can increase screening use. Information about recommended interventions is available for communities and health systems from The Community Guide. §§ Cancer Control PLANET provides resources for designing and implementing evidence-based programs. Such resources can help communities identify and implement effective interventions appropriate for their needs to increase use of these important services.

What is already known on this topic?

Screening is effective for detecting breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers early when the cancers can be more easily treated and deaths averted. Healthy People 2020 established targets for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States. Disparities in screening use related to several demographic and health care access factors have been observed.

Flow and timing — the domain overview and signaling question 10 specify what to report and how timing should align with practice: The Methods and Results sections should provide a clear description of clinical referral algorithms and of any patients excluded from the analyses, and the follow-up time interval and any interventions between the index test(s) and the reference standard should also be clearly described; the time interval between sample collection for testing and application of the reference standard should reflect what is done in routine clinical practice; at a minimum, results should report summary measures of follow-up time for all participants (e.g., mean/median with standard deviations and/or ranges), and if the interval is outside what is considered normal by routine clinical standards for a given indication, this could introduce bias; ideally a description of the clinical referral algorithm should allow reviewers to assess timing.

### Cancer screening tests… [^111JsFx6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Screening tests can find breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers early. Overview CDC supports screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers as recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Screening means checking your body for cancer before you have symptoms. Getting screening tests regularly may find breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers early, when treatment is likely to work best. Cancer Doesn't Wait In this video, Dr. Lisa Richardson, Dr. Robert W. Carlson, and Dr. Laura Makaroff talk about the importance of routine cancer screenings. Breast cancer For many women, mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat. Mammograms can find cancer before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Cervical cancer The HPV test and the Pap test can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early.
- The HPV testlooks for the virus that can cause cell changes on the cervix.
- The Pap test looks for precancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. Colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can find precancerous polyps, so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Screening tests also can find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Lung cancer The USPSTF recommends yearly lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography for people who:

- Have a history of heavy smoking, and
- Smoke now or quit within the past 15 years, and
- Are between 50 and 80 years old. Other types of cancer Screening for ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, testicular, and thyroid cancers has not been shown to reduce deaths from those cancers.

The USPSTF found too little evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening people without symptoms for bladder cancer, oral cancer, and skin cancer.

### Screening: why, when, and how [^113ozvSD]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Screening refers to the early detection of individuals with unrecognized disease or with early stages of disease among a population. Early detection allows early medical intervention, which may ultimately slow progression of the disease and reduce both morbidity and mortality. As such, screening is an important tool in improving public health. In 1968, Wilson and Jungner proposed 10 criteria to consider prior to starting screening for a disease. This review discusses these criteria when applied to screening for chronic kidney disease with additional focus on (1) the validity of the test to be used for screening; (2) which part of the population to screen; and (3) forms of bias to consider in screening.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^111Z4JKQ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Identification of eligible screening recommendations and data extraction

To identify eligible screening recommendations, we reviewed the most recent version of all guideline and recommendation statements listed on the websites of the CTFPHC, the UKNSC, and the USPSTF. We considered only completed guideline and recommendation statements, but not "upcoming guidelines" or "recommendations in progress". Eligible guidelines and recommendations were those that primarily focused on the use of a self-report questionnaire to identify patients with previously unreported and undetected yet presently experienced health problems or symptom-based syndromes. Guidelines and recommendations that focused on the use of performance-based measures, such as measures designed to test for cognitive impairment, but not self-report symptom questionnaires, were excluded.

The names of all guideline and recommendation statements listed on the websites of the CTFPHC, UKNSC, and USPSTF were uploaded into the systematic review data management program DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). DistillerSR was used to store and track results of the inclusion and exclusion process and for data extraction. When guideline and recommendation statements included more than one recommendation (e.g. one for children and one for adolescents), each recommendation was listed separately. For each included recommendation, we extracted the recommendation that was made (e.g. recommendation for screening, recommend against screening, insufficient evidence). Two investigators independently reviewed all recommendations to assess eligibility and extract the recommendations made. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third investigator, if necessary.

Sources of divergent recommendations

In cases where recommendations differed between guideline organizations, we extracted information on the main rationales provided for recommendations. One investigator initially extracted the rationales from the recommendation statements, and a second investigator validated the information extracted against the statements. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus, including a third investigator, if necessary. We compared rationales and identified where they diverged.

### Screening for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117NQaqY]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

A standardised form was created, piloted, and then used to abstract the available data for the predefined outcomes of interest. These were: all cause mortality and death from prostate cancer, diagnosis of prostate cancer, effect of screening on stage at diagnosis, false positive and false negative results, harms of screening, quality of life, and cost effectiveness. We used the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer system for prostate cancer staging. Two authors (MD and MMN) independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, consensus, and arbitration by a third author (PD). Data were extracted on the methodological domains relevant to minimising bias and random error in the analysis of trials by using the Cochrane methods for assessing risk of biasand GRADE methods. Specifically, we assessed study limitations by evaluating the method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, analysis by intention to screen, contamination of the control arm, and completeness of follow-up. As per GRADE, we further assessed the quality of evidence with regard to inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness, imprecision, and other potential sources of bias, such as publication and reporting bias (see below). GRADE criteria were then applied to downgrade the quality of evidence when indicated on an outcome specific basis. The quality of evidence for an individual outcome was ultimately rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. The review protocol is available from the authors on request.

Data synthesis and analysis

Relative risks were used to summarise the effect of screening intervention for all outcomes. Mantel-Haenszel estimates were calculated based on the number of events per number of participants in a given study arm and pooled under a random effects model, with data expressed as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. When no information on event rates was available, we used the inverse variance method. Heterogeneity was assessed by examining clinical characteristics of included studies as well as by formal statistical testing with χ² and I². The possibility of publication bias was assessed with Begg and Egger funnel plots. The results of these tests are not separately reported, however, because this method is known to be unreliable when there are fewer than 10 studies in the meta-analysisand because our qualitative analysis indicated a high likelihood of reporting bias. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5according to the PRISMA guidelines. We used the GRADE method to summarise findings. We also carried out predefined subgroup analyses for participants' age and stage at diagnosis and sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality parameters.

Results

Recommendations on screening with self-report questionnaires

As of 5 April 2016, there were 217 guideline or recommendation statements with 299 separate recommendations posted on the websites of the CTFPHC (12 statements with 39 recommendations), UKNSC (109 statements with 109 recommendations), and USPSTF (96 statements with 151 recommendations). Of these, there were 18 guideline or recommendation statements with 22 separate recommendations that focused on questionnaire-based screening, including two statements with three recommendations from the CTFPHC, eight statements with eight recommendations from the UKNSC, and eight statements with 11 recommendations from the USPSTF. No additional recommendations related to questionnaire-based screening were identified when the websites were reviewed again on 5 September 2016 (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Flow of guideline and recommendation statements reviewed and included, randomized controlled trials described in the statements, and results of randomized controlled trials that were tests of questionnaire-based screening interventions

As shown in Table 1, the CTFPHC made two weak recommendations and one strong recommendation against screening. The UKNSC recommended against screening in all eight of its recommendations. The USPSTF, on the other hand, made four recommendations to offer screening and determined in seven cases that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. In conditions where more than one organization made a recommendation for or against screening in the same patient population, the USPSTF recommended using questionnaires to screen for alcohol misuse, but the UKNSC recommended against it; the USPSTF recommended screening adults, including women in pregnancy and postpartum for depression, whereas the CTFPHC and UKNSC recommended against; both the CTFPHC and the UKNSC recommended against screening for developmental delays or behavioral problems; and the USPSTF recommended screening for intimate partner violence, whereas the UKNSC recommended against.

### Reliability of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal swab screening for predicting MRSA burn infections [^115jMWNV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection is the primary cause of death among burn-injured patients, with soft tissue infection trailing only pneumonia as the most common source of sepsis. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become endemic in burn units, resulting in the frequent initiation of empiric vancomycin therapy. MRSA nasal swab screening rapidly identifies patients who are MRSA-colonized, informing contact precaution and decontamination protocols. We hypothesized that MRSA nasal swab results could also be used to reliably predict results of wound cultures obtained from infected burns. We performed a retrospective review of all 250 patients who underwent weekly nasal swab screening and developed a burn infection in our unit over a 36-month period. By comparing nasal screening results to bacterial cultures, we determined test performance metrics for MRSA nasal swabs: sensitivity 64.1%, specificity 96.2%, positive predictive value (PPV) 75.8%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 93.5%. Nasal swabs were slightly more sensitive for predicting community-acquired MRSA infections versus those that were likely hospital-acquired. 30 patients (76.9%) presented with community-acquired MRSA infections; of those, 20 (66.7%) had tested positive for MRSA colonization on nasal screen. 9 patients (23.1%) developed hospital-acquired MRSA infections; 5 (55.6%) had tested positive for MRSA on a preceding nasal swab. The NPV calculated here indicates that patients who test negative for MRSA colonization by recent nasal swab are highly unlikely to have a burn infection caused by MRSA. Burn centers should employ universal MRSA nasal screening and de-escalate MRSA antibiotic coverage when treating burn infections in patients with a negative nasal swab result.

### Responsible implementation of expanded carrier screening [^115ZmKYE]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The carrier screening test

Although rapidly evolving genomic technologies facilitate carrier screening for a growing number of diseases simultaneously, developing a screening panel which meets the criteria that justify screening, including known positive and negative predictive values for each test, remains a challenge. One of the frameworks to assess new emerging tests is the ACCE framework developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA), National Office of Public Health and the Foundation of Blood Research (last accessed 18 August 2015).

Analytic validity

Analytic validity of a genetic test defines its ability to accurately and reliably measure the genotype of interest. Current commercial providers use mostly microarray-based genetic tests covering most frequent sequence variants in selected genes. Although the results may differ between providers, it has been shown that the validity of microarray test results is comparable to blood-based single-gene carrier tests. Alternatively, whole genes, and not only selected sequence variants, can be enriched and sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Analytical validity of targeted NGS is comparable to Sanger sequencing, while concordance and sensitivity of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing was reported to exceed 97 and 95% compared with high-density microarrays; main sources of non-uniformity included variance in depth of coverage, artefactual variants resulting from repetitive regions and larger structural variants. Clinical use of NGS is still in its early phase and recommendations are being developed for assuring the quality of NGS in clinical laboratories;, nevertheless, it is expected that companies start moving to NGS for their expanded panels. For certain conditions, such as HBPs and Tay-Sachs disease, biochemical methods may provide better accuracy than molecular methods.

### Lack of awareness of human papillomavirus testing among U.S. women [^115stk3j]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Current cervical cancer screening recommendations for women aged 30–65 years by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2018) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2021) include Pap test alone, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone, or both (cotesting). - In 2020, the American Cancer Society recommended moving toward HPV testing alone as the preferred screening test. A recent study in a nationwide convenience sample of women with private health insurance from 2013 to 2019 showed that cotesting increased in women aged 30–65 years, whereas HPV testing alone was rarely used. National health surveys are critical sources for monitoring the nation's cancer screening coverage and guiding Healthy People objectives. However, self-reported surveys may be limited in providing the most accurate information and may not yield reliable estimates of cervical cancer screening, especially if women are not aware of their testing status. In this study, we estimate the prevalence of women's responses to HPV testing awareness status questions and identify the demographic characteristics associated with these responses.

### An efficient strategy for evaluating new non-invasive screening tests for colorectal cancer: the guiding principles [^113izFry]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

9. Predicting value by paired comparison with a proven non-invasive screening test

The performance of a new non-invasive screening test can be assessed in parallel or paired with an existing non-invasive screening test of proven effectiveness at any step in the screening process, from population engagement to key outcomes. Intermediate end points known to reliably and consistently predict the potential for reducing CRC mortality and/or incidence can be used to compare new with existing screening tests. Such end points include estimates of diagnostic accuracy.

Explanatory text

It has been argued that when an RCT has established that a non-invasive screening test is effective in reducing CRC mortality, then a new non-invasive test does not need to be evaluated in an RCT with CRC mortality as the outcome, provided it is compared with a proven test (an existing non-invasive screening test with known effectiveness)in well-designed studies appropriate to the context of its use. Consequently, comparing a new test with an existing test of proven effectiveness will be highly informative and efficient for initial evaluation, as proposed for phases I and II evaluations (see principle 10 for the phases of evaluation). Proceeding to larger-scale, more definitive studies in typical screening populations will depend on the findings in these early simpler studies. It is acknowledged that the comparator test used may change over time, based on evolving data. Ongoing studies such as the CONFIRM trialwill assist in understanding whether projections based on modelling assumptions for tests such as FIT are indeed correct.

How initial studies evaluating a test can be planned in relatively small neoplasia-enriched populations to achieve a direct head-to-head comparison of a new test with a proven comparator using an efficient comparative design is shown in figure 2. Table 3 shows how to compare test accuracy (see online supplemental material 9.1 for further discussion).

### Principles of screening [^116Cvfd4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially-oriented procedures for progressively analyzing risk. Screening is broadly based and aimed at identifying those at high risk of a disease or condition. Diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively answer the question of whether or not a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) are necessary for proper utilization of screening tests.

### Recommendations for cell-free DNA assay validations: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and college of American pathologists [^112D62kg]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Clinical implementation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays — application categories, performance priorities, and evaluation granularity are specified: The clinical applications of ctDNA assays cover three broad and overlapping categories: i) diagnosing disease and/or selecting therapy, ii) guiding patient treatment and management after therapy, which may include monitoring for disease recurrence or ascertaining resistance mutations, and iii) screening for disease in individuals without a cancer diagnosis or with early-stage cancer, and all phases of testing — pre-analytical, analytical, and postanalytical — should be evaluated and optimized for each clinical assay category. Performance priorities vary by indication, with high analytical sensitivity required for a screening assay even at the expense of decreased specificity, and in a posttherapy setting detecting acquired resistance mutations in patients with advanced disease necessitates high sensitivity and specificity. Key considerations include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, overall accuracy, and concordance, and because therapy-response indicators typically depend on a specific variant, performance should be evaluated on an individual variant basis, though it may be aggregated for each variant class; inconsistent reporting of scenarios such as a true positive for EGFR L858R and a false negative for T790M has confounded interpretations of clinical validity.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^115zWx3e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, health screening recommendations have gone beyond screening for early-stage, asymptomatic disease to include "screening" for presently experienced health problems and symptoms using self-report questionnaires. We examined recommendations from three major national guideline organizations to determine the consistency of recommendations, identify sources of divergent recommendations, and determine if guideline organizations have identified any direct randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the effectiveness of questionnaire-based screening.

Methods

We reviewed recommendation statements listed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UKNSC), and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) as of 5 September 2016. Eligible recommendations focused on using self-report questionnaires to identify patients with presently experienced health problems or symptoms. Within each recommendation and accompanying evidence review we identified screening RCTs.

Results

We identified 22 separate recommendations on questionnaire-based screening, including three CTFPHC recommendations against screening, eight UKNSC recommendations against screening, four USPSTF recommendations in favor of screening (alcohol misuse, adolescent depression, adult depression, intimate partner violence), and seven USPSTF recommendations that did not recommend for or against screening. In the four cases where the USPSTF recommended screening, either the CTFPHC, the UKNSC, or both recommended against. When recommendations diverged, the USPSTF expressed confidence in benefits based on indirect evidence, evaluated potential harms as minimal, and did not consider cost or resource use. CTFPHC and UKNSC recommendations against screening, on the other hand, focused on the lack of direct evidence of benefit and raised concerns about harms to patients and resource use. Of six RCTs that directly evaluated screening interventions, five did not report any statistically significant primary or secondary health outcomes in favor of screening, and one trial reported equivocal results.

Conclusions

Only the USPSTF has made any recommendations for screening with questionnaires for presently experienced problems or symptoms. The CTFPHC and UKNSC recommended against screening in all of their recommendations. Differences in recommendations appear to reflect differences in willingness to assume benefit from indirect evidence and different approaches to assessing possible harms and resource consumption. There were no examples in any recommendations of RCTs with direct evidence of improved health outcomes.

### A short-form measure of diabetes distress among adults with type 1 diabetes for use in clinical practice: development and validation of the T1-DDS-7 [^1149WNM4]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Valid and reliable diabetes distress assessment is essential for identifying adults with elevated levels of concern and to guide targeted support. However, assessing diabetes distress must also be feasible in time-limited settings. We aimed to identify a short-form measure of the 28-item Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale (T1-DDS-28) representing seven sources of type 1 diabetes distress that would be convenient for use in clinical practice.

Research Design and Methods

Based on the evaluation of influence and importance by 14 experts in diabetes care and research, we identified the best-performing item within each of seven sources of diabetes distress included in the T1-DDS-28. To further validate the proposed short-form measure, we used survey data from 2,016 adults living with type 1 diabetes. Validity was examined by exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's α, test-retest reliability analysis, and correlations with other psychosocial measures.

Results

We identified a short-form measure of the T1-DDS-28 consisting of seven items, each representing a source of diabetes distress. These items showed satisfactory reliability (factor loadings > 0.45; α = 0.82; test-retest correlation, r = 0.90) and validity (correlation with T1-DDS-28, r = 0.95; area under the curve = 0.91; sensitivity 93%; specificity 89%) when combined in the short-form scale (T1-DDS-7).

Conclusions

We propose the T1-DDS-7 as a valid and reliable measure for routine screening of diabetes distress among adults with type 1 diabetes. In case of elevated levels of diabetes distress, we recommend that a full-scale assessment and open dialogue follow the short-form measure before determining further treatment.

### Screening for primary open-angle glaucoma: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117875bj]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests — diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma is based on degenerative optic disc changes, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and visual field defects; screening may use a single test or a smaller combination of tests to triage patients for specialist evaluation; commonly used tests include tonometry, dilated ophthalmoscopy, perimetry, gonioscopy, and pachymetry, with imaging tests such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), spectral-domain OCT, and optic disc photography supplementing the examination; because increased IOP is no longer necessary or sufficient for diagnosis, tonometry alone is inadequate; there are no tests that reliably identify who is at increased risk or most likely to benefit from screening, and the USPSTF found no randomized clinical trials of primary care referral to specialty eye services.

### Simple statistical measures for diagnostic accuracy assessment [^116HFDhT]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of diagnostic medicine research is to estimate and compare the accuracy of diagnostic tests to provide reliable information about a patient's disease status and thereby influencing patient care. When developing screening tools, researchers evaluate the discriminating power of the screening test by using simple measures such as the sensitivity and specificity of the test, as well as the positive and negative predictive values. In this brief report, we discuss these simple statistical measures that are used to quantify the diagnostic ability of a test.

### A prospective study assessing agreement and reliability of a geriatric evaluation [^116UoyMH]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Reliability of mood disorder assessment was excellent. This is probably due to the fact that it relies on highly standardized detailed scoring scale (Yesavage's Geriatric Depression Scale) that leaves little room for subjective interpretation by the rater. Similarly, good results for the assessment of functional impairment and cognitive impairment were also obtained that might also be explained by the fact that both rely on detailed scoring scales. Finally, even though a full geriatric assessment as described here can act as a reference consultation for older patients, it seems not feasible that the entire population of older people could benefit from it. Rather, collaboration with primary care physicians who screen for common geriatric syndromes might be a more judicious approach.

Methodological interest

The approach described in this study showed that using 3-way intraclass correlation (3w-ICC) index performs better than usual Kappa test to assess the reliability, when different sources of error variability are present in the data. It allows indeed calculating the disagreement attributable to each source of variability (observed disagreement decomposition) and avoids biased results on small samples, as shown by a simulation. On geriatric consultations data, assessment of reliability using 3w-ICC index provided slightly different and more accurate measurement with respect to the classical Kappa analysis, showing notably that reliability on the assessment of fall risk and global health status is lower (and the disagreement is higher) than when estimated with the traditional Kappa test. Furthermore, we estimated that variability related to the geriatrician related error plays an important role in the overall disagreement, while error variability related to the visit effect is almost inexistent (with 1 month distance visits), contrary to what one could expect when dealing with older people.

### Reporting and assessing the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies for cervical cancer screening and management [^117WsTi2]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening diagnostic accuracy studies — inter-rater agreement for an adapted QUADAS-2 assessment and patient selection domain guidance are provided: Percent agreement for individual questions ranged from 14.3% (Q9) to 100.0% (Q1, Q2, Q4, and Q7), and with revised signaling questions agreement increased to 83% for individual responses and to 87% for "yes" versus "unclear/no"; for the first set of 7 studies, applicability agreement was 57% for patient selection, 86% for index test, and 100% for reference standard, improving in a second set of 10 studies to 90% for patient selection and index test and 100% for reference standard. The framework distinguishes "3 populations, study, source, and target", and Signaling Question 1 asks about consecutive or random sampling with the expectation that "The study population should be representative of the underlying source population"; random sampling can also be representative, enrichment of higher-risk participants can be efficient, but "it is critical that the enriched population is weighted back to the source population" and that weighting uses "unbiased sampling of cases and controls" with knowledge of the sampling frame. Signaling Question 2 addresses exclusions, which "should be prespecified and should not be related to specific index test or reference test results", with examples including "excluding unsatisfactory index test results or exclusions based on a specific screening result". Signaling Question 3 addresses exclusions due to missing data, noting that "large proportions (≥ 15–20%) of missing data may introduce bias". Applicability is explicitly queried by "Are There Concerns That The Included Patients Do Not Match the Research Question?" which "addresses whether the findings from the study population will be applicable to the target population".

### The spectrum effect in tests for risk prediction, screening, and diagnosis [^1149L7rW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research, clinical practice, and policy

As for prognostic models, the development and evaluation of screening and diagnostic tests should ideally be undertaken by use of data from two different cohort studies (one for development and one for evaluation), which include a wide range of disease states and population characteristics. This approach would allow for some exploration of the spectrum effect, and ensure that the test's performance is not overestimated by use of a sample that is unrepresentative of the wider population. If this is not possible and case-control studies are used, ideally the study sample should be as similar as possible to the population in which the test is intended to be used.

In all situations, however, researchers should report sufficient data to allow the extent of the potential spectrum effect to be assessed. The STARD statement for reporting studies of diagnostic accuracyrecommends that authors describe the study participants in detail, including the distribution of disease severity. Authors should also report estimates of variability of diagnostic accuracy between readers, centres, or subgroups of participants and estimates of test reproducibility, to allow readers to assess any potential spectrum effect. Subgroup variation in sensitivity and specificity estimates can be examined by stratification of the characteristic defining the subgroup and by a simple χ² test of association. Subgroup specific receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can also be constructed and compared, while calculating the critical ratio (the difference in area under the ROC curves divided by the standard deviation of the difference) and comparing it with a normal distribution can provide a quantitative comparison of these ROC curves. As Mulherin and Miller point out, logistic modelling can produce estimates of test performanceamong small groups, and facilitates investigation of patient characteristics that are multicategorical or continuous, enabling the investigator to model separately factors that affect sensitivity and specificity.

Care should also be taken by researchers and policy makers when comparing the performance of diagnostic tests developed in different populations using different methods. For example, it is not appropriate to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a new diagnostic test developed and validated in a secondary care based case-control study with the sensitivity and specificity of screening programmes in a national population.

### Update on the methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: estimating certainty and magnitude of net benefit [^113PfXAF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The major goal of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is to provide a reliable and accurate source of evidence-based recommendations on a wide range of preventive services. In this article, the USPSTF updates and reviews the process by which it evaluates evidence, determines the certainty and magnitude of net benefit, and gives a final letter grade to recommendations. Because direct evidence about prevention is often unavailable, the Task Force usually considers indirect evidence. To guide its selection of indirect evidence, a "chain of evidence" is constructed within an analytic framework. The Task Force examines evidence of various research designs that addresses the key questions within the framework. New terms have been added to describe the USPSTF's judgment about the evidence for each key question: "convincing", "adequate", or "inadequate". For increased clarity, the USPSTF has changed its description of overall evidence of net benefit for the preventive service from "good", "fair", or "poor" quality to "high", "moderate", or "low" certainty. This rating considers the extent to which an uninterrupted chain of evidence exists across the analytic framework. Individual studies will continue to be judged as being of "good", "fair", or "poor" quality. Using outcomes tables, the USPSTF estimates the magnitude of benefits and the magnitude of harms, and synthesizes them into an estimate of the magnitude of net benefit. Although some judgment is required at all steps, the USPSTF strives to make the process as explicit and transparent as possible. The USPSTF anticipates that its methods for making evidence-based recommendations will continue to evolve.

### Reporting and assessing the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies for cervical cancer screening and management [^1158EJHc]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy studies — signaling question 9 addresses blinding of the reference standard and the need for transparent reporting: Typically, the reference test should be interpreted objectively without the index test, yet practice may vary across settings and individual pathologists and cannot be controlled in studies using clinical databases; therefore, detailed reporting of pathology practice is important to assess risk of bias.

### Noninvasive prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis using circulating trophoblasts: detection of the 50 most common disease-causing variants [^112T6zST]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common severe autosomal recessive disorders. Prenatal or preconception CF screening is offered in some countries. A maternal blood sample in early pregnancy can provide circulating trophoblasts and offers a DNA source for genetic analysis of both the mother and the fetus. This study aimed to develop a cell‐based noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) to screen for the 50 most common CF variants.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from 30 pregnancies undergoing invasive diagnostics and circulating trophoblasts were harvested in 27. Cystic fibrosis testing was conducted using two different methods: by fragment length analysis and by our newly developed NGS‐based CF analysis.

Results

In all 27 cases, cell‐based NIPT provided a result using both methods in agreement with the invasive test result.

Conclusion

This study shows that cell‐based NIPT for CF screening provides a reliable result without the need for partner‐ and proband samples.

### Cancer screening overview (PDQ ®)-health professional version… [^111JpdFh]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Commonly used screening tests, such as mammography for breast cancer and prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer, have false-positive rates per screen in the range of 5% to 10%; with repeat screening, cumulative false-positive rates for these tests are substantially higher. Follow-up invasive diagnostic procedures, such as a prostate biopsy, are associated with low but non-negligible risks of complications.

### Design and reporting considerations for genetic screening tests [^116dTSpe]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). Medium credibility.

Testing asymptomatic individuals for unsuspected conditions is not new to the medical and public health communities. Protocols to develop screening tests are well established. However, the application of screening principles to inherited diseases presents unique challenges. Unlike most screening tests, the natural history and disease prevalence of most rare inherited diseases in an unselected population are unknown. It is difficult or impossible to obtain a truth set cohort for clinical validation studies. As a result, it is not possible to accurately calculate clinical positive and negative predictive values for likely pathogenic variants, which are commonly returned in genetic screening assays. In addition, many of the genetic conditions included in screening panels do not have clinical confirmatory tests. All these elements are typically required to justify the development of a screening test, according to the World Health Organization screening principles. Nevertheless, as the cost of DNA sequencing continues to fall, more individuals are opting to undergo genomic testing in the absence of a clinical indication. Despite the challenges, reasonable estimates can be deduced and used to inform test design strategies. Herein, we review basic test design principles and apply them to genetic screening.

### The use of "overall accuracy" to evaluate the validity of screening or diagnostic tests [^115Qt4YS]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Evaluations of screening or diagnostic tests sometimes incorporate measures of overall accuracy, diagnostic accuracy, or test efficiency. These terms refer to a single summary measurement calculated from 2×2 contingency tables that is the overall probability that a patient will be correctly classified by a screening or diagnostic test. We assessed the value of overall accuracy in studies of test validity, a topic that has not received adequate emphasis in the clinical literature.

Design

Guided by previous reports, we summarize the issues concerning the use of overall accuracy. To document its use in contemporary studies, a search was performed for test evaluation studies published in the clinical literature from 2000 to 2002 in which overall accuracy derived from a 2×2 contingency table was reported.

Measurements and Main Results

Overall accuracy is the weighted average of a test's sensitivity and specificity, where sensitivity is weighted by prevalence and specificity is weighted by the complement of prevalence. Overall accuracy becomes particularly problematic as a measure of validity as 1) the difference between sensitivity and specificity increases and/or 2) the prevalence deviates away from 50%. Both situations lead to an increasing deviation between overall accuracy and either sensitivity or specificity. A summary of results from published studies (N = 25) illustrated that the prevalence-dependent nature of overall accuracy has potentially negative consequences that can lead to a distorted impression of the validity of a screening or diagnostic test.

Conclusions

Despite the intuitive appeal of overall accuracy as a single measure of test validity, its dependence on prevalence renders it inferior to the careful and balanced consideration of sensitivity and specificity.

### Screening for hepatitis C virus infection in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116sw93R]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Accuracy of screening tests and risk assessment — HCV screening tests are highly accurate, and evidence gaps remain regarding repeat screening yield or alternative strategies. The USPSTF previously found HCV screening to be highly accurate, and the USPSTF found no new evidence on the yield of repeat vs 1-time screening or alternative screening strategies (eg, different risk- or prevalence-based methods).

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^115YTe82]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

There are limitations to consider in evaluating the results of the present study. First, we included only recommendations from three guideline organizations, the CTFPHC, UKNSC, and USPSTF. Although these organizations are recognized for their leadership in the area of preventive healthcare policy, these results do not necessarily apply to other organizations that make recommendations on screening. Second, we only reviewed trials included in recommendation statements and did not seek to identify other trials that may have been conducted. It is possible that there are trials of questionnaire-based screening that we did not review from other areas of screening where no recommendations have been made or from trials conducted since these recommendations were made. However, identification of any existing trials was not the objective of the present study. Rather, we sought to determine if the CTFPHC, UKNSC, or USPSTF had identified direct evidence from any questionnaire-based screening program that would support the use of indirect evidence in recommendations.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116uaM9Z]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer screening — The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening, and prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years, and men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources, and patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy [^116uGzst]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy summarize the accuracy, e.g. the sensitivity and specificity, of diagnostic tests in a systematic and transparent way. The aim of such a review is to investigate whether a test is sufficiently specific or sensitive to fit its role in practice, to compare the accuracy of two or more diagnostic tests, or to investigate where existing variation in results comes from. The search strategy should be broad and preferably fully reported, to enable readers to assess the completeness of it. Included studies usually have a cross-sectional design in which the tests of interest, ideally both the index test and its comparator, are evaluated against the reference standard. They should be a reflection of the situation that the review question refers to. The quality of included studies is assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 checklist, containing items such as a consecutive and all-inclusive patient selection process, blinding of index test and reference standard assessment, a valid reference standard, and complete verification of all included participants. Studies recruiting cases separately from (healthy) controls are regarded as bearing a high risk of bias. For meta-analysis, the bivariate model or the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model is used. These models take into account potential threshold effects and the correlation between sensitivity and specificity. They also allow addition of covariates for investigatation of potential sources of heterogeneity. Finally, the results from the meta-analyses should be explained and interpreted for the reader, to be well understood.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^112yjzeE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of methodological quality

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS‐2 checklist tailored to this review (Appendix 7; Whiting 2011). The two review authors resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Ideally, studies examining the use of tests in symptomatic people should prospectively recruit a representative sample of participants presenting with signs and symptoms of COVID‐19, either in community or primary care settings or to a hospital setting, and they should clearly record the time of testing after the onset of symptoms. Studies in asymptomatic people at risk of infection should document time from exposure. Studies applying tests in a screening setting should document eligibility criteria for screening, particularly if a targeted approach is used and should take care to record any previous confirmed or suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or any relevant epidemiological exposures. Studies should perform tests in their intended use setting, using appropriate samples with or without viral transport medium and within the time period following specimen collection as indicated in the IFU document. Tests should be performed by relevant personnel (e.g. healthcare workers), and should be interpreted blinded to the final diagnosis (presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2). The reference standard diagnosis should be blinded to the result of the rapid test, and should not incorporate the result of the rapid test. If the reference standard includes clinical diagnosis of COVID‐19 for RT‐PCR‐negative patients, then established criteria should be used. Studies including samples from participants known not to have COVID‐19 should use pre‐pandemic sources or if contemporaneous samples then at least two RT‐PCR‐negative tests were required to confirm the absence of infection. Data should be reported for all study participants, including those where the result of the rapid test was inconclusive, or participants in whom the final diagnosis of COVID‐19 was uncertain. Studies should report whether results relate to participants (one sample per participant), or samples (multiple samples per participant).

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157SoSj]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

For study inclusion, the intent of this review was not to focus on a single criterion for "inappropriate" utilization nor a single source of that criterion (eg, local consensus guidelines, national guidelines). Rather, focus was cast broadly on the effect of utilization management approaches. This review (particularly the "Future Research Needs" section) was informed by 2013 and 2014 reviews, which characterized the "landscape" of inappropriate testing, and identified frequent sources of criteria for identification of inappropriate utilization.

Finally, several of the outcome types listed above (eg, number of tests, costs of tests, and turnaround time) represent intermediate outcomes and are systems/operational in nature. However, they are proximal indicators of practice effectiveness, such that direct causality in relation to an intervention is more likely. While other outcomes types (eg, length of stay, patient safety events, and morbidity) may be more patient-related outcomes, a concern (discussed in the "Limitations" section) is that they are distal to the intervention and thus influenced by other medical and nonmedical factors during the course of patient care.

Acquire: Literature Search and Request for Unpublished Studies

With involvement of the expert panel and a CDC librarian, a comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases to identify eligible studies in the current evidence base. The initial literature search was conducted April 17, 2014, with two additional searches on September 1, 2015, and January 10, 2016. Further description of the search protocol, as well as the full electronic search strategy for each searched database, are provided in Supplemental Table 3.

Appraise: Screen and Evaluate Individual Studies

Screening of search results against eligibility criteria was performed by two sets of independent reviewers, with disagreement mediated by consensus discussion or by a third reviewer. The screening process is further described in Supplemental Table 3.

Studies were categorized to specific practice category (ie, CDSS/CDST, CPOE, education, etc) independently by two reviewers, with disagreement mediated by consensus discussion or, if needed, by a third reviewer. Studies were then abstracted and quality appraised using a standard data abstraction form tailored to the topic of this systematic review (Supplemental Table 4). The final data abstraction forms — "evidence summary tables" for each study — represent consensus between two independent abstractions on content and quality appraisal, with a statistician's review of abstracted statistical data and input of qualitative effect size ratings. Use of the data abstraction forms for generation of "evidence summary tables" is further described in Supplemental Table 4.

### The importance of residual newborn screening dried blood spots, 2025 revision: a position statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^117UjBBY]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Residual DBS (RDBS) — roles in test development and quality assurance include validation of new assays and ongoing performance monitoring. RDBS are used in addition to screening for test development and improvement and laboratory quality control; before implementation, NBS programs must validate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of a new screening assay typically using archived DBS samples, and RDBS samples are often the only source available for these preliminary efforts; without access to RDBS, it would be difficult or even impossible to ensure that new screening tests are appropriately validated. Existing tests must be evaluated on a regular basis and RDBS are the primary source of specimens used for such testing, and if an individual is later diagnosed with a panel condition not originally detected by NBS, the RDBS from the affected individual can be reanalyzed to adjust cutoff values.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^1151LBbi]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Psychometric and measurement knowledge — Guideline 5 states that psychologists who provide psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation demonstrate knowledge in and seek to appropriately apply psychometric principles and measurement science as well as the effects of external sources of variability such as context, setting, purpose, and population. The rationale emphasizes that descriptive statistics are the foundational components of test construction and interpretation, noting common measures of central tendency and measures of variation. It adds that critical evaluation of instruments requires working knowledge of the fundamental theories and techniques of test construction. The section explains that individual results of most tests are derived from item responses that are grouped to form scales and are reported as raw scores or transformed and presented as normative comparative or standardized scores. On reliability/precision and measurement error, it states that the reliability/precision of test scores depends on how much scores vary across replications and that psychologists are encouraged to become familiar with approaches to reliability/precision estimation and factors that influence the appropriate index(es). On validity, it defines validity as "the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for proposed uses of tests", clarifies that validity is not an inherent property of a test but concerns support for use for a particular purpose, and notes that in evaluating tests, psychologists should become suitably aware of the five sources of validity.

### Cancer screening overview-NCI-national cancer institute… [^112QuFe6]. NCI (2010). Low credibility.

How do Screening Tests Become Standard Tests. Key Points
- Results from research studies help doctors decide when a screening test works well enough to be used as a standard test.
- Different types of research studies are done to study cancer screening.
- The following types of studies are used to get information about cancer screening tests:

- Randomized controlled trials
- Nonrandomized controlled trials
- Cohort studies
- Case-control studies
- Ecologic studies
- Expert opinions
- Screening tests for cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Results from research studies help doctors decide when a screening test works well enough to be used as a standard test. Evidence about how safe, accurate, and useful cancer screening tests are comes from clinical trials and other kinds of research studies. When enough evidence has been collected to show that a screening test is safe, accurate, and useful, it becomes a standard test.

Examples of cancer screening tests that were once under study but are now standard tests include:

- Colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.
- Mammograms for breast cancer.
- Pap tests for cervical cancer. The strongest evidence about screening comes from research done in clinical trials. However, clinical trials cannot always be used to study questions about screening. Findings from other types of studies can give useful information about how safe, useful, and accurate cancer screening tests are. The following types of studies are used to get information about cancer screening tests: Randomized controlled trials Randomized controlled trials give the highest level of evidence about how safe, accurate, and useful cancer screening tests are. In these trials, volunteers are assigned randomly to one of two or more groups. The people in one group may be given a standard screening test or no screening test.

The people in the other group are given the new screening test. Test results for the groups are then compared to see if the new screening test works better than the standard test, and to see if there are any harmful side effects. PDQ is a service of the NCI.

### The 2009 US preventive services task force (USPSTF) guidelines are not supported by science: the scientific support for mammography screening [^1133rx29]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Mammography screening is one of the major medical accomplishments of the past 40 years. In light of the downstream consequences of any screening test, it was critical that mammography screening be challenged. There have been many legitimate challenges, as well as many challenges that are not scientifically based but have gained credibility because of repetition. The latter have led to a great deal of confusion among women and their physicians. The aim of this review is to dispel many of the misunderstandings that have developed in the past 4 decades and, hopefully, reduce the confusion that has occurred. Mammography screening does not find all breast cancers and does not find all cancers early enough to result in a cure, but it is a major advance, and women should not be denied access to its benefits.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^114XJb6g]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Identification and evaluation of direct evidence from RCTs described in recommendations

We reviewed each recommendation statement and its accompanying evidence review and extracted the citations of all RCTs described as screening interventions; non-randomized interventions were excluded. If there were separate sections in the recommendation statement or evidence review for trials of screening interventions and for trials of treatment interventions, we extracted citations for all trials listed in the screening intervention section. If there were no separate sections, we extracted only citations for trials described as screening intervention trials. If the recommendation statement or evidence review described a systematic review of screening intervention trials, we extracted the citations for all eligible RCTs included in the systematic review.

In order to identify direct tests of screening interventions for each RCT that was described in a recommendation or accompanying evidence review as a screening trial, we determined (1) if patient eligibility and randomization occurred prior to administering the screening test and (2) if similar management resources were available to patients identified as having the target condition in both the screening and non-screening trial arms. Additionally, we determined if patients with a recent diagnosis of the target condition and patients being treated for the condition at the time of trial enrollment were excluded from the trial.

### Screening for aspiration risk associated with dysphagia in acute stroke [^111Tb5GL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke can affect people's ability to swallow, resulting in passage of some food and drink into the airway. This can cause choking, chest infection, malnutrition and dehydration, reduced rehabilitation, increased risk of anxiety and depression, longer hospital stay, increased likelihood of discharge to a care home, and increased risk of death. Early identification and management of disordered swallowing reduces risk of these difficulties.

Objectives

Primary objective
- To determine the diagnostic accuracy and the sensitivity and specificity of bedside screening tests for detecting risk of aspiration associated with dysphagia in people with acute stroke Secondary objectives
- To assess the influence of the following sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of bedside screening tools for dysphagia - Patient demographics (e.g. age, gender) - Time post stroke that the study was conducted (from admission to 48 hours) to ensure only hyperacute and acute stroke swallow screening tools are identified - Definition of dysphagia used by the study - Level of training of nursing staff (both grade and training in the screening tool) - Low-quality studies identified from the methodological quality checklist - Type and threshold of index test - Type of reference test SEARCH METHODS: In June 2017 and December 2019, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database via the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination; the reference lists of included studies; and grey literature sources. We contacted experts in the field to identify any ongoing studies and those potentially missed by the search strategy.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that were single-gate or two-gate studies comparing a bedside screening tool administered by nurses or other healthcare professionals (HCPs) with expert or instrumental assessment for detection of aspiration associated with dysphagia in adults with acute stroke admitted to hospital.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened each study using the eligibility criteria and then extracted data, including the sensitivity and specificity of each index test against the reference test. A third review author was available at each stage to settle disagreements. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS-2) tool. We identified insufficient studies for each index test, so we performed no meta-analysis. Diagnostic accuracy data were presented as sensitivities and specificities for the index tests.

Main Results

Overall, we included 25 studies in the review, four of which we included as narratives (with no accuracy statistics reported). The included studies involved 3953 participants and 37 screening tests. Of these, 24 screening tests used water only, six used water and other consistencies, and seven used other methods. For index tests using water only, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 46% to 100% and from 43% to 100%, respectively; for those using water and other consistencies, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 75% to 100% and from 69% to 90%, respectively; and for those using other methods, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 29% to 100% and from 39% to 86%, respectively. Twenty screening tests used expert assessment or the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) as the reference, six used fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), and 11 used videofluoroscopy (VF). Fifteen screening tools had an outcome of aspiration risk, 20 screening tools had an outcome of dysphagia, and two narrative papers did not report the outcome. Twenty-one screening tests were carried out by nurses, and 16 were carried out by other HCPs (not including speech and language therapists (SLTs)). We assessed a total of six studies as low risk across all four QUADAS-2 risk of bias domains, and we rated 15 studies as low concern across all three applicability domains. No single study demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity with low risk of bias for all domains. The best performing combined water swallow and instrumental tool was the Bedside Aspiration test (n = 50), the best performing water plus other consistencies tool was the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS; n = 30), and the best water only swallow screening tool was the Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screening Test (TOR-BSST; n = 24). All tools demonstrated combined highest sensitivity and specificity and low risk of bias for all domains. However, clinicians should be cautious in their interpretation of these findings, as these tests are based on single studies with small sample sizes, which limits the estimates of reliability of screening tests.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify a single swallow screening tool with high and precisely estimated sensitivity and specificity based on at least one trial with low risk of bias. However, we were able to offer recommendations for further high-quality studies that are needed to improve the accuracy and clinical utility of bedside screening tools.

### Reporting and assessing the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies for cervical cancer screening and management [^1145r6TM]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Patient selection for cervical cancer screening and management — study populations should match intended use. For screening and triage, the source population should reflect individuals undergoing routine cervical cancer screening in the appropriate age range (e.g., 21–65 years), and the study population should include a series of consecutively screened patients or a random sample that can be weighted back to the full screening population. If the population is enriched for disease endpoints (e.g., from a colposcopy referral population), then a sampling frame and weighting scheme should be described that allows extrapolation back to the full screening population. For posttreatment surveillance, the study population should include a series of consecutive patients with previous treatment in the last 6 to 18 months, and the treatment modality should be described.

ACOEM position statement — guiding principles for workplace genetic screening: ACOEM endorses the following guiding principles: Genetic screening must be conducted with consideration of the law, medical ethical standards, and good scientific practices. Until extensively validated, genetic screening is a form of human investigation and subject to the appropriate ethical and scientific controls. Due consideration should be given to the quality and reliability of the screening tests and the predictive value of the results. Caution should be exercised in the use and interpretation of screening tests. If performed, genetic screening should always be accompanied by an opportunity to discuss the meaning of the results with an appropriately trained health professional.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^11643pTs]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Guideline development and evidence sources — The guideline development group chose to use 2 reports commissioned by the USPSTF for its 2018 update as sources of evidence: a systematic evidence review on cervical screening by the Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence‑Based Practice Center and a decision analysis based on a mathematical disease‑simulation model from the Center for Health Decision Science of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; the ACS staff also conducted continued surveillance and reviewed potentially relevant articles after the publication date of the evidence review report (August 2018). The systematic review's data analysis was restricted mostly to randomized controlled trials conducted in women aged 25 to 65 years. Historical ACS recommendations stated that cervical cancer screening should be initiated at age 21 years and that women aged ≥ 65 years who have a history of regular screening with negative results should discontinue screening.

### What constitutes evidence? Colorectal cancer screening and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113uJwQ8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force is perhaps America's best-known source of evidence-based medicine (EBM) recommendations. This paper reviews aspects of the history of one such recommendation-screening for colorectal cancer (CRC)-to explore how the Task Force evaluates the best available evidence to reach its conclusions. Although the Task Force initially believed there was inadequate evidence to recommend CRC screening in the 1980s, it later changed its mind. Indeed, by 2002, it was recommending screening colonoscopy for those aged 50 and older, "extrapolating" from the existing evidence as there were no randomized controlled trials of the procedure. By 2016, due in part to the use of an emerging analytic modality known as modeling, the Task Force supported four additional CRC screening tests that lacked randomized data. Among the reasons the Task Force gave for these decisions was the desire to improve adherence for a strategy-screening healthy, asymptomatic individuals-that it believed saved lives. During these same years, the Task Force diverged from other organizations by declining to advocate screening otherwise healthy Black patients earlier than age 50-despite the fact that such individuals had higher rates of CRC than the general population, higher mortality from the disease and earlier onset of the disease. In declining to extrapolate in this instance, the Task Force underscored the lack of reliable data that proved that the benefits of such testing would outweigh the harms. The history of CRC screening reminds us that scientific evaluation relies not only on methodological sophistication but also on a combination of intellectual, cognitive and social processes. General internists-and their patients-should realize that EBM recommendations are often not definitive but rather thoughtful data-based advice.

### Cancer screening test use-United States, 2015 [^114yHDKG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the screening questions did not distinguish whether the test was performed for screening or diagnostic purposes; however, a person might be considered effectively screened in either instance. Second, data were self-reported and were not verified by medical records. Third, the overall response rate was 55.2%, and nonresponse bias is possible, despite adjustments for nonresponse. Fourth, sample sizes were small and not age-adjusted for some subgroups. Comparisons of subgroup rates to national targets should be interpreted with caution because targets were based on improvement from the 2008 baseline values for the national age-adjusted rate. In addition, consideration should be given to the fact that targets were designed to be met by 2020, not 2015. Finally, screening recommendations and questions have changed over time. In 2012, screening every 5 years with Pap and HPV tests was added as an option for women aged 30–65 years. It is unclear whether this change might have extended screening intervals for women and thus contributed to the slight decline in cervical cancer screening. Attempts were made to account methodologically for changes in recommendations and questions by using consistent definitions across years. Because hysterectomy status was unknown for 2003, Pap test data for that year were excluded Screening measures for the trend analysis were defined according to the 2000 method, which makes assumptions for cases with only partial timing data (i.e. respondent did not provide enough timing detail to determine if the test came within the recommended time interval). This source of bias results in slightly higher estimates but allows for fair comparisons over time. Accordingly, percentages for 2015 in the trend analysis differ slightly from those reported in the tables.

These findings might inform future activities to increase the use of screening tests as recommended. Some progress has been achieved toward meeting the HP2020 objective for colorectal cancer screening, but the trend for mammography use has remained static, and cervical cancer screening is declining. Substantial disparities persist for some subgroups, including persons without health insurance or a usual source of health care. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program can provide access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services for low-income, uninsured, and medically underserved women. For persons with access to health care, evidence-based interventions, such as provider and patient reminders about screening, can increase cancer screening rates. Innovative approaches are needed to reach some racial and ethnic minorities and medically underserved populations to improve the use of cancer screening test use toward the HP2020 targets.

### Development of a follow-up measure to ensure complete screening for colorectal cancer [^114CJgwd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Stool-based tests are robust tools for CRC screening; however, their use only reflects part of the screening process. A timely follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal SBT result is necessary to complete the screening process. To address this shortcoming, we have proposed a new measure to complement the existing HEDIS measure: the CRC screening completion measure. The measure is proposed as a health system measure, but where SBT results are available, the measure could also be considered for health plans. This measure is being tested in 20 health systems participating in a national CRC Screening Best Practices Learning Collaborative (2023–2025)and has been shown to be feasible to implement into practice. Ultimately, we hope to improve CRC screening rates and detection of CRC at earlier stages in efforts to reduce the burden of this disease on individuals and health care systems. While technically all noncolonoscopy tests — that is, SBTs, computed tomographic colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy — should be followed up with a colonoscopy, this measure is limited to SBTs due to the infrequent use of the other tests and the growing use of SBTs. In fact, more than 99% of CRC screening tests reported in the American Medical Group Association's national CRC Screening Best Practices Learning Collaborativewere colonoscopies or SBTs. Other noncolonoscopy tests could be considered for inclusion in this measure, although the impact on measure rates would be negligible.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include a large sample size of 38 diverse HCOs; our ability to test the reliability, variability, and face validity of the data over several years; and the demonstrated feasibility of collecting data elements in 3 independent HCOs. This study also has some limitations. Health systems may be limited in identifying colonoscopies that occurred outside their organizations. A sensitivity analysis found underestimates of the follow-up colonoscopy rate to be approximately 14%; however, because this rate was calculated using administrative claims data from a single payer, true underestimates of follow-up colonoscopies could differ among individual health systems. The clinical data used in this study were sourced from a sample of health systems that maintained a relationship with the provider of the source data (OLDW), which may introduce selection bias if they differed systematically from other US health systems.

### Risk of bias from inclusion of patients who already have diagnosis of or are undergoing treatment for depression in diagnostic accuracy studies of screening tools for depression: systematic review [^116bwaiR]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

A great deal of research has been conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tests in different clinical settings. Based on data from such studies, expert panels have considered the risks and benefits of screening and issued recommendations to screen for depression in various settings. Diagnostic or screening tests, however, are useful only to the extent that they distinguish between disordered and non-disordered states that are not otherwise obvious to cliniciansand if they are accurate across the spectrum of patients who will be assessed in clinical practice.

The term "spectrum effect" has been used to describe variations in test performance that sometimes occur across subgroups of patients that differ in demographic or clinical features. Spectrum effects raise questions about the generalisability of study results to specific populations of patients that might differ in important ways from study samples. The term "spectrum bias" is related and also describes situations in which the accuracy of a test is heterogeneous across subgroups of patients. Spectrum bias is said to be present when a study samples preferentially from certain portions of the patient spectrum but provides a global estimate of accuracy that could misrepresent what would be experienced in actual practice. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy that are based on case-control designs and whose samples include only obvious cases and healthy controls, for instance, have been shown to substantially overestimate diagnostic accuracy.

Self reported depression questionnaires are used for various purposes (such as screening for unidentified cases, tracking severity of symptoms, detecting relapse). For the purpose of screening, which involves the identification of cases not previously recognised, if individuals who already have a diagnosis of depression are not specifically excluded from studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools, examined cohorts will have a greater prevalence and severity of depression than if only individuals without clinically recognised depression were screened. Not excluding patients who already have a diagnosis would, in turn, lead to determinations of screening accuracy and new case yield that are inflated compared with what would be achieved if the instrument were used to screen patients in clinical practice.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are highly cited and are prioritised in grading evidence for practice guidelines. If studies of the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools that include patients who already have a diagnosis or are receiving treatment are included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses without adjustment for potential bias, these reviews could provide misleading accuracy estimates, thereby misleading calculations of risk-benefit by expert panels and, thus, clinicians.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^1169nBp3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, neither the CTFPHC nor the UKNSC has made any recommendations endorsing questionnaire-based screening. The USPSTF, on the other hand, has recommended questionnaire-based screening for alcohol misuse, depression in adolescents and adults, and intimate partner violence. Compared to the CTFPHC and UKNSC, the USPSTF appears to be more confident in relying upon indirect evidence, minimizes potential harms, and does not consider cost and resource utilization.

### Association between use of systematic reviews and national policy recommendations on screening newborn babies for rare diseases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UwehH]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Two reviewers independently assessed each item against the inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were:

Source of documents — only information from national policy making organisations was included. We excluded recommendations by state or regional organisations unless endorsed by a national policy making organisation, and recommendations by clinical societies or other groups unless they were explicitly used to underpin national policy decisions.

Type of document — we included all journal articles, papers, legal documents, presentations, conference abstracts, or reports from the website of the organisation and all those obtained through personal communication with policy makers, officials, and researchers in all included countries. We did not include patient information.

Language — there were no restrictions on language. For documents not in English we used automated translation software, with formal translation by native speakers if further clarity was needed.

Subject of documents — we included material on whether to start or stop screening or material that evaluated the effectiveness of current or proposed screening programmes for any condition using the newborn blood spot test. If we also found reviews of conditions for that country, we included documents describing standards for national evidence review processes for screening.

Method of reaching recommendation — we included recommendations produced using all methods, including evidence from systematic reviews, expert panels, or any approach that resulted in a recommendation or decision or described why or how a decision was made.

Data extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus and involvement of a third reviewer if necessary (see appendix 3 for data extraction sheet). Data extraction was carried out in two steps. Firstly, we recorded whether any of the review documentation included a systematic review. The criteria for defining a systematic review were inclusive; we required either two parts of the search strategy (for example, search terms, databases, dates) to be described or any details of systematic evidence selection after a search (for example, inclusion criteria, PRISMA flow chart) to be described (table 1). We were also inclusive about the question posed by the systematic review, which could address any aspect of the evidence relating to whether or not to screen for a condition, including benefits of early detection through screening, disease prevalence, test accuracy, effects of false positive test results, overdiagnosis or any other harm, and clinical course of the condition.

### Screening adults for type 2 diabetes: a review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^116gV9cV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a heavy burden of suffering. Screening for diabetes is controversial.

Purpose

To examine the evidence that screening and earlier treatment are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, reviews, and experts, all of which addressed key questions about screening.

Study Selection

Studies that provided information about the existence and length of an asymptomatic phase of diabetes; studies that addressed the accuracy and reliability of screening tests; and randomized, controlled trials with health outcomes for various treatment strategies were selected.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers abstracted relevant information using standardized abstraction forms and graded articles according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Data Synthesis

No randomized, controlled trial of screening for diabetes has been performed. Type 2 diabetes mellitus includes an asymptomatic preclinical phase; the length of this phase is unknown. Screening tests can detect diabetes in its preclinical phase. Over the 10 to 15 years after clinical diagnosis, tight glycemic control probably reduces the risk for blindness and end-stage renal disease, and aggressive control of hypertension, lipid therapy, and aspirin use reduce cardiovascular events. The magnitude of the benefit is larger for cardiovascular risk reduction than for tight glycemic control. The additional benefit of starting these treatments in the preclinical phase, after detection by screening, is uncertain but is probably also greater for cardiovascular risk reduction.

Conclusions

The interventions that are most clearly beneficial during the preclinical phase are those that affect the risk for cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of additional benefit of initiating tight glycemic control during the preclinical phase is uncertain but probably small.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^116LVZhR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For included RCTs that directly evaluated screening interventions based on having (1) randomized patients prior to administering the screening test and (2) providing similar management resources to patients with the condition in the screening and non-screening trial arms, we extracted the primary and secondary health outcomes assessed in the RCT and determined if the outcomes were statistically significant or not. Process-based outcomes, such as the number of patients diagnosed or the number of patients who received treatment, were not extracted since these outcomes do not reflect improvements in health. If intent-to-treat and completer-only outcomes were provided, we extracted only intent-to-treat results. We did not extract subgroup outcomes, but only outcomes for main analyses that included all patients randomized to the screening and non-screening trial arms.

We determined if each screening trial had been registered, and, if so, we compared published outcomes to registered outcomes to identify any relevant discrepancies. If there was a pre-enrollment trial registration, and if published and registered outcomes differed, we recorded whether the trial outcome related to demonstrating benefit would have been different if pre-trial registered outcomes had been used. To identify whether trials had been registered, we first attempted to retrieve trial registration data, including the registration number, from each published article. If no registration information was included in the article, we searched for a trial registration in multiple clinical trial registries, including the ClinicalTrials.gov registry, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry, the World Health Organization registry search portal, and the registry from the country of the first author (e.g. Netherlands Trial Register;). To identify registry records, we performed a search using key terms from the published article, then attempted to match the principal investigator, funding source, intervention, control group, and design from the article to the registrations obtained in the search. If this method did not uncover a registration number, we contacted the corresponding author by email to attempt to determine if there was a trial registration that we had not been able to identify. Data were extracted by two investigators independently with any disagreements resolved through consultation with a third investigator.

### APA guidelines for psychological assessment and evaluation [^115N9S39]. APA (2020). High credibility.

Psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation — multiple sources of information: Psychologists who conduct psychological testing, assessment, and evaluation strive to use multiple sources of relevant and reliable clinical information collected according to established principles and methods of assessment. The guidance emphasizes integrating data from multiple sources and recognizing the advisability of using multiple methods, with examples including standardized, norm-referenced tests, interviews, behavior observations, performance-based measures, patient-examiner relationship, and rating scales. It further states that convergence and divergence of information from multiple sources informs the assessment process and increases confidence in and appropriate critique of test results, while information from multiple resources is valuable and useful but may not be feasible in some situations.

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^113nHFSx]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The USPSTF was recently criticized for relying upon indirect evidence and for not adequately considering potential harms in recommending depression screening. Experts pointed out that there are numerous examples where the use of insufficient and indirect evidence has led to ineffective and harmful screening programs and argued that guideline makers should refrain from recommending new screening services based on only indirect evidence. In the context of questionnaire-based screening programs, this concern is heightened because, when RCTs have directly tested these programs, they have not found evidence of health benefits. When high-quality trials are feasibly conducted, as is the case with questionnaire-based screening programs, a more conservative approach than recommending a new service without direct evidence would be to call for well-conducted RCTs.

Appropriate care that addresses patient needs, but avoids intervention without demonstrated benefit, is increasingly emphasized in healthcare planning and service delivery. Recognition that screening is not benign is reflected in recent recommendations for more restricted use of screening for breast and prostate cancer. Using self-report questionnaires as screening tests to identify unreported and unrecognized, but presently experienced, health problems and symptoms extends the boundaries of the standard screening paradigm, in which tests are used to detect hidden signs or unrecognized symptoms in order to stave off future health problems. It is possible that questionnaire-based screening might improve upon good, conscientious medical care that provides patients with information and encourages them to inquire about problems they are experiencing. Direct evidence from existing studies included in CTFPHC, UKNSC, and USPSTF recommendations, however, does not lead to this conclusion.

Without evidence that using questionnaires to search for presently experienced, unreported problems would lead to better health outcomes, the negative implications of this practice need to be carefully considered in screening recommendations, including the possibility that it would lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Traditionally, overdiagnosis has been understood to occur when a person without symptoms is diagnosed with a condition or disease that will not lead to symptoms or early mortality and would not ever be identified without screening. More broadly, in the case of presently experienced problems or symptoms, overdiagnosis can occur when patients are identified with a disorder or problem that they do not experience as significantly impairing and that would not be expected to be substantively affected by medical intervention. This could occur in mental disorders, even when diagnostic criteria are met, such as in the presence of mild depressive symptoms that fall close to the normal range on a diagnostic spectrum.

### Population-level impact of the BMJ rapid recommendation for colorectal cancer screening: a microsimulation analysis [^116YRjqi]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Our study is the first to assess the long-term population-level impact of the Rapid Recommendation. An important strength of this study is it using the most reliable data sources available for Switzerland. Nevertheless, there are several limitations to note. First, as with many population health surveys, the SHS is prone to healthy population and social desirability biases. The true distribution of QCancer risk might be higher on average and more heterogeneous than reported if unhealthy lifestyle is under-reported and unhealthy subjects are under-represented. Second, QCancer was developed for the UK population and would ideally be recalibrated to the Swiss or Dutch population. However, it is unlikely that a recalibrated QCancer tool for these countries, nor the original tool applied to the UK population, is more independent from age and sex. Third, we only modelled FIT and colonoscopy separately. In reality, most Swiss programmes have the benefits, harms and burdens of offering the choice between both screening tests. Finally, we calibrated MISCAN-Colon to historical CRC incidence rates and stage distributions from a period before (opportunistic) CRC screening to more accurately model the likely effects of screening. As a consequence, we were limited to reliable CRC stage distribution data from the urban canton of Geneva, which might not be representative for Switzerland.

### Sources of variation and bias in studies of diagnostic accuracy: a systematic review [^11163iQQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of diagnostic accuracy are subject to different sources of bias and variation than studies that evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. Little is known about the effects of these sources of bias and variation.

Purpose

To summarize the evidence on factors that can lead to bias or variation in the results of diagnostic accuracy studies.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS, and the methodologic databases of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration. Methodologic experts in diagnostic tests were contacted.

Study Selection

Studies that investigated the effects of bias and variation on measures of test performance were eligible for inclusion, which was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer.

Data Synthesis

The best-documented effects of bias and variation were found for demographic features, disease prevalence and severity, partial verification bias, clinical review bias, and observer and instrument variation. For other sources, such as distorted selection of participants, absent or inappropriate reference standard, differential verification bias, and review bias, the amount of evidence was limited. Evidence was lacking for other features, including incorporation bias, treatment paradox, arbitrary choice of threshold value, and dropouts.

Conclusions

Many issues in the design and conduct of diagnostic accuracy studies can lead to bias or variation; however, the empirical evidence about the size and effect of these issues is limited.

### Reporting and assessing the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies for cervical cancer screening and management [^114BevnX]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

Reference standard receipt — signaling question 11 outlines expectations and bias from incomplete verification or follow-up: Generally, in diagnostic studies, it is expected that all study participants receive a reference standard, but the reference standard is typically not applied to the whole population in cervical cancer screening studies; when evaluating multiple index tests, all individuals testing positive for any test should be referred to colposcopy equally; patients who were supposed to receive a reference standard may be lost to follow-up, which can introduce bias when risks differ between those not undergoing the reference standard and those who do, and the degree to which this may introduce bias is increased as the proportion lost to follow-up increases.

### A step-by-step guide to the systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic and prognostic test accuracy evaluations [^111qD6nh]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Analysis of diagnostic (or screening) test accuracy. The meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy represents an area of growing interest. These analyses often consist of three steps: assessment of study quality, creation of forest plots for sensitivity and specificity for each study, and summarisation of estimates of sensitivity and specificity using two types of models.

Quality assessment for diagnostic articles: Quality assessment is as important in systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies as it is in any other type of review, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed as recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. These recommendations were adapted from the QUADAS guidelines. All of the criteria were classified as Yes, No or Unclear based on information available in this publication (see Appendix 5 in Supplementary Materials). The studies were judged according to the data used for the meta-analysis, which may not include all of the data available in the publication.

Meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests: Meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy present many challengers: (1) even in the simplest case, a minimum of two summary statistics (sensitivity and specificity) must be addressed simultaneously; (2) meta-analysis methods allow studies to be combined that have applied tests at different thresholds; and (3) random-effect methods are recommended when data are heterogeneous (this is the rule for diagnostic studies). Therefore, in a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy, two analysis steps must be completed: (1) forest plots for pooling the sensitivity and specificity of all of the selected studies are first created; and (2) two statistical methods to calculate summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity are proposed to account for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity across studies caused by the relationship between sensitivity and specificity within each study. The two statistical methods, that is, the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and bivariate model, are statistically rigorous (Appendix 6 in Supplementary Materials introduces two ways to perform a meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests).

### Consistency and sources of divergence in recommendations on screening with questionnaires for presently experienced health problems or symptoms: a comparison of recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, UK national screening committee, and US preventive services task force [^111TkxeS]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

However, screening with questionnaires for existing conditions is controversial, and major guideline organizations have reached different conclusions about the potential benefits versus harms of some of these programs. Indeed, there are a number of reasons why applying a conventional test-based screening paradigm to presently experienced problems and symptoms may not improve health outcomes compared to providing patients with accurate healthcare information and appropriate assessment and intervention when problems are recognized. One such reason is that some of the conditions being screened may not necessarily be progressive. For some patients, symptoms and problems identified via self-report questionnaires reflect transitory reactions to circumstances that will resolve without intervention. Another is that using tests to identify and label medical conditions that patients do not otherwise recognize or report as health problems risks identifying large numbers of patients with mild conditions whose symptoms or problems may not be amenable to healthcare interventions. Finally, interventions to reduce symptoms or solve health problems are most effective when there is agreement between patients and providers on the impact of the problem and the need to address it. Such an agreement may not be present when tests are used to inform patients that they are experiencing a healthcare problem which they did not recognize as such.

Recommendations for screening should ideally be based on direct evidence from high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that show a sufficiently large benefit to justify the costs and harms involved in screening. RCTs designed to directly test the effectiveness of a screening program should, at a minimum, (1) randomize patients prior to the screening intervention and (2) provide similar treatment resources to patients detected with the condition or health problem in the screening and non-screening arms of the trial so as not to confound the effects of a screening program with the effects of providing different treatments. Ideally, RCTs of screening programs would also exclude patients who are already known to have the targeted condition at the time of screening, as these patients would not be screened in actual practice.

The objective of the present study was to examine recommendations from three major national guideline organizations, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UKNSC), and the USPSTF, to (1) document the consistency of recommendations on using questionnaires to screen for presently experienced health problems or symptom-based syndromes, (2) identify sources of divergent recommendations, and (3) determine if guideline organizations have identified any examples of direct evidence from RCTs that questionnaire-based screening programs improve health outcomes for screened patients compared to non-screened patients.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112nPjDX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

A group of experts on CD screening and management in the United States, including clinicians, researchers, and public health experts, prepared these recommendations. Group members had previously participated in meetings on challenges in diagnosis of CD. The working group was organized to provide a straightforward, quick-reference tool to facilitate CD testing by primary healthcare providers, hospitals, infectious disease specialists, and laboratories. Diagnostic guidance was constructed via both expert consensus and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The group agreed on 6 main questions based on the PICO method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) and divided into subgroups to discuss each and propose initial recommendations, which were then shared and validated within the larger group. Literature searches were conducted on CD screening and prevalence in the United States and the 4 assays that are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for clinical use (Table 1).

Table 1.
Trypanosoma cruzi -Specific IgG Antibody Assays With Food and Drug Administration Diagnostic Clearance a

The GRADE methodology provides 2 types of ratings. The strength of the recommendation (strong or conditional, either for or against a recommendation) is based on the public health priority, potential benefit, feasibility of implementation, acceptability to patients, and costs in terms of resources. An additional rating is provided for the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation (high, moderate, low, very low), which considers previous study designs, effect size, relevance, sources of bias, and other factors. Two key limitations should be noted: (1) the evidence on US CD has significant gaps, and (2) while the GRADE methodology provides a structured, evidence-based framework, this does not completely rule out subjectivity in determining ratings.

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113XuyNt]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) sample source — digital rectal exam (DRE) versus spontaneous stool — There is limited information examining the test characteristics of FIT when applied to a stool specimen obtained by DRE, and available data suggest that test characteristics may suffer; therefore, The Task Force suggests that FIT screening programs rely on spontaneously passed stool specimens and not an in-office DRE sample. Weak recommendation; very low quality evidence.

### What you need to know about statistics part I: validity of diagnostic and screening tests [^116Ln4yx]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The intent of this manuscript is to provide guidance and support to clinicians and investigators for reporting the results of screening and diagnostic tests. This article is the first of two parts addressing statistics in imaging research. In this part validity measures are discussed. In part II reliability measures will be discussed. In discussing validity, the following concepts will be introduced: (1) functions of diagnostic tests, (2) statistical characteristics of diagnostic tests and application of validity measures, (3) power and sample size for testing the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, (4) statistical versus clinical significance and (5) characteristics of a useful diagnostic test.

### National experience in the first two years of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical screening in an HPV vaccinated population in Australia: observational study [^1149ATFP]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data source, attendance, and test results

Data were sourced from Australia's National Cancer Screening Register. Laboratories are required to report all test results to the national register, including HPV tests, liquid based cytology, and histology, and are required to use tests that separately identify HPV16 and HPV18. Data were extracted from the register for all women with at least one HPV test, conducted between 1 December 2017 and 31 December 2019 inclusive, including all subsequent HPV tests, cytology, and colposcopy or histology in these women. Colposcopy and histology tests were included if they were conducted up until 16 April 2020 and recorded in the register on 22 September 2020. The proportion of women eligible for screening who attended for their first HPV test took into account women enrolled in Compass (as the register excludes data on women participating in Compass; about 75 944 were enrolled as of 31 December 2019)and the estimated proportion of women who had undergone hysterectomy, by excluding both groups from the denominator in line with standard methods. Age specific results for the proportion of women eligible for screening who had attended for their first HPV test by the end of 2019 are based on a woman's age on 31 December 2019; all other age specific results are reported based on a woman's age at the time of testing. The National Cancer Screening Register does not yet contain reliable data on vaccination status, so this could not be considered at an individual level, but some results are reported stratified based on whether women had or had not previously been age eligible for HPV vaccination in Australia (age < 40 v ≥ 40 years).

### Personalizing age of cancer screening cessation based on comorbid conditions: model estimates of harms and benefits [^114bu2En]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Harms and benefits of cancer screening depend on age and comorbid conditions, but reliable estimates are lacking.

Objective

To estimate the harms and benefits of cancer screening by age and comorbid conditions to inform decisions about screening cessation.

Design

Collaborative modeling with 7 cancer simulation models and common data on average and comorbid condition level-specific life expectancy.

Setting

U.S. population.

Patients

U.S. cohorts aged 66 to 90 years in 2010 with average health or 1 of 4 comorbid condition levels: none, mild, moderate, or severe.

Intervention

Mammography, prostate-specific antigen testing, or fecal immunochemical testing.

Measurements

Lifetime cancer deaths prevented and life-years gained (benefits); false-positive test results and overdiagnosed cancer cases (harms). For each comorbid condition level, the age at which harms and benefits of screening were similar to that for persons with average health having screening at age 74 years.

Results

Screening 1000 women with average life expectancy at age 74 years for breast cancer resulted in 79 to 96 (range across models) false-positive results, 0.5 to 0.8 overdiagnosed cancer cases, and 0.7 to 0.9 prevented cancer deaths. Although absolute numbers of harms and benefits differed across cancer sites, the ages at which to cease screening were consistent across models and cancer sites. For persons with no, mild, moderate, and severe comorbid conditions, screening until ages 76, 74, 72, and 66 years, respectively, resulted in harms and benefits similar to average-health persons.

Limitation

Comorbid conditions influenced only life expectancy.

Conclusion

Comorbid conditions are an important determinant of harms and benefits of screening. Estimates of screening benefits and harms by comorbid condition can inform discussions between providers and patients about personalizing screening cessation decisions.

### Use of quality rapid diagnostic testing for safe blood transfusion in resource-limited settings [^113nD7K1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Blood safety in sub-Saharan Africa is jeopardized by multiple and diverse factors, including the predominance of high-risk family/replacement donors and the high prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs). Thus, stringent diagnostic strategies are vital. Western blotting is costly and technically demanding, and nucleic acid testing technologies, which have been reported to reliably reduce the rate of TTI, are not available in resource-limited settings. Therefore, there is a need for reliable and affordable testing alternatives in these settings. Rapid diagnostic testing has been widely adopted in developing countries, but, for effectiveness in blood safety, highly sensitive tests and the strict selection of low-risk blood donors are indispensable. Although the pre-serological window period remains a source of residual risk for transmission of TTIs during blood transfusion, the combination antigen-antibody rapid tests could contribute significantly to shortening the window period. Thus, despite its limitations, rapid diagnostic testing continues to contribute significantly to blood safety, as a cost-effective means of enhancing screening for TTIs and reducing their transmission in resource-limited rural settings.

### The spectrum effect in tests for risk prediction, screening, and diagnosis [^113MPixj]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The spectrum effect describes the variation between settings in performance of tests used to predict, screen for, and diagnose disease. In particular, the predictive use of a test may be different when it is applied in a general population rather than in the study sample in which it was first developed. This article discusses the impact of the spectrum effect on measures of test performance, and its implications for the development, evaluation, application, and implementation of such tests.

### When and how to screen! [^116VdkJp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition

The WHO defines screening as the presumptive identification of unrecognized disease in an apparently healthy, asymptomatic population by means of tests, examinations or other procedures that can be applied rapidly and easily to the target population [1]. This definition excludes surveillance and/or opportunistic screening, as those strategies do not adhere to the criteria of 'an apparently healthy and asymptomatic population'. That means that a 'pure' screening programme will approach not patients but members in a defined population, where the absolute majority will submit to a procedure in order to be reassured that they are healthy.

Screening programmes have many stakeholders, and the opinions of the value of such programmes differ. The spectra are wide, from 'screening is good' to 'screening programmes is a curse for any healthcare system'. In the current issue, there are two reviews [2, 3], which both make the case that it screening is good, but they also acknowledge difficulties. There are questions, which must be dealt with, before such a screening programme can be launched.

There are certain criteria, which should be fulfilled before a screening programme is launched. The most commonly used is the WHO criteria from 1968 [4].

The condition sought should be an important health problem.
There should be an accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease.
Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available.
There should be a recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage.
There should be a suitable test or examination.
The test should be accept.
Able to the population.
The natural history of the condition, including development from latent to declared disease, should be adequately understood.
There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat as patients.
The cost of case finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole.
Case finding should be a continuing process and not a 'once and for all' project.

It is obvious that the two conditions, atrial fibrillation and colorectal cancer, fulfil some of those criteria. Both are important health problems, and there is accepted treatment for patients with recognized disease, anticoagulant to prevent stroke and polypectomy. There is also a recognizable latent or early symptomatic stage.

### Expanding screening through the use of liquid biopsy for early cancer detection [^1159mZfa]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

One strategy employed to overcome the limitations of low sensitivity is evaluating organ-specific biofluids, such as urine for bladder and renal malignancies, and saliva for head and neck cancer (Fig. 1). Biofluids in direct contact with tumor or its microenvironment can provide more insights into cancer development, offering a favorable avenue for early diagnosis and monitoring. Several studies have shown potential for early detection using these alternative biofluids.

Recent work from our group illustrates the potential to impact screening and early detection protocols for PrBC through the detection of cfDNA in serum breast milk (sBM), which reflects the environment of the mature gland. At early disease stages, this approach can help identify carcinogenesis by analyzing tumor-derived shedding in sBM. The study found ctDNA variants in sBM mirrored those in the tumor, resulting in higher sensitivity than concurrent plasma testing. Despite the relatively small cohort size, ctDNA was detectable in sBM samples collected up to 18 months before a diagnosis in two participants. These results highlight the potential superiority of sBM as a source for LB, suggesting its possible role in the context of PrBC screening. The prospective clinical study, MMATERNA, aims to clinically validate our LB panel in sBM for early PrBC detection, based on the innovative concept that sBM from lactating women can serve as a reliable source of ctDNA from early-onset BC. The results of this trial could improve early diagnosis of PrBC, confirming the clinical utility of sBM as a reliable source for screening in a high-risk population and addressing an unmet need.

Conclusively, ensuring exceptionally high sensitivity and specificity is crucial when implementing a screening program in the general population. The clinical development of a ctDNA-based approach for early detection requires large-scale clinical evidence to demonstrate an assays performance and to prove its clinical utility. While an earlier diagnosis might introduce "lead-time bias", which might not necessarily affect cancer-specific mortality, following patients for an adequate period and conducting serial ctDNA testing to assess signal kinetics dynamically is essential to refining patient stratification.

### ACMT comment on recent guidance on PFAS laboratory testing [^113UZm8W]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). High credibility.

ACMT PFAS laboratory testing — ACMT does not recommend broad, population based PFAS testing of patients in communities except as part of public health investigations or research. ACMT acknowledges the potential benefits of serum/plasma PFAS testing for some individuals but also acknowledges limitations including the inability to discern specific source(s) of exposure or predict any specific health outcome, variations between laboratories in testing techniques/modalities, the cost of testing due to lack of insurance coverage, and the absence of good screening modalities for most potential PFAS-related health effects; it further notes potential harms associated with screening and that there is currently no validated therapy for enhancing elimination of PFAS.

### The spectrum effect in tests for risk prediction, screening, and diagnosis [^112LCiFe]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion and implications

When reviewing a study of a new risk prediction, screening, or diagnostic test and deciding whether to use that test in practice, clinicians and policymakers should examine the relevance of the study sample to their own population. Ideally new tests should be developed and evaluated using data from the population(s) in which they are intended to be used. If not possible, it is important to remember that, as a result of the spectrum effect, calculations of positive and negative predictive value will only partly adjust for differences in disease prevalence (box 2). The performance of the test in their own population might, therefore, be different from that reported in the study, and the potential health gains associated with introduction of the test should be interpreted with caution.

### Cervical cancer screening programmes and policies in 18 European countries [^1177YSS1]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Emphasis was placed on collecting both current and historical information on the following:
Screening policy: Year of programme initiation; target age range of screening; screening interval for women with normal results; financial cost of the smear to the women;
Organisational issues: Whether all women in the target population are invited, or only those without a recent smear; the manner in which women are invited (personally or otherwise); the data source from which invitations are drawn; whether invitations and visits are centrally registered on an individual basis; if there had been, historically, important changes in the screening organisation;
Process and performance measures: Invitational and geographical coverage of the programme or policy; screening attendance; proportion of women tested at least once within the recommended interval; availability of data on detection rates of histologically confirmed cancerous or precancerous findings, by severity of lesions.

We also enquired as to how estimates on screening parameters were collected and calculated in order to assess the reliability of the reported information, and we also searched for all published information on the programmes.

Different organisational definitions affect the applicability of the concept, while invitational coverage can apply only among invitational programmes. Another measure of coverage, the proportion of the target population subject to formal programme or policy, was included in the tables. In addition, proportion of women tested at least once within the recommended interval was used. The latter attendance rate is a combined measure of invitational coverage and related attendance, plus noninvitational smear-taking activity.

In addition to smears taken within programmes, spontaneous smears taken outside the programme were reported by several centres. Lack of information prevented their inclusion in detail in all performance measures. For those programmes, which registered smears, proportions of women tested at least once during the recommended interval could be calculated from the register-based source. For those programmes that registered only the invitational programme, corresponding estimates were based usually on questionnaire surveys where the reliability of the information may be limited due to reporting and selection biases. Owing to the lack of information, calculations could not be carried out for some other relevant time windows, such as smears during the last 10 year period.

### Effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in reducing the risk of death from right and left colon cancer: a large community-based study [^113gLd56]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

A particular strength of our study was its setting within large community-based integrated healthcare systems with stable membership and extensive coded and free-text clinical data. Thus, we were able to define a historic cohort of members and, from it, sample average-risk patients to provide estimates that are generalisable to the source population. Also, we could reliably assign indications for colonoscopies and specifically define the subsets that were for screening using clinical information from several sources, a pretested algorithm and adjudication by clinicians. Although this approach resulted in a lower exposure rate than has been reported in this population, a greater threat to validity would arise from classifying diagnostic tests as screening than the converse. Also, clinical databases were linked with detailed information in cancer and death registries.

As in all clinical settings, screening colonoscopy took place in the context of other colorectal cancer screening tests that might confound or modify its effects. During the period of our study, the health systems in this study relied primarily on guaiac-FOBT and sigmoidoscopy before implementing system-wide screening outreach programmes with faecal immunochemical tests. We were able to assess for confounding effects of other screening tests including when both sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were used. We found no strong evidence that screening FOBT confounded our estimates. Using the same models as were used for estimating colonoscopy's effectiveness, we also found that receipt of screening sigmoidoscopy was associated with a reduced risk of any colorectal cancer death by 36%. This estimate was similar to results from randomised trials (risk ratios: 0.57and 0.62) and thus supports the validity of our research design and analyses.

### HIV support source: development of a distress screening measure for adults with HIV [^111mHa2k]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

To provide an effective, multidimensional, and psychometrically valid measure to screen for distress among people with HIV, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of HIV Support Source, a distress screening, referral, and support program designed to identify the unmet needs of adults with HIV and link them to desired resources and support. Development and testing were completed in three phases: (1) item generation and initial item pool testing (N = 375), (2) scale refinement via exploratory factor analysis (N = 220); external/internal item quality, and judging theoretical and practical implications of items, and (3) confirmatory validation (N = 150) including confirmatory factor analysis along with reliability and validity analyses to corroborate dimensionality and psychometric properties of the final measure. Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses determined scoring thresholds for depression and anxiety risk subscales. The final measure comprises 17-items representing four domains of concern: emotional well-being, financial and practical needs, physical well-being, and HIV treatment and sexual health, plus one screening item assessing tobacco and substance use. Our analyses showed strong internal consistency reliability, a replicable factor structure, and adequate convergent, discriminant, and known groups validity. Sensitivity of 2-item depression and 2-item anxiety risk subscales was 0.90 and 0.79, respectively. HIV Support Source is a reliable and valid multidimensional measure of distress that also screens for risk for clinically significant depression and anxiety. It can be implemented within a distress screening, referral, and follow-up program to rapidly assess and support the unmet needs of adults with HIV.

### Recommendations for practices using gestational carriers: a committee opinion [^111BgzhD]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

IPs and genetic contributors — US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required screening and testing include that all genetic contributors, including genetic parents and gamete donors, must be screened in the same manner; there is no method to completely ensure that infectious agents will not be transmitted, but screening for risk factors associated with infectious diseases, assessing for physical signs of infectious diseases, and testing for infectious diseases should significantly reduce these risks; the US FDA eligibility medical questionnaire states that complete personal and sexual history should be obtained and that prospective egg or sperm sources should be marked as "ineligible" when specific findings are identified on history, and the US FDA eligibility physical examination adds that a physical examination should be performed and that prospective egg or sperm sources should be marked as "ineligible" when specific findings are identified on the physical examination; laboratory requirements for FDA donor eligibility are outlined in Table 2, with laboratory testing noted as "FDA Laboratory Testing within 7 days of semen production and 30 days before or 7 days after oocyte acquisition"; individuals with identified risk factors on screening questionnaires, physical examination, or laboratory testing are considered ineligible for anonymous tissue donation, yet embryos created by such individuals can still be transferred into a GC provided the tissue is labeled to indicate any associated increased risks and both the IPs and GC are aware of the theoretical increased risk and have verbally consented, and although the FDA does not require that the GC be informed of the results of the screening, the ASRM strongly recommends that embryos created using gametes from individuals considered ineligible should only be transferred to a GC who is adequately informed and counseled; a positive test should be verified before notifying the potential genetic parent, confirmed positives should be referred for appropriate counseling and management, and individuals with false-positive syphilis nontreponemal assay results that are confirmed negative using a treponemal-based assay are considered eligible.

### Does subtle screening for substance abuse work? A review of the substance abuse subtle screening inventory (SASSI) [^1172kc8P]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

Through a complex combination of direct (face-valid) and indirect (subtle) subscales, the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI) is purported to detect substance use disorders with a high degree of validity regardless of respondent honesty or motivation. This review evaluates empirical evidence regarding the reliability and validity of this widely used screening instrument.

Methods

Source documents were 36 peer-reviewed reports yielding data regarding the SASSI's internal consistency, test-retest reliability, psychometric structure, convergent and divergent validity and criterion (predictive) validity.

Results

The total N of the studies reviewed equaled 22 110. Internal consistency is high for the overall SASSI and for its direct but not its indirect (subtle) subscales, suggesting that the instrument taps a single face-valid construct. SASSI classifications converged with those from other direct screening instruments, and were also correlated with ethnicity, general distress and social deviance. Studies found test-retest reliability lower than that reported in the test manuals. Sensitivity was found to be similar to that for public domain screening instruments, but on specificity the SASSI appears to yield a high rate of false positives.

Conclusion

No empirical evidence was found for the SASSI's claimed unique advantage in detecting substance use disorders through its indirect (subtle) scales to circumvent respondent denial or dishonesty. Recommendations for screening and for future research with the SASSI are offered.
