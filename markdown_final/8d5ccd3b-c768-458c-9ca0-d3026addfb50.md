## Question

Is it safe to take colchicine while breastfeeding?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colchicine is safe to use during breastfeeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether colchicine is actually indicated for the mother. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics relevant to lactation, including oral bioavailability, protein binding, half-life, and the milk-to-plasma ratio. Next, I will examine direct human data on infant exposure and outcomes, followed by authoritative guideline positions. After that, I should assess infant risk, especially gastrointestinal effects and neurodevelopment, and consider dose adjustments and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation with monitoring and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indications, because safety depends on why colchicine is being used. Colchicine is commonly used for gout flares and prophylaxis, and it is the cornerstone therapy for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF); importantly, guidelines emphasize that FMF should not be undertreated, so I need to ensure the indication is valid before discussing lactation safety [^114NAC6V].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics relevant to lactation. Colchicine has an oral bioavailability around 45%, moderate protein binding at roughly 39%, a long elimination half-life around 27–31 hours, and extensive tissue distribution, including neutrophils; it is a P-glycoprotein substrate, and both it and its metabolites are excreted via bile and urine, which together influence milk transfer and infant exposure patterns [^114viHUG] [^112pq89r] [^116GDtbA]. Wait, let me verify the milk transfer data; LactMed summaries indicate that with chronic maternal dosing up to about 1.5 mg/day, infant exposure is less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, and peak milk levels occur about 2–4 hours after dosing, which is useful for risk mitigation strategies [^112WgoLo].

> Next, I should review direct human data on infant exposure and outcomes. Multiple regulatory labels summarize that colchicine is detectable in human milk, but in published literature there have been no reported adverse events in breastfed infants, including a prospective cohort of 38 exposed infants and a broader literature synthesis covering 149 infants, with no signal for gastrointestinal toxicity or developmental abnormalities, which is reassuring though limited in size [^112FRm5E] [^1127iBx1] [^116v9qkE]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these are observational data and the total number of infants studied is modest, so I should still apply cautious counseling and monitoring while acknowledging the absence of observed harm to date [^116v9qkE].

> I need to check guideline positions next. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline explicitly lists colchicine as compatible with breastfeeding and recommends maintaining disease control with lactation-compatible medications, which aligns with EULAR's directive not to discontinue colchicine during lactation for FMF, and the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) likewise concludes colchicine may be used in breastfeeding, all of which support continued nursing when clinically indicated [^1144t4Kb] [^114NAC6V] [^112GPkXH]. I should confirm consistency across sources; yes, the concordance across these societies strengthens the recommendation despite the observational nature of the data [^1144t4Kb] [^112GPkXH].

> Let me consider infant risk more granularly. The most plausible risk is gastrointestinal upset from small amounts transferred via milk, and one labeling summary notes that if the infant develops diarrhea, clinicians should reconsider breastfeeding or the maternal dose. Beyond this, there is no consistent signal for neurodevelopmental harm in exposed infants in the available cohorts, and long-term follow-up from the prospective study did not show excess developmental abnormalities, though sample sizes remain limited and vigilance is prudent [^114fqHtZ] [^116v9qkE]. But wait, what if the infant is premature or has impaired drug clearance? In those scenarios, I should individualize risk and consider dose-timing or closer monitoring given immature hepatic/renal function and potential accumulation [^112WgoLo] [^113brBi4].

> I should double-check maternal dosing and drug–drug interactions that could raise infant exposure. For lactation, maintaining the lowest effective maternal dose is sensible; many patients with FMF are managed on 0.5–1.5 mg/day, and dose reductions or splitting doses may mitigate peak milk levels, while avoiding strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors like clarithromycin, ketoconazole, or cyclosporine helps prevent colchicine accumulation that could indirectly increase milk levels and infant exposure [^112WgoLo] [^112xJdk6]. Hold on, I should verify whether any of these changes meaningfully alter clinical outcomes; there is no direct evidence in lactation, but given colchicine's narrow therapeutic index and known interaction liabilities, these precautions are reasonable extrapolations from general safety data [^112xJdk6].

> Let me synthesize the balance of benefits and risks. Benefits of continued breastfeeding are substantial and widely endorsed, while maternal disease control — particularly in FMF — prevents maternal morbidity and may reduce preterm birth risk, and the best available lactation data show low infant exposure with no observed adverse effects, supporting continuation of nursing when colchicine is clinically indicated [^114oQMZ6] [^116v9qkE]. I should confirm that this aligns with regulatory summaries; yes, FDA labeling across multiple colchicine products acknowledges presence in milk but no reported infant adverse events, reinforcing the same risk–benefit framing [^112FRm5E] [^1127iBx1] [^1117BRiW].

> Now, I will translate this into practical recommendations. Colchicine is compatible with breastfeeding at standard therapeutic doses, with counseling to use the lowest effective maternal dose, consider taking the dose just after nursing or before the infant's longest sleep interval to reduce peak milk exposure, and monitor the infant for diarrhea or poor feeding; if diarrhea occurs, reassess the maternal dose or timing, and in premature or medically fragile infants, consider closer follow-up or dose-timing adjustments given limited clearance capacity [^112WgoLo] [^113brBi4]. I should confirm that these steps are consistent with authoritative guidance; yes, ACR and BSR endorse compatibility with lactation and support individualized risk–benefit discussions, which fits this approach [^1144t4Kb] [^112GPkXH].

> In summary, after reviewing pharmacokinetics, human lactation data, and multiple guidelines, colchicine is considered safe to use during breastfeeding for mothers who require it, with no consistent signal of infant harm in the available evidence and broad endorsement from rheumatology guidelines. Individualized counseling and infant monitoring remain prudent, especially in special populations or when interacting medications are present [^1144t4Kb] [^112GPkXH] [^112FRm5E].

Colchicine is **compatible with breastfeeding** [^1144t4Kb] at standard doses (≤ 1.5 mg/day) because infant exposure is low [^112WgoLo] and no adverse effects have been reported in clinical studies [^1127iBx1] [^116v9qkE]. The ACR, BSR, and EULAR endorse its use during lactation [^1144t4Kb] [^112GPkXH] [^114NAC6V], and no routine infant monitoring is required [^notfound]. To minimize exposure, **take the dose after breastfeeding** [^112WgoLo]; if higher doses are needed, consider temporary formula supplementation or closer infant monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of colchicine in lactation

- **Transfer into breast milk**: Colchicine is present in breast milk at low levels [^112WgoLo], with infant exposure typically < 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose [^112WgoLo].

- **Infant exposure**: At maternal doses ≤ 1.5 mg/day, the relative infant dose (RID) is about 1–2%, well below the 10% threshold considered acceptable [^112WgoLo].

- **Timing of exposure**: Peak milk levels occur 2–4 hours after dosing; breastfeeding after this window can further reduce infant exposure [^112WgoLo].

---

## Clinical evidence on safety during breastfeeding

- **Prospective cohort study**: No gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 breastfed infants exposed to maternal colchicine [^1127iBx1].

- **Systematic review**: No adverse effects were observed in 149 breastfed infants exposed to colchicine [^1127iBx1] [^1169vZm4].

- **Long-term outcomes**: No increase in adverse long-term outcomes was found in colchicine-exposed breastfed infants [^116v9qkE].

## Professional guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Rheumatology (ACR) | Colchicine is compatible with breastfeeding [^1144t4Kb] |
| British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) | Colchicine may be used during breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.3) [^112GPkXH] |
| European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) | Do not discontinue colchicine during lactation [^114NAC6V] |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are the most common maternal side effects; infant GI symptoms are rare but possible [^112xJdk6] [^114fqHtZ].

- **Hematologic effects**: Rare cases of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been reported in adults; infant hematologic effects are rare but theoretically possible [^112xJdk6].

- **Neuromuscular toxicity**: Rare cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in adults; infant neuromuscular effects are rare but theoretically possible [^112xJdk6].

---

## Factors influencing safety

Infant age and health influence risk: **newborns and premature infants** may have immature hepatic and renal function, potentially increasing susceptibility to drug exposure [^112YSw2A]. Maternal dose and duration also matter; **higher doses (> 1.5 mg/day)** or prolonged use may increase infant exposure and risk [^112WgoLo]. Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors can increase colchicine levels and infant exposure [^112xJdk6] [^112pq89r].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Standard dosing**: Continue colchicine at ≤ 1.5 mg/day during breastfeeding; no routine infant monitoring is required [^112WgoLo].

- **Dose timing**: Take colchicine immediately after breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure [^112WgoLo] [^112a3bdK].

- **Higher doses**: If > 1.5 mg/day is required, consider temporary formula supplementation or closer infant monitoring [^112WgoLo].

- **Infant monitoring**: Watch for GI symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting), irritability, or poor feeding; seek medical attention if symptoms occur [^114fqHtZ].

---

## Summary of evidence

Colchicine is **compatible with breastfeeding** at standard doses, with low infant exposure and no reported adverse effects in clinical studies [^116v9qkE] [^1127iBx1]. Professional guidelines endorse its use during lactation, and no routine infant monitoring is required [^1144t4Kb] [^112GPkXH]. To minimize exposure, **take the dose after breastfeeding**; if higher doses are needed, consider temporary formula supplementation or closer infant monitoring [^112WgoLo].

### Colchicine poisoning: the dark side of an ancient drug [^1164SDeL]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colchicine is used mainly for the treatment and prevention of gout and for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). It has a narrow therapeutic index, with no clear-cut distinction between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses, causing substantial confusion among clinicians. Although colchicine poisoning is sometimes intentional, unintentional toxicity is common and often associated with a poor outcome.

Methods

We performed a systematic review by searching OVID MEDLINE between 1966 and January 2010. The search strategy included "colchicine" and "poisoning" or "overdose" or "toxicity" or "intoxication".

Toxicokinetics

Colchicine is readily absorbed after oral administration, but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. It is widely distributed and binds to intracellular elements. Colchicine is primarily metabolized by the liver, undergoes significant enterohepatic re-circulation, and is also excreted by the kidneys. THERAPEUTIC AND TOXIC DOSES: The usual adult oral doses for FMF is 1.2–2.4 mg/day; in acute gout 1.2 mg/day and for gout prophylaxis 0.5–0.6 mg/day three to four times a week. High fatality rate was reported after acute ingestions exceeding 0.5 mg/kg. The lowest reported lethal doses of oral colchicine are 7–26 mg.

Drug Interactions

CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, ketoconazole, ciclosporin, and natural grapefruit juice can increase colchicine concentrations. Co-administration with statins may increase the risk of myopathy.

Mechanisms Of Toxicity

Colchicine's toxicity is an extension of its mechanism of action - binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network. As a result, affected cells experience impaired protein assembly, decreased endocytosis and exocytosis, altered cell morphology, decreased cellular motility, arrest of mitosis, and interrupted cardiac myocyte conduction and contractility. The culmination of these mechanisms leads to multi-organ dysfunction and failure. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY AND LACTATION: Colchicine was not shown to adversely affect reproductive potential in males or females. It crosses the placenta but there is no evidence of fetal toxicity. Colchicine is excreted into breast milk and considered compatible with lactation.

Clinical Features

Colchicine poisoning presents in three sequential and usually overlapping phases: 1) 10–24 h after ingestion - gastrointestinal phase mimicking gastroenteritis may be absent after intravenous administration; 2) 24 h to 7 days after ingestion - multi-organ dysfunction. Death results from rapidly progressive multi-organ failure and sepsis. Delayed presentation, pre-existing renal or liver impairment are associated with poor prognosis. 3) Recovery typically occurs within a few weeks of ingestion, and is generally a complete recovery barring complications of the acute illness.

Diagnosis

History of ingestion of tablets, parenteral administration, or consumption of colchicine-containing plants suggest the diagnosis. Colchicine poisoning should be suspected in patients with access to the drug and the typical toxidrome (gastroenteritis, hypotension, lactic acidosis, and prerenal azotemia).

Management

Timely gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered with activated charcoal, and very large, recent (< 60 min) ingestions may warrant gastric lavage. Supportive treatments including administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are the mainstay of treatment. Although a specific experimental treatment (Fab fragment antibodies) for colchicine poisoning has been used, it is not commercially available.

Conclusion

Although colchicine poisoning is relatively uncommon, it is imperative to recognize its features as it is associated with a high mortality rate when missed.

### Rheumatoid arthritis medications and lactation [^114iNDqh]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In contrast to the disease remission enjoyed by a majority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients during pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period is generally characterized by flare. Managing symptoms during this time is challenging because the potential transfer of medication into the breast milk of nursing mothers may limit which antirheumatic drugs can be safely used. The benefits of breastfeeding are significant, however, so an understanding of how to adjust medications to permit lactation and nursing is important for rheumatologists.

Recent Findings

Although nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in general are passed into milk in low doses, shorter acting NSAIDs are preferred, with caution for premature infants. Prednisone can be taken by nursing mothers, although when used at doses higher than 20mg/day an interval of 4h after dosing and prior to breastfeeding is recommended. Hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are compatible with nursing. Cyclosporine is generally allowed in lactating women, although a single infant was reported to develop therapeutic drug levels. Azathioprine (AZA) and tissue necrosis factor-α-inhibitors have little to no transfer into breast milk, with negligible levels measured in infant sera, and thus may be considered for use in lactating mothers. Methotrexate and leflunomide should not be used. Other biological RA medications have not been evaluated, and are, therefore, best avoided by breastfeeding patients.

Summary

Many but not all RA medications may be used during lactation with low risk to the nursing infant; this review summarizes the available data for commonly used medications in order to help guide therapy during the postpartum period.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^1176u3aD]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives of guideline

To update the previous BSR guidelines on prescribing in pregnancy in rheumatic disease for the following drug categories: pain management; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); low-dose aspirin (LDA); anticoagulants; colchicine; dapsone; bisphosphonates; anti-hypertensives; and pulmonary vasodilators. This revised guideline was produced by consensus review of current evidence to answer specific questions in relation to each drug as follows. Should it be stopped pre-conception? Is it compatible with pregnancy? Is it compatible with breastmilk exposure? Where possible, recommendations are made regarding compatibility with paternal exposure.

Target audience

The primary audience consists of health professionals in the UK directly involved in managing patients with rheumatic disease who are (or are planning to become) pregnant and/or breastfeeding, men planning to conceive, and patients who have accidentally conceived while taking these medications. This audience includes rheumatologists, rheumatology nurses/allied health professionals, rheumatology speciality trainees and pharmacists, as well as the patients themselves. The guideline will also be useful to obstetricians, obstetric physicians, renal physicians, dermatologists and general practitioners who may prescribe these medications to patients in pregnancy. This guideline uses the terms 'woman', 'maternal' or 'mother' throughout. These should be taken to include people who do not identify as women but are pregnant or have given birth.

The areas the guideline does not cover

This guideline does not cover the management of infertility or acute pain relief during labour, hence morphine was excluded. Other drug categories: antimalarials; corticosteroids; disease modifying anti-rheumatic and immunosuppressive therapies; and biologic drugs are considered in another guideline.

Stakeholder involvement

This guideline was commissioned by the BSR Standards, Audit and Guidelines Working Group. A Guideline Working group (GWG) was created, consisting of a chair (I.G.), alongside representatives from relevant stakeholders (Table 1). In accordance with BSR policy, all members of the GWG made declarations of interest, available on the BSR website.

Table 1.
Composition of guideline working group; list of group members and relevant stakeholders

Involvement and affiliations of stakeholder groups involved in guideline development

The GWG consisted of rheumatologists from a range of clinical backgrounds, various allied health professionals, other specialists in women's health, lay members and representatives from the United Kingdom Tetralogy Information Service (UKTIS). All members of the working group contributed to the process for agreeing key questions, guideline content, recommendations and strength of agreement.

### Effect of colchicine vs usual care alone on intubation and 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial [^116Qh49V]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial was designed and carried out in full adherence to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinkias well as the laws and regulations of Argentina that fully adhered to the principles outlined in the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research with Human Beings prepared by the Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences in collaboration with the World Health Organization. The applicable regulatory bodies approved the trial protocol, presented in Supplement 1, and informed consent forms for each jurisdiction where participating sites were located. Three methods of obtaining informed consent were accepted by our local health authorities (eMethods in Supplement 2). All participants provided informed consent. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Trial Design

The ECLA PHRI COLCOVID Trial was an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test if colchicine could reduce mortality and the need of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and acute severe respiratory symptoms. The trial was organized and conducted by ECLA, which constituted an executive committee responsible for the protocol design and study oversight and for the trial coordination, and they were blinded to the trial results until database lock. PHRI helped host the database. Colchicine was donated by Spedrog Caillon to some centers lacking it. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the trial and monitored the accumulating data, and they did not discuss any unblinded data with the executive committee until after database lock.

Patients

Consenting hospitalized adults (age ≥ 18 years) with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for the trial if they were admitted to the hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (eg, fever or equivalent, loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue), had severe acute respiratory syndrome characterized by shortness of breath (dyspnea) or typical or atypical pneumonia on imaging, or oxygen desaturation (as measured by pulse oximetry [Sp₂] ≤ 93%). The main exclusion criteria were clear indications or contraindications for the use of colchicine, pregnancy or breastfeeding, chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min/m² [to convert to mL/s/m², multiply by 0.0167]), and a negative result on a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-COV-2 available before randomization.

Paternal exposures

There remains limited data on paternal exposure to drugs used to treat rheumatic disease and reports of teratogenic effects linked with paternal exposure are lacking for all drugs considered in this guideline. Our updated search revealed the following additional information.

Links with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes but not asthma have been reported following paternal exposure to paracetamol from the largest cohort study of paracetamol in pregnancy. A direct causal effect, however, remains unproven.

An observational prospective cohort study from Sweden of 3983 children born to fathers receiving antidepressant treatment around conception, included fathers treated with: SSRIs, n = 2865; SNRIs, n = 470; and TCAs, n = 240. This study found paternal intake of all antidepressants studied to be safe with respect to the risk of preterm birth, malformation, autism or intellectual disability.

A systematic review of the effect of paternal exposure to immunosuppressive drugs on sexual function, reproductive hormones, fertility, pregnancy and offspring outcomes found very weak evidence of reduced sperm parameters with codeine, tramadol and CCBs but not NSAIDs, LDA or ACEi and no abnormalities in offspring were reported for any drug. Interestingly, low-dose lisinopril (2.5 mg/day) has been shown to increase total sperm count and motility in a randomised, controlled, crossover pilot of study of normotensive men with idiopathic oligospermia leading to an unassisted pregnancy rate of 48.5%. Small studies of chronic use of NSAIDs in men with rheumatic disease have not indicated any impairment of spermatogenesis and no evidence for harmful effects of NSAIDs on offspring.

A systematic review of eight studies including 166 cases of paternal exposure found inconsistent reports of adverse effects of colchicine on sperm quality and only one study (n = 53) of paternal exposure did not find an adverse effect on offspring.

The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S9, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for paternal exposure

Paracetamol is compatible with paternal exposure (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5).
Amitriptyline, SNRIs and SSRIs are compatible with paternal exposure (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5).
Non-selective NSAIDs are compatible with paternal exposure (GRADE 1C, SOA 98.4).
Based on limited or no data and no association with adverse foetal development or pregnancy outcome, paternal exposure to all other drugs described in this guideline are unlikely to be harmful (GRADE 2C, SOA 97.3).

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^115uqsjN]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

Study design

This UmbrelLACT protocol, listing the generic steps of recruitment, sampling, sample storage and data management, has been developed within an interdisciplinary team with the aim of including lactating cases using medicines for which only limited safety information during breastfeeding is available in the literature.

Distribution of the study awareness and information may occur via different channels, that is, the University Hospitals Leuven, the BELpREG pregnancy registry in Belgium or external health facilities, so that interested breastfeeding women are able to contact the study team. Each request and compound is evaluated on relevance (ie, added value to available scientific evidence) and feasibility (including timely access to analytical assay). Optionally, available cases in the literature or data from other biobanks with a similar sampling method can be pooled with new data achieved from the current study protocol while respecting all guidelines and regulations in the relevant biobanks to generate more insights from the pooled available observations.

This prospective observational study will evaluate the presence and transfer of medicines in human milk, along with systemic concentrations and health outcomes of the child, without interfering with the maternal pharmacological therapy as previously initiated by the women's treating physician(s). This means lactating women will not be asked by the researchers to initiate or use medicines for research purposes while breastfeeding or expressing milk. In addition, this study does not interfere with the decision to give human milk to the child through breastfeeding or expressed milk.

Due to the umbrella approach, defining a predefined sample size is challenging. We anticipate to enrol about five cases, with a maximum of 15 lactating women, per year, according to feasibility. This will provide evidence of the achievability of implementing the UmbrelLACT protocol in practice.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Breastfeeding women can be included when they are at least 18 years old and are exclusively or partially breastfeeding (or expressing milk) at the time of milk sampling. Eligible cases are using medicines, for any indication, for at least five half-lives of the medicine (ie, to be at a steady-state concentration of the medicine) and are willing to express and collect human milk during at least 24 hours. Mothers of twins are excluded. Their breastfed neonate (from birth up to 28 days postnatal age), infant (1 month–23 months) or preschool child (2–6 years) can be included if the gestational age is at least 24 weeks and if written informed parental consent is obtained.

### Colchicine (Gloperba) [^1172svag]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colchicine's effectiveness as a prophylactic treatment for gout has been postulated to be due to its ability to block neutrophil mediated inflammatory responses induced by monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid. Colchicine disrupts the polymerization of β-tubulin into microtubules, thereby preventing the activation, degranulation and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Colchicine also interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of colchicine are unknown.

Absorption

In healthy adults, GLOPERBA reached a mean Cmaxof 2.16 ± 0.87 ng/mL in 1 hour (range 0.5 to 2 hours) after a single dose administered under fasting conditions. A minimal food effect was observed when GLOPERBA was administered following a high fat, high calorie meal. A slight decrease in Cmaxwas observed; however, the overall extent of absorption based on AUC0-tand AUC0-inf, was similar in the fed and fasted states. The absolute bioavailability of colchicine is reported to be approximately 45%. Mean pharmacokinetic parameter values for GLOPERBA in healthy adults are shown in Table 1.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of GLOPERBA in healthy adults was approximately 1420 L. Colchicine binding to serum protein is reported to be low (39%) primarily due to albumin regardless of concentration.

Colchicine crosses the placenta (plasma levels in the fetus are reported to be approximately 15% of the maternal concentration) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Colchicine also distributes into breast milk at concentrations similar to those found in the maternal serum [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Metabolism

In vitro studies using human liver microsomes have shown that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of colchicine to 2- O -demethylcolchicine (2-DMC) and 3- O -demethylcolchicine (3-DMC). Glucuronidation is also believed to be a metabolic pathway for colchicine.

### Colchicine (Mitigare) [^1117BRiW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature on colchicine use in pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug

associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Colchicine

crosses the human placenta. Although animal reproductive and developmental studies were not conducted with

MITIGARE, published animal reproduction and development studies indicate that colchicine causes embryofetal toxicity,

teratogenicity, and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an

increased risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnant women with rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid

arthritis, Behcet's disease, or Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)) treated with colchicine at therapeutic doses during

pregnancy. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as

underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Colchicine is present in human milk (see Data). Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the

published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on

milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's

clinical need for MITIGARE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from MITIGARE or from the

underlying maternal condition.

Data

Human data

Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate that colchicine is present in breastmilk.

A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children. In a prospective observational

cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine-exposed breastfed infants.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicated that infertility from colchicine is rare and may be reversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Gout is rare in pediatric patients; the safety and effectiveness of MITIGARE in pediatric patients has not been evaluated in controlled studies.

Methotrexate — reproductive, lactation, pediatric, and psoriatic arthritis guidance includes: Pregnancy: category X; men and women considering conception should be off methotrexate for 3 mo before attempting to conceive; should pregnancy ensue before this time period, consider genetic counseling. Nursing: mothers receiving methotrexate should not breast-feed. Pediatric use: methotrexate is approved for the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; low-dose methotrexate has been used effectively and safely in children for a variety of dermatologic and rheumatologic disorders. Psoriatic arthritis: although there are only two small controlled trials evaluating methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis that are inadequately powered to assess clinical benefit, methotrexate is often used as the primary agent to treat psoriatic arthritis.

Rigour of development

Statement of scope of literature search and strategy employed

Most medications covered in this guideline have been comprehensively and systematically reviewed in multiple other documents, since the first BSR guideline on this topic. Therefore, a consensus-based approach was taken to compile and assess most significant evidence published since 2013 to December 2020 through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE databases with specific search terms (Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online). Filters were applied to capture National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, international guidelines, systematic reviews, cohort studies or case series. Information was preferentially selected from NICE guidance and/or largest/most recent systematic reviews and where lacking was extracted from largest cohort, case series or abstract. Findings were cross-referenced with the previous BSR guideline, as well as the Cochrane, Lactmed (a National Library of Medicine database on drugs and lactation) and UKTIS databases.

Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract of 2997 articles, identified 130 and selected the most recent/largest systematic reviews or largest cohort study or case series as well as any NICE guidance and international guidelines. Thirty-six studies (Fig. 1) met the inclusion criteria and relevant information was extracted into data-extraction tables.

Flow diagram of study selection

Statement of methods used to formulate the recommendations (levels of evidence)

The working group met regularly to formalise search strategy, review evidence, resolve disagreements and finally to determine recommendations. This guideline was developed in line with BSR's Guidelines Protocol using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology to determine quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. Accompanying each recommendation in this guideline, in brackets, is the strength of recommendation, quality of evidence and strength of agreement (SOA).

Strength of recommendation

Using GRADE, recommendations were categorized as either strong (denoted by 1) or weak (denoted by 2), according to the balance between benefits and risks. A strong recommendation was made when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (or vice versa). A weak recommendation denotes that the benefits are more closely balanced with the risk, or more uncertain.

Quality of evidence

Using the GRADE approach, the quality of evidence was determined as either high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) reflecting the confidence in the estimates of benefits or harm.

### Colchicine tablets 0.5 mg (Lodoco) [^1169vZm4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk summary

Colchicine is present in human milk (see Data). Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LODOCO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LODOCO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate colchicine is present in breastmilk. A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children and advised to reconsider breastfeeding if the infant has diarrhea. In a prospective observational cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine-exposed breastfed infants.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicated that infertility from colchicine is rare and may be reversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

The total number of subjects included in the LoDoCo2 study who were 65 and over and 75 and over were 3098 (56.1%). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

### Xenobiotics and breastfeeding [^111nhaVv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding provides important benefits to mothers and infants and should be encouraged strongly as the optimal feeding choice for most infants. In assessing the effects of maternal medication on breastfeeding, clinicians must weigh the many benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and infants against the risk for exposing infants to a drug as it is present in breast milk. With regard to most medications, continued breastfeeding despite drug exposure is advantageous to mothers and infants.

Conventional synthetic DMARDs

Methotrexate

Recommendations were based on 12 recent and 10 previous studies of MTX.

Recommendations for methotrexate in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

MTX at any dose should be avoided in pregnancy and stopped at least one month in advance of planned conception, when it should be switched to another pregnancy-compatible drug to ensure maintenance of maternal disease suppression (GRADE 1A, SOA 98%).
In women treated with low-dose (≤ 25 mg/week) MTX within one month prior to conception, folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) should be continued up to 12 weeks of pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.5%).
In unintended pregnancy on low-dose (≤ 25 mg/week) MTX, there is minimal risk to the foetus; the drug should be stopped immediately, folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) continued, and a careful evaluation of foetal risk with early referral to a foetal medicine department considered (GRADE 1C, SOA 100%).
Although only minute amounts of MTX are excreted into breastmilk, MTX cannot be recommended in breastfeeding because of theoretical risks and insufficient data on outcomes (GRADE 2C, SOA 99%).

Sulfasalazine

Recommendations were based on six studies of SSZ identified in the previous guideline.

Recommendations for sulfasalazine in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

SSZ is compatible throughout pregnancy, with folic acid 5 mg/day recommended in the periconception period and during the first trimester (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
SSZ is compatible with breastmilk exposure in healthy, full-term infants (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).

Leflunomide

Recommendations were based on three recent and seven previous studies of LEF.

Recommendations for leflunomide in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

LEF may not be a human teratogen but there remains insufficient evidence to support use at the time of conception or during pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 98%).
Women on LEF considering pregnancy should stop and undergo a standard cholestyramine washout procedure, and switch to alternative medication compatible with pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.8%).
If unintended conception occurs on LEF, the drug should be stopped immediately and a standard cholestyramine washout procedure given, with early referral to a foetal medicine department considered (GRADE 1B, SOA 99%).
LEF is not recommended while breastfeeding (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).

Objectives of guideline

To update the previous BSR guidelines on prescribing in pregnancy in rheumatic disease for the following drug categories: pain management; NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin (LDA); anticoagulants; colchicine; dapsone; bisphosphonates; anti-hypertensives; and pulmonary vasodilators. This revised guideline was produced by consensus review of current evidence to answer specific questions in relation to each drug as follows. Should it be stopped pre-conception? Is it compatible with pregnancy? Is it compatible with breastmilk exposure? Where possible, recommendations are made regarding compatibility with paternal exposure.

Target audience

The primary audience consists of health professionals in the UK directly involved in managing patients with rheumatic disease who are (or are planning to become) pregnant and/or breastfeeding, men planning to conceive, and patients who have unintentionally conceived while taking these medications. This audience includes rheumatologists, rheumatology nurses/allied health professionals, rheumatology speciality trainees and pharmacists, as well as the patients themselves. The guideline will also be useful to obstetricians, obstetric physicians, renal physicians, dermatologists and general practitioners who may prescribe these medications to patients in pregnancy.

This guideline uses the terms 'woman', 'maternal' or 'mother' throughout. These should be taken to include people who do not identify as women but are pregnant or have given birth. Where the term 'breastfeeding' is used in this guideline it also refers to infant breastmilk exposure via other methods (e.g. expressed breastmilk, administered via a bottle).

The areas the guideline does not cover

This guideline does not cover the management of infertility or acute pain relief during labour, hence morphine was excluded. Other drug categories: antimalarials; corticosteroids; disease modifying anti-rheumatic and immunosuppressive therapies; and biologic drugs are considered in another guideline. All recommendations in this guideline were formulated by the working group on the basis of published evidence at the time of the systematic literature search, and do not necessarily refer to licensing information or Summary of Product Characteristics for individual medications.

Stakeholder involvement

This guideline was commissioned by the BSR Standards, Audit and Guidelines Working Group. A Guideline Working group (GWG) was created, consisting of a chair (I.G.), alongside representatives from relevant stakeholders (Table 1). In accordance with BSR policy, all members of the GWG made declarations of interest, available on the BSR website.

Recommendations for colchicine and dapsone in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Colchicine therapy may be considered during pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.5).
Dapsone may be used in pregnancy (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.0).
Colchicine may be used in breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.3).
Dapsone may be used in breastfeeding and due to the risk of haemolytic anaemia it is advised to monitor the infant for signs of haemolysis, especially in newborn or premature breastfed infants (GRADE 2C, SOA 90.7).

Anticoagulants in rheumatic disease

The deleterious effects of warfarin and compatibility of heparin in pregnancy are well described and evidence-based guidelines for the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and thrombophilia in pregnancy exist.

Heparin

A systematic review and systematically produced guidelines describe the utility of heparin in the management of VTE and pregnancy morbidity in pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Heparin/LMWH does not cross the placenta.

Heparins are compatible with breastfeeding. There were no additional studies identified, but LactMed states that no particular caution is required as the molecular weight of heparin is such that it is unlikely to be appreciably excreted into breastmilk.

Warfarin

Warfarin has the ability to cross the placenta and is associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities including a characteristic warfarin embryopathy (hypoplasia of the nasal bridge, congenital heart defects, ventriculomegaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, stippled epiphyses) in ∼5% of foetuses exposed between 6 and 12 weeks of gestation. Warfarin should therefore be avoided between 6 and 12 weeks. While heparin/LMWH remains the anticoagulant of choice in pregnancy for the majority of patients considered to be at increased thrombotic risk in pregnancy, warfarin may be considered in pregnancy for women with mechanical heart valves (MHVs). The LMWH regimen could be used for those who refuse warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In management of atrial fibrillation, VKAs may be used after the first trimester.

LactMed is reassuring both with regard to low drug levels in breastmilk and infant serum, and no reported adverse effects.

Breastfeeding use of new small-molecule agents lacks panel guidance and may involve theoretical transfer into milk. The Voting Panel declined to vote on the compatibility of new small-molecule agents regarding use during breastfeeding due to absence of data, and in theory these medications may transfer into breast milk because of their low molecular weights.

### Safety and efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines during lactation [^114MFSaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

In this review, we summarize the data on the safety and side-effect profile of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines during lactation to date, review what is known about mRNA vaccine components in breast milk, and discuss the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in providing immune protection for the breastfeeding infant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that lactating individuals receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and stay up to date on booster doses, including the bivalent COVID-19 booster. The lack of serious side effects in mothers or infants across numerous large studies and registries of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and lactation is reassuring. Although small quantities of mRNA may be transiently detectable in breast milk after maternal vaccination, there are no data demonstrating that vaccine mRNA can survive the infant gastrointestinal tract and no evidence that breast milk from lactating individuals who have received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine can cause harm to breastfeeding infants. In contrast, numerous studies demonstrate that the breast milk of vaccinated individuals contains severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific functional antibodies and T cells, which benefit the breastfeeding infant's developing immune system. Transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies from mother to infant is highest when vaccination occurs during pregnancy compared with lactation, because the breastfeeding infant receives both long-lasting antibodies through the placenta and breast-milk antibodies through breast milk. With clear data demonstrating efficacy and safety and no data demonstrating harm to mother or infant after COVID-19 vaccine administration during lactation, any recommendations to avoid vaccination while breastfeeding or to withhold breast milk from the infant for any period of time after vaccination are not supported by available evidence.

### Medication use during lactation: either a potential contributor to premature weaning or evidence-based support of the mother / child couplet [^116hGsdb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well established that breastfeeding improves the health of women, children, and populations. According to the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report Card, 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, but only 58% maintained breastfeeding at the 6-month mark, and 36% continued to 12 months. Reasons for cessation of breastfeeding are multifactorial and include issues surrounding safe use of medications while breastfeeding for acute or chronic conditions. There are a wide variety of resources that clinicians may consult to help decide if medications are compatible with breastfeeding. The resources have varying data and recommendations, which can make counseling challenging for the clinician. There are some resources that are updated regularly with the most current information about drug safety in lactation, as well as call centers that can answer questions from clinicians and patients. A case scenario is presented to help illustrate the many facets of how medication use can affect breastfeeding. Very few medications are absolutely contraindicated during lactation. Involving the woman and her family in a shared decision-making approach regarding medication use may help women feel more confident in the medication recommendations given and ultimately help women achieve their breastfeeding goals.

### Lactation and management of postpartum disease [^1119s4aB]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

While much of the existing literature in the field of reproductive rheumatology focuses on fertility, preconception counseling, and pregnancy, there is limited information regarding the postpartum period and lactation. Evidence suggests that many rheumatologic disorders flare after delivery, which, along with limitations in medications compatible with breastfeeding, make this time period challenging for women with rheumatologic conditions. This article discusses rheumatologic disease activity during the postpartum period and reviews the safety during lactation of commonly used medications for the management of rheumatic diseases. Fortunately, many of the commonly used medications are compatible with breastfeeding.

### Could tocilizumab be used in familial mediterranean fever? A systematic review [^113Vyytt]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent fever and serosal inflammation. Although colchicine is the primary treatment, around 10% of FMF patients do not respond to it, necessitating alternative therapies. Biologic treatments, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 inhibitors, have been considered. However, the accessibility and cost of IL-1β inhibitors may limit their use in certain regions. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, offers an alternative, but its efficacy in FMF is not well-documented.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in the treatment of FMF.

Methods

Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified 237 articles on the use of TCZ in FMF.

Results

After selection, 14 articles were included: two double-blind RCTs, two retrospective studies and 10 case reports. Multicentre double-blind RCTs reported mixed results in FMF patients without AA amyloidosis due to genetic/classification heterogeneity of the available studies, possible misdiagnosed FMF patients and study design. Retrospective studies suggest that TCZ may benefit FMF patients with established renal AA amyloidosis, potentially preventing progression and managing flares more effectively. TCZ showed a safe profile with no specific adverse events, but data on its use during pregnancy or breastfeeding are lacking. There was no available data on the use of TCZ in paediatric FMF.

Conclusion

This review summarizes the current state of research, safety and efficacy of TCZ in FMF. While IL1β inhibitors remain the first choice for colchicine-resistant or intolerant FMF patients, TCZ might be of interest in some selected FMF patients with established AA amyloidosis and resistance to colchicine and interleukin 1 inhibitors.

Ciclosporin

An earlier consensus document reviewed evidence from > 800 human pregnancies exposed to ciclosporin (CsA). Our previous search from 2005 onwards identified a further 13 studies/reports of 98 pregnancies in patients with a variety of diseases and multiple concomitant medications who had been exposed to CsA at 2–6 mg/kg during pregnancy. Reports of increased rates of preterm delivery and low birth weight were confounded by maternal disease and concomitant medications, and there was no evidence of an increased malformation risk. Comorbidities, such as hypertension, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus, were reported at higher incidences than the general population. Based upon this evidence, CsA was considered compatible with pregnancy at the lowest effective dose, with monitoring of blood pressure, blood glucose and renal function. UKTIS draws a similar conclusion.

We identified an additional five studies of 550 pregnancy exposures. Three studies reported on maternal exposure. A cohort study of 240 SLE pregnancies, in whom 50% were exposed to CsA before and during the first trimester, increased the risk of pancytopenia and/or pre-eclampsia in maternal outcomes. A single-centre experience of outcomes of pregnancy (n = 117) following liver transplantation did not find any difference between those on CsA (n = 34) compared with tacrolimus (n = 81), and so did not attribute these outcomes to medication. A study of the efficacy and safety of CsA in 29 pregnancies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases did not find an increased risk of maternal–foetal complications, and stated that it should be continued in patients who beneﬁt from therapy.

Previously identified studies described small amounts of CsA in breastmilk and almost universally undetectable blood levels in infants, without any adverse effects reported during breastmilk exposure. We found a further study that reported low transfer of CsA and its metabolites into the breastmilk of seven post-transplant mothers in the first two days post-partum, although this study was not designed to make a corresponding assessment of drug safety. LactMed recommends that breastfed infants should be monitored if CsA is used during lactation, possibly with measurement of serum levels if there is a concern for toxicity. In routine clinical practice, there is no concern in the management of solid organ transplant patients who breastfeed on this drug.

No additional studies of long-term follow-up were identified to those found previously on 10 infants exposed to CsA in utero, which reported no complications at 11–14 months.

### Drugs in lactation [^114UM8xV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication management in lactation is a challenging topic for healthcare practitioners around the world. In contrast to traditional advice, very few medications are now thought to be absolutely contraindicated in breastfeeding. As data from case reports, quantitative studies of medication transfer to milk, and lactation physiology accumulate, fact-based guidance for use of medications can be increasingly provided. This review presents the strengths and weaknesses of current scientific knowledge underlying recommendations for use of medications during breastfeeding, describes key pharmacokinetic factors influencing infant drug exposure in breastmilk, and provides a practical algorithm and case study on use of clinical resources as well as pharmacologic data to help in development of a management plan for lactating individuals with various medication needs.

### Safe sleep practices in a New Zealand community and development of a sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) risk assessment instrument [^1158Z925]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Pacifier use at sleep time is associated with a lower SUDI risk through a yet to be determined mechanism. Despite some countries recommending pacifier use for SUDI prevention, NZ does not include pacifier use as part of its safe sleep messages. We found pacifier use more than doubled from 3 weeks of age [9.6%] to 15 weeks, [19%], similar to the 19% of 3 month old infants in this region using pacifiers in 2001/2. This suggests no significant effect of international recommendations on pacifier use in this community, and no broader social effect even though pacifier use is much more common in other countries [32% to 71%].

The suggestion that breastfeeding may be protective against SUDI has been controversial, with many, although not all, studies reporting an association. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that breastfeeding is protective, and that the effect is even stronger when breastfeeding is exclusive. Eighty-nine percent of infants in the current study were breastfed at 2 months of age, compared to 79% of NZ infants aged approximately 6–9 weeks. Although exclusive breastfeeding is likely to provide greater protection against SUDI, we used "any breastfeeding" at 2 months as the marker for protective breastfeeding behaviour. This was because the only estimate available in the literature of the relative risk of SUDI amongst infants who are breastfed was for "any breastfeeding" at 2 months.

Infant feeding in women with HIV — U.S. recommendations and risks: Breastfeeding by women with HIV, even those taking effective ART, is not recommended in the United States because formula is a safe, affordable, available, and acceptable alternative; breastfeeding increases risk of perinatal HIV transmission by 5%–20%; because expressed breast milk may contain HIV and could expose recipients to HIV, it is not safe for women with HIV, regardless of their viral load or ART treatment status, to donate breast milk to human milk banks; infants may also acquire HIV by eating food that has been prechewed by a person with HIV, which may be due to contamination with blood from HIV-infected persons who have oral bleeding or have had recent dental work.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: immunomodulatory anti-rheumatic drugs and corticosteroids [^115ESo92]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

UKTIS does not reported on JAKi. We found no evidence relating to breastmilk exposure to JAKi. Given that they are small molecules and likely to transfer into breastmilk, they should be avoided. LactMed states that no information is available on the use of TOF or BAR during breastmilk exposure, and alternate drugs are preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

There were no studies identified that met our inclusion criteria for UPA. Data provided by AbbVie included 54 maternal pregnancies inadvertently exposed to UPA in the month prior to conception or during the first trimester of pregnancy during the clinical trials programme. The 41 known outcomes included 17 healthy live births (including two premature deliveries), 14 spontaneous miscarriages (10 of whom were on concomitant MTX), nine elective terminations (all with no reported foetal defects) and one ectopic pregnancy. Filgotinib was NICE-approved after our search window, and so was not included in our search.

Recommendations for JAK inhibitors in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

There are insufficient data to make a recommendation on JAKi use during pregnancy and they should be stopped at least two weeks before planned conception (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).
There are insufficient data to recommend JAKi in breastfeeding and, given they are likely to transfer into breastmilk, they should be avoided (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5%).

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^115A5p1S]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pain management: conventional analgesics

Paracetamol

Two systematic reviews were selected. Overall, paracetamol was considered to have a favourable safety profile in pregnancy. Potential links between paracetamol use in pregnancy and pre-term birth and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (principally autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) were confounded by maternal disease and selection bias. UKTIS states that 'In most studies, risk of abnormal neurodevelopment correlated with duration of paracetamol exposure. However, significant methodological limitations of these studies limit the conclusions that can be drawn, and a causal association remains unproven'.

There were no convincing associations with congenital malformations. UKTIS notes that findings of a possible increased risk of cryptorchidism in male offspring following paracetamol use during pregnancy are conflicting. Current Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) guidance is that paracetamol remains safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and its use in any trimester does not appear to increase the risk of major birth defects.

There were conflicting results on the risk of developing wheeze in infants exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy. A recent meta-analysis of 13 articles and 1 043 109 individuals identified a statistically significant association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and increased risk of child asthma [odds ratio (OR) 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12, 1.27; P < 0.00001] in a random-effect model. This significant association was observed for first trimester as well as second and third trimester exposure.

There were no studies identified which specifically examined neonatal outcomes after drug exposure in breastmilk. LactMed reports low amounts of this drug in breastmilk at levels much less than doses usually given to infants with few reports of adverse events. The following recommendations for paracetamol were developed based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S3, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for paracetamol in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Paracetamol is the analgesic of choice and compatible peri-conception and throughout pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 99).
LactMed describes paracetamol as a good choice for analgesia and fever reduction in breastfeeding mothers (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.5).

### Colchicine (Mitigare) [^1131Ycw1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colchicine's effectiveness as a treatment for gout has been postulated to be due to its ability to block neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses induced by monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid. Colchicine disrupts the polymerization of β-tubulin into microtubules, thereby preventing the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Colchicine also interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In healthy adults, MITIGARE when given orally reached a mean Cmaxof 3 ng/mL in 1.3 h (range 0.7 to 2.5 h) after 0.6 mg single dose administration.

Absolute bioavailability is reported to be approximately 45%.

Administration with food has no effect on the rate or extent of colchicine absorption.

Colchicine is not effectively removed by hemodialysis.

Distribution

Colchicine has a mean apparent volume of distribution in healthy young volunteers of approximately 5 to 8 L/kg. Colchicine binding to serum protein is about 39%, primarily to albumin. Colchicine crosses the placenta and distributes into breast milk [see Pregnancy (8.1) and Lactation (8.2)].

Metabolism

A published in vitro human liver microsome study showed that about 16% of colchicine is metabolized to 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine (2- and 3-DMC, respectively) by CYP3A4. Glucuronidation is also believed to be a metabolic pathway for colchicine.

Excretion

In a published study in healthy volunteers, 40 to 65% of the total absorbed dose of colchicine (1 mg administered orally) was recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion are also believed to play a role in colchicine elimination. Colchicine is a substrate of P-gp and P-gp efflux is postulated to play an important role in colchicine disposition. Elimination half-life in humans was found to be 31 h (range 21.7 to 49.9 h).

### Colchicine (Gloperba) [^114fqHtZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available human data from published literature on colchicine use in pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Although animal reproduction and development studies were not conducted with GLOPERBA, published animal reproduction and development studies indicate that colchicine causes embryofetal toxicity and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnant women with rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Behçet's disease, or familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)) treated with colchicine at therapeutic doses during pregnancy. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Colchicine is present in human milk (see Data). Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for GLOPERBA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from GLOPERBA or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate that colchicine is present in breastmilk. A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children and advised to reconsider breastfeeding if the infant has diarrhea. In a prospective observational cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine exposed breastfed infants.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicate that infertility from colchicine is rare and may be reversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Gout is rare in pediatric patients; safety and effectiveness of GLOPERBA in pediatric patients has not been established.

### Managing urticarial vasculitis: a clinical decision-making algorithm based on expert consensus [^115X1u1d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This review has several limitations. First, this is not a systematic review, and some studies were not included. Second, the proposed algorithm is based on the expert opinion of the coauthors of this review and available literature, primarily case reports and case series. Furthermore, few publications specified the treatment of children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and other vulnerable patients. The treatment algorithm should be adjusted to meet the needs of these populations. Last, drug combinations were used in many studies, making the identification of individual drug efficacy difficult.

### The impact of breastfeeding and safe sleep mobile health messaging on breastfeeding and bedsharing [^116oJKUk]. Academic Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mobile health (mHealth) safe sleep messaging increases rates of safe sleep. Bedsharing is more common among breastfeeders. Advice to not bedshare may negatively impact breastfeeding. We compared the impact of safe sleep or breastfeeding mHealth messaging on bedsharing and breastfeeding at 2 to 5 months.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of mothers who initiated breastfeeding from a cluster randomized clinical trial of mHealth messaging for safe sleep or breastfeeding. A multi-ethnic sample of 1600 mothers was recruited from 16 US birth hospitals and surveyed at 2 to 5 months regarding the previous 2 weeks' breastfeeding and bedsharing practices. Data on 997 mothers who initiated breastfeeding were analyzed with multivariable generalized estimating logistic regression models to examine the association of mHealth messaging with infant care practices.

Results

Overall, exposure to breastfeeding versus safe sleep messaging was not associated with a difference in any breastfeeding at 2 to 5 months (69.3% vs 65.5%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.33 [95% confidence interval, 0.91, 1.94]). Women with shorter planned duration of breastfeeding who received breastfeeding messaging had increased odds of breastfeeding at 2 to 5 months (50% vs 31%; aOR 3.13 [95% CI, 1.47, 6.65]). Mothers who received safe sleep messaging had lower rates of bedsharing overall when compared to breastfeeding messaging (24.8% vs 35.2%; aOR = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.44, 0.78]).

Conclusions

In this large multi-ethnic US sample, receipt of safe sleep mHealth messaging was associated with lower rates of bedsharing without negatively impacting breastfeeding rates. Future research should focus on continued development of interventions to improve adherence to both safe sleep and breastfeeding recommendations.

### Colchicine tablets 0.5 mg (Lodoco) [^114viHUG]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The mean absolute bioavailability of colchicine is reported to be approximately 45%.

Effect of food

When LODOCO was administered with or following a high-fat, high-calorie meal in a bioavailability study, the results showed a lack of a significant food effect, see Table 2, above. LODOCO may be administered with or without food.

The mean peak plasma concentration of LODOCO under fed conditions was found to be 1.8 ng/ml in approximately 1.75 hour.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution in healthy volunteers is approximately 1300 L.

Colchicine binding to serum protein is 39 ± 5%, primarily to albumin regardless of concentration. After reabsorption, is rapidly removed from the plasma and distributed to various tissues. Colchicine is found in high concentrations in leucocytes, kidneys, the liver, and spleen.

Colchicine crosses the placenta. Colchicine also distributes into breast milk. Colchicine can also cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate within the brain, which contains large amount of tubulin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].

Elimination

Metabolism

Colchicine is demethylated to two primary metabolites, 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine (2- and 3-DMC, respectively) and one minor metabolite, 10-O-demethylcolchicine (also known as colchiceine). In vitro studies using human liver microsomes have shown that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of colchicine to 2- and 3-DMC. Plasma levels of these metabolites are (less than 5% of parent drug).

### Colchicine use during breastfeeding [^116v9qkE]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the outcome of infants exposed to colchicine during lactation.

Subjects and Methods

A prospective observational cohort study design was used. Mothers who contacted Beilinson Teratology Information Service (BELTIS) regarding use of colchicine while breastfeeding were followed up by phone interview. Data on lactation, neonatal symptoms, and outcome 1–3 years after initial consultation were obtained. Mothers breastfeeding while taking colchicine (n = 37) and their infants (n = 38) were compared with a matched control group of mothers using a drug known to be safe during lactation (n = 75) and their infants (n = 76).

Results

Follow-up was obtained for 59 of 76 (78%) women who contacted BELTIS regarding use of colchicine. Of the 59 women, 37 breastfed while taking colchicine, five did not take colchicine, 16 did not breastfeed, and one declined to participate. The mean duration of breastfeeding was similar in both groups. Adverse neonatal symptoms were seen in three of 38 colchicine-exposed infants versus four of 76 of control group infants (p = 0.68). Delayed development or neurological abnormalities were seen in two infants in both study groups (p = 0.60). None of the colchicine-exposed infants showed abnormal growth.

Conclusions

No increase in adverse long-term outcomes was found in colchicine-exposed breastfed infants. Our data support continuation of breastfeeding in women treated with colchicine.

Breastfeeding has positive health consequences for both the breastfed infant and the nursing mother.(1,2) Although information on drug use during lactation is available through sites such as LactMed,(3) available information is often incomplete. Unlike pregnancy, in which large numbers of pregnant women need to be studied to assure safety, measurement of drug concentrations in breastmilk in a relatively few subjects can provide valuable information to assess drug safety. This article reviews methods of measuring and predicting drug passage into breastmilk.

### Digitization in nursing processes and the use of clinical decision support systems: do they improve perinatal indicators? [^112KDW4o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Study tools

The initial values of the study, which were calculated to evaluate the arrangements made in the nursing records systems regarding the usage rates of the safe childbirth checklist of the WHO, the rates of infants discharged following exclusive breastfeeding, and the rates of mother–infant pairs starting skin–to-skin contact within one hour after delivery, as well as the effects of the nursing CDSS that were developed, were selected as the average values at the end of 2021. For the three selected indicators, these values were 45.81%, 26.44%, and 70.95%, respectively. Because the 2021 indicator values were lower than the target values of the institution and because the institution was going to apply for Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 6 certifications, a digitization process was initiated by the institution. The goals of this process were determined to be reducing the record-keeping burden of healthcare workers, making record-keeping processes easier, and improving healthcare indicators. The usage priority of digital technologies in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology was designed to include the three indicators given above. In order to improve the relevant indicators, the institution has started to fill out the safe birth control checklist prepared by the WHO and the LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool through the Information Management System (IMS). After the digital data entry, the nursing care processes supported by these scales began to develop CDSS (Fig. 1). An example of the nursing care CDSS process flowchart, triggered by the "start breastfeeding and initiate skin-to-skin contact if the mother and baby are well" section in the safe birth control checklist via IMS, and included in the scope of our study, is presented in Fig. 2. In the study, the nursing diagnoses of "Risk of Parent-Infant-Child Bonding Disruption", "Ineffective Breastfeeding", and "Breastfeeding Interruption" were examined. The CDSS were used to create task lists and reminder alerts for nurses on the main screen when the re-evaluation times for the scales were approaching, nursing intervention classification procedures were imminent, and/or reminders were needed for incomplete areas. The institution completed the integration of the devices involved in the decision-making criteria and provided vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature), CD4, and proteinuria values into the IMS (laboratory device integration) simultaneously with software arrangements, and it was ensured that this information was assigned to the relevant tab in the safe childbirth checklist.

### A learning healthcare system for pregnant and breastfeeding women: what do women during preconception, pregnancy, and nursing think? – A qualitative study: a contribution from the concePTION project [^1167XBq3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Dissemination of information

In general, there is a cautious attitude towards medication use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Our interviews, as well as the literature, showed that women are concerned about the impact of medication on both foetal development and their own health. Our interviews showed that regardless of an LHS, respondents want to know from their HCP whether a medication is safe to use in their situation. The anxiety towards medication use and the difficulty with interpreting medical information, results in a feeling of insecurity. The question is whether an LHS can take away these insecurities. Not only are HCPs important in the dissemination of information among women, but they are also important in the interpretation and translation of new insights that are generated through an LHS. Therefore, the help of HCPs in validating research outcomes and deciding what type of knowledge would be useful to pregnant and breastfeeding women is necessary. Respondents explained they wish to have information that is applicable to their specific situation. It seems that an HCP is of crucial importance in making sure the results generated through an LHS flow back to the patient in understandable language.

Subsequently, pharmaceutical companies have the duty to monitor the safety and efficacy of their medication and to update drug labels once new information becomes available. Unfortunately, it has proven to be extremely difficult to stimulate the progress of updating labels. The European Medicine Agency (EMA) has set up post-authorisation measures (PAM) to make sure drug agencies collect and provide data to enable further assessment on the safety or efficacy of medication in the post-approval setting. Despite these regulations, it still takes too long before labels are updated or the assessments are not completed because of a lack of data. However, providing readable and solid evidence on the safety and efficacy of medication is the task of drug manufacturers. Furthermore, labels are an important source for making an informed decision. Our interviews showed that almost all respondents read the labels before taking any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### Bedsharing and breastfeeding: the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol # 6, revision 2019 [^116kmimz]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). High credibility.

SIDS and SUID trends and bedsharing policy — United States and United Kingdom indicate that, taking into account diagnostic shift, the proxy sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rate (R95 + R99 + W75) in the United States with the strict "no bedsharing" policy appears to be almost unchanged, whereas in the United Kingdom, where parents are educated about safe bedsharing, the proxy SIDS rate has fallen over the past 10 years; in a study to avoid bedsharing, bedsharing was no different than in the control group and increased over the first 6 months while breastfeeding did not decrease; figures show U.S. trends in SIDS and sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) from 1990–2015 and England and Wales trends from 2000–2015 with deaths per 100,000 live births as the rate scale.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^1133Eo9W]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure and safety data on drug use in lactation

Development and evaluation of a new drug requires understanding of its safety profile at a dose that can achieve therapeutic concentrations. This is particularly true for small molecule versus biologics, as studies to date suggest that very low levels of biologics are secreted into breastmilk, likely due to their large molecular weight and enzymatic degradation in the gastro-intestinal tract. Typically, during drug development, safety data that inform the use of medicines during breastfeeding fall into three categories, including animal experiments, predictive computational tools that estimate the partitioning of a drug into the breast milk based on its physicochemical properties, and clinical exposure and safety data. In vitro, in vivo and in silico methods to study the transfer of maternal medication into human breast milk are available and have been described in detail in a recent review. Although several in vitro models (animal and human mammary epithelial cell lines) are currently used, cell culture characterization, including transporter-mediated uptake across the in vitro blood-milk barrier, remains limited.

Non-clinical postnatal development studies are designed to collect initial information on exposure via milk in nursing pups, including evaluations of survival, growth and behaviour. Although animal data are used to assess whether a drug is likely to partition in human milk, they are not generally considered to be useful for extrapolating to drug concentrations in human milk. Indeed, the FDA's Pregnancy and Lactation Labelling Rule (PLLR) recommends that in prescribing information "Animal data not be included if human data exists" and "Animal data, when included, should only state presence or absence of drug in milk".

Models to predict the milk-to-plasma concentration ratio (M:P ratio) of a drug based on the physicochemical characteristics of the drug (e.g. ionization, molecular weight, lipophilicity and protein binding affinity) are available and undergoing assessment. Although these models have met with some success (depending on the characteristics of the drug), they are continuously evolving to accommodate the changing drug space (more metabolically stable drugs susceptible to transporter uptake and efflux). Currently, they are not considered sufficiently robust for prospective prediction of drug concentration profiles in human milk, especially if transporter-mediated secretion is involved. These predictive models can be integrated within a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling framework to simulate concentration-time profiles in mothers and breastfeeding infants. PBPK models by their very nature are primed for this as they can account for the time-variant complex interplay between physiological parameters and drug-related characteristics in nursing mothers and infants.

ABM Protocol #21 — opioid exposure during breastfeeding — notes that while there is a moderate amount of data on prescribed opioids, little is known about nonprescribed synthetic opioids; fentanyl may adulterate up to 90% of illicit supply. In individuals taking short-term prescribed opioids (3–5 days), relative infant doses (RID) are usually low (1–5%) and breastfeeding is typically safe, whereas longer-term use (> 5 days) raises concern for drug accumulation. Tramadol carries a US Food and Drug Administration warning for potentially higher RID, though there are no reports of infant effects with parental tramadol use. The document also highlights increasing impacts of opioid use disorder (OUD) and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) over 2000–2016.

Rigour of development

Statement of scope of literature search and strategy employed

Most medications covered in this guideline have been comprehensively and systematically reviewed in multiple other documents, since the first BSR guideline on this topic. Therefore, a consensus-based approach was taken to compile and assess most significant evidence published since 2013 to December 2020 through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE databases with specific search terms (Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online). Filters were applied to capture National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance, international guidelines, systematic reviews, cohort studies or case-series. Information was preferentially selected from NICE guidance and/or largest/most recent systematic reviews and where lacking was extracted from largest cohort, case-series or abstract. Findings were cross-referenced with the previous BSR guideline, as well as the Cochrane, Lactmed (a National Library of Medicine database on drugs and lactation) and UKTIS databases.

Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract of 2997 articles, identified 130 and selected the most recent/largest systematic reviews or largest cohort study or case-series as well any NICE guidance and international guidelines. Thirty-six studies (Fig. 1) met the inclusion criteria and relevant information was extracted into data-extraction tables.

Figure 1.
Flow diagram of study selection

Statement of methods used to formulate the recommendations (levels of evidence)

The working group met regularly to formalise search strategy, review evidence, resolve disagreements and finally to determine recommendations. This guideline was developed in line with BSR's Guideline Protocol using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology to determine quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. Accompanying each recommendation in this guideline, in brackets, is the strength of recommendation, quality of evidence and strength of agreement (SOA).

Strength of recommendation

Using GRADE, recommendations were categorized as either strong (denoted by 1) or weak (denoted by 2), according to the balance between benefits and risks. A strong recommendation was made when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks (or vice versa). A weak recommendation denotes that the benefits are more closely balanced with the risk or more uncertain.

Quality of evidence

Using the GRADE approach, the quality of evidence was determined as either high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) reflecting the confidence in the estimates of benefits or harm.

### Policy statement: breastfeeding and the use of human milk [^114oQMZ6]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding make breastfeeding, or the provision of human milk, a public health imperative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately 6 months after birth. Furthermore, the AAP supports continued breastfeeding, along with appropriate complementary foods introduced at about 6 months, as long as mutually desired by mother and child for 2 years or beyond. These recommendations are consistent with those of the World Health Organization (WHO). Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. The AAP recommends that birth hospitals or centers implement maternity care practices shown to improve breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Joint Commission monitor breastfeeding practices in US hospitals. Pediatricians play a critical role in hospitals, their practices, and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and, thus, need to be trained about the benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and children and in managing breastfeeding.

### Colchicine and the heart [^114yh9Ru]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacology

Colchicine is absorbed by the jejunum and ileum. Bioavailability is variable (mean 45%); however, peak serum concentrations are usually reached within 0.5–3 h of oral administration and decline over the next 2 h but subsequently rise due to enterohepatic recycling. Colchicine becomes highly concentrated in leucocytes, especially neutrophils, due to their limited expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). After single 1 mg oral dose, intracellular concentrations within neutrophils peak within 48 h in healthy subjects, which explains why its acute biological effects require 24–48 h to fully develop. Colchicine has an elimination half-life of 27–31 h. Thus, after discontinuation, its biological effects on leucocytes decline within 48 h.5w Between 10% and 30% of the drug is protein-bound. Colchicine is partially metabolized in the liver by de-acetylation with an elimination half-life of 12–30 min and is excreted by the kidneys (20–40%) and in the bile (60–80%). Decreased clearance through either of these two pathways may increase the risk of drug accumulation. 6w Two major interactions of colchicine with specific proteins modulate its pharmacokinetics beyond tubulin: cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-gp. CYP3A4 metabolizes colchicine in the liver (Figure 3). P-gp is an ATP-dependent phospho-glycoprotein located in the cell membrane and responsible for the excretion of the drug in the intestine, liver, kidney, and blood–brain barrier. 6w

Figure 3
Colchicine uptake occurs in the ileum and jejunum. The drug is metabolized by the liver through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and excreted into the bile and urine through P-glycoprotein. Colchicine can also cross the placenta and enters breast milk by P-glycoprotein.

### Antirheumatic medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^114atJAF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As active rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease during pregnancy increases the risk for pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and maternal illness, ongoing management with pregnancy-compatible medications can improve these outcomes. Selecting and taking these medications can be challenging for rheumatologists and patients due to limited knowledge about potential risks and benefits.

Recent Findings

Fortunately, the American College of Rheumatology, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, British Rheumatology Society, and the European League Against Rheumatism have each published recommendations to guide the use of antirheumatic medications in pregnancy and lactation. Each of these groups endorsed the use of hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in pregnancy. They also agreed that methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and leflunomide should be avoided in pregnancy. New medications, including small-molecules and biologics, have limited data to support safety in pregnancy and are not currently recommended during this period. Most antirheumatic medications are compatible with lactation.

Summary

Because many patients are hesitant to use antirheumatic medications during pregnancy, honest and accurate discussions about pregnancy planning and management are important to help women make decisions that are in their and their offspring's best interest.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^112WgoLo]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Colchicine and dapsone

These drugs were not considered in the previous BSR guideline and are now included because they may be used to treat certain inflammatory rheumatic diseases. UKTIS does not report on colchicine or dapsone. A systematic review and meta-analysis of colchicine use in 550 pregnancies of women with mostly familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) at doses of 1–2 mg per day, compared with 1263 non-exposed pregnancies found this drug did not significantly increase the incidence of foetal malformations or miscarriage when taken during pregnancy. However, the National Amyloidosis Centre recommends to continue the prescribed dose as there are no established safety concerns at colchicine doses > 2 mg daily during pregnancy.

No systematic review data was identified for dapsone. A review of 924 pregnancies exposed to dapsone to treat malaria was precluded from meaningful risk-benefit analysis due to limited reporting of outcomes. They concluded that the use of dapsone may be considered when no suitable alternative is available and the threat of malaria is the greater risk. It is a safe option in pregnant patients without glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiency and can be used during lactation while monitoring the baby for haemolysis and G6PDH deficiency. A review of the treatment of rheumatic and autoimmune skin disease in women during pregnancy concluded that dapsone may be safely and cautiously used during pregnancy.

LactMed reports that long-term prophylactic maternal doses of colchicine up to 1.5 mg daily produce levels in milk that result in the infant receiving < 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and no adverse effects have been reported from limited studies. It also states that the highest milk levels occur 2–4 h after a dose, so avoiding breastfeeding during this time can minimize the infant dose, or simply taking the drug after nursing. LactMed also states that dapsone can be used during breastfeeding; however, haemolytic anaemia might occur, especially in newborn infants and in those with G6PDH deficiency. Recommendations for these drugs were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online.

### Colchicine and the heart [^112WmNno]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent review of drug-induced agranulocytosis, over 120 drugs including colchicine were listed as potentially causal. However, in the current literature only one case report is described in a patient taking low-dose therapy with no history of renal or liver disease. 16w

Prolonged use of colchicine has been associated with a transient rise in liver enzymes in ∼2% of patients, but as with statin therapy this did not result in treatment discontinuation or severe liver dysfunction. Other reported possible side-effects, including alopecia and neuropathy, have rarely been reported (< 1% of users), and appear to resolve rapidly after colchicine withdrawal. Although colchicine crosses the placenta, continuous use at doses of 0.5–1.0 mg daily during pregnancy does not increase the risk of birth defects or pregnancy loss in FMF. Despite entering breast milk, colchicine is considered safe during breast feeding.

Hence, when used at doses up to 1.0 mg daily in patients without advanced renal or liver disease, colchicine is safe. In the 90% of patients who do not develop early treatment intolerance, long-term use at this dosage proved to be safe and well tolerated.

### Colchicine in acute myocardial infarction [^111xJzxn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR (colchicine) was published by Sanjit S Jolly and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the trial question was: what is the role of colchicine in patients with myocardial infarction? In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the population was: 7062 patients (1438 female, 5624 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with myocardial infarction. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; SBP < 90 mmHg; active diarrhea; known allergy or contraindication to everolimus; unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy; contraindication to colchicine; cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the interventions were: n = 3528 colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily) n = 3534 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned ischemia-driven coronary revascularization (9.1% vs. 9.3%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.85 to 1.16). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, or stroke (6.8% vs. 7.1%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (3.3% vs. 3.2%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.34) No significant difference in recurrent myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.1%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. significant difference in diarrhea (10.2% vs. 6.6%). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the conclusion was: in patients with myocardial infarction, colchicine was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned ischemia-driven coronary revascularization.

Canakinumab

Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody to IL-1. There is, therefore, the potential for active transport across the placenta from the second trimester onwards.

One paper reporting canakinumab use from pre-conception in eight pregnancies (stopped during first trimester in 5/8 pregnancies) met our inclusion criteria. There were seven live births, all of whom were healthy, full term and normal birth weight. One mother with refractory Cogan syndrome had an early miscarriage at 6 weeks (after a miscarriage the previous year while on anakinra).

In addition, Novartis supplied information from analyses of the Novartis Global Safety Database, which included 76 maternal and nine paternal exposures. There were 47 known pregnancy outcomes, with 27 healthy newborns, one preterm birth (with meconium staining not thought likely to be related to canakinumab exposure), nine spontaneous miscarriages (including two miscarriages related to paternal exposure in one father) and three elective terminations. Seven other adverse events were reported: one case of congenital pyelocaliectasis following paternal exposure to canakinumab; one case of congenital musculoskeletal abnormality following maternal exposure, with insufficient data on other contributory factors; one case of inherited genetic disease with neonatal RSV infection and pyrexia following infant vaccinations; and four adverse events very unlikely to relate to canakinumab exposure (one newborn non-serious hypotension and three cases of likely inherited disease: Muckle–Wells syndrome and CAPS).

One cohort study reported breastmilk exposure in four infants whose mothers were prescribed regular canakinumab, with no reported serious infections or developmental abnormalities.

### Breastfeeding in women with rheumatic diseases [^114rmNZC]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast feeding is considered an ideal way for a mother to feed her child and has both bonding and health benefits for the infant and the mother. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast feeding as an infant's only nutrition source for the first 6 months, as well as continued breast feeding for at least 1 year. In the USA, the actual number of women breast feeding is below this goal, with half of infants receiving breastmilk at 6 months of age. Although American women met the 2010 Healthy People goal for 75% of new mothers to initiate breast feeding, the rates of prolonged and exclusively breast feeding were below the targets. In North Carolina, which is where our study took place, 85% of mothers tried to breastfeed in 2015, 59% of mothers were breast feeding at 6 months and 33% at 12 months. Prior studies have identified five key determinants of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity: demography, biology, attitudes, hospital practices and social norms.

Current guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) all agree that most medications used to manage rheumatic diseases are compatible with breast feeding, including antimalarials, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, colchicine, intravenous immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids and all biologicals.

This study sought to identify the frequency and predictors of the desire to and actually breast feeding in women with a range of rheumatic diseases. We hypothesise that the breastfeeding rates of women included in this study will reflect the common demographic determinants but that the health of the mother and infant and the safety of antirheumatic medications would also play a role in breast feeding.

### Medications in the breast-feeding mother [^1161CZrc]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Prescribing medications for a breast-feeding mother requires weighing the benefits of medication use for the mother against the risk of not breast-feeding the infant or the potential risk of exposing the infant to medications. A drug that is safe for use during pregnancy may not be safe for the nursing infant. The transfer of medications into breast milk depends on a concentration gradient that allows passive diffusion of nonionized, non-protein-bound drugs. The infant's medication exposure can be limited by prescribing medications to the breast-feeding mother that are poorly absorbed orally, by avoiding breast-feeding during times of peak maternal serum drug concentration and by prescribing topical therapy when possible. Mothers of premature or otherwise compromised infants may require altered dosing to avoid drug accumulation and toxicity in these infants. The most accurate and up-to-date sources of information, including Internet resources and telephone consultations, should be used.

Second-Generation H1-Antihistamines

Overall, 141 patients with UV (77 of whom had NUV) from 23 publications received different second-generation anti-histamines (sgAHs) at a standard dose or up-titrated up to four times the standard dose (n = 5). Two patients received concomitant ranitidine (an H2-antihistamine), whereas eight patients received an additional first-generation H1-antihistamine (hydroxyzine, up to 50 mg/day). The duration of treatment varied from 10 days to 8 years. Resolution of skin lesions with the isolated use of sgAHs occurred in 3.5% of patients (n = 5/141), and skin lesions improved in 6.4% (n = 9/141) of patients with concomitant use of oral prednisolone or colchicine. SgAHs, used at standard or higher than the standard dose, failed to effectively improve skin lesions in the remaining 90.1% patients (n = 128/141). These patients commonly switched to the use of SGC, immunomodulators, or omalizumab for their UV. SgAHs have not been reported to have any effect on extracutaneous symptoms, and no treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported (Table 3 of the ESM).

In line with our recent systematic review, we found that sgAHs are of limited efficacy in UV. However, given their safety profile, sgAHs can be tried in patients with UV with mild symptoms and pruritus, those who have signs of a CSU/UV overlap, and possibly also in patients with more severe disease as an adjunct therapy, along with systemic immunomodulators or biologics. SgAHs are generally safe, even as a long-term treatment; however, some AEs are possible, such as tiredness and somnolence, especially at high doses. Elderly patients, especially those with renal, hepatic and/or cardiac disorders may be at risk while taking high doses of some sgAHs. Cetirizine and loratadine are considered to be safe in pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Monoclonal Antibodies

Among biologic therapies, the most substantial evidence for treating UV is available for omalizumab, a humanized recombinant anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20. Additionally, there is evidence for the use of canakinumab, an interleukin (IL)-1β antagonist, and anakinra, an IL-1-receptor antagonist.

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^112pq89r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution in healthy young volunteers is approximately 5 to 8 L/kg.

Colchicine binding to serum protein is low, 39 ± 5%, primarily to albumin regardless of concentration.

Colchicine crosses the placenta (plasma levels in the fetus are reported to be approximately 15% of the maternal concentration). Colchicine also distributes into breast milk at concentrations similar to those found in the maternal serum [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].

Metabolism

Colchicine is demethylated to two primary metabolites, 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine (2- and 3-DMC, respectively) and one minor metabolite, 10-O-demethylcolchicine (also known as colchiceine). In vitro studies using human liver microsomes have shown that CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of colchicine to 2- and 3-DMC. Plasma levels of these metabolites are minimal (less than 5% of parent drug).

Elimination/Excretion

In healthy volunteers (n = 12), 40 to 65% of 1 mg orally administered colchicine was recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion are also postulated to play a role in colchicine elimination. Following multiple oral doses (0.6 mg twice daily), the mean elimination half-lives in young healthy volunteers (mean age 25 to 28 years of age) is 26.6 to 31.2 hours. Colchicine is a substrate of P-gp.

Special Populations

There is no difference between men and women in the pharmacokinetic disposition of colchicine.

Pediatric Patients

Pharmacokinetics of colchicine was not evaluated in pediatric patients.

Generic recommendations on prescribing immunomodulatory drugs and/or corticosteroids in rheumatic disease in pregnancy

Pre-conception counselling should be addressed by all healthcare professionals, with referral to professionals with relevant expertise as appropriate, to optimize disease control before pregnancy; with advice on the timing of pregnancy, and drug therapy before, during and after pregnancy, including contraception (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
If a woman is planning pregnancy, avoid pregnancy-incompatible drugs (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
The risks and benefits to the mother and foetus of drug treatment to control maternal disease should be discussed and clearly documented by all healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5%).
Immunomodulatory drugs that are contraindicated in pregnancy should be switched to a pregnancy-compatible alternative in advance of conception to ensure maintenance of disease control on the new medication (GRADE 1A, SOA 100%).
When no pregnancy-compatible drugs are suitable, control of severe/life-threatening maternal disease should take priority over concerns for potential foetal outcomes (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.0%).
All biologic DMARDs may be continued throughout pregnancy if required to control active/severe maternal disease (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5%).
Immunisation schedules in infants after in-utero exposure to biologic DMARDs will depend on timing of exposure, bioavailability and persistence of the drug, mechanism of action of the drug, and live vaccines (GRADE 1C, SOA 99.5%).
Where possible, the minimum effective dose of immunomodulatory drug or corticosteroid should be used to maintain maternal disease suppression, and stopping the drug during pregnancy may be considered in women at low risk of disease flare on withdrawal of therapy (GRADE 1B, SOA 100%).
Some drugs may reduce male fertility, but paternal drug exposure in humans has not convincingly been associated with adverse foetal development or pregnancy outcome. Although the evidence is weak, men who take rheumatological medicines should be reassured about the safety of conceiving (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.4%).

### Colchicine (Colcrys) [^1127iBx1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature on colchicine use in pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Colchicine crosses the human placenta. Although animal reproductive and developmental studies were not conducted with COLCRYS (colchicine), published animal reproduction and development studies indicate that colchicine causes embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnant women with rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's disease, or familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) treated with colchicine at therapeutic doses during pregnancy. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Colchicine is present in human milk (see Data). Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for COLCRYS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from COLCRYS or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate that colchicine is present in breastmilk. A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children. In a prospective observational cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine-exposed breastfed infants.

### Delphi survey of international pharmacology experts: an attempt to derive international recommendations for use of medicine in breastfeeding women [^112YSw2A]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are currently no common guidelines used by health professionals to aid decision-making around the use of medicines during breastfeeding. Several specialized books, Web sites, and drug information services exist; however, all use slightly different criteria to derive their "safety hierarchy". The aim of this study was to build consensus among international experts in pharmacology and breastfeeding to develop an agreed-upon classification system for safety of medicine use in breastfeeding women.

Study Method

A three-round Web-based Delphi qualitative research design was used.

Results

Seventeen experts in pharmacy/pharmacology and breastfeeding identified 15 key parameters that are used to inform decisions about medicines and breastfeeding. The most important parameters about the infant were the age and health of the child, and those of the medicine were the safety profile and experience of use in infants. The experts had a clear understanding of the complexity of decision-making when prescribing for breastfeeding women. Although the current number or letter classification systems do not incorporate important considerations such as infant age, a longer "descriptive text" incorporating all considerations may be impractical in busy clinical practice.

Conclusions

Although clinicians and lay people would appreciate a simple classification scheme, in practice, decision-making about the safety of medicines for breastfeeding women is complex.

Breastfeeding in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) — we suggest as standard good practice that women with RMD be encouraged to breastfeed if they so desire and are able to do so, and we suggest that disease control be maintained with lactation-compatible medications and that individualized risks and benefits be reviewed with each patient. We strongly recommend treatment with HCQ, colchicine, sulfasalazine, rituximab, and all TNF inhibitors as compatible with breastfeeding. We conditionally recommend treatment with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, calcineurin inhibitors, NSAIDs and the non–TNF inhibitor biologic agents (anakinra, rituximab, belimumab, abatacept, tocilizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab) as compatible with breastfeeding. We also recommend prednisone < 20 mg daily (or equivalent nonfluorinated glucocorticoid) as compatible with breastfeeding, but strongly recommend that with doses of prednisone ≥ 20 mg a day (or equivalent), women delay breastfeeding or discard breast milk accumulated in the 4 hours following glucocorticoid administration. We strongly recommend against use of CYC, leflunomide, MMF, and thalidomide while breastfeeding, and we conditionally recommend against use of MTX while breastfeeding.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^115jbkJh]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Clinical Protocol #36 — d. Minimize breast pump usage states that mechanical breast pumps stimulate breast milk production without physiologically extracting milk as an infant will, and that pumping does not provide the opportunity for bacterial exchange between the infant's mouth and mother's breast, and may, therefore, predispose to dysbiosis. Breast pumps also can cause trauma to breast parenchyma and the nipple areolar complex if improper flange sizes are used, suction is too high, or the mother is pumping for an excessive duration of time. Milk expression should be limited to when a mother is separated from her infant or requires pumping for other medically indicated reasons for herself or her infant. Women should not be instructed to express and discard their milk, as bacterial mastitis is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, and women using a breast pump should express milk at a frequency and volume that mimics physiological breastfeeding. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: immunomodulatory anti-rheumatic drugs and corticosteroids [^111ArbHy]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies of MTX in breastfeeding remain very limited. Although they did not meet our inclusion criteria, we identified two case reports that found low levels of MTX in breastmilk and no adverse effects on the breastfed infants. LactMed describes low levels of MTX in breastmilk and conflicting expert opinion on whether it can safely be used during breastfeeding. It states that withholding breastfeeding for 24 h after a weekly low-dose of MTX may decrease the infant's dose by 40%, and that if breastfeeding is undertaken during long-term, low-dose MTX use, monitoring of the infant's complete blood count and differential could be considered.

Post-partum follow-up of up to 14 months after first trimester MTX exposure was reported in three infants with long-term complications of foetal MTX syndrome, including semi lobar holoprosencephaly, cardiac abnormalities, tracheostomy and requirement for antiepileptic therapy.

Recommendations for methotrexate in pregnancy and breastmilk exposure

MTX at any dose should be avoided in pregnancy and stopped at least one month in advance of planned conception, when it should be switched to another pregnancy-compatible drug to ensure maintenance of maternal disease suppression (GRADE 1A, SOA 98%).
In women treated with low-dose (≤ 25 mg/week) MTX within one month prior to conception, folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) should be continued up to 12 weeks of pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.5%).
In unintended pregnancy on low-dose (≤ 25 mg/week) MTX, there is minimal risk to the foetus; the drug should be stopped immediately, folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) continued, and a careful evaluation of foetal risk with early referral to a foetal medicine department considered (GRADE 1C, SOA 100%).
Although only minute amounts of MTX are excreted into breastmilk, MTX cannot be recommended in breastfeeding because of theoretical risks and insufficient data on outcomes (GRADE 2C, SOA 99%).

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^116GDgeQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is beneficial for the health of the mother and child. However, at least 50% of postpartum women need pharmacotherapy, and this number is rising due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and pregnancies at a later age. Making informed decisions on medicine use while breastfeeding is often challenging, considering the extensive information gap on medicine exposure and safety during lactation. This can result in the unnecessary cessation of breastfeeding, the avoidance of pharmacotherapy or the off-label use of medicines. The UmbrelLACT study aims to collect data on human milk transfer of maternal medicines, child exposure and general health outcomes. Additionally, the predictive performance of lactation and paediatric physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, a promising tool to predict medicine exposure in special populations, will be evaluated.

Methods and Analysis

Each year, we expect to recruit 5–15 breastfeeding mothers using pharmacotherapy via the University Hospitals Leuven, the BELpREG project (pregnancy registry in Belgium) or external health facilities. Each request and compound will be evaluated on relevance (ie, added value to available scientific evidence) and feasibility (including access to analytical assays). Participants will be requested to complete at least one questionnaire on maternal and child's general health and collect human milk samples over 24hours. Optionally, two maternal and one child's blood samples can be collected. The maternal medicine concentration in human milk will be determined along with the estimation of the medicine intake (eg, daily infant dose and relative infant dose) and systemic exposure of the breastfed child. The predictive performance of PBPK models will be assessed by comparing the observed concentrations in human milk and plasma to the PBPK predictions.

Ethics and Dissemination

This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven (internal study number S67204). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at (inter)national scientific meetings.

Colchicine: dosing, safety and tolerability

Colchicine exhibits a dose-dependent response with a narrow therapeutic index. Most side effects tend to resolve upon dose reduction or discontinuation. When divided into two daily doses and gradually increased, it is well-tolerated. For acute gout attacks, the recommended initial dose is 1.0 mg or 1.2 mg, followed by a 0.5 mg or 0.6 mg dose after 1 h. The maintenance dose is 0.5–0.6 mg, once or twice daily after the attack subsides. In familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients, it is well-tolerated up to 0.5 mg three times daily for the prevention of attacks and amyloidosis, in the absence of renal impairment. Gastrointestinal intolerance, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or discomfort, is the most common adverse reaction, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Treatment dosages may lead to mild leukopenia. Depending on the administered dosages and the presence of renal dysfunction, aplastic anemia, granulocytopenia, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia may also occur. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are additional but rare side effects. The hepatic P450 cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme metabolizes colchicine, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp; also known as multidrug resistance protein-1; MDR1) efflux pump in the liver and kidneys removes it. The MDR1 gene, encoding P-gp, and specific MDR1 polymorphisms have been associated with elevated P-gp expression and decreased serum colchicine concentrations. Consequently, drugs strongly inhibiting CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, such as clarithromycin, fenofibrate, cyclosporine, and antifungals like itraconazole and ketoconazole, should be avoided, as they increase colchicine concentrations. Amiodarone, carvedilol, verapamil, and diltiazem may impede clearance, necessitating lower doses. While statins are generally well-tolerated, combining colchicine with atorvastatin has been linked to rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and in the elderly. Hemodialysis patients require dose reduction. Toxicity symptoms of colchicine typically resolve within a week to several months after discontinuation.

Data from patient studies indicate the safety of colchicine use during the peripartum period and breastfeeding. However, there is controversy regarding its effects on sperm production and function despite the belief that paternal exposure is consistent

### Extent of medication use in breastfeeding women [^113AynmQ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The types of and extent to which medications are used by breastfeeding women have not been thoroughly investigated in the United States. The relationship between medication use during pregnancy and lactation has also been insufficiently investigated.

Methods

A survey was given to a cohort of women who delivered their babies at a single center. The participants were asked to record the medications they had taken during pregnancy and subsequently were contacted each month during lactation to determine what medications they had taken.

Results

Breastfeeding women took significantly more medications per month than pregnant women (p < 0.0001). Women who were breastfeeding also took prescription medications more frequently than women who were pregnant (p < 0.0001). The number of medications taken per month showed no trend throughout the course of breastfeeding. The medications most often used by breastfeeding women were multivitamins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, progestins, antimicrobials, and decongestants. Over a third of the subjects took medications rated possibly or probably unsafe, or had unknown safety.

Conclusion

The women in this study took more prescription and nonprescription medications while breastfeeding than they did during pregnancy. Many of the medications taken have unknown safety for the breastfed infant. The results of this study should direct further research toward determining the safety of medications commonly used during lactation and to promote the labeling of these medications.

### Evaluation of the safety of drugs and biological products used during lactation: workshop summary [^114gA2tu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

This report serves as a summary of a 2-day public workshop sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the safety of drugs and biological products used during lactation. The aim of the workshop was to provide a forum to discuss the collection of data to inform the potential risks to breastfed infants with maternal use of medications during lactation. Discussions included the review of current approaches to collect data on medications used during lactation, and the considerations for future approaches to design and guide clinical lactation studies. This workshop is part of continuing efforts to raise the awareness of the public for women who choose to breastfeed their infants.

### Safe recovery after cesarean in rural Africa: technical consensus guidelines for post-discharge care [^116rgGRx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

3.1.4 Personal hygiene and nutrition

During the postpartum period, good hygiene practices are essential. The TAG discussed concerns about home WASH conditions and the association of WASH conditions and risk of surgical site infections (Hakizimana et al. submitted for publication); therefore, some instructions specifically emphasize the importance of safe water sources for bathing. The instructions also provide a list of commonly available sanitary products that are safe to use and recommendations to change their pads/pieces of cloth regularly throughout the day. The instructions recommend that women maintain a nutritious diet including a variety of different food groups in order to return to/maintain normal bowel function and to support breastfeeding. The TAG discussed the importance of recognizing traditional and local practices around diet and personal hygiene and incorporating these into adaptations of these instructions, either emphasizing practices that facilitate recovery or pausing practices that may delay recovery.

3.1.5 Breast care and breastfeeding

Promoting exclusive breastfeeding practices, as is endorsed in Rwanda, reduces risks of newborn mortality and morbidity, and improves postpartum health outcomes. Women who deliver by cesarean are more likely to delay breastfeeding initiation and should be offered additional breastfeeding and milk production counseling support at each postpartum contact. The instructions provide some specific tips for successful breastfeeding after cesarean. The TAG members emphasized that these may need to be modified for women who have experienced pregnancy complications or who have pre‐existing health conditions. Local practices for breast care and breastfeeding, such as special foods and local herbs to encourage milk production and nursing, could be incorporated into these instructions. Further, healthcare worker‐led and community health worker (CHW) ‐led strategies to support early and successful breastfeeding are critical both for women who deliver by cesarean or vaginally and for their infants.

3.1.6 Family planning

Birth spacing is recommended for optimal outcomes for women and newborns; this is particularly important for women who give birth via cesarean to allow for full healing at the uterine surgical incision. In Rwanda, nearly a quarter of women adopted a family planning method before discharge and an additional two‐thirds plan to engage during subsequent visits. The discharge instructions emphasize the importance of birth spacing and family planning counseling.

### Infant feeding practices and parental perceptions during the 2022 United States infant formula shortage crisis [^114Gabbe]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, parents were asked to rate the activities that were commonly posted on social media parent groups that could be most helpful in supporting families feed their infants in the near future. The highest rated activities were lactation education during pregnancy (61.3%), followed by online websites that describe brands that are similar and meet each infant's unique health need (59.7%), and postpartum lactation support (59.2%). These findings suggest that parents from this cohort agree that universal breastfeeding education and support are important to optimally feed infants. These findings are consistent with numerous systematic reviews that demonstrate prenatal and postpartum breastfeeding support increase the initiation, duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding (34–37).

We propose a call to action for the implementation of healthcare and government policies that prioritize lactation support and access to banked donor milk. Breastfeeding and human milk feeding are the most nutritious, safe, and reliable sources of food for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend exclusive breastfeeding (or feeding mother's expressed milk) for the first six months of age or use of banked donor milk if mother's own milk is unavailable. Most (84.1%) U.S. families reported ever feeding breast milk to their infants, although the rate of exclusive breastfeeding drastically decreases to 46.9% and 25.6% at 3 and 6 months of age. These data suggest that while most parents aim to meet national and international health recommendations to exclusively breastfeed their infants until 6 months of age, they are unable or choose not to. The Surgeon General's report on breastfeeding and other research have highlighted inadequate paid family and medical leave policies that prevent women from having the time and support to initiate and sustain breastfeeding; a lack of flexibility and privacy for mothers to breastfeed or pump while at work; and difficultly affording lactation services, which are not part of standard care, as explanations for the suboptimal breastfeeding rates in the U.S. All people should be able to choose the feeding method that is best suited for their family — whether that be breastfeeding, formula feeding, or a combination — however, lower-income women often do not have the ability to make that choice, and they are more likely to rely on infant formula than breastfeeding or to start their children on formula earlier than planned. Protecting infant nutrition and food security, requires systemic changes to workplace and healthcare policies that support breastfeeding and ensure equitable and reliable access to banked donor milk.

### Colchicine [^112FRm5E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature on colchicine use in pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Colchicine crosses the human placenta. Although animal reproductive and developmental studies were not conducted with colchicine, published animal reproduction and development studies indicate that colchicine causes embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity, and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range.

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnant women with rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's disease, or Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)) treated with colchicine at therapeutic doses during pregnancy. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Colchicine is present in human milk (see Data). Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for colchicine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from colchicine or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

Human data

Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate that colchicine is present in breastmilk. A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children. In a prospective observational cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine-exposed breastfed infants.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicated that infertility from colchicine is rare and may be reversible.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Gout is rare in pediatric patients; the safety and effectiveness of colchicine in pediatric patients has not been evaluated in controlled studies.

Counseling and screening — clinicians are told that all families should be counseled about safe sleep, that information and counseling about safe bedsharing should be provided even to parents for whom bedsharing should be discouraged because parents may bedshare anyway (even unintentionally), and that conversations should be nonjudgmental; open‑ended questions that have been found to be successful include "What are your plans for where your baby will sleep?", "What does that sleep area look like?", and "Does your baby ever end up in bed with you?"; ending stigma around bedsharing and educating all parents about safe bedsharing are described as having the potential to reduce infant deaths.

### Colchicine [^116GDtbA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colchicine's effectiveness as a treatment for gout has been postulated to be due to its ability to block neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses induced by monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid. Colchicine disrupts the polymerization of β-tubulin into microtubules, thereby preventing the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Colchicine also interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In healthy adults, colchicine when given orally reached a mean Cmaxof 3 ng/mL in 1.3 h (range 0.7 to 2.5 h) after 0.6 mg single dose administration.

Absolute bioavailability is reported to be approximately 45%.

Administration with food has no effect on the rate or extent of colchicine absorption.

Colchicine is not effectively removed by hemodialysis.

Distribution Colchicine has a mean apparent volume of distribution in healthy young volunteers of approximately 5 to 8 L/kg. Colchicine binding to serum protein is about 39%, primarily to albumin. Colchicine crosses the placenta and distributes into breast milk [see Pregnancy (8.1) and Lactation (8.2)].

Metabolism

A published in vitro human liver microsome study showed that about 16% of colchicine is metabolized to 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine (2- and 3-DMC, respectively) by CYP3A4. Glucuronidation is also believed to be a metabolic pathway for colchicine.

Excretion

In a published study in healthy volunteers, 40 to 65% of the total absorbed dose of colchicine (1 mg administered orally) was recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion are also believed to play a role in colchicine elimination. Colchicine is a substrate of P-gp and P-gp efflux is postulated to play an important role in colchicine disposition. Elimination half-life in humans was found to be 31 h (range 21.7 to 49.9 h).

### Call to action for equitable access to human milk for vulnerable infants [^112fBWx6]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

There are a number of important ethical considerations that policymakers, regulators, health workers, and mothers must consider in facilitating and navigating supportive breastfeeding environments, including the provision of human milk within different socioeconomic contexts.

Ethical challenges include the commercialisation of donor human milk for profit and exploitation of women in low-income settings selling breastmilk — where detrimental to their own child's health — for purchase by consumers in high-income settings; managing risks associated with peer-to-peer sharing and selling of unscreened human milk; weighing trade-offs for increasing screening of donors to ensure milk safety with increasing supply to address unmet need; potential risks that donor's own infants are not optimally breastfed; and determining how best to prioritise provision of donor human milk in times of scarcity. A crucial and overriding challenge is ensuring the appropriate use of donor milk so that it serves as a bridge to support breastfeeding, rather than displacing a mother's own milk and breastfeeding.

To address these challenges, the Ethox Centre of the University of Oxford and PATH convened a working group — the Oxford-PATH Human Milk Working Group — of technical and policy experts in nutrition, human milk banking, human rights, bioethics, and maternal, newborn, and child health to develop ethical guidance in support of safe and equitable access to human milk and breastfeeding for vulnerable infants. Participants shared perspectives from Australia, France, Germany, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, UK, USA, and Vietnam. The working group identified cross-cutting ethical considerations and key actions that should be addressed as part of global and regional responses to donor milk policy and guideline development (panel).

The working group calls on global, regional, and country-level policy and regulatory bodies to establish governance mechanisms and enact legislation for the safe and ethical use of donor human milk in a way that also protects, promotes, and supports breastfeeding — similar to the policies established to guide the safe, ethical use of medical products of human origin. These standards and policies are urgently needed to inform the development and operations of donor human milk programmes at the national, regional, and global levels. By heeding this call, we can work together to protect breastfeeding and safe, equitable access to human milk for vulnerable infants, and for all infants and young children globally.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^1171DzZr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication use during breastfeeding: The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 1 year. Because women with RMD may experience disease flare post partum and require treatment, it is important to balance benefits of disease control with risk of infant exposure through breast milk, and infant serum levels of drugs ingested by the mother depend on drug concentration in breast milk, quantity of breast milk ingested, and drug absorption through the infant's gastrointestinal tract.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation [^112a3bdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

NSAIDs and anti-platelet drugs

Recommendations were based on NICE guidance, four systematic reviews, a case report/review, UKTIS, LactMed and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, as shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Discordant findings from retrospective, large studies with population controls on the use of NSAIDs in the first trimester of pregnancy raise the possibility of a low risk of miscarriage and malformation. Therefore, these drugs should only be used intermittently in the first trimester of pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 97.3).
Intermittent rather than regular use of all non-selective NSAIDs except LDA is recommended throughout pregnancy and weaned from end of second trimester (26 weeks) to stop by gestational week 30 to avoid premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (GRADE 1B, SOA 98).
At present there are limited data on selective COX-2 inhibitors; they should therefore be avoided during pregnancy (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.5).
Non-selective NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) are compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 1C, SOA 98.8).

Recommendations for low-dose aspirin and clopidogrel in pregnancy and breastfeeding

LDA of ≤ 150 mg/day may be continued throughout pregnancy and NICE guidelines (2019) for hypertension in pregnancy advise treatment with LDA (for prophylaxis of pre-eclampsia) until delivery (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.0).
LDA is compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 99.8).
There are limited data on clopidogrel but it may be considered where alternative drugs are not suitable in pregnancy and breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 96.3).

Colchicine and dapsone

Recommendations were based on and, as shown in Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for colchicine and dapsone in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Colchicine therapy may be considered during pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 99.5).
Dapsone may be used in pregnancy (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.0).
Colchicine may be used in breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.3).
Dapsone may be used in breastfeeding and due to the risk of haemolytic anaemia it is advised to monitor the infant for signs of haemolysis, especially in newborn or premature breastfed infants (GRADE 2C, SOA 90.7).

### Technical report: breastfeeding and the use of human milk [^114RTRKF]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding make breastfeeding or the provision of human milk a public health imperative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately 6 months after birth. Furthermore, the AAP supports continued breastfeeding, along with appropriate complementary foods introduced at about 6 months, as long as mutually desired by mother and child for 2 years or beyond. These recommendations are consistent with those of the World Health Organization (WHO). Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. The AAP recommends that birth hospitals or centers implement maternity care practices shown to improve breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The Joint Commission monitor breastfeeding practices in United States hospitals. Pediatricians play a critical role in hospitals, their practices, and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and, thus, need to be trained about the benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and children and in managing breastfeeding. Efforts to improve breastfeeding rates must acknowledge existing disparities and the impact of racism in promoting equity in breastfeeding education, support, and services.

### Disparities in hospital-reported breast milk use in neonatal intensive care units-United States, 2015 [^1124oMTj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

AAP recommends breast milk as the primary source of nutrition for infants, and supports equal access to donor breast milk based on medical necessity for all high-risk infants when mother's milk is unavailable. The 2011 Surgeon General's Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding recommends that stakeholders "identify and address obstacles to greater availability of safe banked donor milk for fragile infants". Interventions aimed at increasing the use of breast milk in NICUs among hospitals serving higher percentage black patient populations might help reduce some of the disparities observed in this analysis. Health care providers can play a role in facilitating initiation of breastfeeding or breast milk expression after birth. Hospitals can ensure that policies and staff member training are in place to support provision of breast milk specific to high-risk infants. Safe and equitable access to milk from donor banks is also a factor in ensuring that all high-risk infants receive optimal nutrition. Understanding policies and practices at hospitals with higher breast milk use in the NICU might help inform interventions to increase its use in other facilities. Further investigation into cultural and community practices and preferences related to breast milk might also help in understanding differences in its use.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^114aeJmE]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The guideline

Drugs are considered in the following categories: pain management; NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin in the management of multisystem rheumatic disease; anticoagulants; bisphosphonates; anti-hypertensive medication in the management of multisystem rheumatic disease; and pulmonary vasodilators. The overall findings for maternal and foetal breastmilk exposures to each drug, including information and key references from the previous BSR guideline are summarised in the full-length guideline and updated recommendations listed below. Paternal exposures and recommendations are described separately after maternal data. An overall summary of compatibility of each drug pre-conception, during pregnancy, breastmilk exposure and paternal exposure is shown in Table 2. Generic recommendations were developed based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online.

Table 2.
Summary of drug compatibility in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Generic recommendations on prescribing in rheumatic disease in pregnancy

Pre-conception counselling should be addressed by all healthcare professionals, with referral to professionals with relevant experience as appropriate to optimise all therapy, including non-pharmacological options for chronic pain management during pregnancy (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5).
The risks and benefits of drug treatment to mother and foetus should be discussed and clearly documented by all healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care (GRADE 1A, SOA 99).
The cause of pain and other symptoms should be assessed and managed appropriately (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5).
The requirement for analgesia should be assessed and minimum effective dose should be prescribed and titrated according to response (GRADE 1B, SOA 100).
Tricyclic antidepressants are preferred over other antidepressant medications to manage chronic pain (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.1).
Cessation of anti-depressant therapy that is being used as chronic pain medication in the post-natal period is not recommended, due to the risk of adverse impact on mood (GRADE 1C, SOA 96).
LDA (≤ 150 mg/day) is recommended in all patients at high risk for pre-eclampsia (GRADE 1A, SOA 99.5).
Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant (GRADE 1A, SOA 100).
Nifedipine is the preferred vasodilator (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.5).
Paternal drug exposure may reduce male fertility but has not been associated with adverse foetal development or pregnancy outcome. Although evidence is weak, we recommend that men are reassured about the safety of fathering a pregnancy whilst taking medicines to manage comorbidities as described in this guideline (GRADE 1C, SOA 98).

### Prescription medication use | Breastfeeding special circumstances… [^113brBi4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or infant well-being. A few medications should be avoided while breastfeeding. Mothers should talk with their health care provider about medications or supplements they take and medications to avoid. Prescription medications while breastfeeding It is usually safe for mothers to use prescription medications while breastfeeding. A 2013 clinical report by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates that most medications and immunizations are safe to use while breastfeeding. According to the AAP, health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to breastfeeding mothers. Consider the following:

- Need for the drug by the mother.
- Potential effects of the drug on milk production.
- Amount of the drug excreted into human milk.
- Extent of oral absorption by the breastfeeding infant.
- Possible adverse effects on the breastfeeding infant.
- Age of the infant.
- Proportion of feedings that are breast milk. More information The U. S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health maintains LactMed®. LactMed® is a database of information on drugs and other chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. LactMed® includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the nursing infant. The database also provides alternatives to those drugs where appropriate. All data come from scientific literature and are referenced. A peer review panel reviews the data for scientific validity and whether it is the most current information. The Organization of Teratology Information Specialists provides information on the risks and safety of taking medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^116b7A8S]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Methotrexate — pregnancy and lactation: Methotrexate use is contraindicated during pregnancy, and it is essential for women of child-bearing age to be on contraception while taking methotrexate. Fetal abnormalities have been reported after exposure at all gestational ages, but the critical period for teratogenic effects appears to be within the first 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy. If a female patient wishes to become pregnant after methotrexate therapy, she should wait at least 3 months after discontinuation to ensure clearance from the liver and other tissues. Methotrexate has been detected in human milk, there is potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, and methotrexate is therefore contraindicated in nursing mothers.

### From inception to concePTION: genesis of a network to support better monitoring and communication of medication safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding [^116uNfvq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

More than 200 million women worldwide become pregnant every year, and a majority take at least one medication during pregnancy. However, merely 5% of available medications have been adequately monitored, tested, and labeled with safety information for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have long been overlooked in medical research, especially in randomized controlled clinical trials, due to complex practical, ethical, and legal challenges. Since the 2000s, data generated in routine healthcare have been increasingly used and recognized as a valuable source for evidence generation, offering the possibility of filling evidence gaps left by randomized controlled clinical trials and rendering the lack of information on pregnancy and breastfeeding even more untenable from ethical, medical, and societal perspectives. In 2019, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) funded the ConcePTION project — Building an ecosystem for better monitoring and communicating safety of medicines use in pregnancy and breastfeeding: validated and regulatory endorsed workflows for fast, optimised evidence generation — with the vision that there is a societal obligation to rapidly reduce uncertainty about the safety of medication use in pregnancy and breastfeeding. ConcePTION aims to contribute to filling the knowledge gap regarding the effects of medicines in pregnancy and lactation, by developing a system across European Data Access Providers (DAPs) that transforms existing and routinely collected healthcare data into evidence in a robust and transparent manner.
