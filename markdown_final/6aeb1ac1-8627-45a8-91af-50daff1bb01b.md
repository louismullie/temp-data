## Question

Asthma diagnostic criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic principle and why objective confirmation is necessary. Then, I should verify the core clinical features that raise suspicion. Next, I will examine objective tests and their thresholds, including spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility, peak flow variability, and bronchial challenge testing. After that, I need to consider inflammatory biomarkers and how to integrate them without overreliance. I will then review age-specific nuances for preschoolers, school-aged children, and adults, including the asthma–COPD overlap. Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds, address misdiagnosis risks, and outline a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm with escalation and referral triggers.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: asthma diagnosis requires both a characteristic symptom pattern and objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and I should avoid diagnosing asthma on symptoms alone because misdiagnosis is common and objective testing is often not performed at the time of initial diagnosis, which leads to over- and underdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment [^115ppn5R] [^114qc2CP] [^114NUYEd].

> Wait, let me verify the core clinical features that should trigger testing: symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and intensity, are often worse at night or on waking, are triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air, and viral infections, and may worsen after exercise. Importantly, symptoms alone are insufficient for diagnosis and must be paired with objective evidence of variability in lung function [^115ppn5R] [^1148j9QB].

> I will now examine objective confirmation of variable airflow limitation. Let me think about the hierarchy of tests and thresholds. Spirometry with bronchodilator responsiveness is preferred, with a positive test defined as an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL from baseline; if spirometry is not available, peak expiratory flow variability of at least 20% over two weeks can support the diagnosis, and bronchial challenge testing with methacholine or mannitol can be used when baseline tests are non-diagnostic, recognizing that a positive challenge indicates airway hyperresponsiveness consistent with asthma but is not absolutely specific [^112HHJDS] [^115ppn5R].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of inflammatory biomarkers. FeNO and blood eosinophils can support a type 2 inflammatory phenotype and predict ICS responsiveness, but they should not be used in isolation to make or exclude asthma, and combining multiple biomarkers to create a composite score is discouraged by ERS because it does not improve diagnostic accuracy. FeNO has high specificity but limited sensitivity and can be reduced by smoking and obesity, so a normal FeNO does not rule out asthma [^112FhH3v] [^1142WTpr] [^112bqJrr].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances. For preschool children aged 5 years and under, objective testing is often not feasible, so diagnosis relies on a clinical triad of recurrent wheezing episodes, absence of a likely alternative explanation, and a timely clinical response to bronchodilator and/or a short ICS trial, documenting suspected asthma if only one or two criteria are met and reassessing over time as new information emerges [^111nvJAc] [^114Q38Cr].

> For school-aged children 6 years and older, I should confirm that spirometry with bronchodilator testing is recommended whenever feasible, with PEF monitoring as an alternative if spirometry is unavailable. I need to ensure technique and quality control, and if initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high, proceed to bronchial challenge testing or repeat testing after withholding controllers when safe, recognizing that pediatric diagnostic evidence quality varies and guideline thresholds differ across societies [^115ppn5R] [^112w4CDg] [^1122rhJL].

> In adults, I should double-check that spirometry with reversibility is the primary objective test, with bronchial challenge testing reserved for cases with normal spirometry but persistent suspicion. I must also screen smokers or former smokers with more than 10 pack-years for COPD or asthma–COPD overlap, where treatment principles diverge and ICS-containing therapy is essential if asthma features are present because LABA or LAMA monotherapy increases risk of severe exacerbations and death in asthma [^113LT73i] [^116CWKoD] [^113Qv6Zb].

> But wait, what if the patient already has an established diagnosis and is on therapy? I need to ensure that I do not rely on a single negative test to overturn the diagnosis, because ICS can blunt bronchodilator responsiveness and FeNO, and many treated patients with asthma will not meet classic reversibility thresholds. In such cases, step-down or supervised washout may be required to confirm the diagnosis, and I should also reassess for alternative or overlapping conditions and confirm that severe asthma criteria are truly met before escalating therapy [^112nbLGt] [^115nG8db] [^116Q6oe7].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds and avoid overinterpreting borderline results. A bronchodilator response of at least 12% and 200 mL increase in FEV1 remains the conventional diagnostic criterion, while PEF variability of at least 20% supports the diagnosis, and bronchial challenge positivity indicates hyperresponsiveness. However, no single test is both highly sensitive and specific, and guideline concordance is only moderate, reinforcing the need for a compound diagnostic approach and, when needed, referral for specialized testing [^112HHJDS] [^116u1DvE] [^111mun6e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity or control. I need to ensure that I distinguish difficult-to-treat asthma from true severe asthma by verifying adherence, inhaler technique, and environmental triggers before labeling severe disease, and I should use validated control tools and exacerbation history to classify control and risk, recognizing that severity is dynamic and control-based management supersedes static severity categories [^116Q6oe7] [^113wtdLv] [^1112ugx6].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm: start with a careful history to identify characteristic symptom patterns and triggers, then perform objective testing with spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness when feasible. If spirometry is unavailable, use PEF monitoring. If results are negative but suspicion remains, proceed to bronchial challenge. Integrate FeNO or blood eosinophils as supportive, not decisive, evidence. If diagnosis remains uncertain, consider a closely monitored therapeutic trial with reassessment of symptoms and lung function, and refer for specialist evaluation when diagnostic uncertainty persists or alternative diagnoses are suspected [^115spWrp] [^1148j9QB] [^116eJ6HV].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing verification and a treatable traits mindset. Asthma is heterogeneous and may evolve, so I should periodically reassess the diagnosis, especially in children and in patients not responding as expected, and tailor therapy to phenotypic and mechanistic features such as eosinophilic inflammation, smoking, obesity, and comorbidities, aligning treatment with patient goals and local resource constraints [^111mun6e] [^114uR6NB] [^112WXZFZ].

Asthma diagnosis requires a **clinical pattern of variable respiratory symptoms** (wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough) with **objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^115ppn5R] [^112FhH3v]. In adults and children ≥ 6 years, confirm variability with spirometry showing a **≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL increase in FEV1 after bronchodilator** [^112HHJDS], or with a positive bronchial challenge, excessive PEF variability, or a significant FEV1 rise after a trial of ICS [^115ppn5R]. In children ≤ 5 years, diagnose based on recurrent wheeze, symptom response to bronchodilator or ICS, and exclusion of alternatives, as objective testing is often not feasible [^111nvJAc] [^114Q38Cr]. Avoid diagnosing asthma on symptoms alone; **confirm with objective testing when possible** [^112FhH3v] [^115MUAss].

---

## Clinical features and symptom patterns

Asthma presents with **recurrent respiratory symptoms** that vary over time and in intensity [^115ppn5R]. Typical symptoms include:

- **Wheeze**: High-pitched whistling sound during expiration [^113UCPWu].
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath, often exertional or nocturnal [^115ppn5R].
- **Chest tightness**: Sensation of constriction or pressure in the chest [^115ppn5R].
- **Cough**: Particularly at night or early morning, often dry or with minimal sputum production [^115ppn5R].

These symptoms are often triggered by **exercise, allergens, cold air, viral infections, or emotional stress** [^115ppn5R]. A positive family history of asthma or atopy and personal history of allergic conditions (e.g. eczema, allergic rhinitis) further support the diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation

Objective confirmation of variable airflow limitation is **essential** for a definitive asthma diagnosis [^115ppn5R]. The following tests are commonly used:

| **Test** | **Diagnostic criteria** |
|-|-|
| Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility | ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL increase in FEV1 after bronchodilator administration [^112HHJDS] |
| Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability | - Diurnal variation > 20% <br/> - Or significant improvement after bronchodilator [^112HHJDS] |
| Bronchial challenge tests (methacholine or mannitol) | - PC20 methacholine < 8 mg/mL <br/> - Or PD15 mannitol < 635 mg [^notfound] |
| Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) | Elevated levels (> 25 ppb in adults, > 20 ppb in children) indicate eosinophilic inflammation [^notfound] |

---

## Age-specific diagnostic considerations

### Adults and adolescents (≥ 6 years)

In adults and adolescents, **objective testing is essential** [^1148j9QB]. Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility is the **preferred initial test** [^1142WTpr]. If spirometry is inconclusive, bronchial challenge tests or PEF monitoring may be used to confirm variable airflow limitation [^115ppn5R].

---

### Children ≤ 5 years

Objective testing is often not feasible in young children; therefore, diagnosis relies on clinical judgment and response to therapy [^113ze1Ms]. Criteria include:

- **Recurrent wheezing episodes**: At least two episodes of wheezing lasting > 24 hours, with wheezing confirmed during at least one episode [^111nvJAc].
- **Symptom variability**: Symptoms vary over time and in intensity [^115ppn5R].
- **Response to bronchodilator or ICS**: Clinical improvement after bronchodilator administration or a trial of ICS therapy [^111nvJAc].
- **Exclusion of alternative diagnoses**: No likely alternative explanation for symptoms [^113ze1Ms].

---

## Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

It is essential to exclude alternative diagnoses that may mimic asthma, such as:

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Particularly in smokers or former smokers [^116CWKoD].
- **Upper airway cough syndrome**: Chronic cough due to upper airway inflammation [^notfound].
- **Vocal cord dysfunction**: Paradoxical vocal cord motion causing respiratory symptoms [^113UCPWu].
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Acid reflux triggering respiratory symptoms [^112WXZFZ].
- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic bronchial infection with airway dilation [^114G2bgW].

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

Asthma diagnosis requires:

- **Clinical features**: Recurrent respiratory symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough) with variability over time and intensity [^115ppn5R].
- **Objective evidence**: Documented variable expiratory airflow limitation using spirometry, PEF monitoring, or bronchial challenge tests [^115ppn5R].
- **Exclusion of alternatives**: Rule out other conditions that may mimic asthma symptoms [^111tzDXu].

---

Asthma diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical features and objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, with age-specific considerations and exclusion of alternative diagnoses [^1148j9QB].

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (eg, lack of blinding or of a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures. The need to downgrade the evidence should be a clarion call to investigators to use standardized and validated outcome measures that were outlined in the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012). This single activity will create more robust evidence to support recommendations in the future.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Asthma differentials and clues in medical history

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

### What is severe asthma? [^117J79aC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is common, and some individuals are severely affected by it. Learned institutions have sought to provide a definition of 'severe asthma' to facilitate research and clinical care. This is a challenging undertaking given the difficulty in defining asthma and the lack of supportive evidence for a distinct severe asthma phenotype. In this review, we discuss the rationale for a definition of severe asthma and the relative merits of the sequential attempts that have been made to produce such a definition. The difficulty in disentangling control and severity is highlighted, as is the heterogeneity of phenotype in severe asthma, and potential for misclassification. We conclude that the search for a singular definition of severe asthma is problematic, though likely to continue. We suggest the alternative strategy of using classifiers with a specific aim related to symptoms, pathophysiology or service provision.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112sAac7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths of the Working Definition

The obvious merit of our working definition is that it integrates impairment with risk, alluding to more longitudinal assessments of patients, as opposed to cross-sectional assessments of control in some of the existing definitions. The intent of proposing this working definition is to provide a starting point for future research in this space.

The panel emphasized that it is imperative to first confirm the asthma diagnosis. Diagnostic challenges noted in the general asthma population most certainly pertain to mild asthma as well, and the role of available tests needs to be reevaluated carefully, as is being done in parallel efforts.

As intended, our working definition captures patients with the mildest manifestations of disease and addresses needs in both the clinical and research arenas. Our definition also clearly focused on the influence of treatment on severity classification. In the survey, when participants were asked if the symptom and exacerbation thresholds needed to be met only while patients were off treatment, 36% disagreed, and 50% conceded that this would be impossible to implement, as it would require patients and family members to recall remote asthma history, and asthma severity can change over time. Thus, an elevated risk of recall bias makes this infeasible. Hence, although not unanimous but based on a clear majority of opinion, our definition included severity assessment on specific low-intensity asthma therapies or patients with low impairment plus low risk while off any treatment.

### Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the overlap syndrome [^113sd9de]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases in the general population. Both are characterized by heterogeneous chronic airway inflammation and airway obstruction. In both conditions, chronic inflammation affects the whole respiratory tract, from central to peripheral airways, with different inflammatory cells recruited, different mediators produced, and thus differing responses to therapy. Airway obstruction is typically intermittent and reversible in asthma but is progressive and largely irreversible in COPD. However, there is a considerable pathologic and functional overlap between these 2 heterogeneous disorders, particularly among the elderly, who may have components of both diseases (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). The definitions for asthma and COPD recommended by current guidelines are useful but limited because they do not illustrate the full spectrum of obstructive airway diseases that is encountered in clinical practice. Defining asthma and COPD as separate entities neglects a considerable proportion of patients with overlapping features and is largely based on expert opinion rather than on the best current evidence. The presence of different phenotypes or components of obstructive airway diseases, therefore, needs to be addressed to individualize and optimize treatment to achieve the best effect with the fewest side effects for the patient. Although specific interventions vary by disease, the treatment goals of obstructive airway diseases are similar and driven primarily by the need to control symptoms, optimize health status, and prevent exacerbations.

### Asthma: defining of the persistent adult phenotypes [^115VFx2t]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The common disease asthma is probably not a single disease, but rather a complex of multiple, separate syndromes that overlap. Although clinicians have recognised these different phenotypes for many years, they have remained poorly characterised, with little known about the underlying pathobiology contributing to them. Development of targeted therapies for asthma, and phenotype-specific clinical trials have raised interest in these phenotypes. Improved understanding of these phenotypes in complex diseases such as asthma will also improve our ability to link specific genotypes to their associated disease, which should help development of biomarkers. However, there is no standardised method to define asthma phenotypes. This Review analyses some of the methods that have been used to define asthma phenotypes and proposes an integrated method of classification to improve our understanding of these phenotypes.

### Treatment of overlapping asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can guidelines contribute in an evidence-free zone? [^1162wkJw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In their most typical forms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clearly distinguishable, but many patients with chronic airflow limitation demonstrate features of both conditions and have worse health outcomes than those with either disease alone. This has been called the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), but as yet, it lacks a precise definition. However, given the different pathways by which a patient can come to demonstrate features of both asthma and COPD, ACOS is not thought to represent a single disease but to include several heterogeneous phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. These issues have important implications for guidelines because some existing treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD are in conflict, and patients with both asthma and COPD have specifically been excluded from major pharmacologic trials. As a result, there is little evidence at present to support specific treatment recommendations for ACOS on the basis of efficacy or effectiveness, yet these patients continue to present for diagnosis and management, mainly in primary care. This article highlights the need for clinical guidance about ACOS, summarizes recommendations about its diagnosis and treatment from a sample of national asthma and COPD guidelines, and proposes a way forward, as suggested in a collaborative Global Initiative for Asthma/Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report, to provide health professionals with interim recommendations about syndromic recognition and initial treatment based on both potential effectiveness and potential risk. Additional research in broad populations is urgently needed to develop a precise definition for ACOS, characterize its phenotypes, and identify opportunities for targeted treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1148j9QB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^11366U2k]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a meta-epidemiological study of paediatric asthma CPGs published between February 2011 and September 2022 using a systematic approach. There are no formal reporting standards for meta-epidemiological studies; therefore, this study followed a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

We assessed the quality and reporting of these CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. We evaluated the quality of evidence underpinning diagnostic testing recommendations using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

We searched Medline and Embase for paediatric asthma CPGs (see Supplementary File for search strategy). We also searched the following guideline repositories: Trip Database, Guidelines International Network, National Guideline Clearinghouse and WHO guidelines. We included guidelines from high-income countries with similar health systems to the United Kingdom, specifically Australia, Canada, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands, where GPs act as the gatekeepers to specialist paediatric care.

We included guidelines published or updated between February 2011 and September 2022. We also considered strategy documents as guidelines if they included diagnostic recommendations for clinicians. The most recently published guideline was used if multiple versions of a guideline existed. CPGs which (i) targeted children and adolescents with suspected asthma, (ii) related to primary care, and (iii) included diagnostic testing recommendations were eligible. Non-English language publications were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed all abstracts for potential inclusion, with discrepancies resolved by consensus and a third reviewer if required.

Data extraction

We extracted data on the country of origin, date of guideline publication and update. We also extracted the diagnostic tests included in each guideline and associated recommendations.

Assessment of guideline quality and reporting

Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality and reporting of included CPGs using the AGREE II tool. The guideline quality was assessed across 6 domains; scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, the rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. We calculated an aggregate score for each domain using the formula in the AGREE II guidance, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score (Supplementary File). A global quality score was given ranging from 1 (lowest quality) to 7 (highest quality). Any major discrepancies were resolved by discussion and a third author if required.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111M2Lvq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Remission of asthma — Remission of asthma can be identified in children and in adults, either clinical remission or complete remission, and either off-treatment or on-treatment, and definitions and criteria vary; the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for each patient. Research among patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off-treatment or on-treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding underlying mechanisms of asthma and to develop new approaches to asthma prevention and management, facilitated by standardized criteria and assessment tools. Take care if using the term 'remission' with patients or parents/caregivers, explain what you mean, and that if asthma symptoms have gone quiet for a while, they may recur.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115spWrp]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years in clinical practice outlines an approach for patients presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The algorithm begins by asking "Are symptoms typical of asthma?", then evaluates objective testing feasibility with "Is spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) available and feasible?" and directs to "Perform lung function test(s) as in Box 1–2, e.g. spirometry or PEF before and after bronchodilator" to determine whether "Is variable expiratory airflow limitation confirmed?". A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

### Asthma diagnosis and treatment: filling in the information gaps [^116WWbHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of asthma are based on guideline recommendations, which have provided a framework for the efforts. Asthma, however, is emerging as a heterogeneous disease, and these features need to be considered in both the diagnosis and management of this disease in individual patients. These diverse or phenotypic features add complexity to the diagnosis of asthma, as well as attempts to achieve control with treatment. Although the diagnosis of asthma is often based on clinical information, it is important to pursue objective criteria as well, including an evaluation for reversibility of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, an area with new diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, there exist a number of treatment gaps (ie, exacerbations, step-down care, use of antibiotics, and severe disease) in which new direction is needed to improve care. A major morbidity in asthmatic patients occurs with exacerbations and in patients with severe disease. Novel approaches to treatment for these conditions will be an important advance to reduce the morbidity associated with asthma.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^115Qbc6X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

- wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following): positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

Introduction

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) launched the first joint Guideline for asthma diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) and British Thoracic Society (BTS)in November 2024. Prior to this date BTS/SIGN and NICE had produced separate guidelines with differing recommendations in some areas. This article compares the key areas of diagnosis and pharmacological management in the BTS/NICE/SIGN Guideline with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy report 2024and the implications for international primary respiratory care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117WmeDa]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma diagnosis — GINA 2024 updates for clinical practice state that the diagnostic flowchart has been revised to accommodate limited access to spirometry, that peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry but better than relying on symptoms alone, and that the flowchart allows selection of different initial lung function tests with clarified criteria for variable expiratory airflow limitation and more details about bronchodilator withholding; GINA has not adopted the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society proposal to change bronchodilator responsiveness from an increase from baseline of ≥ 12% and 200 mL to > 10% predicted for diagnosis, noting the committee avoided diagnostic recommendations and that further population and outcome data will be considered.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the asthmas [^111mun6e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Optimizing asthma diagnosis is an essential part of global strategies to reduce the excessive illness burden from asthma. New understanding about how to address the complexity and heterogeneity of the different forms of asthma means that asthma diagnosis now requires a compound diagnostic approach and label. Eliciting the typical symptoms and abnormal physiology of variable airflow limitation permits the recognition of asthma, and the identification of further features, such as eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation, allows a compound diagnostic label of eosinophilic asthma. This conveys key information about future exacerbation risk and likely treatment responsiveness. Treatable traits are a useful way to implement this new approach to diagnosis. Targeted assessment is used to inform a specific treatment plan in a pragmatic and iterative process.

### Asthma-COPD overlap and chronic airflow obstruction: definitions, management, and unanswered questions [^114YbnTi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a common clinical presentation of chronic airways disease in which patients show some features usually associated with asthma, and some usually associated with COPD. There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a "treatable traits" approach to ACO management. Throughout the review, we highlight some of the pressing, unanswered questions surrounding ACO that are relevant to the clinical community. Ultimately, addressing these questions is necessary if we are to improve clinical outcomes for this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Classifying asthma [^116H9eNB]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The most widely known method of asthma classification is the severity classification recommended in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 1997 guidelines, which also formed the basis of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. This method was developed to direct a hierarchy of asthma therapy based on the patient's severity of disease. However, this severity classification has not been validated and has a number of limitations; in particular, it is challenging for physicians to apply reliably. Moreover, it does not allow asthma control to be assessed after the initiation of treatment, even though symptom control is a key objective of the treatment guidelines. A number of tools have been evaluated to provide longitudinal information on asthma control, and some of these have been validated. Clinically relevant measures of inflammation, such as eosinophilic airway inflammation, may also be helpful in classifying asthma and in guiding the use of antiinflammatory therapy. This may be a particularly useful approach in patients who are asymptomatic but have poor lung function, by permitting physicians to determine whether inflammatory processes are active, thus requiring ICS therapy. In the clinical setting, easy-to-use tools are needed to enable longitudinal assessments of symptom control and (ideally) disease progression.

Diagnosis of asthma in adults, young people and children age 5–16 (BTS/NICE/SIGN) and in adults, adolescents and children age 6–11(GINA)

Both BTS/NICE/SIGN and GINA documents emphasise that a diagnosis of asthma should be made on basis of a characteristic history and confirmed by objective evidence. However their recommendations for objective testing differ significantly.
BTS/NICE/SIGN: Emphasises tests for eosinophilic airway inflammation such as Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), blood eosinophil counts and (in children) skin-prick testing.
GINA: Focuses on identifying variable expiratory airflow limitation, primarily using spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility.

The recommended tests, criteria for positivity and recommended sequence of testing are shown in Fig. 1.

Objective tests for asthma in primary care and diagnostic criteria.

(in sequence if the previous test is negative).

FeNO testing has moderate sensitivity (reflecting the number of false negative results) in children and adults and high specificity (reflecting a low number of false positive results). The order of diagnostic tests recommended by BTS/NICE/SIGN is largely based on economic analysis derived from United Kingdom costs. However, as pointed out in the GINA strategy document, the sensitivity of FENO is reduced in smokersand obese individuals. Also it has questionable utility in identifying non-eosinophilic asthma which may account for 48% adults with asthma. Evidence regarding the diagnostic value of bronchodilator testing, particularly in children, remains surprisingly limited. The evidence shows that bronchodilator reversibility has high specificity, but low sensitivity in adults. (for example may be normal when a patient is asymptomatic) Peak flow variability also shows low sensitivity, but has very high specificity and is readily available in primary care internationally.

Definition

Advances in the understanding of severe asthma accelerated ∼20 years ago when severe asthma was recognized as a distinct grouping of entities. Severe asthma was specifically defined, first in 2000 by an American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop, then by the World Health Organization (for a more global definition with relevance to poorly developed and developing countries), and most recently by the European Respiratory Society (ERS)–ATS guidelines. Underlying obstructions with reversibility or reactivity, current or previous, remain at the heart of identifying severe asthma, such that confirmation of an asthma diagnosis, by original ATS definitions, is mandatory. This need to link to current or historical reversible obstruction is sometimes lost when evaluating symptomatic patients, despite guideline-appropriate therapy, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, lack of reversibility to normal should not invoke a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; rather, it is a hallmark of severe asthmatic disease.

Once an asthma diagnosis is established, ERS–ATS–defined severe asthma (Box 1) is "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (CSs), plus a second controller, to remain controlled or which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy". Control is defined by symptoms, exacerbations, and degree of obstruction. Yet the current severe asthma definition remains an umbrella definition. It can encompass smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers and a broad range of underlying pathobiologies or molecular phenotypes. Dissecting them is critical to improving treatment.

### Asthma-COPD overlap: review of diagnosis and management [^112qNXqg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are both commonly encountered respiratory conditions. The term asthma — COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to identify patients presenting with features of both conditions. Controversy exists regarding its definition, approach to diagnosis and management. In this publication, recent evidence has been reviewed that provides insight into diagnosis and management of this condition.

Recent Findings

Previously, multiple criteria were used to define Asthma — COPD overlap. In this publication, the most recent guidelines to identify this condition have been reviewed. This publication provides a summary of the recent evidence with regard to the role of various diagnostic modalities including the use of biomarkers, such as exhaled nitric oxide, serum IgE and provides updated evidence on available treatment choices for this condition.

Summary

ACO is a commonly encountered clinical condition with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations and resulting in increased healthcare resource utilization. Recent interest in ACO has led to development of a framework towards diagnosis and management of this condition. Therapeutic choices for ACO range from bronchodilator therapy to immunomodulatory therapy, highlighting the heterogeneity of this condition. Additional research is required to improve understanding of pathogenesis and improve outcomes in ACO.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

Clinical Implications

There are two main clinical implications from these findings. First, there is no specific cut point for any of the BDR criteria to clearly differentiate asthma from COPD in treated patients with long-standing disease. It is reasonable to conclude that the higher the degree of BDR, the greater the probability of asthma, with the caveat that most patients with asthma receiving ICS-containing treatment will not show BDR by any criteria, particularly on a single day of testing. For clinical practice, objective confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma in patients receiving treatment may require stepping down or cessation of ICS.

Second, the standard practice of requiring positive BDR as an inclusion criterion in major RCTs in asthma means that the evidence base derived from the RCTs is not generalizable to the management of the broad asthma population. Indeed, it has been reported that only a median of 6% of participants with current asthma receiving treatment met the eligibility criteria (including but not limited to BDR) for major asthma RCTs cited in the 2005 Global Initiative for Asthma strategy report. This indicates that most patients with current asthma receiving treatment in the community would not have been eligible for these RCTs. Similarly, only a median of 10% of patients with severe asthma were found to be eligible for enrollment in the phase III trials of biologic therapies because of the requirement for BDR and other criteria, indicating that the vast majority were excluded from trial participation by criteria designed to reconfirm questionable diagnostic labels rather than by biomarker criteria that predict responsiveness to treatment. Notably, in these studies, average BDR is typically 25% to 35% of baseline FEV 1, a level found in only a very small proportion of NOVELTY patients with a label of severe asthma. Comparable findings have been observed in COPD, in which over 90% of patients with COPD in the community who were taking medication did so on the basis of RCTs for which they would have not been eligible.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

Conclusions

Good-quality evidence is lacking to support the use of diagnostic tests in childhood asthma. Discrepant guideline recommendations based on the same evidence may contribute to poor clinician adherence to asthma guidelines and variation in testing practices. Therefore, guideline bodies should prioritise evidence to address the essential gaps and employ rigorous methods to identify all the best available evidence when making diagnostic recommendations for children with asthma.

### Diagnostic challenges of adult asthma [^1154QPyg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchial asthma is a common disorder that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Its signs and symptoms however, can be present in other pulmonary and/or airway diseases and therefore a careful workup of patients with respiratory symptoms that might be due to asthma is required to a) keep a broad differential diagnosis, especially in cases that do not respond well to standard antiasthmatic therapy and b) attempt to subphenotype patients within the syndrome of asthma to diagnose e.g. precipitating factors, inflammatory subtypes and comorbidities.

Recent Findings

The syndrome of asthma contains a number of different phenotypes that offer the possibility of personalized medicine based on the respective asthma phenotype. There are attempts to combine asthma and COPD in newly postulated overlap syndromes which this review discourages to do but instead, based on new and old information concerning asthma phenotyping, suggests to rule in comorbidities and rule out a number of other diseases that can mimick asthma clinically.

Summary

Bronchial asthma, although one of the most common respiratory diseases, can be mimicked by a number of other pulmonary and airway diseases, and especially patients with so called severe or treatment refractory asthma should receive a detailed diagnostic workup with a rather broad differential diagnosis.

### External validity of randomised controlled trials in asthma: to whom do the results of the trials apply? [^1155j7ad]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, not all of which may be encompassed in the subjects included in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This makes it difficult for clinicians to know to what extent the evidence derived from RCTs applies to a given patient.

Aim

To calculate the proportion of individuals with asthma who would have been eligible for the major asthma RCTs from the data of a random community survey of respiratory health.

Methods

A postal survey was sent to 3500 randomly selected individuals aged 25–75 years. Respondents were invited to complete a detailed respiratory questionnaire and pulmonary function testing. Participants with current asthma were assessed against the eligibility criteria of the 17 major asthma RCTs cited in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines.

Findings

A total of 749 participants completed the full survey, of whom 179 had current asthma. A median 4% of participants with current asthma (range 0–36%) met the eligibility criteria for the included RCTs. A median 6% (range 0–43%) of participants with current asthma on treatment met the eligibility criteria.

Interpretation

This study shows that the major asthma RCTs on which the GINA guidelines are based may have limited external validity as they have been performed on highly selected patient populations. Most of the participants with current asthma on treatment in the community would not have been eligible for these RCTs.

### A comparison of diagnostic consistency for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and clinical characteristics study [^112y7Eb6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is preventable, common, and treatable and is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease, characterised by variable symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and by variable expiratory airflow limitation. In some patients, chronic asthma cannot be clearly distinguished from COPD using currently available tests and techniques, and in those patients, it is assumed that asthma and COPD coexist. Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome has been coined to acknowledge that this represents an overlap of common disorders causing chronic airflow limitation rather than being a distinct syndrome. To avoid the impression that this is a single disease, the term ACOS is no longer advised; the descriptive term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) may be more appropriate. The prevalence rates of ACO range from 15 to 55%, with variation depending on sex and age. The wide range may be due to the different criteria used by different investigators. The prognosis of ACO is often worse than that of asthma or COPD alone, but the evidence for ACO treatment is very limited as few pharmacotherapy studies have examined this population. The different diagnostic criteria used in various regions and by different investigators might also limit the progress of ACO clinical studies. The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified. Previous studies have used their own respective standards, so there was a lack of evaluation among the ACO patients screened by each standard. Our study compared the consistency among seven different sets of ACO diagnostic criteria proposed by previous studies to examine the clinical characteristics of patients screened by different standards, aiming to provide more clinical evidence for ACO diagnosis.

### Defining asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113J1sKJ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Much interest has been given to the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) in the past 2 decades, but the condition is still ill-defined. There is general agreement that a patient with longstanding asthma who develops fixed airflow obstruction after years of smoking has ACO although defining asthma in the face of COPD can be challenging. Many features of asthma are also found in patients with COPD without indicating an overlap and no consensus exists on which characteristics should be included in the definition of ACO. Nevertheless, some guidance has been issued to help clinicians and researchers to make a diagnosis of ACO and these will be reviewed here.

### Considerations… [^113UCPWu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Diagnosing work-related asthma is based on a combination of medical and exposure history, physical examination, and medical tests such as pulmonary function tests. Physical examination
- Exam findings are typically non-specific.
- Patients with asthma often have normal physical examinations between asthma attacks.
- If wheezing is present, it is generally on expiration. However, sometimes wheezing might also be auscultated on inspiration. Temporary work furlough A short period away from work period can help diagnose patients you suspect have work-related asthma. When away, improvements in pulmonary function tests such as ambulatory peak expiratory flow or bronchial responsiveness measured by methacholine challenge support an occupational etiology. Differential diagnosis Some health conditions have symptoms similar to asthma.

In adults, the differential diagnosis of asthma includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Vocal cord dysfunction
- Obliterative bronchiolitis. Medical tests Pulmonary function tests The American Thoracic Society has guidelines on how to perform and interpret pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Bronchodilator reversibility testing for spirometry When spirometry results show a patient has airways obstruction, the next step is to assess reversibility with an inhaled bronchodilator. The presence of reversibility may support an asthma diagnosis. Nonspecific bronchial responsiveness If spirometry is normal but asthma is suspected, bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be assessed using nonspecific bronchial responsive testing.

Exhaled nitric oxide
- Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is a marker of allergic airways inflammation.
- The American Thoracic Society has guidelines on how to measure and interpret exhaled nitric oxide levels.
- Increased fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels support allergic asthma diagnosis but does not differentiate between work-related asthma and non-work related.
- A normal fractional exhaled nitric oxide level does not rule out work-related asthma. Other tests
- Serologic testing to measure IgE antibodies for specific allergens.
- Skin prick, patch, or intradermal testing to look for allergic reactions to specific substances. Some medical conditions can make asthma worse. Additionally, other tests are needed to evaluate for gastroesophogeal reflux and rhinosinusitis.

Asthma guideline consensus and recommendation strength definitions — strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel after it has reviewed all of the evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action, whereas conditional recommendations are those for which the Expert Panel believes that many informed people are likely to make different decisions about whether to take the recommended course of action, and a conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their health care providers. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation, and if less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation the topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### Asthma diagnosis: a comparison of established diagnostic guidelines in adults with respiratory symptoms [^116u1DvE]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Considerable variability exists between asthma diagnostic guidelines. We tested the performance characteristics of the European Respiratory Society (ERS), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines for the diagnosis of asthma in adults.

Methods

In this prospective observational study (ISRCTN — 11676160, May 2019–June 2022), participants referred from primary care with clinician-suspected asthma underwent comprehensive investigation including: spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, peak expiratory flow variability, bronchial challenge testing with methacholine and mannitol, and responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Results were reviewed by a panel of asthma specialists to determine asthma diagnosis (reference standard) and compared to each diagnostic test and the ERS, NICE and GINA diagnostic algorithms (index tests). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values were calculated.

Findings

One hundred and forty adults were enrolled and 118 given a definitive diagnostic outcome [75 female; mean (SD) age 36 (12) years; 70 (59%) with asthma] and included in the analysis. Sensitivity of individual tests was poor (15–62%), but they provided good specificity at the most stringent thresholds (range: 88–100%). The sensitivity/specificity of ERS, NICE and GINA was 81/85%, 41/100% and 47/100%, respectively. Concordance between guidelines was only moderate (Cohen's Kappa 0.45–0.51).

Interpretation

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of asthma in adults provide either excellent specificity but low sensitivity (GINA and NICE) or only reasonable sensitivity and specificity (ERS). All guidelines therefore have limitations with regards to their clinical application; new guidelines are needed but should be tested prospectively before roll out.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eJ6HV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Refer for specialized investigations — indications for referral: Referral for expert advice and further diagnostic evaluation is advised for patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite treatment, for diagnostic uncertainty (especially if an alternative diagnosis needs to be investigated), for patients with suspected asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggesting an additional pulmonary diagnosis, when chronic airways disease is suspected but syndromic features of either asthma or COPD are few, and for patients with comorbidities that may interfere with assessment and management. When atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggest an additional pulmonary diagnosis, this should prompt early referral, without waiting for a trial of treatment for asthma or COPD. Referral may also be appropriate for issues arising during ongoing management of asthma, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, as outlined in the GINA and GOLD strategy reports.

### The definition and diagnosis of asthma [^117NwXa1]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of asthma depends on what we mean by the word. Its definition continues to be controversial because there is no single genetic or environmental cause. Addressed from a descriptive point of view, the disease components include airway inflammation, symptoms, variable airflow limitation and chronic airflow limitation. The essentialist definition conveys the message that asthma is a separate disease entity, fails to identify a primary defining characteristic which separates it from other diseases and is long winded. These disadvantages are overcome by the nominalist definition of asthma in which the word 'asthma'refers to an abnormality of airway function, specifically to wide variations in airflow limitation over short periods of time. In patients with asthma the other components of airway disease need to be considered. These have separate nominalist definitions and especially include different types of bronchitis for airway inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for chronic airflow limitation. What is present will vary between and within patients. The accurate diagnosis of asthma and of other components of disease all require objective measurements. Currently spirometry and airway responsiveness should be available to the general practitioner, who sees milder disease, and additional quantitative sputum cell counts in specialist practice, where moderate to severe disease is more prevalent. Such measurements characterize the patient, identify heterogeneity and allow treatment to be personalized.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^112w4CDg]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Key messages

The quality of childhood asthma diagnostic guidelines is highly variable.
The evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations is generally of very poor quality.
There is discrepant advice on recommended diagnostic tests and thresholds across guidelines.
Better evidence needs to be generated for existing and emerging diagnostic strategies.
GPs should refer for spirometry and reversibility testing to evaluate children ≥ 5 years.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^113avsJ2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The British BTS/NICE/SIGN Asthma Guideline was launched in November 2024 and represents a major shift in asthma diagnosis and management in the United Kingdom. The British Guideline places emphasis on markers of eosinophilic inflammation as initial key diagnostic tests whereas GINA places emphasis on test of reversible airflow limitation. Both documents acknowledge that there is no one "gold-standard" test and, especially in areas of the world where the is limited or delayed access to tests, the IPCRG "jigsaw puzzle" approach to asthma diagnosis may he particularly useful. The BTS/NICE/SIGN guideline provides strong economic evidence to support the GINA strategy approach of single anti-inflammatory-reliever (AIR) and Maintenance and Reliever (MART) therapies as the cornerstone of asthma management in people age 12 and over.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Asthma diagnosis: a comparison of established diagnostic guidelines in adults with respiratory symptoms [^114qc2CP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects around 300 million people worldwide, and in the UK 12% of the population have been diagnosed with the disease. Asthma is characterised by symptoms of wheeze, chest tightness, breathlessness and cough, typically associated with variable airflow obstruction and inflammation. There are however no gold standard diagnostic criteria for asthma, likely reflecting the heterogenous nature of the condition which encompasses different phenotypes (reflecting different underlying pathophysiology), particularly in adults. Given this phenotypic heterogeneity, it is inevitable that there are multiple pathways to an asthma diagnosis, incorporating different features measured with different tests.

Asthma misdiagnosis is common, reported by Aaron et al.in up to one third of subjects investigated within five years of initial diagnosis, more than half of whom had not undergone any objective testing at the time of diagnosis. Asthma symptoms are non-specific, so it is important to complete confirmatory diagnostic tests to minimise costs and risks associated with unnecessary treatment, and to offer the opportunity to make the correct diagnosis. These should be done prior to starting inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), as treatment can change results.

The most frequently used diagnostic pathways for asthma are produced by the European Respiratory Society (ERS; Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Asthma in Adults 2022), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management 2017)and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA; Global strategy for asthma management and prevention 2023). There were methodological differences in the development of the guidelines. However, these pathways show considerable variability in the utility of different tests, their thresholds, and the order in which they are conducted. None of these pathways has been tested prospectively in symptomatic adults not taking ICS.

The aim of this study was therefore to test the performance characteristics of the ERS, NICE, and GINA asthma diagnostic algorithms, in adults with symptoms in keeping with asthma but not on ICS, in the setting of our Rapid Access Diagnostics in Asthma research clinic (RADicA).

### Diagnosing asthma in children [^114Q38Cr]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite being the most common chronic lung disease in children, asthma continues to be frequently misdiagnosed in the pediatric population. The recommendations to establish a diagnosis of asthma in school-aged children have evolved over time, but there are still important discrepancies between published guidelines. Furthermore, preschool-aged children are often unable to perform objective testing, so the diagnosis of asthma remains a clinical one in the first several years of life, and there is still debate on the criteria and nomenclature to be used in this age group. In this review, we first discuss the definition and misdiagnosis of asthma in children. We then assess and compare published guidelines that outline how to establish the diagnosis of asthma in school-aged children. We also discuss the necessary steps to diagnose preschool-aged children with this disease. Last, we outline unanswered questions and opportunities for research in this field.

The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified, and the diagnostic methods used in different studies lead to diagnostic inconsistencies. Furthermore, these methods cannot be used to diagnose the ACO phenotypes and to study the underlying mechanisms.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1168dN8q]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. Its prevalence has increased in many countries, especially among children. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) aims to improve the diagnosis, management, and prevention of asthma by providing an up-to-date evidence-based strategy and tools and practical resources for clinicians worldwide.

GINA was established through a 1993 collaboration between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. NHLBI to develop a strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (GINA strategy report) has been updated annually since 2002 to provide clinicians with up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations as new evidence emerges and new therapies are approved. The GINA strategy report is under continual review by the Science Committee. GINA methodology involves evaluation of new evidence identified from a twice-yearly rolling review of original research and systematic reviews (not limited to specific population/intervention/comparison/outcomes questions), assessment of its impact on existing or new recommendations, and consideration of whether and how it should be integrated into the overall asthma management strategy. GINA is independent of industry.

This article summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 GINA strategy report, published in April 2021, and briefly summarizes the evidence and rationale for recent important changes.

### Asthma update: part I. diagnosis, monitoring, and prevention of disease progression [^113kJiB9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Despite increased scientific knowledge about asthma and improved therapeutic options, the disease continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel has updated its clinical guidelines on asthma medications, prevention of disease progression, and patient self-management. Diagnostic criteria have not changed, and identification of the disease relies on the physician's analysis of the patient's symptoms, family history, and spirometric measurements of lung function. Classification of asthma severity also has not changed, but many obstacles remain, including the variability of asthma and the classification system's inability to account for physical activity levels, which may result in significant underestimation of the severity of asthma. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recommends the use of written action plans with or without monitoring of peak expiratory flow, although evidence supporting these management techniques is inconclusive. Patients with asthma may benefit from earlier use of inhaled corticosteroids, which have been proven safe in the usual dosages. However, further studies are needed to determine whether inhaled corticosteroids can prevent the progression of asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113Qv6Zb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^115zTJnE]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Asthma is one of the most frequent reasons children visit a general practitioner (GP). The diagnosis of childhood asthma is challenging, and a variety of diagnostic tests for asthma exist. GPs may refer to clinical practice guidelines when deciding which tests, if any, are appropriate, but the quality of these guidelines is unknown.

Objectives

To determine (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric guidelines for the diagnosis of childhood asthma in primary care, and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations.

Design

Meta-epidemiological study of English-language guidelines from the United Kingdom and other high-income countries with comparable primary care systems including diagnostic testing recommendations for childhood asthma in primary care. The AGREE-II tool was used to assess the quality and reporting of the guidelines. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Results

Eleven guidelines met the eligibility criteria. The methodology and reporting quality varied across the AGREE II domains (median score 4.5 out of 7, range 2–6). The quality of evidence supporting diagnostic recommendations was generally of very low quality. All guidelines recommended the use of spirometry and reversibility testing for children aged ≥ 5 years, however, the recommended spirometry thresholds for diagnosis differed across guidelines. There were disagreements in testing recommendations for 3 of the 7 included tests.

Conclusions

The variable quality of guidelines, lack of good quality evidence, and inconsistent recommendations for diagnostic tests may contribute to poor clinician adherence to guidelines and variation in testing for diagnosing childhood asthma.

### The real-life impact of implementing diagnostic guidelines for children and adolescents with asthma [^113QBnKw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no gold-standard for diagnosing asthma in children. This study aimed to investigate the real-life impact on disease progression and adherence by applying diagnostic criteria from international guidelines.

Methods

One hundred and fifteen children with pediatrician-diagnosed asthma aged 5–17 years were followed for 5 years in a pediatric asthma clinic. In a diagnostic 2-year period we evaluated if children had a "guideline-confirmed diagnosis" or not. A guideline-confirmed diagnosis required two of five criteria, (1) FEV1%-predicted < 80%, (2) FEV1/FVC-ratio < 80%, (3) Bronchodilator response ≥ 12% increase in FEV1, (4) FeNO ≥ 25ppb or (5) Positive exercise or mannitol test. In a subsequent 3-year follow-up period we assessed lung function development and acute asthma events.

Results

Sixty three percent of the children had a guideline-confirmed diagnosis. All children had improvements in lung function, with higher increase in FEV1%-predicted per year for children with a guideline-confirmed diagnosis versus without (beta-coefficient: 5.4 (4.5–6.3) vs. 3.7 (2.5–4.9), p = 0.026). Children with versus without a guideline-confirmed diagnosis had higher risk of acute asthma events (IRR: 4.7 (1.6–21.0), p = 0.017), hospitalization (10 vs. 1 event, p = 0.024) and oral corticosteroid treatment (OR: 6.0 (1.1–112.7), p = 0.04). Adherence was not associated with a guideline-confirmed diagnosis and time to guideline-confirmed diagnosis was not associated with disease progression.

Conclusions

Objective tests are important for diagnosing asthma, as children with ≥ 2 positive tests exhibited more acute events and greater benefit from treatment. However, improved lung function and acute events also occurred in children with < 2 positive tests, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach for pediatric asthma.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood; however, no diagnostic criteria exist to confirm or refute the diagnosis. Guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recognise that the diagnosis of asthma is a clinical one. Because of concerns about the diagnosis of asthma, particularly overdiagnosis, the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has developed comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis incorporating objective tests. The NICE interim report proposes a diagnostic algorithm incorporating the sequential use of four measures of lung function and inflammation in children with symptoms, each applied as a dichotomous variable: spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1] and forced vital capacity [FVC] expressed as a ratio FEV 1 :FVC), bronchodilator reversibility, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and peak flow variability. For the development of the NICE guideline, systematic scientific literature searches were done to identify all published evidence relevant to the review questions. The authors acknowledged that no evidence was found for asthma diagnosis in children for either FEV 1 :FVC or bronchodilator reversibility, and little evidence exists for fractional exhaled nitric oxide and peak flow variability. Despite these findings, the guideline proposes a complex algorithm in which at least two of these tests must be positive to make the diagnosis.

### Definitions… [^114G2bgW]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

It is challenging to distinguish difficult-to-treat asthma alone from severe asthma in clinical practice. In a systematic assessment, only 12% of people with difficult-to-treat asthma met criteria for severe asthma. 8 Suboptimal adherence to therapy and incorrect inhaler technique were common in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. In addition, only one-half of asthma cases that were classified as severe were objectively confirmed, and treatment adherence and inhaler technique were often not assessed.
8. Diagnosis and Management of Difficult-to-Treat Asthma The first step is to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, including consideration of the differential diagnosis. 9 Current asthma can be ruled out after repeat testing in up to one-third of adults with physician-diagnosed asthma. 10 Patient history, physical examination, and spirometry should be performed. Interpretation of office spirometry was reviewed previously in American Family Physician.

11 If the diagnosis is still unclear, pulmonary function, diffusion capacity, and bronchoprovocation testing may be considered. 9 Chest computed tomography may be required to rule out other conditions such as bronchiectasis or if the patient has atypical features.
7. Diagnosis and Management of Severe Asthma The 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma guideline also includes recommendations for the diagnosis and management of severe asthma. 9 Initial steps include determining the asthma phenotype, identifying comorbidities, providing social and psychological support, and involving an interdisciplinary care team. Asthma has a variety of heterogeneous phenotypes. Type 2 asthma includes allergic and eosinophilic asthma, and non–type 2 asthma is associated with obesity and smoking and is driven by neutrophils. Type 2 inflammation occurs in 50% of people with severe asthma and responds to newer biologic agents.

It is identified by elevated eosinophils in the blood or sputum or elevated ferrous nitrous oxide inhalation. Biologic therapy may be considered in patients with type 2 inflammation if it is available and affordable. If there is no evidence of type 2 inflammation, further evaluation with immunoglobulin E testing, skin testing, bronchoscopy, sputum induction for inflammatory phenotype, and high-resolution chest computed tomography to rule out anatomic obstruction should be considered. Finally, if the patient does not meet criteria for biologic therapy or response to therapy is limited, bronchial thermoplasty may be considered. 9.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^112EVSqA]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

### Asthma diagnosis: into the fourth dimension [^114YDJh4]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Acknowledging that asthma is an umbrella term covering this heterogeneity, in 2015, Global Initiative for Asthma simplified their asthma definition to aid diagnosis in clinical practice. This new definition highlights the cardinal features of variability in asthma: 'a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity" and "variable expiratory airflow limitation'. Despite this, the diagnostic guidelines continue to predominantly rely on using fixed and arbitrary cut-off values in the interpretation of tests, with little emphasis on the timing of measurements and how this may affect diagnostic accuracy. In this review, we will provide evidence that virtually all asthma diagnostic tests demonstrate diurnal and longer term variation; we will show how variability and timing impact asthma diagnosis and management. We provide an overview of the biological clock mechanism and highlight areas for future research.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess symptom control, future risk of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients presenting with asthma:

- assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks or longer

- identify any other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side-effects

- measure lung function at diagnosis/initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), but more often in at-risk patients and patients with severe asthma

- document the patient's current treatment step

- watch inhaler technique, assess adherence and side-effects

- check that the patient has a written asthma action plan

- ask about the patient's attitudes and goals for their asthma and medications

- assess multimorbidity contributing to symptoms and poor QoL, and sometimes to poor asthma control (such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

|Frequent severe exacerbations|- ≥ 2 courses of systemic corticosteroids (3 days each) in the previous year|
|Serious exacerbations|- ≥ 1 hospitalization, ICU stay, or mechanical ventilation in the previous year|
|Airflow limitation|- After appropriate bronchodilator withholding, forced expiratory volume < 80% of personal best (or less than the LLN in the face of reduced FEV1/FVC).|

### Asthma control or severity: that is the question [^1112ugx6]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

In the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.

### A comparison of diagnostic consistency for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and clinical characteristics study [^117Fftn3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnostic criteria for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap have not been unified. Different studies have used different criteria, and this has led to diagnostic inconsistencies.

Methods

We collected data of patients who were older than 40years and hospitalised because of chronic bronchial diseases. One hundred and seventy-one patients were included in this study. We compared seven different diagnostic criteria, examined their consistency, and analysed differences among groups classified with each set.

Results

The prevalence of ACO ranged between 7.02 and 27.49% depending on the criteria applied. The patients who met the Soler-Cataluna et al. criteria also met the GesEPOC criteria. Rhee has proposed the strictest diagnostic criteria; hence, the number of patients who met these criteria was the smallest, and those patients also met the diagnostic criteria proposed by the other studies. We found that applying the different sets of criteria did not lead to the selection of the same population, while there were no statistical differences in age, disease duration, allergens, and inflammatory markers.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified, which hinders the design and progress of clinical studies that would investigate the ACO phenotypes and underlying mechanisms.

### Managing the allergy and asthma epidemic in 2020s-lessons from the Finnish experience [^116Qob4q]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.3.2 Asthma

Diagnostic criteria of asthma, particularly among young children, varied a lot in the country. The criteria in different age groups were unified and asthma guidelines updated twice during the programme. In small children below 3 years of age, wheezing episodes or symptomatic periods were evaluated by defining asthma predictive index (API). After adopting these simple recommendations, use of asthma drugs in smallest children decreased by 40% without an increase in hospitalizations or acute visits.

For children between 3–7 years of age, impulse oscillometry has been validated and combined with free field running with bronchodilatation test. Asthma drug reimbursement is entitled to a child having both clinical symptoms and variable airflow limitation shown by lung function measurements. For school‐aged children, particularly those above 12 years of age, diagnostic requirements are the same as for adults. Hospitalization or acute visits for children above 4–5 years of age are rare in Finland demonstrating the long‐term validity of the diagnostic policy. Paediatric asthma deaths are almost non‐existent in Finland.

In primary care and in low‐ and middle‐income countries, measures like the allergen component diagnostics, OIT or impulse oscillometry are not readily available or usable, but they are mentioned here to keep up interest also to specialists and allergists being in key position to promote the programme goals.

The practical measures for food allergy, wheezing and asthma are listed in Table 2.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma–COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^112KqoAe]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to screening for other risk factors, DoD/VA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider identifying known risk factors for asthma-related outcomes in adults and children with asthma, including overweight or obesity, atopy, air quality, secondhand smoke exposure in children, and history of lower respiratory infection. Consider screening for the presence of anxiety or depression.

### Differential diagnosis of asthma [^111tzDXu]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma tends to be diagnosed too easily by clinicians without sufficient consideration being given to alternative possibilities. Most asthma is obvious, mild and easy to treat. Deviations from this typical picture should be a signal to consider carefully other diagnoses. Age of onset, pattern of symptoms, sputum production, diurnal variations or the lack thereof, associated upper respiratory symptoms, abnormal physical signs, poor control on standard inhaler therapy and unusual flow volume loops are all pointers to non-asthma diagnoses.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111nvJAc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, diagnosis, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in children aged ≤ 5 years if they meet the following 3 criteria (record as suspected asthma if only 1 or 2 criteria are met)
|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Recurrent acute wheezing episodes with or without asthma-like symptoms between episodes|- At least 2 acute episodes (lasting > 24 hours) of asthma-like signs/symptoms (such as wheezing on expiration, accessory muscle use, difficult and/or heavy breathing), with wheezing confirmed during at least 1 episode, OR <br/> - At least 1 acute wheezing episode (lasting > 24 hours) with wheezing confirmed and with asthma-like symptoms between wheezing episodes (|
|No likely alternative cause for the respiratory symptoms|- No other condition (except for a concurrent viral respiratory infection) is likely to explain the asthma-like signs/symptoms based on a thorough medical history and examination <br/> - Avoid obtaining imaging or laboratory tests|
|Timely clinical response to acute or longer-term asthma treatment|- During an acute wheezing episode in a healthcare setting, confirmed improvement of respiratory symptoms and signs within 20–60 minutes after administration of short-acting β-agonist or, for more severe episodes, within 3–4 hours after short-acting β-agonist and oral corticosteroid are commenced, OR <br/> - At home, the parent/caregiver reports that the child's wheezing or difficulty breathing improves within 20–60 minutes after being given short-acting β-agonist, OR <br/> - During a 2–3-month trial of daily ICS (100–250 mcg/day fluticasone-propionate equivalent by pressurized metered-dose inhaler via spacer) plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, the parent/caregiver reports a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of the child's acute wheezing episodes or asthma-like symptoms between acute wheezing episodes.|

### The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: towards a revised taxonomy of chronic airways diseases? [^116i3pDP]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Most research of treatments for airways diseases has been restricted to patients who meet standard definitions of either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, yet to distinguish COPD from asthma in adult patients who have clinical features of both can be challenging. Treatment guidelines provide scant advice on how such patients should be managed. With increasing recognition that asthma and COPD are heterogeneous diseases, attention has been directed to the needs of a group of patients with what is now termed asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), particularly in view of the high morbidity in this population. This Review considers the epidemiology, mechanisms of disease, current attempts to define and diagnose ACOS, existing and potential treatment options, and new approaches to the phenotyping and taxonomy of airway diseases.

### Guidelines for the management of work-related asthma [^115jnmXe]. The European Respiratory Journal (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to screening for occupational exposure, ERS 2012 guidelines recommend to attempt early recognition and diagnosis of work-related asthma because a shorter symptomatic period after diagnosis is associated with a better outcome.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^116vPsSJ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

No prior studies have assessed the quality and reporting of diagnostic testing guidelines for childhood asthma. One study evaluated diagnostic guidelines in an adult primary care setting. Of interest, the authors found that recommendations based on high-quality evidence had greater rates of clinician adherence to CPGs. Two reviews specifically compared childhood asthma recommendations across international guidelines, focusing on management. For diagnostic questions, Level 1 evidence comprises prospective studies where diagnostic tests are compared with a gold standard test in all patients in the study group. Conducting such research in asthma is challenging due to the absence of a gold-standard test; it is even more difficult to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a sequential testing strategy.

Our study sought to determine: (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric asthma guidelines for primary care and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations for childhood asthma.

Diagnosis and Initial Treatment of Patients with Features of Both Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity. It includes several clinical phenotypes that are likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD, with treatment with long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without ICS) recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma because of the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, all patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence and advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

Rationale

The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, more rapid decline in lung function, greater need for healthcare use, and higher mortality than patients with asthma or COPD alone. The recommendation for ICS is because several studies have shown that patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA compared with ICS–LABA.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in preschool and school-age children: focus on the 2007 NAEPP guidelines [^116KChY5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the changes in the revised National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma pertaining to children and highlights areas that may benefit from further study.

Recent Findings

The most recent NAEPP Guidelines contain several pediatric-specific features, including subdividing classification and treatment recommendations, into three age categories (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and ≥ 12 years). The introduction of the concept of two domains within asthma severity and control, namely impairment and risk, allows classification of patients who are either treatment-naive (asthma severity) or who are receiving controller therapy (asthma control). Suggestions for criteria for initiating daily controller therapy in preschool children with exacerbations or risk factors for asthma symptom persistence, including the asthma predictive index, are discussed. Evidence-based treatment recommendations are provided for the three age groups.

Summary

The recent NAEPP Asthma Guidelines improve on many areas of the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children and lead to the identification of areas that would benefit from further research.

### An update on asthma diagnosis [^114NUYEd]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Asthma imposes a significant health and socioeconomic burden with an average prevalence impacting 5–10% of the global population. The aim of this narrative review is to update the current literature on topics related to asthma diagnosis.

Data Sources

Original research articles were identified from PubMed using the search terms "asthma diagnosis" and "asthma misdiagnosis".

Study Selections

Recently published articles (n = 51) detailing the diagnosis, misdiagnosis of asthma, and the updated recommendations of the European and international asthma guidelines.

Results

Emerging evidence revealed that asthma might represent a rather heterogenous clinical entity with varying underlying molecular mechanisms. Attempts have been made to unravel these traits to better provide accurate diagnosis and a more efficient patient-based management approach. The lack of a gold standard test for asthma diagnosis has contributed to its over- and underdiagnosis. This is problematic, given that overdiagnosis might lead to delay of both diagnosis and prompt treatment of other diseases, while underdiagnosis might substantially impact quality of life due to progression of asthma by increased rate of exacerbations and airway remodeling. In addition to poor asthma control and potential patient harm, asthma misdiagnosis is also associated with excessive costs. As a result, current international guidelines emphasize the need for a standardized approach to diagnosis, including objective measurements prior to treatment.

Conclusion

Future research is warranted to define the optimal diagnostic and treatable traits approach especially for patients with severe asthma, as they may benefit from the advent of newly targeted asthma management.
