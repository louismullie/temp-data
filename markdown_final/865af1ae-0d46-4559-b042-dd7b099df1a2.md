## Question

What is the considerations with GFR when prescribing ace inhibitors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to consider GFR when prescribing ACE inhibitors, including thresholds, monitoring, dose adjustments, and when to continue or stop therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline GFR assessment and how it informs dosing and monitoring. Then, I should verify the expected early GFR "dip" and the 30% creatinine rule. Next, I will examine monitoring intervals and dose titration strategies by GFR strata. After that, I need to check special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will integrate decision thresholds for continuing versus discontinuing therapy and summarize practical recommendations with dosing examples and safety pearls.

> Let me first confirm baseline assessment and dosing context. Before starting an ACE inhibitor, I should obtain a baseline eGFR and serum potassium, and I need to consider albuminuria because ACE inhibitors confer the greatest kidney and cardiovascular benefit in patients with albuminuria, particularly when UACR is ≥ 300 mg/g, and are still beneficial at 30–299 mg/g, whereas benefits are less certain without albuminuria [^117HpBwC] [^115YuZ9N] [^112sJh4P]. Hold on, I should verify dosing in reduced GFR: when eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², start at a lower dose and titrate cautiously, with early labs to detect hemodynamic changes and hyperkalemia risk [^116RjsUr] [^112LNNvA].

> Now, I will examine the expected early GFR decline. ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure via efferent arteriolar vasodilation, producing a predictable, hemodynamic dip in eGFR of about 10–30% within the first 2–4 weeks. This is usually functional and not a sign of structural injury, and larger dips correlate with greater long-term kidney protection in many patients, so I should not overreact to a modest, early decline [^114Eitoo] [^1138Jv3a] [^115e1aUJ]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude threshold: a creatinine rise up to about 30% is acceptable if it stabilizes, whereas a persistent rise beyond 30% warrants evaluation for volume depletion, renovascular disease, or other causes before deciding to reduce or stop therapy [^113LV5s7] [^113CB7KF].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence by kidney function. I need to ensure labs are checked 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose escalation, with earlier checks in those with lower eGFR or higher potassium, and then space out once stable; many guidelines advise 1–2 weeks in advanced CKD or higher-risk patients, which aligns with pragmatic safety practice [^117QJepm] [^115fycFW] [^1125hA23]. Hold on, I should verify that this interval also applies to heart failure contexts; yes, contemporary cardiology guidance similarly recommends 1–2 week checks after RAAS changes in HF, reinforcing the same principle [^112mQm5h].

> I will now examine dose titration and targets. I should titrate to the highest approved, tolerated dose to maximize albuminuria reduction and kidney protection, recognizing that outcome trials used maximally tolerated dosing; this applies especially when albuminuria is present, and I should avoid premature dose reduction due to a small, stable creatinine rise [^115VhSvD] [^112LNNvA] [^112sJh4P]. But wait, what if there is no albuminuria? In CKD without albuminuria, ACE inhibitors remain reasonable for hypertension control, though the incremental kidney-specific benefit beyond BP lowering is less certain, so I should individualize and not force uptitration if adverse effects emerge [^116hynxJ] [^112sJh4P].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications. In advanced CKD with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², I should generally continue ACE inhibitors unless there is symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite therapy, or a need to reduce uremic symptoms; stopping RAAS blockade in advanced CKD has not improved long-term eGFR decline and may worsen outcomes in observational cohorts, so I should resist reflex discontinuation [^114Nzg9U] [^115fycFW] [^114JZdQn]. I need to ensure I screen for bilateral renal artery stenosis or solitary kidney with stenosis, where ACE inhibitors can precipitate acute kidney injury; in these settings, I should avoid or use extreme caution and monitor closely if used at all [^116RjsUr] [^117Y1rZo]. For pregnancy or those planning pregnancy, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated due to teratogenicity, so I should counsel and choose alternatives [^113ZxvjG].

> Next, I should review decision thresholds for continuing versus discontinuing therapy. Continue the ACE inhibitor if the creatinine rise is ≤ 30% and stabilizes, and if potassium remains ≤ 5.5 mmol/L; if potassium is elevated, I should treat hyperkalemia with dietary measures and/or binders rather than reflexively stopping RAAS blockade, given the cardiovascular and kidney risks of discontinuation [^113LV5s7] [^115MCQ91]. I should double-check the threshold for action: a persistent creatinine rise > 30% or potassium > 5.5–6.0 mmol/L despite measures warrants dose reduction or temporary cessation while I evaluate for contributing factors like NSAIDs, diuretic-induced volume depletion, or renovascular disease [^114wAyzd] [^115fycFW] [^113CB7KF].

> I will now examine practical dosing examples and safety pearls. Typical ACE inhibitor starting doses in reduced GFR include benazepril 5 mg daily, enalapril 2.5 mg once or twice daily, lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, or ramipril 1.25 mg daily, with titration every 1–2 weeks as tolerated; I should confirm there is no concomitant aliskiren or recent neprilysin inhibitor exposure and counsel on cough, angioedema, and hyperkalemia risks [^113ZxvjG]. Hold on, I should verify "sick day" management: temporarily hold ACE inhibitors during serious intercurrent illness, planned IV contrast, bowel prep, or major surgery to mitigate AKI risk, then restart promptly when safe [^116RjsUr] [^115P6YDs].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle to ensure internal consistency. The key message is that a modest, early GFR decline with ACE inhibition is expected and protective hemodynamically, whereas persistent or large creatinine rises signal a problem that needs evaluation; aligning with the 30% rule, using structured early monitoring, and pushing to maximally tolerated doses in albuminuric CKD optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes while minimizing unnecessary discontinuations [^115VhSvD] [^115fycFW].

ACE inhibitors are indicated for CKD with albuminuria [^111PBF8F] and for HFrEF [^112mQm5h], but **initiate at a lower dose when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^116RjsUr] and titrate slowly. An **early eGFR decline ≤ 30% is expected** [^113CB7KF] and not harmful; monitor creatinine and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change [^1125hA23], and only stop if the creatinine rise exceeds 30% or hyperkalemia is uncontrolled [^115fycFW]. Continue ACE inhibitors even if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² unless there is intolerance or adverse events [^114Nzg9U] [^115ptPMP]. Avoid in bilateral renal artery stenosis [^117Y1rZo], and use caution with NSAIDs, diuretics, and potassium supplements [^115P6YDs].

## Indications for ACE inhibitors in CKD

ACE inhibitors are recommended for **CKD with albuminuria** [^115YuZ9N] (moderately or severely increased) because they reduce proteinuria, slow CKD progression, and lower cardiovascular risk [^112sJh4P]. They are also indicated for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** [^notfound] to improve survival and reduce hospitalizations.

---

## GFR thresholds and dose adjustments

- **eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Standard dosing is appropriate [^notfound].

- **eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Start at a lower dose and titrate slowly with close monitoring [^116RjsUr].

- **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Continue ACE inhibitors unless intolerance or adverse events occur; no routine dose reduction is required [^114Nzg9U] [^115ptPMP].

---

## Monitoring renal function and electrolytes

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure serum creatinine and potassium before starting therapy [^115ou4Sc].

- **Early follow-up**: Recheck creatinine and potassium 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose escalation [^112mQm5h] [^1125hA23].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Check at regular intervals (every 3–6 months) or as clinically indicated [^112mQm5h].

---

## Interpretation of changes in renal function

An **early eGFR decline ≤ 30%** is expected and reflects reduced intraglomerular pressure; it is not harmful and should not prompt discontinuation [^113CB7KF] [^115e1aUJ]. A **creatinine rise > 30% within 4 weeks** warrants evaluation for volume depletion, NSAID use, or renovascular disease; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if no alternative explanation is found [^113LV5s7] [^1135WoYk].

---

## Hyperkalemia risk and management

Hyperkalemia risk increases as eGFR declines, especially in patients with diabetes or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements [^1161tg2e] [^1161yzJX]. Management includes dietary potassium restriction, diuretic adjustment, and, if needed, potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) [^114wAyzd] [^115MCQ91].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or contraindication

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis**: Contraindicated due to risk of acute renal failure [^117Y1rZo].

- **Single functioning kidney with renal artery stenosis**: Use with extreme caution [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: Contraindicated due to teratogenicity [^113ZxvjG].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Egfr category** | **Dose adjustment** | **Monitoring** | **Continuation criteria** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m² | Standard dosing | Routine monitoring | Continue unless adverse effects |
| 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² | Lower initial dose; titrate slowly | Close monitoring | Continue unless adverse effects |
| < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | No routine dose reduction | Close monitoring | Continue unless intolerance or adverse events |

---

ACE inhibitors are beneficial in CKD with albuminuria and HFrEF; initiate at lower doses when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², monitor renal function and potassium closely, and continue therapy even if eGFR declines below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² unless there is intolerance or adverse events.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116ynZWg]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Surveillance and monitoring in diabetes with CKD — both albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be monitored annually; serum potassium should also be monitored in individuals treated with diuretics because these medications can cause hypokalemia; individuals with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or MRAs should have serum potassium measured periodically, and people with this lower range of eGFR should have their medication dosing verified, exposure to nephrotoxins minimized, and be evaluated for potential CKD complications; there is a clear need for an annual quantitative assessment of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR); when eGFR is < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, screening for complications of CKD is indicated, and early vaccination against hepatitis B virus is indicated in individuals likely to progress to ESKD.

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^115e1aUJ]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of the combined SPRINT and ACCORD-BP trial, we determined the normal range of eGFR decline during antihypertensive therapy in high-risk patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Our analysis demonstrates that when BP is lowered by > 10 mm Hg, the initial decline in renal function is strongly depended on the decrease in BP. Based on 95% of the participants, an eGFR reduction of 26% can be considered normal for a BP decrease up to 10 mm Hg. A further decrease in BP resulted in an average eGFR reduction of 3.4% for every 10 mm Hg lowering of MAP, leading to a lower bound of 46% for a 40 mm Hg lower MAP. Comparison of the eGFR slopes after 1 year showed that a more profound initial decline in eGFR is not associated with an increased loss of renal function during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years during standard and intensive BP-lowering treatment.

Our results are in line with earlier statements that a 20% reduction in eGFR or 30% serum creatinine increase can be accepted. However, in many patients with hypertension, BP reductions will exceed 10 mm Hg, especially when lower BP values are targeted. Following a decrease in MAP of 40 mm Hg, an eGFR decline up to 46% can be considered normal, which corresponds to a serum creatinine increase of 66% in a 65-year-old man with a baseline eGFR of 67 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2. Independent of the achieved BP reduction, patients with increased albuminuria and diabetes mellitus, both considered markers of glomerular hyperfiltration, had a higher eGFR reduction. Earlier post hoc analyses of the ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global End point Trial), TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant participants with cardiovascular Disease), and RENAAL trial (Reduction in End points in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin-II Antagonist Losartan) showed similar associations. The sensitivity analysis using the data between the initial decline and 12 months showed a similar linear trend, supporting the hemodynamic relation between renal function and BP. This suggests that we should take the magnitude of the BP decrease and clinical characteristics suggestive of renal hyperfiltration into account when assessing the eGFR decline after initiation or intensification of BP-lowering therapy.

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency: how concerned should we be by the rise in serum creatinine? [^1161tg2e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the association between the early rise in serum creatinine levels associated with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the long-term renoprotective properties of these drugs in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

Background

Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated survival benefits of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure. In patients with renal insufficiency, whether associated with diabetes mellitus or not, use of ACE inhibitors is associated with slowing in the progression of renal disease. In fact, patients who have the most advanced renal insufficiency at baseline are the ones who show the maximum slowing of the disease progression, but these patients are also more likely to show an early rise in serum creatinine levels after ACE inhibitor therapy. There is evidence that patients with renal insufficiency often do not receive ACE inhibitors. There is also evidence that patients with heart failure are not receiving this life-saving drug or are receiving it at dosages lower than that used in the clinical trials. One of the main reasons for this underutilization of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is the underlying renal insufficiency or the rise in serum creatinine level after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor.

Methods

The authors reviewed 12 randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus or heart failure. Studies were included for review if they met the following criteria: subjects were randomized to receive ACE inhibitor; subjects were followed up for a minimum of 2 years; and most of the subjects had baseline chronic renal insufficiency (≥ 25% loss of renal function), irrespective of cause. Of the 12 studies that met these criteria, six were multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled studies. The other six were smaller randomized studies. The studies had a mean ± standard deviation follow-up of 3.2 ± 0.3 years. One thousand one hundred two patients were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Of these, 705 (64%) had data on renal function at baseline (within 6 months of the start) and at the end of the study. The authors examined the changes in serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates (GFR) in patients who were randomized to receive ACE inhibitors. The authors also assessed the blood pressures achieved in the trials.

Results

Patients with preexisting chronic renal insufficiency who achieved their blood pressure control goals were likely to demonstrate an early rise in serum creatinine levels, approximately 25% above the baseline (approximately 1.7 mg/dL) after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This rise in serum creatinine was more acute (by approximately 15% from the baseline) during the first 2 weeks of therapy and was more gradual (additional approximately 10%) during the third and fourth weeks of therapy (Figure 1). The serum creatinine level was likely to stabilize after about 4 weeks, provided patients had a normal salt and fluid intake. In addition, patients who did not show a rise in serum creatinine level during the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy, were less likely to experience one after that period, unless they were dehydrated from use of diuretics or gastroenteritis or had used a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). In spite of this early rise in serum creatinine in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine level of ≥ 124 micromol/L or ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) who were randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, these patients receiving the drug showed a 55% to 75% lower risk of worsening renal function than those with normal renal function receiving the drug. The rate of risk reduction was inversely related to the severity of renal impairment at baseline, but data were limited on the benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with more advanced renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min). The authors noted that those aged 65 and older were likely to have much lower GFRs for given levels of serum creatinine than younger patients and were therefore likely to have advanced renal insufficiency at serum creatinine levels as low as 2 mg/dL (vs 4 mg/dL for younger patients). Patients with normal renal function were likely to show a much smaller rise in serum creatinine level (approximately 10% above the baseline of 0.9 mg/dL), mostly occurring during the first week after initiation of therapy, with subsequent stabilization, whereas patients with normal renal function suffering from heart failure, volume depletion, or bilateral renal artery stenosis experienced a significant rise (approximately 225% above baseline) in serum creatinine level, much higher in magnitude and rate than that experienced by those with renal insufficiency (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels in these patients sharply increased (by approximately 75% above baseline) in the 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor, followed by an even sharper increase (another approximately 150%) during the subsequent 2 weeks. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL) who received therapy with ACE inhibitors had about a five times higher risk of developing hyperkalemia than those with normal renal function, whereas presence of heart failure increased the risk of hyperkalemia by about three times over those without heart failure. Concomitant use of diuretics was associated with an approximately 60% reduction in risk of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

The authors conclude that, in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL) treated with ACE inhibitors, there is a strong association between early (within the first 2 months) and moderate (not exceeding 30% over baseline) rise in serum creatinine and slowing of the renal disease progression in the long run. The authors recommend that ACE inhibitor therapy should not be discontinued unless serum creatinine level rise above 30% over baseline during the first 2 months after initiation of therapy or hyperkalemia (serum potassium level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) develops.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^114wQZXz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade — KDIGO recommendation 1.2.1 states that treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) should be initiated in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria and titrated to the highest approved tolerated dose, and commentary notes targeting at least a 30% albuminuria reduction with maximally tolerated dosing may be associated with lower CKD progression.

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt –1 · day –1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt –1 · day –1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (urine albumin excretion rate and GFR) and is recommended. (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, or rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for sickle cell disease: cardiopulmonary and kidney disease [^117VEBTf]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease albuminuria — recommendation and prescribing remarks: For children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and albuminuria, the guideline panel "suggests the use of ACEi's or ARBs" and labels this a "conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects". Initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi's) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) "requires adequate follow-up and monitoring of side effects (eg, hyperkalemia, cough, hypotension)". When prescribing ACEi's or ARBs, start "at a low dose in individuals with a GFR of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2"; "assess GFR and measure serum potassium within 1 week of starting medication or following dose escalation"; and "temporarily suspend medication during interval illness, planned IV radiocontrast administration, or bowel preparation for colonoscopy or prior to major surgery". The panel "did not assess the evidence to inform decisions about albuminuria screening"; external guidance "state that albuminuria should be confirmed by either first morning urine sample or 2 consecutive untimed urine samples", and "screening for albuminuria should occur annually beginning at 10 years of age in patients with SCD", but "the ASH guideline panel makes no recommendation about screening".

### Acute fall in glomerular filtration rate with renin-angiotensin system inhibition: a biomeasure of therapeutic success? [^114Eitoo]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) acutely declines with the introduction of renin-angiotensin system inhibition. This response is functional, not anatomical, and varies with volume status. The reduction in GFR with renin-angiotensin system inhibition may serve as a biomeasure of future therapeutic benefit.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^111bnCzv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a degree of acute renal impairment would be expected and acceptable while trying to achieve adequate decongestion in patients with acute or decompensated heart failure. If clinicians are not aware that this can hamper the initiation or continuation of heart failure medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The introduction of RAAS inhibitor medications is associated with efferent arteriolar vasodilatation, drop in intraglomerular filtration pressure and decrease in GFR. The introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with increased sodium delivery to distal tubule, causing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a drop in GFR, which aids in preservation of the kidney function in the long run as shown in the large SGLT inhibitor studies of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (Fig. 2). While concerns regarding worsening renal function and hyperkalemia in progressive CKD frequently lead to discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors, the Renin–Angiotensin System Inhibition in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease or STOP – ACEi trial has shown that stopping RAAS inhibitors is not associated with change in the long-term rate of decline in eGFR.

AKI is common in patients at admission with acute heart failure, related to renal arterial hypoperfusion and renal venous congestion. Further AKI happens during hospital admission due to decongestion and further haemodynamic changes. These haemodynamic changes are potentially reversible and do not have long-term adverse consequences, as shown in a meta-analysis of 13 studies where AKI with decongestion was associated with lower mortality and patients who had no AKI and remained congested. AKI can also happen due to non-haemodynamic tubular injury such as sepsis and nephrotoxic drugs, and it is important to distinguish between the two to guide further decongestion therapy and predict prognosis. The rise in serum creatinine and tubular injury markers during adequate decongestion predicts a better prognosis, compared with patients with no decongestion and no rise in creatinine. Hence it is important to achieve rapid and adequate diuresis or decongestion with acute heart failure in hospital, perhaps within first 3 days of admission, accepting minor AKI that usually recovers; however, patients should be closely monitored to identify and treat for sepsis and other non-haemodynamic causes to avoid irreversible AKI. Worsening or persistent congestion despite adequate diuretic therapy characterized by worsening or persistent symptoms of heart failure with concomitant worsening renal impairment would be a cause for concern and may indicate irreversible AKI (Fig. 3).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor use in CKD — monitoring and continuation criteria: ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, but this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113diAfM]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to January, 2005, for randomised trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

Findings

Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials on all renal outcomes, but were accompanied by substantial reductions in blood pressure in favour of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Interpretation

The benefits of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on renal outcomes in placebo-controlled trials probably result from a blood-pressure-lowering effect. In patients with diabetes, additional renoprotective actions of these substances beyond lowering blood pressure remain unproven, and there is uncertainty about the greater renoprotection seen in non-diabetic renal disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^115CoLSQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening positions — The KDIGO guideline does not address screening for CKD among specific populations, and the US Preventive Services Task Force highlighted a lack of sufficient evidence to support CKD screening of asymptomatic adults; the American College of Physicians stated that asymptomatic adults who are not at high risk for CKD should not be screened and recommended not screening for proteinuria in individuals taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Separate guidelines for high-risk conditions suggest routine screening may be useful, the 2002 KDOQI guideline recommended assessing risk for all individuals with blood pressure, albuminuria, and serum creatinine to estimate GFR among those at higher risk, and the commentary endorses screening among individuals at high risk for CKD.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials for implications of acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate for long-term kidney protection [^115FeScN]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions to slow chronic kidney disease progression, such as ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, often produce acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that differ from their long-term chronic treatment effects. Observational studies assessing the implications of acute effects cannot distinguish acute effects from GFR changes unrelated to the treatment. Here, we performed meta-regression analysis of multiple trials to isolate acute effects to determine their long-term implications. In 64 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 154,045 participants, we estimated acute effects as the mean between-group difference in GFR slope from baseline to three months, effects on chronic GFR slope (starting at three months after randomization), and effects on three composite kidney endpoints defined by kidney failure (GFR 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 or less, chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation) or sustained GFR declines of 30%, 40% or 57% decline, respectively. We used Bayesian meta-regression to relate acute effects with treatment effects on chronic slope and the composite kidney endpoints. Overall, acute effects were not associated with treatment effects on chronic slope. Acute effects were associated with the treatment effects on composite kidney outcomes such that larger negative acute effects were associated with lesser beneficial effects on the composite kidney endpoints. Associations were stronger when the kidney composite endpoints were defined by smaller thresholds of GFR decline (30% or 40%). Results were similar in a subgroup of interventions with supposedly hemodynamic effects that acutely reduce GFR. For studies with GFR 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 or under, negative acute effects were associated with larger beneficial effects on chronic GFR slope. Thus, our data from a large and diverse set of RCTs suggests that acute effects of interventions may influence the treatment effect on clinical kidney outcomes.

Diabetes: hypertension treatment thresholds and agents — In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at an SBP of ≥ 130 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 130 mm Hg, with encouragement to achieve an SBP < 120 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a DBP of ≥ 80 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 80 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, all first-line classes of antihypertensive agents (thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting CCB, ACEI, and ARB) are useful and effective for BP lowering; and in adults with diabetes and hypertension, ACEI or ARB are recommended in the presence of CKD as identified by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g and should be considered when mild albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) is present to delay progression of diabetes-related kidney disease.

Hypertension and ACE inhibitor/ARB considerations in hemodialysis (HD) — it is now generally accepted that the decrease in renal function observed in most patients treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is reversible and reno-protective, even in patients with CKD stage 5; however, the drug-induced decrease in GFR causes an increase in levels of BUN, creatinine, and other solutes and may decrease urine output, and irreversible loss of renal function may occur in patients with ischemic renal disease treated with ACE inhibitors. Severe hypertension is well known to damage normal kidneys acutely and can cause ongoing damage over years, and control of hypertension after initiating dialysis therapy has been associated with improvement in RKF, sometimes allowing discontinuation of dialysis therapy; these patients should be identified from the beginning, and special attention should be given to controlling blood pressure for the purpose of preserving and possibly improving RKF.

ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in diabetes with CKD — preferred indications and dosing emphasize albuminuria thresholds and use of maximum tolerated doses: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the preferred first-line agents for blood pressure treatment among people with diabetes, hypertension, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and UACR ≥ 300 mg/g [creatinine], and in the setting of lower levels of albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) therapy at maximum tolerated doses reduced progression to more advanced albuminuria (≥ 300 mg/g creatinine), slowed CKD progression, and reduced cardiovascular events but has not reduced progression to ESKD; while ACE inhibitors or ARBs are often prescribed for moderately increased albuminuria (30–299 mg/g [creatinine]) without hypertension, outcome trials have not been performed, and two long-term, double-blind studies demonstrated no renoprotective effect when initiated in people with normal albuminuria or hypertension alone without albuminuria; it is also noted that not maximizing these therapies due to creatinine rise concerns would not be considered optimal care and that trials used maximum tolerated doses, there are no studies demonstrating outcome benefits on both mortality and slowed CKD progression in people with diabetes who have an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and when increases in serum creatinine reach 30% without associated hyperkalemia, RAS blockade should be continued.

Purpose Of Review

To present the available data on the risks and benefits for ACEi/ARB usage in patients with advanced CKD.

Recent Findings

It has been well established that ACEi/ARB use is beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, especially in patients with proteinuria. The majority of available data includes patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data in individuals with advanced CKD are limited. Additionally, data available for this subset of patients is conflicting and the definition of advanced CKD varies across clinical trials.

Summary

On the basis of our literature review, evidence suggests continuing ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m) unless hyperkalemia ensues unresponsive to therapy, hypotension develops or have unusually rapid worsening of eGFR (not usual progressive decline). These patients should be monitored closely. There is not enough data to support starting ACEi/ARBs de novo in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15ml/min/1.73m). If RAS blockade is started de novo in this subgroup, we recommend close monitoring.

### ABCDE to identify and prevent chronic kidney disease: a call to action [^113UmLPN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Reasons for this lack of awareness of the need for CKD diagnosis and monitoring, despite measurement of GFR and UACR being simple, inexpensive and enshrined not only in all CKD guidelines, but also in multiple other guidelines including those for diabetes, hypertension and CVD are not really understood. These are very likely to be complex and multifactorial and differ between countries, healthcare systems and societal perspectives. One potential explanation is a lack of appreciation that the results will lead to positive action, especially in the early phases of CKD. Until recently, the management of CKD has been based on lifestyle measures and the treatment of blood pressure (BP) and albuminuria, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Despite decades of evidence of benefit, there is considerable evidence for the underutilization of these therapeutic agents in individuals with hypertension and albuminuria. Recently, the addition of multiple novel agents including non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs), sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1ras) have been tested in large randomized controlled trials showing very significantly improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD. Not surprisingly perhaps, given the data on ACEis and ARBs, there is again evidence accumulating of the underuse of these newer agents despite having been rapidly incorporated into guidelines and consensus documents. Furthermore, early use of these agents when CKD is mild can have a dramatic benefit on survival without kidney failure compared with starting these agents later in more advanced stages of CKD (Fig. 3). For instance, in the example shown in Fig. 3, starting the SGLT2i empaglifozin when the GFR is 85 ml/min/1.73 m 2 will potentially delay an individual reaching kidney failure by 26.6 years, whereas starting the same agent when the GFR is 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 will only delay reaching kidney failure by 1.9 years. Although several assumptions have been made in creating this extreme example, including consistent adherence to treatment and no competing risk of death, it makes the very important point that early detection and treatment of CKD is critical. Actuarial analyses using data from large-scale randomized outcome trials show that combination treatment with SGLT2i, GLP-1ra and nsMRA is projected to afford substantial gains in cardiovascular, kidney and overall survival. Conversely, another important consequence of a lack of awareness of CKD is the associated continued overprescription or overdosing of potentially nephromodulatory medications — e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and proton pump inhibitors.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) medication management — Where precision is required for dosing or estimates may be unreliable, we recommend methods based upon cystatin C or direct measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1C). We recommend temporary discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic and renally excreted drugs in people with a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G3a-G5) who have serious intercurrent illness that increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (including ACE-Is, ARBs, aldosterone inhibitors, direct renin inhibitors), diuretics, NSAIDs, metformin, lithium, and digoxin (1C). We recommend that adults with CKD seek medical or pharmacist advice before using over-the-counter medicines or nutritional protein supplements (1B), and we recommend not using herbal remedies in people with CKD (1D). For metformin, we recommend that it be continued in people with GFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G1-G3a); its use should be reviewed in those with GFR 30–44 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (GFR category G3b); and it should be discontinued in people with GFR < 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m^2 (GFR categories G4-G5) (1C). We recommend that all people taking potentially nephrotoxic agents such as lithium, aminoglycosides, and calcineurin inhibitors should have their GFR, electrolytes and drug levels regularly monitored (1A). The US Food and Drug Administration black-box warning for metformin states it is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL in men and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL in women, and it is now recognized that the risk for lactic acidosis in patients on metformin is extremely low.

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^115FpGnT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^112cUUgH]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

One of the great triumphs of modern medicine is the therapy of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (together with appropriate device therapy) increase life expectancy markedly, with the combination of sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blocker and MRA reducing all-cause mortality with a HR of 0.37 against placebo. However, there is frequently a conflict between renal function and heart failure therapy. Renal dysfunction is extremely common in patients with CHF (figure 1) and associated with a worse outcome. Most of the treatments used for CHF can cause worsening renal function.

Figure 1
Distribution of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 1216 patients with chronic stable heart failure. Data from Eur Heart J 2006;27:569–81. AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; HFREF, heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; MI, myocardial infarction; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone.

Anxiety about rises in creatinine (and the associated falls in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) can lead to underprescription of ACEI and ARBs. The tendency to withdraw ACEI and ARB has been exacerbated by the international adoption of the term 'acute kidney injury' (AKI) to describe acute changes in kidney functionand by the inclusion of these drugs, which can also protect against progressive proteinuric kidney damage, in lists of drugs termed 'nephrotoxic'. The British National Formulary and guidelines on chronic kidney disease (CKD) published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)advise dose reduction or even stopping ACEI or ARB if serum creatinine rises by > 30% without another explanation. The NICE heart failure guidelinerecommends regular biochemical monitoring but refers to the NICE CKD guidelines on how to respond to changes in biochemistry. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines advise dose reduction or withdrawal only if serum creatinine rises by > 50% or reaches a limit of 266 μmol/L.(The arbitrary nature of some cut points is shown by the peculiar numbers that sometimes appear. They appear less peculiar when it is appreciated that they are conversions of round numbers of mg/dL.)

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^116fN4cF]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in kidney function after initiation of drug treatment

A decline in renal function is commonly seen in patients when they start an ACEI, ARB or sacubitril/valsartan and is usually modest. The decline is attributable to loss of renal efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and an acute decrease in intraglomerular pressure, with subsequent fall in GFR. Renal function may actually improve: in Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), although the average increase in creatinine was 44 µmol/L at 2 weeks, in nearly a quarter of patients creatinine declined.RAAS inhibitors can decrease the rate at which renal function subsequently declines, despite an apparent initial worsening.

The deterioration in renal function may also indicate haemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis or intrarenal vascular disease. For a small proportion of patients, particularly those with bilateral renovascular disease, initiation of ACEI/ARB can result in substantial and irreversible declines in renal function or life-threatening hyperkalaemia. In those rare cases with profound decline in GFR post-RAAS inhibitor, renal artery stenosis should be actively sought with decision on revascularisation made on an individual patient basis.

Important questions are: (1) whether there is a level of decline in renal function related to ACEI/ARB initiation beyond which the risk of continuing treatment outweighs the benefits; and (2) whether the risk:benefit balance depends on the indication for treatment.

One of the pitfalls in caring for patients with heart failure is premature discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors when renal function declines during initiation or uptitration of the drugs. Worsening renal function is more common in patients treated with ACEI and ARB. Among patients with HFrEF, those with worse renal function at baseline, and those who have a greater decline in renal function during initiation of RAAS inhibitors, have a worse prognosis than those who do not; however, they gain a greater relative benefit from RAAS inhibitors. In patients with HFpEF, worse renal function is again associated with higher mortality, but in contrast to patients with HFrEF, worsening renal function on RAAS inhibitors is associated with increased mortality.

### Is there added value to adding ARB to ACE inhibitors in the management of CKD? [^114B42eU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Antagonism of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) decreases BP and reduces proteinuria in chronic kidney disease. BP is decreased approximately 5 mmHg when angiotensin II blockers are added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is less than typically seen when other agents are added to existing ACE inhibitor regimens. Dual RAAS blockade results in additional reduction in proteinuria. Clinically insignificant increases in hyperkalemia and modest decreases in GFR occur. Data regarding long-term preservation of renal function are lacking. We suggest dual RAAS blockade be used in patients with chronic kidney disease with residual proteinuria on maximal ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II blocker therapy, anticipating additional data with ongoing trials.

KDOQI US commentary — RAS inhibitor safety, monitoring, and hyperkalemia management: Since RAS inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia, monitoring for hyperkalemia within 1–2 weeks after initiation remains appropriate. Although serum creatinine concentrations often increase acutely with RAS inhibitor initiation, an initial increase of ≤ 30% followed by stabilization within 2 months is associated with long-term preservation of kidney function. Therefore, every effort to maintain adequate dosing of RAS inhibitors, even in individuals more likely to develop hyperkalemia, could be useful, and an approach to maintain adequate RAS inhibition may be facilitated by dietary restrictions and/or potassium binders. The guideline also notes that the concurrent use of ACEIs and ARBs or inclusion of direct renin inhibitors in conjunction with an ACEI or ARB increases adverse outcomes and should be avoided. Consistent with practice point 1.2.6, ACEIs or ARBs should only be reduced or discontinued as a last resort in patients with hyperkalemia, and a recent retrospective cohort study found a higher risk of death and major cardiovascular outcomes after discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy in individuals who reached eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

### Do ACE-is and ARBs benefit patients with advanced CKD?… [^114JZdQn]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on June 21, 2021 Many prescribers discontinue patients' angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers as their estimated glomerular filtration rate worsens due to concerns about hyperkalemia, hypotension, and/or worsening chronic kidney disease. Slightly less than half of all persons with CKD stage 4 or 5 in the United States are not currently prescribed an ACE-I or ARB. Two recent studies, however, demonstrate potential benefits of ACE-I and ARB use in patients with advanced CKD. The first study reviewed the medical records in a large US health system of nearly 4, 000 patients with CKD who were prescribed an ACE inhibitor or an ARB and whose CKD eventually worsened to an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1. 73m2. Cohorts were divided into patients whose ACE-Is or ARBs were discontinued when their eGFR dropped below 30 mL/min/1.

73m2 and those patients whose ACE-Is or ARBs were continued despite this lower eGFR. Researchers then tracked participants' outcomes for 5 years. They found that persons who had their ACE-I/ARB discontinued had a higher mortality risk than those whose ACE-Is/ARBs were continued. The risk of adverse cardiac events was higher in persons who had stopped their ACE-I/ARB. There was no difference in the rate of CKD progression to end-stage kidney disease between groups. The second study reviewed the medical records of nearly 5000 patients in Sweden with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1. 73m2 who received a new prescription for either an ACE-I/ARB or a calcium channel blocker. After a median of 4. 1 years, persons who received an ACE-I/ARB had a lower risk of needing to initiate dialysis compared to the persons who received a CCB. Mortality and risk of adverse cardiac events were similar in both groups, respectively). These two studies examined different nuances of patients with advancing CKD: the first, persons whose previous ACE-I/ARB was continued despite worsening eGFR, the second, persons receiving new prescriptions for ACE-I/ARB at a lower eGFR. These differences may explain the studies' differing findings regarding mortality benefit of these medication classes, adverse cardiac events benefit, and lowered risk of advancement to ESKD. Cohort studies can only demonstrate correlation. Both studies' authors acknowledge the potential for unrecognized confounding factors; for example, it's possible that the persons in both studies who didn't receive ACE-Is/ARBs were somehow more ill than those who did.

Until we see randomized controlled trials comparing these approaches, though, these current studies are the best evidence we have to date, and they suggest that continuing ACE-I/ARBs in persons with advanced CKD is likely safe and may have benefits.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease: an endorsement with some caveats for real-life application [^116NP9tC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Developing guidelines on a subject as broad as hypertension is difficult, especially when the guidance relates to hypertension in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline Development Group has applied a rigorous methodology in reviewing all available evidence, and their recommendations are consistent with the evidence-based approach. As a result, the European Renal Best Practice endorses most of its recommendations. However, the Work Group feels that some additional advice could help clinicians in daily practice: (i) individualization of treatment should be taken into account, especially (cardiovascular) co-morbidities, age, gender and race; (ii) side-effects, such as postural dizziness should be monitored closely, particularly in elderly, diabetics and patients with arterial stiffness; (iii) the importance of salt restriction should not be neglected; (iv) although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) remain a cornerstone in the management of hypertension, and especially cardiovascular protection, in some particular situations such as in advanced CKD and in patients without proteinuria, their role is less well defined; (v) as most CKD patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve blood pressure control, the specific (renal) (dis)advantages of other classes than ACE-I or ARB should be taken into account.

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, with hypertension and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117Y1rZo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) in CKD — benefits, harms, and monitoring: In randomized trials, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have consistently shown renal and cardiovascular benefits in proteinuric kidney disease, and they remain nephroprotective in those with GFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Adverse effects include acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, peripheral edema, hypotension, angioedema, cough, headache, and nausea, and they are associated with teratogenicity. KDIGO guidelines recommend that the initial dose should be lower for individuals with GFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, with GFR and potassium measured within 1 week of starting, or after any dose escalation, and regularly thereafter. ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be temporarily discontinued during intercurrent illness, planned intravenous radiocontrast administration, bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy, or before major surgery, and contraindications include a history of allergy or angioedema and bilateral renal artery stenosis.

### Serum creatinine levels and renal insufficiency… [^111fzoVp]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The sixth report of the Joint National Committee has recommended that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors be used for lowering blood pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus and in persons with renal insufficiency. Blood pressure reduction is known to slow renal disease regardless of the antihypertensive agent used, but ACE inhibitors may further slow renal disease progression in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, only one half of the 53 percent of hypertensive patients treated actually achieve blood pressure reduction to less than 140/90 mm Hg. Some patients may experience a transient rise in serum creatinine level after starting treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, or after blood pressure is adequately controlled.

A rise in serum creatinine or potassium level may result in discontinuation of the drug or use of lower dosages than what is recommended because of concerns about safety and tolerability in patients with renal insufficiency. Bakris and Weir reviewed 12 randomized trials to determine if an initial reduction in the glomerular filtration rate or elevation of serum creatinine levels from use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs results in long-term protection against decline in renal function in patients with renal insufficiency. Renal disease progression among patients with preexisting renal insufficiency was evaluated over a three-year period. The evaluations included patients with and without diabetes mellitus or systolic heart failure. GFR data was used if serum creatinine values were unavailable.

A limited elevation in serum creatinine level was seen following initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients who achieved their blood pressure goal. The increase usually occurred within two weeks of therapy. Regardless of the serum creatinine value, manifestations of renal failure were not apparent until the GFR was well below 30 mL per minute. Patients with the greatest degree of renal insufficiency experienced the greatest protection from renal disease progression. As renal disease increases, there is a loss of renal reserve as well as the autoregulatory ability of the kidney, resulting in a more acute fall in GFR following ACE inhibition. The studies also indicated that there is a low risk of hyperkalemia with use of drugs that block the reninangiotensin system. Results indicated that use of drugs that block the RAS is appropriate in patients with renal insufficiency.

Once marked elevations in serum creatinine levels are present and renal reserve is lost, the unique benefits of ACE inhibitors may not exceed that of achieving the recommended level of blood pressure reduction alone. Data from these studies in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal disease demonstrated that if an elevation in the serum creatinine level does occur, it stabilizes quickly and does not progressively worsen. In addition, this reduction in GFR is reversible. The authors conclude that no one should be denied a long-term trial of an ACE inhibitor because of a preexisting elevation of serum creatinine level or one that increases up to 30 percent from baseline and then stabilizes within two to three weeks. If elevations in serum creatinine of more than 30 percent occur on a chronic basis within the first month or if hyperkalemia occurs, the drug should be withdrawn.

### Pharmacotherapy for heart failure in patients with renal insufficiency [^1161yzJX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone improve survival in patients with heart failure. Because patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency have been underrepresented in these trials, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with both conditions. Approximately one third to one half of patients with heart failure have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and renal insufficiency is among the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence with which to weigh the risks and benefits in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction. beta-Blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure, and their beneficial effect is unlikely to differ according to renal function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal insufficiency appears to increase risk for hyperkalemia and limits the use of the drug in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Future clinical trials in heart failure should include a representative number of patients with renal insufficiency to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114wAyzd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 ESH Guidelines highlight also the main therapeutic challenges with ACEi or ARB treatment. As the vasodilating effect of ACEis or ARBs on the efferent arteriole reduces intraglomerular pressure, eGFR drops commonly by an average of 10%–15% in the first weeks of treatment with these agents (eGFR dip). A similar hemodynamic effect can be seen with large BP reductions offered by any antihypertensive agent. Thus, repeated monitoring of eGFR and blood electrolytes within 4–8 weeks (depending on baseline kidney function) is important when treatment is initiated. Clinicians should not be alarmed by this early GFR drop, but if the decline in GFR continues or is more severe (> 30%), the RAS blocker should be stopped, and the patient should be investigated for the presence of renovascular disease. Use of RAS blockers in CKD patients further increases the risk of hyperkalemia. Incident hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality and is the most frequent reason for dose reduction or discontinuation of ACEis and ARBs in CKD patients. However, reducing the dose or discontinuing RAS blockers has been associated with increased risk of CV events in large observational studies and should be avoided. Novel potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) were shown to effectively normalize elevated serum potassium and chronically maintain normal levels in CKD patients treated with ACEis, ARBs or spironolactone, with good tolerability. Thus, these agents can be used to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L in individuals with CKD (CoR II; LoE B).

What are the general treatment options for DKD?

Intensive glycemic control is critical in the prevention of DKD in the early course of the disease. However, a number of studies have shown that intensive glucose control may not reduce the risk of CKD progression or cardiovascular mortality in advanced stages of DKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend a target HbA1c ranging from < 6.5 to < 8.0%, with the choice of an exact target guided by the extent of hypoglycemia risk in each patient.

For glycemic control, current guidelines suggest using both metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for patients with DKD and GFR > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists can be added to manage hyperglycemia if needed. Uncontrolled hypertension can worsen DKD and increase the risk of progression to ESKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to maintain blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg in all patients with CKD and albuminuria regardless of their diabetic status. Prior studies showed that ACEis and ARBs offer kidney protection by lowering proteinuria and slowing the rate of CKD progression. Combination regimens with ACEis and ARBs are not recommended due to an increased risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.

Regarding the non-pharmacological therapies, KDIGO guidelines recommend the implementation of lifestyle modification among DKD patients, including low sodium intake (< 2 g/day), maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/day for patients who are not on dialysis, and moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week as tolerated.

Conclusions

The interaction between treatment for heart failure and decline in renal function is frequently misunderstood and commonly used as a reason to withhold potentially life-prolonging therapy. The misunderstanding is not helped by referring to RAAS inhibitors as 'nephrotoxic' drugs, which they most emphatically are not. Well-meaning but poorly evidenced recommendations to give patients 'sick day rules'have the potential to cause harm when patients stop their medication for minor illness (or fail to restart them once illness has passed). Perhaps of even greater concern is inaccurate advice given by bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which suggested that 'concomitant use of spironolactone with ACEi or ARB is not routinely recommended'. The combination is, of course, of vital importance to patients with symptomatic HFrEF; however, close monitoring of renal function and potassium is vital when using MRA and other RAAS inhibitor together.

There is a danger that concerns over renal function may prevent patients receiving medication beneficial to their long-term outcome. While decline in renal function is important and may require drugs to be stopped, that should only be after very careful consideration of the risks and benefits to the individual patient (figure 3).

### Using ACE inhibitors and ARBs in advanced chronic… [^117WRVBB]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, does the continued use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have a worsening effect on renal function. Bottom Line Although some experts have recommended the discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with advanced CKD, the study supports their continuation with no evidence of harm and a possible reduction in the need for renal replacement therapy. Synopsis Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors include angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although their use in mild to moderate CKD slows progression of the disease, their use in patients with advanced CKD is not known. The U. K. investigators identified adults with stage IV or V CKD and a decrease in GFR of 2 mL per minute per 1.

73 m. 2 per year over the past two years who were not on dialysis and used an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least six months before enrollment. At baseline, the 411 patients had a median serum creatinine level of 3. 4 mg per dL, a median estimated GFR of 18 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2, 45% were 65 years or older, and 36% had type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patients were randomized to continue or discontinue their ACE inhibitor or ARB. In both groups, other classes of antihypertensives could be used to control blood pressure at the discretion of the treating physician. Analysis was by intention to treat, and the groups were balanced at baseline. After a median follow-up of three years, the estimated GFR was higher in the group that continued to use renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, but this difference was not statistically significant.

Patients in the continuation group had a strong trend toward a lower rate of requiring renal replacement therapy. This is an example of a clinically significant difference that was not statistically significant, likely because of inadequate sample size and/or duration of follow-up. Hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, and deaths were similar between groups. Adherence to the assigned treatment was very good and there was no difference between groups in serious adverse events.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^1111tfiL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression.
- ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment should be maximized in patients who have diabetes with albuminuria and hypertension unless complicated by symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or more than a 30% increase in creatinine level. From the AFP Editors. Diabetes mellitus affects more than 450 million people globally, which could increase to more than 700 million people by 2045.

Up to 40% of cases of diabetes are complicated by chronic kidney disease, with persistent abnormalities of kidney function demonstrated by elevated urine albumin excretion or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes group, an international organization dedicated to nephrology clinical practice guidelines, has developed a new guideline for management of diabetes with CKD. Self-Management Education Structured education in diabetes self-management is recommended for people with diabetes and CKD because education improves long-term clinical outcomes and quality of life. Group-based education programs improve A1C level, fasting blood glucose level, body weight, self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1.

73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high. The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2 or in people treated with dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitor use can cause a reversible decline in eGFR that usually does not require stopping the medication. The SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 if well-tolerated and dialysis is not imminent.

SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with genital mycotic infections and rare diabetic ketoacidosis. Limb amputations were increased in one trial. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events. GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2, where they appear to reduce albuminuria and preserve eGFR. They should not be prescribed with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. They can be used with a sulfonylurea or insulin, although the doses of these medications may need to be reduced. A1C is imprecise among people treated with dialysis but reasonably accurate with an eGFR of 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2 or greater.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117VSEJf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Additional antihypertensive considerations in diabetes — continuation of renin–angiotensin system blockade, comparative cardioprotection, β‑blocker role, and need for multiple drugs. In people receiving ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, continuation of those medications as kidney function declines to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 may provide cardiovascular benefit without significantly increasing the risk of end‑stage kidney disease; in the absence of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have not been found to afford superior cardioprotection compared with thiazide‑like diuretics or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. β‑Blockers are indicated in the setting of prior MI, active angina, or HFrEF but have not been shown to reduce mortality as blood pressure–lowering agents in the absence of these conditions. Multiple‑drug therapy is often required to achieve blood pressure goals, particularly in the setting of CKD in people with diabetes.

### Impact of early glomerular filtration rate decline in response to antihypertensive treatment on risk of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127otcp]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure control, which can induce a slight decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), plays a nephron- and cardioprotective role. However, the more important early decline in GFR associated with antihypertensive therapy and strict blood pressure targets is still of concern. Since few data are available from trials and observational studies, and the phenomenon is relatively rare, we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. We conclude that major reductions in the glomerular filtration rate occurring soon after starting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or under intensive blood pressure control predict end-stage kidney disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — supportive evidence and ACEi/ARB monitoring: SPRINT data demonstrated adults with CKD and hypertension can be effectively and safely treated to SBP < 130 mm Hg, and meta-analyses have shown benefit of treating SBP < 130 mm Hg versus higher SBP targets. An analysis of CKD patients from 4 trials found that an SBP target of < 130 mm Hg (versus < 140 mm Hg) decreased all-cause mortality; a meta-analysis of the CKD subsets from 18 trials reported that more-intensive SBP (mean SBP 132 mm Hg) versus less-intensive SBP (mean SBP 140 mm Hg) control resulted in 14% reduction in all-cause mortality. While < 120 mm Hg is more effective at preventing CVD events, meta-analyses of trial data support an SBP < 130 mm Hg to balance the benefits of intensive BP-lowering with the risks of adverse events. ACEi or ARB reduce intraglomerular pressure, which may cause a transient decrease, or dip, in eGFR up to 30%, and this short-term decline in eGFR is not associated with decreased long-term outcomes and should not prompt discontinuation of the ACEi or ARB. Electrolytes should be rechecked 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or intensifying ACEi or ARB dosage, monitoring for hyperkalemia or a decline in eGFR of > 30%, which may require reducing or holding the agent temporarily or additional evaluation. ACEi or ARB can be continued in people with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as an RCT found that discontinuation was not associated with a significant difference in long-term decrease in eGFR, and the combined use of an ACEi and an ARB should be avoided because of increased harm.

### Renin angiotensin system blockade in kidney transplantation: a systematic review of the evidence [^113Uby9y]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) slow the progression of renal disease in non-transplant patients. A systematic review of randomized trials (n = 21 trials with 1549 patients) was conducted to determine the effect of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use following kidney transplantation. With a median follow-up of 27 months, ACE-inhibitor or ARB use was associated with a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (-5.8 mL/min; 95% CI -10.6 to -0.99). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use resulted in a lower hematocrit (-3.5%; 95% CI -6.1 to -0.95), reduction in proteinuria (-0.47 gm/d; 95% CI -0.86 to -0.08) but no change in the serum potassium (0.18 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.03 to 0.40). ACE-inhibitor or ARB use results in clinically important reductions in proteinuria, hematocrit and glomerular filtration rate in renal transplant recipients, but there are insufficient data to determine the effect on patient or graft survival. Randomized trials of sufficient power and duration that examine these hard outcomes should be conducted. Until such trials are completed, this study provides quantitative estimates of the risks and benefits of ACE-inhibitor or ARB use that can be used by clinicians considering prescribing these medications to kidney transplant recipients or to researchers designing future trials.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m^2). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2.

### Practical approach to detection and management of chronic kidney disease for the primary care clinician [^116TpWH4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^116Wr4z3]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in kidney function during treatment of CHF

In the absence of evidence from trials, understanding how changes in the systemic circulation may affect kidney function is important in informing clinical recommendations.

Effects of systemic blood pressure on glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

The normal kidney maintains a stable GFR across a wide range of systemic blood pressure due to the effect of an intact RAAS. However, in CKD and in long-standing hypertension, the blood pressure range for autoregulation is smaller, and GFR becomes more pressure dependent, so that a drop in systemic blood pressure results in a fall in GFR, without tubular injury.RAAS inhibitors make GFR much more dependent on systemic arterial pressure. A sustained drop in usual blood pressure beyond the autoregulatory range causes AKI, from which recovery may take weeks and may be incomplete. Pre-existing low-flow states, including CHF, increase the risk of normotensive AKI.

Effects of renal artery stenosis and intrarenal vascular disease

Angiotensin II causes a preferential increase in efferent arteriolar tone, helping to maintain GFR when afferent arteriolar pressure is low, as in renal artery stenosis and severe generalised intrarenal arteriosclerosis. In these settings, inhibition of angiotensin II production by ACEI or ARB can lead to acute renal failure, which is not always reversible.

Effects of venous congestion and fluid overload

Increased systemic venous pressure can cause a decline in GFR by increasing renal interstitial pressure. Congestion per se is a key driver of change in renal function. Venous congestion also causes an inflammatory response within the renal parenchyma. Decongestion by diuretics can thus result in an increase in GFR, and withdrawal of diuretics from patients with stable chronic heart failure can cause tubular injury.

Effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure

Increased intra-abdominal pressure, for instance, due to tense ascites, can cause a reduction in GFR in patients with CHF by causing functional ureteric obstruction; the precise mechanism is unclear.

### Summary of revisions for the 2009 clinical practice recommendations [^111DXbTp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Prevention and Management of Diabetes Complications:

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) cut points for use of thiazide or loop diuretics have been revised.
Pharmacologic therapy for patients with diabetes and hypertension should be with a regimen that includes either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, a thiazide diuretic should be added to those with an estimated GFR (see below) ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and a loop diuretic for those with an estimated GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. (C)
Several dyslipidemia recommendations have been revised. If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A) If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but have not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Several antiplatelet agent recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) as a primary prevention strategy in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, including those who are > 40 years of age or who have additional risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (C) For patients with CVD and documented ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/day) should be used. (B) Combination therapy with aspirin (75–162 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) is reasonable for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome. (B)
Coronary heart disease treatment recommendations have been revised and/or the level of evidence has been changed. In patients with known CVD, ACE inhibitor (C), aspirin (A), and statin therapy (A) (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients > 40 years of age with another cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, family history, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, or smoking), aspirin and statin therapy (if not contraindicated) should be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. (B) In patients with coronary heart failure (CHF), thiazolidinedione use is contraindicated. (C) Metformin may be used in patients with stable CHF if renal function is normal. It should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with CHF. (C)
The recommendation in the "Retinopathy screening and treatment" section has been revised. Adults and children aged 10 years or older with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within 5 years after the onset of diabetes. (B)
One recommendation in the "Neuropathy screening and treatment" section has been moved to the "Foot care" section, and one has been revised. Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
The "Foot care" section has been extensively revised, including the recommendations. For all patients with diabetes, perform an annual comprehensive foot examination to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations. The foot examination should include inspection, assessment of foot pulses, and testing for loss of protective sensation (10-g monofilament plus testing any one of: vibration using 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold). (B)

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jZRBm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### ACP releases guideline on screening, monitoring, and treatment… [^112Wk8Hx]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice Screening for CKD in asymptomatic adults without risk factors is not recommended. Monitoring for proteinuria in adults already taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is not indicated. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the preferred therapies for patients with hypertension and stage 1 to 3 CKD. Statin therapy should be used to manage elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD. From the AFP Editors Chronic kidney disease is commonly defined as abnormalities of the kidney structure or function that are present for longer than three months with implications for health. CKD is typically divided into five stages based on severity as defined by a patient's glomerular filtration rate. The breakdown of stages in increasing order of severity is as follows: Stage 1: kidney damage with GFR ≥ 90 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 2: kidney damage with GFR of 60 to 89 mL per minute per
1.

73 m 2 Stage 3: GFR of 30 to 59 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2 Stage 4: GFR of 15 to 29 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 5: GFR < 15 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2, or kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation. Approximately 22. 4 million adults in the United States have stage 1 to 3 CKD, which is considered early-stage CKD. Persons in the early stages are typically asymptomatic. However, these three stages, reduced GFR, and albuminuria are associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, fractures, bone loss, infections, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Based on a systematic evidence review, this guideline from the American College of Physicians presents recommendations on screening, monitoring, and treatment of stage 1 to 3 CKD in adults. Interventions and Outcomes The screening and monitoring tests evaluated for the guideline include estimated GFR, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria.

The treatments evaluated include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, statins, low-protein diet, intensive control of diabetes mellitus, and intensive multicomponent interventions. Benefits and Harms No randomized controlled trials evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for stage 1 to 3 CKD or monitoring for disease progression, although indirect evidence was used to inform the guideline. Potential screening benefits would be derived from anticipated benefits of treatment. There was no evidence evaluating the benefits of early treatment on clinical outcomes of patients with screen-detected CKD. Evidence on the validity and reliability of monitoring tests is lacking.

The guideline identified the following benefits of screening, monitoring, and treatment of CKD: Screening: Early identification of undiagnosed or possibly asymptomatic CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD Monitoring: Identification of progression to later stages of CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD. Treatment: Therapy reduces risk of mortality, end-stage renal disease, and other vascular or renal outcomes.

### Elevations in serum creatinine with RAAS blockade: why isn' T it a sign of kidney injury? [^111NxL9F]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review the pertinent physiology and pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), summarize the proven beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of RAAS blockade, examine clinical situations in which RAAS blockade may induce reductions in glomerular filtration rate, and explore why increases in serum creatinine in the setting of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy do not necessarily signify the presence of clinically relevant kidney failure.

Recent Findings

RAAS inhibition appears to reduce the likelihood of atrial fibrillation. RAAS inhibition leads to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, but does not appear to prevent diabetes. The beneficial effects of ACEi/ARB therapy extend to those with significant renal disease. Combination ACEi/ARB is safe, and reduces proteinuria more than either agent alone in patients with macroalbuminuric nephropathy. Acute deteriorations in renal function that result from RAAS inhibition are usually reversible.

Summary

RAAS blockade exerts potent hemodynamic, antihypertensive, and antiinflammatory effects, and slows progression of kidney disease beyond that due to lowering of blood pressure. The benefit extends to those with advanced disease. In spite of established benefit, ACEi and ARB therapy remains underutilized, in part due to concerns about acute deteriorations in renal function that result from interruption of the RAAS.

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)
While there are no adequate head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, there is clinical trial support for each of the following statements: In patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, and any degree of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria.

Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (urine albumin excretion rate, GFR) and is recommended. (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of urine albumin excretion to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors in CKD — We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A3) without diabetes (1B), and we suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). For people with diabetes, we recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for CKD with moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1–G4, A2 and A3) (1B), and we recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). Practice points state that RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated and that changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose increase depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.

Renal Control

Renal hyperfiltration and microalbuminuria should be included as treatment goals in patients with diabetes. As both of these are prognostic markers of renal and CV risk, the expert panel recommended monitoring a pathophysiological mechanism of renal damage.

Initial GH is triggered by excess glucose at the proximal glomerular tubules, with a consequent increase in proximal reabsorption of glucose and sodium, which results in the activation of the tubuloglomerular feedback system. This leads to a reduction in sodium reaching the distal segments. The macula densa detects a decrease in distal sodium concentration, leading to the vasodilation of afferent arterioles and, consequently, an increase in intraglomerular pressure. Blocking glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubules corrects this situation and improves renal and CV prognosis from the early stages of the disease.

Pharmacological Treatment

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to significantly reduce eGFR decline, risk of microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease, and nephropathy compared to controls. Furthermore, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced serum creatinine doubling, and renal death in patients with eGFR > 60 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. These outcomes were supported by the recently published DAPA-CKD trial that reported a significantly lower risk of a sustained decline in the eGFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes after dapagliflozin treatment compared to placebo in patients with CKD regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. An SGLT2 inhibitor should be prescribed to reduce renal hyperfiltration and to protect the kidneys in patients with T2D.
Prescribe an ACEI or ARB, but not as combined therapy at the same time, in case of microalbuminuria or hypertension.
Monitor potassium and creatinine levels and GFR if ACEI, ARB, or diuretics are used
Avoid nephrotoxic drugs, such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides, and iodinated contrast media.

Consult a Nephrologist in the Following Circumstances

If GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.
When an accelerated decrease in GFR occurs (> 15% in 12 months).
In case of increase in serum creatinine (> 20% from baseline).
In case of persistent albuminuria despite treatment (> 30 mg/dL).

ACE inhibitors or ARBs for CKD with albuminuria — clinical utility: In "stages 1 to 3 CKD and severely increased urine albumin excretion", either ACE inhibitors or ARBs "should be considered as first-line agents unless there are contraindications", and "In individuals with severely increased urine albumin excretion, ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce the risk of kidney end points, such as rate of eGFR decline, 50% decline in eGFR, and incident kidney failure".

### Therapeutic perspective: starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker in a diabetic patient [^115ou4Sc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

There are extensive data confirming involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Blockade of the system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is regarded as the first-line approach to managing hypertension and end-organ protection in patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are still the preferred agents for most patients. Dose should be lower with renal impairment unless an agent which is not excreted by the kidneys is chosen. Dose should be titrated up to the maximum tolerated to optimize end-organ protection, and intermediate-acting agents should be given in a twice daily divided dose when higher doses are used. Electrolytes should be checked before commencing, 1–2 weeks later, and after each dose increment. A modest decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increase in creatinine often occurs with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. The agents may need to be discontinued if eGFR decreases by > 15%, if creatinine increases by > 20%, or if hyperkalemia develops. Cough occurs in 5–10% of patients taking ACE inhibitor, but not with ARBs. Angioedema is probably equally common with ACE inhibitor or ARBs. It is not widely appreciated that ACE inhibitors may precipitate hypoglycaemia in patients taking glucose-lowering medication. The combination of ACE inhibitor and ARB is not routinely indicated for either hypertension or end-organ protection. While patients should not be denied the undoubted benefits of these important classes of drugs, we should also guard against their indiscriminate use in patients with diabetes. We must also ensure that patients receive appropriate counselling and monitoring.
