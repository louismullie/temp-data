## Question

Chairi 1 malformation symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of Chiari malformation type 1, including common, atypical, spinal cord–related, and age-specific features. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and MRI-based diagnostic criteria. Then, I should delineate the most prevalent symptom clusters and their relative specificity. Next, I will examine headache phenotypes and their pathophysiologic correlates. After that, I will review non-headache neurological and cranial nerve manifestations. I will then assess syringomyelia-related findings and spinal signs. I should also consider age-specific phenotypes in infants versus older children and adults. Finally, I will integrate sleep-related symptoms, key comorbid associations, and how natural history and guidelines shape when symptoms should prompt intervention, while continuously verifying claims against the best-available evidence [^112kRCZu] [^111qU7mw].

> Let me first confirm the terminology and diagnostic benchmark because precision here underpins the entire symptom discussion. The term is Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1), defined radiologically by cerebellar tonsillar descent of about 5 mm or more below the foramen magnum on MRI, with recognition that entities like Chiari 0 can present with overlapping symptoms despite minimal or absent descent, which complicates strict cutoffs and clinical correlations [^112kRCZu] [^111qU7mw]. I need to ensure I also anchor prevalence carefully; modern MRI series suggest CM1 is increasingly detected, with estimates in the low single digits percent range on imaging, though many are incidental and asymptomatic, which impacts how we interpret symptom causality in a given patient [^112kRCZu].

> Next, I should outline the major symptom domains before diving into specifics, and I will double-check that I am not over-attributing nonspecific symptoms to CM1. Headache is the most common presenting complaint across cohorts, followed by neck pain and a range of vestibulocerebellar, ocular, cranial nerve, and sleep-related manifestations, with considerable heterogeneity and frequent coexisting primary headache disorders, which means I must interpret the history in context and avoid premature causal attribution [^111oafQE] [^1148uoZd] [^115iKNVc].

> Now, regarding headaches, I will start with the classic "cough" or Valsalva-induced suboccipital pain because it is the most specific pattern for CM1 pathophysiology. Classically, these are brief, paroxysmal occipital or suboccipital headaches triggered by coughing, laughing, or straining and often respond well to decompression, consistent with impaired craniocervical CSF dynamics; hold on, I initially thought "pathognomonic", but that is too strong because overlap exists and not every cough headache is due to CM1, so I should correct that and say "highly specific" rather than pathognomonic [^111oafQE] [^116o6p65] [^11693naP]. Atypical headache phenotypes, including migraine-like or tension-type–like patterns, are common but less reliably linked to obstructed CSF flow and tend to improve less with surgery, so I need to verify primary headache management is optimized before attributing them to CM1 [^114E1MZL] [^111oafQE].

> I will now examine the non-headache neurological constellation, and I should confirm I am prioritizing findings with a plausible anatomic substrate at the craniocervical junction. Patients describe neck pain, dizziness or vertigo, imbalance and gait ataxia, limb dysmetria, and a spectrum of ocular and cranial nerve signs, including downbeat nystagmus, diplopia, blurred vision, dysphagia, dysarthria, tinnitus, and hearing changes, all of which can be explained by crowding at the foramen magnum and brainstem–cerebellar involvement, though each remains individually nonspecific and requires correlation with imaging and exam [^115iKNVc] [^111ZP6p9] [^117Qax8c].

> Hold on, I should not overlook syringomyelia, because its presence reshapes the symptom profile and urgency. Syringomyelia coexists in a meaningful minority of CM1 patients and contributes central cord–type findings such as dissociated sensory loss, a "cape-like" distribution of numbness, intrinsic hand muscle atrophy, upper-extremity weakness, hyperreflexia, spasticity, and progressive myelopathy; rare focal presentations, like unilateral foot drop, have been reported but are exceptional and mandate thorough differential evaluation for peripheral causes first [^1148uoZd] [^117GEhMU] [^114yEXCb]. Let me verify the pathophysiology link as well: CSF flow obstruction at the foramen magnum is central, with pre-syrinx interstitial edema patterns observed and often regressing after decompression, which aligns with clinical improvement when CSF dynamics are restored [^1162ZLrg] [^112kRCZu].

> I need to consider age-specific phenotypes next, and I should double-check that I accurately separate infant presentations from older children and adults. In infants and toddlers, oropharyngeal dysfunction, feeding difficulty, and failure to thrive can predominate, while preschool-age children show higher rates of syringomyelia and scoliosis, whereas older children and adults more often report Valsalva-provoked headaches and neck pain; hmm, wait a minute, the original note had a truncated "Syringomy… " — I should clarify that refers to syringomyelia as a prominent feature in early childhood subsets [^1148Ah9j] [^1148uoZd].

> But wait, what about sleep and respiratory symptoms that can masquerade as nonspecific morning headache or school-day fatigue. Central and obstructive sleep apnea are described with CM1 and can present with morning headaches, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive complaints; however, I should confirm testing indications, as guidelines state there is insufficient evidence for routine sleep studies in CM1 without sleep complaints, while case observations highlight that unrecognized sleep-disordered breathing can exacerbate intracranial pressure, particularly in children with syringomyelia [^112k2UAp] [^111c6TY6] [^116ckQ7W].

> I should review associated conditions and differentials to avoid anchoring bias. CM1 occurs with and can be influenced by connective tissue disorders, craniosynostosis syndromes, neurofibromatosis type 1, and metabolic bone conditions like X-linked hypophosphatemia; recognition matters because comorbid skull base or posterior fossa constraints, skeletal anomalies, and genetic traits can modify symptom patterns and management sequencing, and there are also overlapping entities like Chiari 0 that complicate strict symptom-imaging correlations [^115iKNVc] [^114dFF1C] [^1152SnB7] [^11183NLN] [^112fP28o].

> Hold on, let me verify how natural history informs the symptom conversation, because not all imaging-defined CM1 leads to progressive symptoms. Many incidentally discovered or minimally symptomatic patients remain stable or improve with conservative management, with prospective and retrospective cohorts showing generally stable quality of life and low rates of progression to surgery in "benign" CM1; in line with this, contemporary guidelines advise against prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic CM1 without a syrinx, though a subset can evolve and warrants periodic clinical and MRI follow-up tailored to symptoms [^112AiWJZ] [^115M1dpn] [^116zMQhH] [^113xCefD].

> I should now tie symptoms to evidence-based management implications, carefully avoiding overpromising outcomes. Strain-related suboccipital headaches with supportive imaging and CSF flow impairment are more likely to improve after foramen magnum decompression, whereas atypical headache phenotypes show a more variable response and should first receive optimized primary headache care; presence of a syrinx generally strengthens the indication for decompression, and CSF flow cine MRI can assist in prognostication by identifying obstructed versus relatively normal hindbrain flow, which correlates with symptom response and recurrence risk after surgery [^116NxNE2] [^115ucpUm] [^116u6DVC] [^116P1usf] [^114E1MZL] [^111oafQE].

> In summary, I need to ensure that when a patient presents with suspected CM1 symptoms, I synthesize a history emphasizing Valsalva-provoked suboccipital pain, screen for cerebellar and cranial nerve signs, actively assess for syringomyelia-related myelopathy, remain alert to sleep-disordered breathing in those with suggestive features, and contextualize everything against MRI anatomy and CSF dynamics, recognizing that atypical headaches are common and not automatically attributable to CM1; this measured, reference-guided approach reduces misattribution and aligns symptom interpretation with the underlying pathophysiology and guideline-based care pathways [^111qU7mw] [^112kRCZu] [^113xCefD].

Chiari I malformation most commonly presents with **suboccipital headaches** that worsen with Valsalva [^111ZP6p9], along with neck pain and dizziness or imbalance [^115iKNVc]. Syringomyelia-related symptoms include **cape-like sensory loss**, hand weakness/atrophy, and scoliosis [^1148uoZd] [^117GEhMU]. Brainstem compression can cause dysphagia, dysarthria [^115iKNVc], and respiratory disturbances such as **central sleep apnea** [^112k2UAp]. Visual disturbances, tinnitus, and cranial nerve deficits may occur [^115iKNVc], while children may present with scoliosis [^1148uoZd] or developmental delays. Symptoms vary and may **progress** [^112kRCZu], especially with syringomyelia or significant tonsillar descent [^111ZP6p9] [^116XkUvD].

---

## Headache and neck pain

**Suboccipital headache** is the hallmark symptom [^111ZP6p9], typically precipitated or worsened by Valsalva maneuvers (coughing, sneezing, straining) [^116o6p65]. Neck pain often accompanies the headache and reflects compression at the cervicomedullary junction [^115iKNVc] [^1148uoZd].

---

## Neurological symptoms

- **Dizziness and imbalance**: Common [^111ZP6p9] due to cerebellar involvement, leading to ataxia and coordination difficulties [^115evbBp].

- **Sensory disturbances**: Numbness, tingling, or paresthesia, particularly in the upper extremities, often associated with syringomyelia [^117GEhMU].

- **Motor weakness**: Progressive weakness, especially in the hands and arms, sometimes presenting as unilateral foot drop [^114yEXCb].

- **Syringomyelia-related symptoms**: Cape-like sensory loss, hand weakness/atrophy, and scoliosis [^1148uoZd] [^117GEhMU].

---

## Brainstem and cranial nerve involvement

- **Dysphagia and dysarthria**: Difficulty swallowing and speech disturbances due to lower cranial nerve compression [^1148uoZd] [^115iKNVc].

- **Respiratory disturbances**: Central sleep apnea and other sleep-related breathing disorders from brainstem compression [^112k2UAp].

- **Cranial nerve deficits**: Rarely, hemifacial spasm and other cranial nerve abnormalities may occur [^111yhQbG].

---

## Visual and auditory symptoms

Visual disturbances include blurred vision, diplopia, and especially **downbeat nystagmus** [^111ZP6p9] [^117Qax8c]. Auditory symptoms, though less common, include **tinnitus** and **hearing loss** [^115iKNVc].

---

## Pediatric-specific symptoms

- **Scoliosis**: Common in children, often associated with syringomyelia [^1148uoZd] [^116D2d2z].

- **Developmental delays**: Motor and cognitive delays may occur, particularly in younger children.

- **Oropharyngeal dysfunction**: Feeding difficulties and abnormal movements related to brainstem involvement [^1148uoZd] [^113TTVUN].

---

## Symptom progression and variability

Symptoms can **worsen over time** [^112kRCZu], especially with syringomyelia or significant tonsillar descent [^111ZP6p9] [^116XkUvD]. However, severity and progression vary widely — some patients remain stable, whereas others deteriorate rapidly [^112AiWJZ] [^116zMQhH].

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^111ZP6p9]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Chiari I malformation (CIM) is made not clinically but by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is defined by a downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils ≥ 5 mm through the foramen magnum. This type of cerebellar tonsillar descent occurs in approximately 0.1% of adults, predominantly affects women, and is often associated with syringomyelia and, in some cases, scoliosis.

Symptoms tend to begin in adulthood with typical paroxysmal 'cough headache' — induced or exacerbated by laughing, coughing, or the Valsalva maneuver and lasting seconds to a few minutes. However, migrainous headaches with classical accompanying symptoms, such as sensory phobia or nausea, and tension-type-like (TTH) headaches have also been described as associated with CIM. Not all patients with CIM present with headaches; symptoms like vertigo, dizziness, and gait disturbances have also been described. Less frequently, patients present with neurological signs or oculomotor disturbances such as downbeat nystagmus. Diagnostically, MRI of the craniocervical junction is the method of choice, showing a descent of one or both cerebellar tonsils from the McRae (basion-opisthion) line, with or without accompanying syringomyelia.

### Chiari malformation type 1 presenting as unilateral progressive foot drop: a case report and review of literature [^114yEXCb]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Identification of the exact cause is the most important component of the management of foot drop. Causes are diverse, consisting of a broad range of pathologies; however, lesions in the peripheral nervous system, which include common peroneal neuropathy, L5 radiculopathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, hereditary neuropathies, mononeuritis multiplex, and anterior horn cell diseases, predominate. Rarely, central lesions including brain tumors and tuberculomas can cause foot drop. In this report, we have described an extremely rare presentation of a central lesion, Chiari malformation type 1, presenting as unilateral foot drop.

Chiari malformations refer to a spectrum of congenital hindbrain abnormalities affecting structural relationships between the cerebellum, brain stem, the upper cervical cord, and the bony cranial base. Chiari malformation type 1 is the most common form, which usually presents with headache, neck pain, urinary frequency, and progressive lower-extremity spasticity during adolescence or adulthood. It is characterized by the displacement of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum, resulting in impaction of the foramen magnum, compression of the cervicomedullary junction by the herniating tonsils, and interruption of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the region. Disordered CSF flow may result in syringomyelia, which usually presents with 'central cord symptoms': numbness followed by the development of atrophy and weakness in the upper extremities.

### Chiari type I malformation in a pediatric population [^1148uoZd]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of Chiari I malformation in children remains unclear. Therefore, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted. Radiology reports from all head and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 5248) performed among 741,815 children under age 20 within Kaiser Northern California, 1997–1998, were searched for Chiari I. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed to determine clinical and radiographic predictors of significant neurologic symptoms, defined as moderate to severe headache, neck pain, vertigo, or ataxia. The 51 patients identified with Chiari I represented 1% of the children who had head or spine magnetic resonance imaging scans performed during the study period. Headache (55%) and neck pain (12%) were the most common symptoms. Syringomyelia was present in 6 patients (12%) at initial diagnosis; no new syrinxes developed during follow-up.

Older age at the time of diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of headache (odds ratio OR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.1–1.5) and significant neurologic symptoms (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.04–1.4). Chiari I, an underrecognized cause of headaches in children, is also frequently discovered incidentally in children without symptoms. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment of pediatric Chiari I.

### Interstitial spinal-cord oedema in syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformations [^1162ZLrg]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of syringomyelia in Chiari type 1 malformations has not been clarified. Oedema-like spinal-cord swelling was recently reported in several pathological conditions, including Chiari type 1 malformations as a pre-syrinx state. However, the role of the pre-syrinx state in the development of syringomyelia is unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the parenchymal changes of the spinal cord in syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformations.

- **Methods**: Pre- and postoperative MRI findings in 14 patients who underwent foramen magnum decompression in our institute were reviewed. The analysis was focused on differences in visualisation of the syrinx between T1- and T2-weighted images and abnormal parenchymal signal changes. There were 6 men and 8 women, aged from 6 to 79 years. No patients showed hydrocephalus.

- **Results**: Twelve patients had large and expansive syrinx, whereas 2 patients showed small syrinx confined to the centre of the spinal cord. T2-weighted images displayed significantly larger intramedullary abnormal signal areas. Nine patients showed parenchymal hyperintensity areas around the enlarged central canal or base of the posterior white columns adjacent to the syringomyelic cavity. Such parenchymal hyperintensity areas markedly diminished with reduction of the syrinx after surgery and were considered to be interstitial oedema.

- **Conclusions**: From this study, the interstitial oedema of the spinal cord commonly accompanies syringomyelia with Chiari type 1 malformations. Accumulation of the extracellular fluid due to disturbance likely plays a role in the pathophysiology.

### Clinical phenotypes among patients with familial forms of Chiari malformation type 1 [^113HgWvz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common neurological disorder of the craniocervical junction. CM1 is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar herniation below the foramen magnum, causing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obstruction and neural compression. Patients with CM1 suffer from highly variable symptoms, progression, comorbidities, and outcomes, partly due to a poor understanding of CM1 pathogenesis. In this paper, the authors present the only familial CM1 cohort study to statistically assess intrafamilial clinical phenotypes at the time of writing.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive medical, surgical, and family histories and neuroimaging were collected from families with multiple CM1-affected family members. Univariate analysis was performed for each symptom, comorbidity, or surgery to compare observed versus expected frequencies of affected patients with another CM1-affected family member with the same clinical characteristic.

- **Results**: Twenty-four new familial CM1 cases (totaling 57 patients with CM1) are presented. Intrafamilial similarities were identified for age of onset, symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.007) and neck pain (p = 0.018), neurological comorbidities such as syringomyelia (p = 0.003) and hydrocephalus (p = 0.0001), neurodevelopmental conditions such as dyslexia (p < 0.0001), and connective tissue disorders (CTDs) such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that CM1 and its associated clinical phenotypes, including age of onset, clinical symptoms, neurological comorbidities, neurodevelopmental conditions, and CTDs, are genetically influenced.

### Correlation of cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics and headache in Chiari I malformation [^116o6p65]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The management of patients with a Chiari I malformation who present with headaches alone remains unclear. This study explored the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics in Chiari I malformation patients presenting solely with headaches to identify headache types associated with CSF flow obstruction versus those potentially unrelated to Chiari I malformations.

- **Methods**: Preoperative cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical junction was prospectively performed in 33 patients presenting with headaches alone and a Chiari I malformation (tonsillar ectopia > 5 mm below the foramen magnum). Headaches were classified as frontal, occipital, or generalized. CSF flow dynamics were then prospectively compared with presenting symptomatology. A subgroup of 17 patients underwent surgical decompression of the Chiari I malformations.

- **Results**: Patients with frontal or generalized headaches were 10-fold less likely to demonstrate obstructed CSF flow (odds ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.02–0.52) and 8-fold less likely to have tonsillar descent greater than 7 mm (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.62) compared with patients with occipital headaches. Adjusting for the degree of tonsillar herniation in multivariate analysis, frontal and generalized headaches remained independently associated with nonobstructed CSF flow pathological findings, whereas occipital headaches remained associated with obstructed CSF flow independent of tonsil location (odds ratio, 5.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–34.28).

In the surgical group, all patients with occipital headaches and obstructed CSF flow findings were included in the analysis.

### Chiari type 1 malformation in a pseudotumour cerebri patient: Is it an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation [^112xasUq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is a developmental abnormality of the cerebellar tonsils. Patients with CM1 commonly present with headaches. Papilloedema is rarely seen in CM1. However, a 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a headache, and her ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema. Her cranial MRI was consistent with borderline CM1. The presence of bilateral papilloedema and headache suggested idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the preliminary diagnosis. IIH is a rare case in CM1. This article explores this association and discusses whether it is an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation.

### Clinical, radiological, and genetic similarities between patients with Chiari type I and type 0 malformations [^112fP28o]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Although Chiari Type I (CM-I) and Type 0 (CM-0) malformations have been previously characterized clinically and radiologically, there have been no studies focusing on the possible genetic link between these disorders. The goal of this study was to identify families in whom CM-0 and CM-I co-occurred and to further assess the similarities between these disorders.

- **Methods**: Families were ascertained through a proband with CM-I. Detailed family histories were obtained to identify first-degree relatives diagnosed with CM-0. Several criteria were used to exclude individuals with acquired forms of CM-I and/or syringomyelia. Individuals were excluded with syndromic, traumatic, infectious, or tumor-related syringomyelia, as well as CM-I due to a supratentorial mass, hydrocephalus, history of cervical or cranial surgery unrelated to CM-I, or development of symptoms following placement of a lumbar shunt. Medical records and MR images were used to characterize CM-I and CM-0 individuals clinically and radiologically.

- **Results**: Five families were identified in which the CM-I proband had a first-degree relative with CM-0. Further assessment of affected individuals showed similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, although CM-I patients generally had more severe symptoms and skull base abnormalities than their CM-0 relatives. Overall, both groups showed improvement in symptoms and/or syrinx size following craniocervical decompression surgery.

- **Conclusions**: There is accumulating evidence suggesting that CM-0 and CM-I may be caused by a common unde.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Surgical interventions [^115ucpUm]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Chiari malformation, specifically with respect to indications for surgery, the CNS 2023 guidelines recommend considering the resection or reduction of cerebellar tonsil tissue. This approach aims to improve the syrinx and/or symptoms in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 with a syrinx undergoing posterior fossa decompression.

### Surgical treatment of Chiari I malformation: Indications and approaches [^112PpnEX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation is a well-described entity characterized by hindbrain herniation through the foramen magnum. Although the exact origin of congenital Chiari I malformation is unknown, it appears to be caused by a mismatch between the volume of the posterior fossa neural elements and the posterior fossa cranial content. Several theories have been proposed to describe the resultant pathophysiology of this mismatch. It is clear, however, that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow and velocity play a role in the symptoms and signs associated with this disorder. The authors will review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for patients with Chiari I malformation.

### An unusual presentation of Chiari I malformation [^111oXFYR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The most typical symptom of Chiari malformation type I in children is headache. The authors describe a 14-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of gait decline and no headache, which is very unusual. After surgery to correct the Chiari I malformation, the patient's gait improved; however, she went on to develop decreased hand use with joint deformities. She was diagnosed with a probable connective tissue disorder. Patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for developing Chiari I malformation. The authors discuss the possible reasons for the unusual presentation of the Chiari I malformation and possible mechanisms. The unusual presentation of Chiari I delayed this young patient's diagnosis and treatment.

### Chiari I malformation and neurofibromatosis type 1 [^1152SnB7]. Pediatric Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Single case reports exist in the medical literature of patients with tonsillar ectopia, specifically Chiari I malformation and neurofibromatosis type 1. However, large series of patients with either of these conditions have not been examined for the presence of both defects. We have retrospectively examined two large groups of pediatric patients:

- **Group I**: Patients with the primary diagnosis of Chiari I malformation, who have undergone posterior fossa decompression for symptomatology. Of 130 surgically addressed Chiari I malformations, we determined that 5.4% of these patients had the additional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1.

- **Group II**: Patients observed in our hospital's neurofibromatosis clinic for evaluation. Of the 198 patients who underwent imaging of the brain, 8.6% were found to have a concomitant Chiari I malformation.

These data suggest that Chiari I malformation and neurofibromatosis type 1 are not spurious findings but rather true associations. We hypothesize that the same early dysgenesis of mesoderm, widely accepted as a culprit in the genesis of many Chiari I malformations, is the same pathology affecting primitive development of tissues involved in many patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Perhaps these data will aid in the determination of a genetic locus for the Chiari I malformation.

### Abnormal movements associated with oropharyngeal dysfunction in a child with Chiari I malformation [^113TTVUN]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old boy was evaluated for a two-month history of atypical movements presenting in the evening and lasting an hour after eating. These stereotypical movements, with the head and chest bending forward and to the left side, accompanied by a grimace, were associated with a sensation of breath locking without cyanosis. Pain and dysphagia were absent. The neurological examination was normal. The possibility of Sandifer syndrome posturing occurring with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was considered, but neither pain nor back hyperextension was associated with the atypical movements. Proton pump inhibitors did not improve his symptoms. Various prokinetic agents (metoclopramide, motilium, cisapride, and erythromycin) were also ineffective.

Upper endoscopy and esophageal biopsy did not reveal eosinophilic esophagitis or other abnormalities. An ENT exam was normal. A severe gastroparesis was demonstrated on a milkscan study. Two 24-hour esophageal pH probe studies pointed out severe gastroesophageal reflux. High-resolution manometric evaluation of the esophagus revealed normal sphincter pressures and relaxations with no dysmotility of the esophageal body. Electroencephalography and polysomnography were normal. Because of the unexplained dyspnea associated with this abnormal posture, a head MRI was performed and revealed a Chiari malformation type I: cerebellar tonsils extending to 12 mm, with syringomyelia (D4-D5).

- **Figure 1**: Cerebellar tonsils herniation on magnetic resonance imaging: Chiari malformation type I.

For a long period of time, the child's abnormal movements were only considered to be tics.

### Patients with "benign" Chiari I malformations require surgical decompression at a low rate [^115M1dpn]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

There are sparse published data on the natural history of "benign" Chiari I malformation (CM-I) — i.e. Chiari with minimal or no symptoms at presentation and no imaging evidence of syrinx, hydrocephalus, or spinal cord signal abnormality. The purpose of this study was to review a large cohort of children with benign CM-I and to determine whether these children become symptomatic and require surgical treatment.

Patients were identified from institutional outpatient records using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnosis codes for CM-I from 1996 to 2016. After reviewing the medical records, patients were excluded if they 1) did not have a diagnosis of CM-I, 2) were not evaluated by a neurosurgeon, 3) had previously undergone posterior fossa decompression, or 4) had imaging evidence of syringomyelia at their first appointment. To include only patients with benign Chiari (without syrinx or classic Chiari symptoms that could prompt immediate intervention), any patient who underwent decompression within 9 months of initial evaluation was excluded. After a detailed chart review, patients were excluded if they had classical Chiari malformation symptoms at presentation. The authors then determined what changes in the clinical picture prompted surgical treatment. Patients were excluded from the multivariate logistic regression analysis if they had missing data such as race and insurance; however, these patients were included in the overall survival analysis.

A total of 427 patients were included for analysis with a median follow-up period not disclosed.

### Clinical outcome of different surgical approaches for symptomatic Chiari malformation without syringomyelia: A 13-year retrospective study [^112PU2LE]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation is a condition that disrupts cerebrospinal fluid circulation. While previous studies have extensively explored the symptoms, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes for patients with Chiari malformation accompanied by syringomyelia, there is limited research focused on those without syringomyelia. This study aims to evaluate the symptoms, treatments, intradural findings, and clinical outcomes in patients with Chiari malformation without syringomyelia.

This single-center, retrospective study analyzed 148 patients diagnosed with Chiari malformation without syringomyelia between January 2010 and September 2022. Patients underwent one of two surgical approaches: posterior fossa decompression (PFD) or posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD). Data on clinical symptoms, intradural findings, surgical outcomes, and postoperative complications were collected and analyzed.

A total of 148 patients were included in the study, with 30 undergoing PFD and 118 receiving PFDD. Patients treated with PFDD showed significantly improved CCOS scores compared to those treated with PFD (12.8 ± 1.9 vs. 11.8 ± 2.5, P = 0.018). Symptom improvement rates were comparable between the two groups. Among PFDD patients, over 80% exhibited intradural abnormalities, with 28.4% classified as severe. Severe intradural abnormalities were strongly associated with higher rates of Valsalva-provoked pain (59.5% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.001). PFDD significantly improves CCOS scores compared to PFD, highlighting its potential as a more effective surgical approach for Chiari malformation without syringomyelia.

### Use of deep learning in the MRI diagnosis of Chiari malformation type I [^112kRCZu]. Neuroradiology (2022). High credibility.

Chiari malformations are a group of disorders characterized by anatomical abnormalities of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) with involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem. Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common Chiari malformation. The precise frequency of CM1 is not known; however, since the advent of MRI, CM1 has been increasingly detected with some studies estimating a prevalence of 1–3.6%. The precise natural history of CM1 has not been established, and management is generally indicated for patients with severe symptoms, progressive neurological deficits, or those affected by significant syringomyelia with the goal of alleviating symptoms and preventing neurological deterioration. Diagnosis of CM1 rests on identification of displacement of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. Currently, it is most widely accepted that a herniation of 5 mm or more is the minimum criterion for diagnosis of CM1.

More recently, there has also been recognition of intermediate Chiari subtypes with clinical entities such as the Chiari 0 malformation that is not associated with any cerebellar tonsillar herniation, challenging the widely used 5 mm cutoff for CM1. There are other radiological findings that are known to be associated with CM1 such as syringomyelia, hydrocephalus, and skeletal anomalies such as platybasia and a hypoplastic posterior cranial fossa. As there are no other tissue or blood biomarkers for CM1, diagnosis currently relies on neuroimaging primarily through MRI and identification of the known associated neuroanatomical anomalies.

### Guideline on treatment and management of craniosynostosis: Patient and family version [^114dFF1C]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Chiari-specific factors**: Which Chiari-specific factors play a role in the decision whether or not to treat? It is possible that 17% to 50% of patients with Crouzon-Pfeiffer or multisuture craniosynostosis will still develop complaints and symptoms, therefore requiring surgery.

- **Determining operation necessity**: What are the factors that determine whether an operation is necessary, which operation will be performed, and at what time this will be done? The factors important in determining these aspects are not fully known. Several types of operations have been described for Chiari treatment, including widening of the foramen magnum before or after an occipital expansion, either before the onset of or after the development of symptoms.

- **Recommendations**:
	- **Question 10.1**:
		1. Screen patients with nonsyndromic unilateral lambdoid suture synostosis, children with Crouzon/Pfeiffer syndrome, and multisuture craniosynostosis with fused lambdoid sutures immediately by MRI scan in the specialist center. Repeat the MRI at the ages of 4 and 18 years, and when there are complaints that may indicate a Chiari. Screen for the presence of a syrinx by doing an MRI scan of the spinal cord at the neck, chest, and lower back level (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar myelum) if the diagnosed Chiari increases and/or becomes symptomatic.
		2. Surgical treatment of Chiari is only recommended if the patient has complaints; otherwise, an active follow-up policy is pursued by the pediatric neurosurgeon.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Symptoms [^113xCefD]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Chiari malformation, specifically concerning indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients, the CNS 2023 guidelines recommend not performing prophylactic surgery in patients with asymptomatic Chiari malformation type 1 without syrinx. It is important to recognize that there is a small percentage of patients who may develop new or worsening symptoms in the future.

### A case of sleep-disordered breathing presenting with increased intracranial pressure in a child with type 1 Chiari malformation [^116ckQ7W]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing, with both central and obstructive sleep apneas, has been reported in association with Chiari malformation type 1. Chiari malformation type 1 is a congenital or acquired herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. In this case, a 5-year-old girl with a history of Chiari malformation type 1 and syringomyelia experienced worsening intracranial pressure secondary to sleep-disordered breathing. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of sleep-related respiratory disorders in patients with Chiari malformation and its association with increased intracranial pressure.

### Divergence insufficiency alleviated by posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty in a patient with Chiari type 1.5 malformation [^117Qax8c]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The authors present a case of Chiari type 1.5 malformation with the uncommon presenting symptoms of esotropia and diplopia due to divergence insufficiency in a 12-year-old girl. Imaging at initial diagnosis revealed cerebellar herniation with extension of the tonsils to the C2 vertebral body, a retroflexed odontoid, and a small cervical syrinx. The patient was initially treated with an uncomplicated Chiari malformation decompression without dural opening. Repeat imaging revealed an adequate decompression. Three months postoperatively, the patient's diplopia recurred, and she underwent repeat posterior fossa decompression with dural opening and duraplasty. Following repeat decompression with dural opening and duraplasty, the patient's diplopia had not recurred by the 2-year follow-up.

### Prevalence and treatment of typical and atypical headaches in patients with Chiari I malformation: A meta-analysis and literature review [^111oafQE]. Cephalalgia (2023). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the incidence of typical and atypical headaches and outcomes following various treatments in patients with Chiari I malformation. Headache is the most common symptom of Chiari malformation, which can be divided into typical and atypical subgroups to facilitate management. Much controversy surrounds the etiology, prevalence, and optimal therapeutic approach for both types of headaches.

Relevant studies published before 30 July 2022 were identified with an electronic search of numerous literature databases. The results of this study were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. A total of 1913 Chiari malformation type I (CIM) patients were identified; 78% of whom presented with headache. Within this group, cephalalgia was typical in 48%, atypical in 29% of patients, and migraine was the most common type of atypical headache. The ratio of typical/atypical headaches with an international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.53, and without such diagnosis was 1.56, respectively.

- **Improvement rates**: The pooled improvement rates of typical headaches following conservative treatment, extradural decompression, and intradural decompression were 69%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The corresponding improvement rates for atypical headaches were 70%, 57.47%, and 69%, respectively. The complication rate in the extradural decompression group was significantly lower than in the intradural decompression group (RR, 0.31; 95%).

### Brace treatment for scoliosis secondary to Chiari malformation type 1 or syringomyelia without neurosurgical intervention: A matched comparison with idiopathic scoliosis [^116D2d2z]. European Spine Journal (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of brace treatment in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) or syringomyelia-associated scoliosis without neurosurgical intervention, a retrospective case-control study was conducted. Thirty-four CM-1 or syringomyelia (CMS) patients who received brace treatment without neurosurgical intervention were recruited. Another 68 matched patients with idiopathic scoliosis who received bracing served as the control group. The matching criteria included gender, age (± 1 year), Risser sign (± 1 grade), initial curve magnitude (± 5°), curve patterns, and follow-up time (± 6 months). Patients who encountered curve progression and scoliosis surgery were compared between different groups.

Until the last visit, 16 (47%) patients in the CMS group and 18 (26%) patients in the idiopathic scoliosis (IS) group experienced curve progression; 9 (26%) patients and 15 (22%) patients underwent scoliosis surgery, respectively. Compared to idiopathic scoliosis, patients with CMS-associated scoliosis had a significantly higher rate of curve progression (P = 0.038). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the rate of surgery (P = 0.867). Patients with combined CM-1 and syringomyelia had a higher rate of surgery than patients with isolated CM-1 or syringomyelia (P = 0.049). The double major curve pattern was identified as a risk factor for curve progression.

In conclusion, brace treatment is effective for CMS-associated scoliosis without neurosurgical intervention. Compared to idiopathic scoliosis, the brace can provide similar prevention for scoliosis surgery.

### Comparison of posterior fossa volumes and clinical outcomes after decompression of Chiari malformation Type I [^117LUNJA]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to address the association between Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) and a small posterior fossa. Previous research has largely been limited by 2D quantitative methods. More recent studies have employed 3D methodologies, though these are often time-intensive and require manual segmentation. The authors sought to develop a more automated tool to calculate the 3D posterior fossa volume and correlate its changes after decompression with surgical outcomes.

A semiautomated segmentation program was developed and used to compare the pre- and postoperative volumes of the posterior cranial fossa (PCF) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, including the cisterna magna, prepontine cistern, and fourth ventricle, in a cohort of pediatric patients with CM-I. Volume changes were correlated with postoperative symptomatic improvements in headache, syrinx, tonsillar descent, cervicomedullary kinking, and overall surgical success.

Forty-two pediatric patients were included in this study. The mean percentage increase in PCF volume was significantly greater in patients who showed clinical improvement compared to those with no improvement in headache (5.89% vs. 1.54%, p < 0.05) and tonsillar descent (6.52% vs. 2.57%, p < 0.05). Overall clinical success was associated with a larger postoperative PCF volume increase (p < 0.05). These clinical improvements were also significantly associated with a larger increase in the volume of the cisterna magna (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the increase in the caudal portion of the posterior fossa volume was larger in patients who showed improvement in syrinx (6.63% vs. 2.58%, p < 0.05) and cervicomedullary kinking.

### Quality-of-life outcomes in adults and children with Chiari 1 malformation and in those managed without surgery: A prospective, multicenter, observational study [^116zMQhH]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is a common MRI finding and a frequent reason for neurosurgical consultation. Although many studies have investigated surgical outcomes for patients with CM1, outcomes for those treated without surgery have been less frequently reported. The UK Chiari 1 Study reports the quality of life of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery, 12 months after the first neurosurgical clinic visit.

- **Methods**: The UK Chiari 1 Study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study of adults (≥ 16 years) and children (< 16 years) with CM1. This was an observational study that did not alter the course of clinical care. Symptoms and quality-of-life data (using Short-Form 36 in adults and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ in children) were collected at baseline and 12 months after the first clinical review for all participants.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-two patients with CM1 (146 females; 148 adults) were studied at baseline, and 113 patients with CM1 treated without surgery were studied at a 12-month follow-up. Baseline quality-of-life scores in the study cohort were significantly lower in every domain compared with normative control data, in both adults and children. There were no decreases in quality-of-life subscores after 12 months in this cohort of adults and children with CM1 treated without surgery. Social functioning (t = -40, P < .001) and bodily pain (t = -2.9; p = 0.03) Short-Form 36 scores showed improvements at 12 months in adult patients treated without surgery.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates the stability of quality-of-life measures in patients with Chiari 1 malformation who are managed without surgery over a 12-month period.

### Clinical and radiological evaluation of treated Chiari I adult patients: Retrospective study from two neurosurgical centers [^116P1usf]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). High credibility.

Chiari malformation type I (CM1) is a common neurosurgical disorder that often causes debilitation in affected patients. CM1 involves the herniation of the caudal cerebellum into the spinal canal. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty (PFDD) in treated CM1 patients. Through a retrospective design, we reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with CM1 at two neurosurgical centers over eight years, from 2010 to 2017. We selected all CM1 patients who underwent PFDD surgery (n = 72) as the core sample for this study.

- **Clinical outcomes**: We used the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS) to evaluate clinical outcomes. The mean value of CCOS was 14.1 ± 2.1.

- **Radiological assessment**: Pre- and postoperatively, we assessed the syrinx/cord ratio, the syrinx length, and the improvement of aqueductal stroke volume (ASV) on CSF flow MRIs. On midsagittal MRIs, the mean regression in ectopia tonsils was 9.4 ± 1.9 mm (i.e. mean pre- and postoperative tonsil herniation was 13.1 ± 3.1 mm and 4.0 ± 1.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001). On coronal MRIs, the mean regression in ectopia tonsils was 8.4 ± 1.5 mm (i.e. mean pre- and postoperative tonsil herniation was 13.9 ± 2.4 mm and 5.8 ± 1.0 mm, respectively; p < 0.001).

A strong positive correlation was observed between clinical improvement and the increase in ASV values. CSF flow MRIs can assist in the surgical decision-making and follow-up of CM1 patients. An ASV of ≤ 12 μl is a significant predictor for surgical intervention. Full clinical and radiological evaluations utilizing CSF flow MRI are essential. Most syrinx cavities have regressed following PFDD.

### Chiari I malformation with syrinx [^117AdETu]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The Chiari I congenital malformation is characterized by caudal displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the cervical canal. Although this malformation is often asymptomatic, coexisting syringomyelia can result in neurologic symptoms. We report a case of progressive ataxia with brainstem dysfunction in an adolescent female manifesting a severe Chiari I malformation with syrinx. Chiari decompression four years after initial presentation led to rapid improvement in most of her long-term symptoms. This case demonstrates the importance of considering Chiari I with syringomyelia in the differential diagnosis of progressive ataxia and brainstem symptoms.

### Relationship of cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging with outcome after decompression for Chiari I malformations [^116u6DVC]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Many patients with symptomatic Chiari I malformations experience symptom recurrence after surgical decompression. Identification of predictors of outcome is needed to better select patients most likely to benefit from surgical intervention. This study examined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics assessed by cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging could independently predict response to posterior fossa decompression for Chiari I malformations.

Pre- and postoperative CSF flow dynamics were assessed by cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging in 130 consecutive patients receiving posterior fossa decompression for a Chiari I malformation between 1997 and 2003. CSF flow was classified as "abnormal" if biphasic flow was either absent or decreased through the aqueduct, fourth ventricle and its outlets, the foramen magnum, or ventral or dorsal to the cervical spinal cord. If no evidence of decreased flow was noted, CSF flow was classified as "normal". The association between preoperative CSF flow dynamics, all recorded variables, and long-term outcome was assessed using multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis.

All patients had tonsil herniation more than 5 mm below the foramen magnum (average, 11 ± 5 mm). Abnormal hindbrain CSF flow was observed in 81% of patients (43% complete obstruction, 38% reduced flow). Normal CSF flow was observed in 19% of patients. In multivariate analysis, patients with normal preoperative hindbrain CSF flow were 4.8-fold more likely to experience symptom recurrence after surgery.

### Shunt malfunction causing acute neurological deterioration in 2 patients with previously asymptomatic Chiari malformation type I. Report of two cases [^1154mBZx]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) typically exhibit a chronic, slowly progressive disease course with evolution of symptoms. However, some authors have reported acute neurological deterioration in the setting of CM-I and acquired Chiari malformations. Although brainstem dysfunction has been documented in patients with CM-II and hydrocephalus or shunt malfunction, to the authors' knowledge, only one report exists describing ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunction causing neurological deterioration in a patient with CM-I. The authors report their experience with the treatment of previously asymptomatic CM-I in two children who experienced quite different manifestations of acute neurological deterioration secondary to VP shunt malfunction.

Presumably, VP shunt malfunction created a positive rostral pressure gradient across a stenotic foramen magnum, resulting in tetraparesis from foramen magnum syndrome in one patient and acute ataxia and cranial nerve deficits from syringobulbia in the other. Although urgent shunt revisions yielded partial recovery of neurological function in both patients, marked improvement occurred only after posterior fossa decompression.

### Evaluation and management of the Chiari malformation type 1 for the primary care pediatrician [^112ZBzKM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of Chiari malformation type 1 (CMI) are undergoing reexamination, which involves redefining the anatomic Chiari malformation and refining the clinical syndrome criteria. Children with CMI may present with head pain, a neurologic deficit, or signs of spinal cord dysfunction due to a syrinx. Some children, however, may show no clinical syndrome at all. The presence of an anatomic Chiari malformation or a compelling clinical Chiari syndrome should prompt evaluation by a neurologist or neurosurgeon experienced in these syndromes and their treatment. Treatment options vary but typically lead to symptom resolution. However, when symptoms persist after surgery, management becomes complex and is not uniformly successful, even in the hands of the most experienced professionals.

### Review article: Chiari type I malformation with or without syringomyelia: Prevalence and genetics [^115Rj9VP]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2003). Low credibility.

Chiari type I malformation is traditionally defined as a downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils of ≥ 5 mm through the foramen magnum. It is likely associated with a volumetrically reduced posterior fossa. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation. We estimate the prevalence of these two conditions and determine that they are more common than previously expected. We identify the genetic syndromes associated with some cases of Chiari type I malformation, and we provide evidence in favor of a genetic hypothesis for at least a subset of the nonsyndromic cases.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Diagnosis [^111qU7mw]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Chiari I malformation (CIM) is characterized by the descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, potentially causing symptoms from compression or obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis and treatment of CIM is varied, and guidelines produced through systematic review may be helpful for clinicians.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of the medical literature to answer specific questions on the diagnosis and treatment of CIM.

- **Methods**: PubMed and Embase were queried between 1946 and January 23, 2021, using the search strategies provided in Appendix I of the full guidelines.

- **Results**: The literature search yielded 567 abstracts, of which 151 were selected for full-text review. Of these, 109 were rejected for not meeting the inclusion criteria or for being off-topic, and 42 were included in this systematic review.

- **Conclusion**: Three Grade C recommendations were made based on Level III evidence. The full guidelines can be viewed online at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/1-imaging.

### Occipital nerve stimulation for refractory headache in the Chiari malformation population [^112sQKxQ]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic occipital and suboccipital headache is a common symptom in patients with Chiari I malformation. These headaches may persist despite appropriate surgical treatment of the underlying pathology via suboccipital decompression, duraplasty, and cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Occipital nerve stimulation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of occipital headache/pain syndromes.

- **Objective**: To review retrospectively our experience with occipital nerve stimulation in patients with a primary diagnosis of Chiari malformation and a history of chronic occipital pain intractable to medical and surgical therapies.

- **Methods**: We present a retrospective analysis of our series of 22 patients with Chiari malformation and persistent occipital headaches who underwent occipital neurostimulator trials and, after successful trials, permanent stimulator placement. A trial was considered successful with > 50% pain relief as assessed with a standard Visual Analog Scale score. Patients with a successful trial underwent permanent placement approximately 1 to 2 weeks later. Patients were assessed postoperatively for pain relief via the Visual Analog Scale.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight percent of patients (15 of 22) had a successful stimulator trial and proceeded to permanent implantation. Of those implanted, 87% (13 of 15) reported continued pain relief at a mean follow-up of 18.9 months (range, 6–51 months). Device-related complications requiring additional surgeries occurred in 40% of patients.

- **Conclusion**: Occipital stimulation may provide significant long-term pain relief for patients with Chiari malformation who suffer from chronic occipital headaches intractable to other treatments.

### Atypical presentation of Chiari I malformation in a 13-year-old adolescent [^113EPtmR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

In this report, we describe a 13-year-old with opisthotonos as the presenting symptom of Chiari I malformation. This presentation is rare and has previously been reported only in infants. We describe the physical and radiologic findings, literature regarding Chiari malformation, and differential diagnosis of opisthotonos in this patient.

### Hemifacial spasm associated with type 1 Chiari malformation: a retrospective study of 13 cases [^111yhQbG]. Neurosurgical Review (2017). Low credibility.

Hemifacial spasm (HFS) associated with type 1 Chiari malformation is particularly uncommon and is usually limited to isolated case reports. The aims of this study were to report the clinical correlates of patients who had simultaneous HFS and type 1 Chiari malformation and to present the outcomes of these patients treated with microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery. We retrospectively evaluated 13 patients who had both HFS and type 1 Chiari malformation among 675 HFS patients. Clinical features and radiological findings were collected from each patient and analyzed. All 13 patients were surgically treated with MVD through a retro-mastoid microsurgical approach, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. A review of the literature about this association was also provided.

In this study, the frequency of type 1 Chiari malformation in HFS patients was 1.9%. The clinical profile of this series of patients did not differ from the typical form of primary HFS. MVD achieved satisfactory results in 11 patients (85%) in both short- and long-term follow-ups. There was no mortality or severe complications postoperatively. Although rare, clinicians should be aware of the association of HFS and type 1 Chiari malformation and consider MVD as an effective surgical management option.

### Syringohydromyelia in patients with Chiari I malformation: A retrospective analysis [^117GEhMU]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

The association of syringohydromyelia with Chiari I malformation has a wide range, between 23% and 80% of cases in the literature. In our experience, this range might be overestimated compared with our observations in clinical practice. Because there is an impact of Chiari I malformation-associated syringohydromyelia on morbidity and surgical intervention, its diagnosis is critical in this patient population. Identifying related variables on the basis of imaging would also help identify those patients at risk of syrinx formation during their course of disease.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of the MR imaging studies of 108 consecutive cases of Chiari I malformation. A multitude of factors associated with syrinx formation were investigated, including demographic, morphometric, osseous, and dynamic CSF flow evaluation.

- **Results**: Thirty-nine of 108 (36.1%) patients with Chiari I malformation had syringohydromyelia. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a skull base angle (nasion-sella-basion) of 135° was found to be a statistically significant classifier of patients with Chiari I malformation with or without syringohydromyelia. Craniocervical junction osseous anomalies (OR = 4.3, P = 0.001) and a skull base angle of > 135° (OR = 4.8, P = 0.0006) were most predictive of syrinx formation. Pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) who developed syringohydromyelia were more likely to have associated skull base osseous anomalies than older individuals (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the presence of craniocervical junction anomalies and specific skull base angles are significant indicators for syrinx formation in patients with Chiari I malformation. Identifying these factors may aid in better clinical management and surgical planning for affected individuals.

### Pathogenesis of syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformation: Review of evidences and proposal of a new hypothesis [^115g8kD6]. Neurosurgical Review (2010). Low credibility.

The exact pathogenesis of syringomyelia associated with Chiari type 1 malformation is unknown, although a number of authors have reported their theories of syrinx formation. The purpose of this review is to understand the evidence based on known theories and to create a new hypothesis of the pathogenesis. We critically review the literature on clinicopathological, radiological, and clinical features of this disorder. The previously proposed theories mainly focused on the driven mechanisms of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the spinal cord, but they did not fully explain radiological features or the effects of surgical treatment, such as shunting procedures.

Common findings of the syrinx in clinicopathological studies were the communication with the central canal and extracanalicular extension to the posterior gray matter. Most magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated blockades and altered CSF dynamics at the foramen magnum but failed to show direct communication of the syrinx with the CSF spaces. Pressure studies revealed almost identical intrasyrinx pressure to the subarachnoid space and decreased compliance of the spinal CSF space. Recent imaging studies suggest that extracellular fluid accumulation may play an important role.

The review of evidence promotes a new hypothesis of syrinx formation: decreased absorption mechanisms of the extracellular fluid may underlie the pathogenesis of syringomyelia. Reduced compliance of the posterior spinal veins associated with decreased compliance of the spinal subarachnoid space will result in disturbed absorption.

### Natural and surgical history of Chiari malformation type I in the pediatric population [^116XkUvD]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The natural and surgical history of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) in pediatric patients is currently not well described. In this study, the authors discuss the clinical and radiological presentation and outcomes in a large cohort of pediatric CM-I patients treated with either conservative or surgical management.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed 95 cases involving pediatric patients with CM-I who presented between 2004 and 2013. The patients ranged in age from 9 months to 18 years (mean 8 years) at presentation, with the cohort evenly split between the sexes. Twenty-five patients underwent posterior fossa decompression (PFD) with either dural splitting or duraplasty, while seventy patients were managed without surgery. Patients were followed radiologically (mean 44.8 months, range 1.2–196.6 months) and clinically (mean 66.3 months, range 1.2–106.5 months).

- **Results**: Seventy patients were treated conservatively and followed with serial outpatient neurological and radiological examinations, whereas 25 patients were treated with PFD. Of these 25 surgical patients, 11 were treated with duraplasty (complete dural opening) and 14 were treated with a dura-splitting technique (incomplete dural opening). Surgical intervention was associated with better clinical resolution of symptoms and radiological resolution of tonsillar ectopia and syringomyelia (p = 0.0392). Over the course of follow-up, 20 (41.7%) of 48 nonsurgical patients who were symptomatic at presentation experienced improvement in symptoms, while 18 (75%) of 24 symptomatic surgical patients showed clinical improvement.

### Worsening or development of syringomyelia following Chiari I decompression: Case report [^111vMuyt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The effects of posterior fossa decompression on Chiari malformation Type I-induced syringomyelia have been well described. However, treatment of worsening syringomyelia after Chiari decompression remains enigmatic. This paper defines patient and clinical characteristics as well as treatment and postoperative radiological and clinical outcomes in patients experiencing this complication.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a retrospective review of patients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Children's of Alabama who developed worsening syringomyelia after Chiari decompression was performed.

- **Results**: Fourteen children (age range 8 months to 15 years), 7 of whom had preoperative syringomyelia, underwent posterior fossa decompression. Aseptic meningitis (n = 3) and bacterial meningitis (n = 2) complicated 5 cases (4 of these patients were originally treated at outside hospitals). Worsening syringomyelia presented a median of 1.4 years (range 0.2–10.3 years) after the primary decompression. Ten children presented with new, recurrent, or persistent symptoms, and 4 were asymptomatic. Secondary Chiari decompression was performed in 11 of the 14 children. The other 3 children were advised to undergo secondary decompression. A structural cause for each failed primary Chiari decompression (for example, extensive scarring, suture in the obex, arachnoid web, residual posterior arch of C-1, and no duraplasty) was identified at the secondary operation. After secondary decompression, 8 patients' symptoms completely resolved, 1 patient's condition stabilized.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^114E1MZL]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation typically presents with cough headache; however, migraine-like or tension-type-like headaches may also occur. There are limited publications on Chiari I malformation-associated headache semiologies and the effect of foramen magnum decompression on different headache types.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis complemented by structured phone interviews was performed on 65 patients with Chiari I malformation, treated at our hospital between 2010 and 2021. Headache semiology (according to ICHD-3), frequency, intensity, and radiological characteristics were evaluated pre- and postoperatively.

- **Results**: We included 65 patients, of which 38 were female and 27 were male. The mean age was 43.9 ± 15.7 years. Headache was predominant in 41 patients (63.0%). Twenty-one patients had cough headache, and 20 had atypical headache (12 migrainous, eight tension-type headache-like). Thirty-five patients with headache underwent surgery. Frequency, intensity, and analgesic use were significantly reduced in cough headache (p < 0.001). Atypical headaches improved less (p = 0.004 to 0.176). Exploratory analysis suggested that larger preoperative tonsillar descent correlated with larger postoperative headache intensity relief (p = 0.025).

- **Conclusion**: Decompression was effective in Chiari I malformation-related cough headache. Atypical headache responded less well, and the causal relation with Chiari I malformation remains uncertain. For atypical headache, decompression should only be considered after failed appropriate preventive therapy and within an interdisciplinary approach.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: An international working group clinical practice guideline [^11183NLN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Neurologic manifestations

Neurological complications of XLH in adults include headaches, craniosynostosis, Chiari 1 malformation, syringomyelia, spinal stenosis, spinal cord compression, tinnitus, and hearing loss. In an ongoing, multinational, prospective, longitudinal study designed to characterize disease burden, progression, and long-term outcomes in XLH (the X-linked Hypophosphatemia Disease Monitoring Program [XLH-DMP]), neurologic complications were reported in 364 affected adults. Craniosynostosis was reported in 33 out of 364 (9%), Chiari type 1 malformation in 19 out of 364 (5.2%), syringomyelia in 6 out of 364 (1.6%), and severe headache in 72 out of 364 (19.8%).

Neurological manifestations that are found more frequently in adults than in children with XLH are spinal stenosis, seen in 67 out of 364 (18.4%), and spinal cord compression, seen in 37 out of 364 (10.2%). Spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression in XLH may result from ossification of the ligamentum flava, thickening of the laminae, hypertrophy of facet joints, and intervertebral disc calcification. The XLH-DMP reports common occurrences of tinnitus (126 out of 364; 34.6%) and hearing loss (106 out of 364; 29.1%) in adults with XLH. Thus, comprehensive neurological and fundoscopic examinations should be performed in the presence of headache or other neurologic symptoms.

Hearing

Hearing loss, most often asymmetric, affects up to 34% of affected adults. Both sensorineural and conductive hearing defects may arise. The underlying mechanisms appear to involve both endolymphatic hydrops as well as osteosclerosis and thickening of the petrous bone.

### The Chiari I malformation [^115evbBp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

As with many pathologies, the course of our understanding of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) has developed extensively over time. The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia was listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role.

During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment.

The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in the understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery is crucial.

### A critical analysis of the Chiari 1.5 malformation [^1116vxYd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Although the traditional nomenclature used to describe hindbrain hernias is useful, there are certainly patients in whom these morphological entities do not strictly apply. One such group is composed of patients with the more recently described Chiari 1.5 malformation, in which a Chiari I malformation is seen in combination with brain-stem herniation through the foramen magnum. In an attempt to elucidate further the best surgical strategy and to refine the descriptive terminology, the authors retrospectively analyzed all cases at their institutions in which this form of hindbrain herniation was diagnosed.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the database for all patients in whom Chiari 1.5 malformation had been diagnosed. Each patient had undergone posterior fossa decompressive surgery. Magnetic resonance images were evaluated for the extent of caudal descent of the brainstem, amount of tonsillar ectopia, inclination of the odontoid process, and any brain or brainstem abnormalities. Clinical presentations and postoperative results were correlated to the aforementioned radiological findings.

Twenty-two patients were identified. The obex was a mean of 14.4 mm inferior to the foramen magnum, and the medulla exhibited a flattened appearance in the midsagittal plane in all patients. Syringomyelia was documented in 50% of the cases. The cerebellar tonsils were found to lie at C-1 and C-2 in nine and 13 patients, respectively. The mean angulation of the odontoid process was 84.4 degrees. No abnormalities or caudal descent of the midbrain or pons was identified.

### Prevalence and impact of underlying diagnosis and comorbidities on Chiari 1 malformation [^112BcoQ5]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 affects approximately one in 1,000 people symptomatically, although one in 100 meet radiological criteria, making it a common neurological disorder. The diagnosis of underlying conditions has become more sophisticated, and new radiological markers of the disease have been described. We sought to determine the prevalence and impact of additional comorbidities and underlying diagnoses in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 on symptomatology and surgical treatment.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 612 pediatric patients with a Chiari malformation type 1 diagnosis and imaging data evaluated between 2008 and 2018 was performed. Because of extensive clinical heterogeneity, patients were separated into four categories based on their primary comorbidities (nonsyndromic, central nervous system, skeletal, and multiple congenital anomalies) to identify associations with age of onset, radiographic measurements, syringomyelia, and surgical treatment.

- **Results**: The largest group had nonsyndromic Chiari malformation type 1 (70%) and the latest age at diagnosis of any group. In the syndromic group, 6% were diagnosed with a known genetic abnormality, with overgrowth syndromes being the most common. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies had the earliest Chiari malformation type 1 onset, the most severe tonsillar ectopia and obex position, and were overrepresented among surgical cases. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups and rates of syrinx, we observed differences in individual diagnoses.

- **Conclusion**: Th

### An unusual cause of neck pain: acquired Chiari malformation leading to brainstem herniation and death [^111C6hhB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations are structural defects where portions of the cerebellum are located below the foramen magnum. Of the four types of Chiari malformation, emergency physicians are most likely to encounter Type I (Chiari I). Chiari I malformations can be congenital or acquired. Congenital Chiari I malformations are most frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting due to an exacerbation of subacute or chronic Chiari-related symptoms. However, acute Chiari-associated symptoms from an occult congenital or a secondary (acquired) Chiari malformation may occur.

- **Objective**: To present a literature-guided approach to the identification and initial management of patients with Chiari I malformations in the ED setting.

- **Case report**: We present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to the ED with isolated cervical region pain, and who subsequently died as a result of acute brainstem herniation from an acquired Chiari I malformation.

- **Conclusions**: Although rare, acute Chiari I malformation may present to the ED. The new finding of a Chiari I malformation should be presumed acquired until proved otherwise and should trigger an evaluation for central nervous system lesions or hydrocephalus. Brain imaging to exclude increased intracranial pressure and, in certain cases, specialty consultation, are important considerations.

### The natural history of the Chiari Type I anomaly [^112AiWJZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Since the advent of MR imaging, an increasing number of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients have been diagnosed with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). The decision of whether or not to operate is more difficult in these patients than in those with clear symptoms because of the lack of information about the natural course of this disease.

- **Methods**: The authors report on their experience in a series of 22 patients with CM-I who were evaluated at the authors' institution, and for whom a conservative approach to treatment was adopted. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 16 years (mean 6.3 years) at diagnosis. Neuroradiological and complete clinical examinations were performed in all patients 6 months after the first observation and every year thereafter. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 19 years (mean 5.9 years).

- **Results**: Chiari malformation Type I was incidentally detected on MR images in 11 of 22 patients. The remaining 11 patients had minimal clinical signs at presentation that were not regarded as necessitating immediate surgical treatment. Seventeen patients (77.3%) showed progressive improvement in their symptoms or remained asymptomatic at the last follow-up whereas 5 patients (22.7%) experienced worsening, which was mild in 2 cases and required surgical correction in the remaining 3 cases. On MR imaging, a mild reduction in tonsillar herniation was appreciated in 4 patients (18.18%), with complete spontaneous resolution in 1 of these. In 16 patients, tonsillar herniation remained stable during follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: The authors' data confirm the conservative approach.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^115h61xQ]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

Typical cough-induced headache remains the mainstay of the clinical manifestation in CIM, but atypical headaches accounted for almost half of our CIM cohort. Incidental findings in imaging studies performed in primary headache patients might contribute to this. In cases with a typical cough headache, surgical decompression is effective for CIM-related headache treatment. Although migrainous and TTH-like headaches also improved after surgery, the effect was smaller and should be compared to the natural course of primary headache disorders in future studies. The present results may be useful for counseling patients with CIM regarding surgery according to their headache type and emphasize that careful history taking and, where appropriate, involvement of a neurologist are important to determine the best therapy for a given patient with CIM.

### Chiari-related hydrocephalus: Assessment of clinical risk factors in a cohort of 297 consecutive patients [^113jpnfu]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Patients treated for Chiari I malformation (CM-I) with posterior fossa decompression (PFD) may occasionally and unpredictably develop postoperative hydrocephalus. The clinical risk factors predictive of this type of Chiari-related hydrocephalus (CRH) are unknown. The authors' objective was to evaluate their experience to identify risk factors that may predict which of these patients undergoing PFD will develop CRH after surgery.

Methods: The authors performed a retrospective clinical chart review of all patients who underwent PFD surgery and duraplasty for CM-I at the Primary Children's Hospital in Utah from June 1, 2005, through May 31, 2015. Patients were dichotomized based on the need for long-term CSF diversion after PFD. Analysis included both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses.

Results: The authors identified 297 decompressive surgeries over the period of the study, 22 of which required long-term postoperative CSF diversion. On multivariable analysis, age < 6 years old (OR 3.342, 95% CI 1.282–8.713), higher intraoperative blood loss (OR 1.003, 95% CI 1.001–1.006), and the presence of a fourth ventricular web (OR 3.752, 95% CI 1.306–10.783) were significantly associated with the need for long-term CSF diversion after decompressive surgery.

Conclusions: Younger patients, those with extensive intraoperative blood loss, and those found during surgery to have a fourth ventricular web were at higher risk for the development of CRH. Clinicians should be alert to evidence of CRH in this patient population after PFD surgery.

### Abnormal movements associated with oropharyngeal dysfunction in a child with Chiari I malformation [^1148Ah9j]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Although Chiari I malformation (CM I) is increasingly detected in children, much remains unknown about its natural history. The pathophysiology of CM I and its associated anomalies has been the subject of considerable debate. Chiari I is a multifactorial condition thought to result from a congenitally small posterior fossa. Neurologic signs and symptoms may be related directly to a tight foramen magnum associated with cerebellar tonsillar herniation, which leads to compression and/or distortion of the medulla and lower cranial nerves.

In adults, the most common clinical symptoms include posterior headaches and/or neck pain exacerbated by Valsalva maneuvers. The clinical presentation of young children with CM I differs from that of older children and adults. Albert et al. showed that patients aged 0 to 2 years are much more likely to have oropharyngeal dysfunction, whereas those aged 3 to 5 years are more likely to have syringomyelia, frequently associated with scoliosis.

- **Table descriptions**: CM I pediatric presentations from published series are reported to include both operated and non-operated CM I patients. In 26 to 37% of cases, patients were asymptomatic with a fortuitous discovery. The remaining cases displayed a variety of neurological symptoms, including headaches, ataxia, sensory or motor deficits, and lower cranial abnormalities. The most common symptoms were headaches and scoliosis.

Oropharyngeal dysfunction is not frequently reported. In fact, in Tubbs' study on 500 cases of pediatric CM I, this manifestation is considered rare.

### Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1 complicated by sudden onset anterior spinal artery thrombosis, tetraparesis and respiratory arrest [^115ViwRe]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

In 1891, Chiari described a constellation of anomalies at the base of the brain inherited congenitally. The characteristics include: (1) extension of a tongue of cerebellar tissue posterior to the medulla and cord that extends into the cervical spinal canal; (2) caudal displacement of the medulla and the inferior part of the fourth ventricle into the cervical canal; and (3) a frequent but not invariable association with syringomyelia or a spinal developmental abnormality. Chiari recognized four types of abnormalities; presently, the term has come to be restricted to Chiari's types I and II, which refer to cerebellomedullary descent without and with a meningomyelocele, respectively.

The association of Arnold-Chiari malformation and high cervical cord infarction is unusual. The most common syndrome, anterior spinal artery syndrome (ASAS), is caused by interruption of blood flow to the anterior spinal artery, producing ischemia in the anterior two-thirds of the cord, resulting in neurologic deficits. Causes of ASAS include aortic disease, post-surgical factors, sepsis, hypotension, and thromboembolic disorders. The authors present an interesting case of cervical cord infarction due to anterior spinal artery thrombosis in a patient with type 1 Arnold-Chiari malformation without any of the aforementioned predisposing factors.

### Pediatric and adult Chiari malformation type I surgical series 1965–2013: A review of demographics, operative treatment, and outcomes [^112GgjqN]. Journal of Neurosurgery. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a hindbrain disorder associated with elongation of the cerebellar tonsils, which descend below the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. It occurs in children and adults. Clinical symptoms mainly develop from alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the foramen magnum and the common subsequent development of syringomyelia.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed English-language reports of pediatric, adult, and combined (adult and pediatric) surgical series of patients with CM-I published from 1965 through August 31, 2013, to investigate the following: 1) geographical distribution of reports; 2) demographics of patients; 3) follow-up lengths; 4) study durations; 5) spectrum and frequency of surgical techniques; 6) outcomes for neurological status, syrinx, and headache; 7) frequency and scope of complications; 8) mortality rates; and 9) differences between pediatric and adult populations. Research and inclusion criteria were defined, and all series that contained at least 4 cases and all publications with sufficient data for analysis were included.

- **Results**: The authors identified 145 operative series of patients with CM-I, primarily from the United States and Europe, and divided patient ages into one of three categories: adult (> 18 years of age; 27% of the cases), pediatric (≤ 18 years of age; 30%), or unknown (43%). Most series (76%) were published in the previous 21 years. The median number of patients in the series was 31. The mean duration of the studies was 10 years, and the mean follow-up time was 43 months.

### Headache characteristics and postoperative course in Chiari I malformation [^11693naP]. Cephalalgia (2022). Low credibility.

The following theories on the pathophysiology of the typical CIM-related headache have emerged: the Oldfield's theory, which describes a pulsatile pressure effect caudally with mechanical impact on the spinal cord, and the William's theory, which implies that increasing the abdominal pressure results in a higher craniocaudal pressure gradient that cannot be dissipated via the subarachnoid space. This would result in transient symptomatic intracranial pressure elevation, affecting trigeminal afferents of the meninges and resulting in headache.

Foramen magnum decompression is the treatment of choice for patients with debilitating symptoms and/or pronounced syringomyelia. In cases of mild symptoms or incipient syringomyelia, a surgical approach may be discussed, whereas asymptomatic patients do not require further therapy. The standard surgical approach is the foramen magnum decompression in combination with C1 laminectomy. In several trials, foramen magnum decompression had a favorable effect on symptom relief — especially on headache. However, previous studies have examined headache semiology alone without a precise description of the postoperative course or the outcome of headache with detailed headache semiology. Therefore, a detailed description of headache semiology and characteristics pre- and postoperatively, as well as the postoperative outcome of different headache types (including typical cough headache and other headache semiologies) in CIM, is still lacking.

The aim of our project was to provide such a description of headache characteristics and attempt a…

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Symptoms [^116NxNE2]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Chiari malformation, particularly with respect to indications for surgery in symptomatic patients, CNS 2023 guidelines recommend considering foramen magnum decompression to improve pain associated with strain-related headaches in symptomatic patients with Chiari malformation type 1. It is important to recognize that other symptoms may demonstrate a more variable response to decompression.

### Associated disorders of Chiari type I malformations: A review [^111fBNUZ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

A single pathophysiological mechanism of Chiari Type I malformations (CM-I) has been a topic of debate. To better understand CM-I, the authors review disorders known to be associated with CM-I. The primary methodology found among most of them is the deformation of the posterior cranial fossa, usually resulting in a decrease in volume. Other mechanisms exist as well, which can be categorized as either congenital or acquired. By understanding the relationship of such disorders with CM-I, we may gain further insight into the process by which cerebellar tonsillar herniation occurs. Some of these pathologies appear to be true associations, but many seem to be spurious.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: Surgical interventions [^115nj5fJ]. Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for Chiari malformation, particularly indications for surgery in symptomatic patients, the CNS 2023 guidelines recommend considering additional neurosurgical intervention 6–12 months following the initial surgical treatment of Chiari malformation type 1 with syringomyelia, in the absence of radiographic improvement.

### Chiari malformation I and autism spectrum disorder: An underrecognized coexistence [^112nCdu6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) frequently present with headaches, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, and balance disturbances. Diagnosing CM-I in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be challenging. Even if symptomatic, some patients do not undergo further evaluation or management, as their presentations are attributed to autism and its myriad symptoms. Therefore, cranial MRI findings were reviewed after evaluating and treating patients with coexisting ASD and CM-I. This paper reports on five children with ASD and symptomatic CM-I, including their clinical presentation, imaging studies, management, and outcomes, and discusses the likely underrecognized coexistence of these conditions.

- **Methods**: All pediatric patients with ASD and cranial MRI conducted for any reason in the period from 1999 to 2013 were considered for analysis. All cases with concomitant symptomatic CM-I were eligible for this retrospective analysis.

- **Results**: One hundred twenty-five pediatric patients diagnosed with ASD had undergone MRI, and nine of them had evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Five patients were symptomatic and underwent suboccipital craniectomy, a C-1 or a C-1 and C-2 laminectomy, and duraplasty with bovine pericardium or Type I collagen allograft. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients showed symptom improvement and/or resolution of presenting symptoms, which included headache, dysphasia, speech, and irritability.

- **Conclusions**: There is no identified cause of autism. Children with ASD can…

### The Chiari severity index: A preoperative grading system for Chiari malformation type 1 [^1157cNvh]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

To develop evidence-based treatment guidelines for Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1), preoperative prognostic indices capable of stratifying patients for comparative trials are needed. The objective was to develop a preoperative Chiari Severity Index (CSI) that integrates the clinical and neuroimaging features most predictive of long-term patient-defined improvement in quality of life (QOL) after CM-1 surgery.

Methods included recording preoperative clinical characteristics (e.g. headaches, myelopathic symptoms) and neuroimaging features (e.g. syrinx size, tonsillar descent). Brief follow-up surveys assessed overall patient-defined improvement in QOL. Sequential sequestration was employed to develop clinical and neuroimaging grading systems, and conjunctive consolidation was used to integrate these indices to form the CSI. We evaluated statistical significance using the Cochran-Armitage test and discrimination using the C statistic.

Results from our sample of 158 patients indicated that sequential sequestration identified headache characteristics and myelopathic symptoms as the most impactful clinical parameters. This led to a clinical grading system with improvement rates ranging from 81% (grade 1) to 58% (grade 3) (P = 0.01). Based on sequential sequestration, the neuroimaging grading system included only the presence (55% improvement) or absence (74% improvement) of a syrinx ≥ 6 mm (P = 0.049). By integrating the clinical and neuroimaging indices, improvement rates for the CSI ranged from 83% (grade 1) to 45% (grade 3) (P = 0.002). The combined CSI had moderately better discrimination (c = 0.66) than separate indices.
