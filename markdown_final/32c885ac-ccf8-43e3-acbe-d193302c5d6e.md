## Question

what is gfr for stage 2 ckd?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the GFR range is for Stage 2 CKD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current KDIGO GFR category definitions. Then, I should verify how CKD is defined and whether Stage 2 requires evidence of kidney damage. Next, I will check for any nuances in recent guideline updates that might modify the G2 range. Finally, I will synthesize a concise answer with the exact GFR range and the diagnostic caveat for Stage 2 CKD.

> Let me first confirm the GFR category definitions. According to KDIGO 2024, GFR categories are: G1 normal or high ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m², G2 mildly decreased 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m², G3a mildly to moderately decreased 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m², G3b moderately to severely decreased 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², G4 severely decreased 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², and G5 kidney failure < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114KtcHN] [^1166wRSo].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic requirement for Stage 2 CKD. I initially thought Stage 2 might be defined by eGFR 60–89 alone, but hold on, that would be imprecise; I should confirm that CKD Stages 1–2 require evidence of kidney damage even when eGFR is ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². KDIGO and contemporary summaries define CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for at least 3 months with implications for health, and for GFR categories G1–G2, the diagnosis of CKD requires markers of kidney damage such as albuminuria, hematuria, or imaging abnormalities, whereas G3–G5 can be diagnosed by sustained eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² alone [^114RathD] [^112cYLRs] [^111ruCuQ].

> I should double-check that the G2 range has not changed in recent updates. KDIGO 2024 retains the same GFR category thresholds, including G2 as 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m², and continues to emphasize classifying CKD by Cause, GFR category, and Albuminuria category (the CGA framework), which reinforces that Stage 2 corresponds to G2 plus evidence of kidney damage rather than eGFR alone [^114KtcHN] [^115kbQdq].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final statement is precise. Stage 2 CKD corresponds to GFR category G2, which is 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m², but it is only labeled CKD when there is concurrent evidence of kidney damage (most commonly albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/g) confirmed on repeat testing over at least 3 months; without markers of kidney damage, an eGFR of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m² does not meet CKD criteria [^114KtcHN] [^114RathD] [^112cYLRs].

---

Stage 2 CKD is defined by an **eGFR of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²** with evidence of kidney damage (such as albuminuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging) persisting for at least 3 months [^114KtcHN] [^114RathD]. Kidney damage is required because eGFR alone in this range is not sufficient to diagnose CKD [^111ruCuQ]. Most patients are asymptomatic, but risk of progression and cardiovascular complications increases with higher albuminuria or faster eGFR decline [^116wakmY] [^111aLLFH]. Management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause, optimizing blood pressure and glycemic control, and monitoring kidney function and albuminuria at least annually [^112cYLRs] [^113ZuwxZ].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

According to KDIGO 2024, **stage 2 CKD is defined** by an eGFR of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m² with evidence of kidney damage persisting for at least 3 months [^114KtcHN] [^114RathD]. Kidney damage includes:

- **Albuminuria**: Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) [^114RathD].
- **Hematuria**: Persistent microscopic or macroscopic hematuria.
- **Structural abnormalities**: Abnormal imaging findings (e.g. cysts, scarring).
- **Electrolyte or acid-base disturbances**: Due to tubular disorders [^114RathD].

The **requirement of kidney damage** distinguishes stage 2 CKD from stage 1 CKD (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² with kidney damage) and emphasizes that reduced eGFR alone within this range is insufficient for diagnosis [^111ruCuQ].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Stage 2 CKD is **typically asymptomatic**, yet it carries important clinical implications:

- **Progression risk**: Patients with stage 2 CKD are at increased risk of progression to more advanced CKD stages, particularly if albuminuria is present or if eGFR declines rapidly [^111aLLFH] [^116wakmY].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Even mild reductions in eGFR are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially when accompanied by albuminuria [^116wakmY] [^117Hnk17].
- **Complications**: Although less common than in advanced CKD, complications such as hypertension, anemia, and metabolic bone disease may begin to manifest in stage 2 CKD [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

Management of stage 2 CKD focuses on **identifying and addressing the underlying cause** of kidney damage, optimizing blood pressure and glycemic control, and implementing lifestyle modifications. Key recommendations include:

- **Blood pressure control**: Target blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred if albuminuria is present [^112cYLRs].
- **Glycemic control**: For patients with diabetes, individualized HbA1c targets and use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists may be beneficial [^111Ei8NA].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Dietary sodium restriction, weight management, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Annual assessment of eGFR and albuminuria, with more frequent monitoring if rapid progression or significant albuminuria is present [^113ZuwxZ] [^111rAoay].

---

## Prognosis and progression

The prognosis of stage 2 CKD varies with the **presence of albuminuria**, the underlying cause, and the rate of eGFR decline. Patients with higher albuminuria levels or rapid eGFR decline are at increased risk of progression to advanced CKD stages and kidney failure [^111aLLFH] [^116wakmY]. Nevertheless, with appropriate management and monitoring, many patients with stage 2 CKD remain stable for years without significant progression [^notfound].

---

Stage 2 CKD is defined by an **eGFR of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²** with evidence of kidney damage, and although often asymptomatic, it requires careful monitoring and management to prevent progression and cardiovascular complications.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

### Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114FF5g6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is important in the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current standards for CKD progression in clinical trials are kidney failure and the doubling of serum creatinine (∼57% decline in eGFR). These endpoints have limitations as they are only applicable to patients with later stages of CKD and often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power.

Recent Findings

Lesser declines in eGFR (30% and 40%) have been evaluated as potential endpoints in recent studies. These endpoints are more common and show a strong association with the risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. These findings have been shown to be consistent across different causes of CKD and for different interventions. A particular limitation of reduced thresholds is an elevated risk of type I errors in the presence of acute treatment effects, particularly with a 30% eGFR decline cut off.

Summary

Surrogate endpoints for kidney failure and mortality are needed in clinical trials to allow for the reasonable management of timelines and resources, and the achievement of adequate sample sizes. Lesser eGFR decline thresholds should be considered to aid in the design and conduct of more randomized controlled trials in nephrology.

### Glomerular filtration rate decline as a surrogate end point in kidney disease progression trials [^114QRosY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with increased risks of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality. Clinical trials evaluating CKD progression commonly use a composite end point of death, ESKD or serum creatinine doubling. However, due to low event rates, such trials require large sample sizes and long-term follow-up for adequate statistical power. As a result, very few interventions targeting CKD progression have been tested in randomized controlled trials. To overcome this problem, the National Kidney Foundation and Food and Drug Administration conducted a series of analyses to determine whether an end point of 30 or 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over 2–3 years can substitute for serum creatinine doubling in the composite end point. These analyses demonstrated that these alternate kidney end points were significantly associated with subsequent risks of ESKD and death. However, the association between, and consistency of treatment effects on eGFR decline and clinical end points were influenced by baseline eGFR, follow-up duration and acute hemodynamic effects. The investigators concluded that a 40% eGFR decline is broadly acceptable as a kidney end point across a wide baseline eGFR range and that a 30% eGFR decline may be acceptable in some situations. Although these alternate kidney end points could potentially allow investigators to conduct shorter duration clinical trials with smaller sample sizes thereby generating evidence to guide clinical decision-making in a timely manner, it is uncertain whether these end points will improve trial efficiency and feasibility. This review critically appraises the evidence, strengths and limitations pertaining to eGFR end points.

### The global burden of chronic kidney disease: estimates, variability and pitfalls [^113xZiQX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently defined by abnormalities of kidney structure or function assessed using a matrix of variables - including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thresholds of albuminuria and duration of injury - and is considered by many to be a common disorder globally. However, estimates of CKD prevalence vary widely, both within and between countries. The reasons for these variations are manifold, and include true regional differences in CKD prevalence, vagaries of using estimated GFR (eGFR) for identifying CKD, issues relating to the use of set GFR thresholds to define CKD in elderly populations, and concerns regarding the use of one-off testing for assessment of eGFR or albuminuria to define the prevalence of CKD in large-scale epidemiological studies. Although CKD is common, the suggestion that its prevalence is increasing in many countries might not be correct. Here, we discuss the possible origins of differences in estimates of CKD prevalence, and present possible solutions for tackling the factors responsible for the reported variations in GFR measurements. The strategies we discuss include approaches to improve testing methodologies for more accurate assessment of GFR, to improve awareness of factors that can alter GFR readouts, and to more accurately stage CKD in certain populations, including the elderly.

### Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: a position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^114vgs4Y]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. A simple definition and classification of kidney disease is necessary for international development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conducted a survey and sponsored a controversies conference to (1) provide a clear understanding to both the nephrology and nonnephrology communities of the evidence base for the definition and classification recommended by Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (K/DOQI), (2) develop global consensus for the adoption of a simple definition and classification system, and (3) identify a collaborative research agenda and plan that would improve the evidence base and facilitate implementation of the definition and classification of CKD. The K/DOQI definition and classification were accepted, with clarifications. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or more, irrespective of cause. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g in two of three spot urine specimens. GFR can be estimated from calibrated serum creatinine and estimating equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation or the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Kidney disease severity is classified into five stages according to the level of GFR. Kidney disease treatment by dialysis and transplantation should be noted. Simple, uniform classifications of CKD by cause and by risks for kidney disease progression and CVD should be developed.

BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Progression of kidney disease

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2] to stage 3B [GFR30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

In addition to the KDIGO heatmap, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a validated tool used by clinicians in over 30 countries and recommended by the 2024 KDIGO guideline to provide a 2- and 5-year-probability of kidney failure in individuals with advanced CKD (G stages 3–5) by using the individual's UACR, eGFR, sex, and age. Physicians should be aware of this tool as it has demonstrated excellent discrimination in individuals with advanced CKD who are likely to progress to kidney failure at the 2- and 5-year time points and across CKD etiologies (link:

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health concern, largely attributed to population ageing and the increasing prevalence of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension and heart failure, which are important risk factors for CKD. CKD now affects around 10% of adults worldwide, imposing a substantial strain on healthcare resources due to its association with progression to kidney failure, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations and premature death.

CKD stage G3 involves mild to moderate impairment of the kidneys, defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranging from 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and is generally considered irreversible. Nonetheless, treatment and monitoring interventions can slow or halt progression of CKD, reducing the risk of complications. However, establishing clinical guidelines is challenging due to the large heterogeneity of individuals with CKD.

Among individuals with mild to moderate CKD in a community-based setting, little is known about the absolute risk of experiencing a rapid decline in GFR. Furthermore, identification of individuals at high risk of rapid progression in routine clinical care remains poorly understood. The available evidence on risk markers associated with rapid progression of CKD from stage G3 is mainly based on individuals who have received treatment in a hospital setting, making it difficult to accurately identify individuals at risk of rapidly progressing CKD in primary care. Furthermore, most studies have focused on kidney failure, which is an outcome that may occur many years after the first signs of mild kidney impairment, if ever. However, rapid progression increases not only the risk of kidney failure, but also the risk of other severe outcomes, such as cardiovascular events or death.

Therefore, it is crucial to gain further insight into the risk of rapid progression in individuals with mild to moderate CKD, and to identify individuals at high risk of rapid progression by risk markers that are easily accessible in routine clinical care. This information is imperative to identify individuals in the community setting who could potentially benefit from prophylactic interventions.

To address this, we conducted a nationwide, population-based cohort study among adults with incident CKD stage G3 to examine the risk of rapid progression, kidney failure, all-cause hospitalization and death. Additionally, we examined the association between predefined potential risk markers and rapid progression of incident CKD from stage G3.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1171wmis]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

### Defining improvement in chronic kidney disease: regression and remission [^111A884S]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

International definitions exist for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and kidney failure but despite evidence that kidney function may improve, there are no agreed definitions for regression and remission of CKD. In the light of recent novel kidney protective therapies and the promise of regenerative medicine to reverse kidney damage, it is time to critically examine these neglected aspects of CKD epidemiology.

Recent Findings

We propose that CKD regression is viewed as a process of improvement defined as a sustained increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by ≥ 25% and an improvement in GFR category or increase in GFR of 1 ≥ ml/min/year, whereas remission is considered a category of improvement defined as GFR ≥ 60ml/min/1.73m 2 and urine albumin to creatinine ratio <30mg/g. Several recent studies have reported improvement in kidney function in populations with CKD, even in the absence of specific therapy. Regression and remission of CKD are associated with increased likelihood of sustained improvement in kidney function as well as improved survival.

Summary

Further research is warranted to validate the proposed definitions and investigate associated mechanisms. We look to a future in which the goal of therapy is not merely to slow CKD progression but to improve kidney function and seek a cure.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation (point-of-care testing), KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to generate an estimate of GFR when using a point-of-care testing device for creatinine testing. Use the equation consistent with the one used within the region.

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality [^111aLLFH]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The established chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of −57% or greater) is a late event.

Objective

To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3–46.3) for changes of −57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5–6.4) for changes of −30%. However, changes of −30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of −57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of −57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of −40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of −30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: where does Europe go? [^116uNacG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

This review discusses various screening approaches for chronic kidney disease that are used in Europe. The criterion for defining chronic kidney disease in the various programs differs but is frequently limited to estimated glomerular filtration rate, thus offering only data on chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher; however, screening should not be limited to measuring only estimated glomerular filtration rate but should also include a measure of microalbuminuria, because this will offer identification of chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2. Defining these earlier stages is of importance because the risk for developing end-stage renal disease that is associated with stages 1 and 2 is nearly equal to the risk that is associated with stage 3. Moreover, the risk for cardiovascular events in stages 1 and 2 is equal to that in stage 3. Various reports argue that costs of screening programs in general practitioner or outpatient offices are high and that they are cost-effective only for preventing end-stage renal disease when they are limited to target groups, such as patients with diabetes or hypertension and elderly. The benefits of screening programs, however, should not be evaluated only with respect to the prevention of renal events but should also include the benefits of preventing cardiovascular events. The use of preselection based on either an impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate or on protein-dipstick positivity or elevated albuminuria in a morning urine void has been found effective in various European countries as an alternative for targeted screening.

### GFR slope as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression in clinical trials: a meta-analysis of treatment effects of randomized controlled trials [^117AcxkZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surrogate end points are needed to assess whether treatments are effective in the early stages of CKD. GFR decline leads to kidney failure, but regulators have not approved using differences in the change in GFR from the beginning to the end of a randomized, controlled trial as an end point in CKD because it is not clear whether small changes in the GFR slope will translate to clinical benefits.

Methods

To assess the use of GFR slope as a surrogate end point for CKD progression, we performed a meta-analysis of 47 RCTs that tested 12 interventions in 60,620 subjects. We estimated treatment effects on GFR slope (mean difference in GFR slope between the randomized groups), for the total slope starting at baseline, chronic slope starting at 3 months after randomization, and on the clinical end point (doubling of serum creatinine, GFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, or ESKD) for each study. We used Bayesian mixed-effects analyses to describe the association of treatment effects on GFR slope with the clinical end point and to test how well the GFR slope predicts a treatment's effect on the clinical end point.

Results

Across all studies, the treatment effect on 3-year total GFR slope (median R 2 = 0.97; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 0.78 to 1.00) and on the chronic slope (R 2 0.96; 95% BCI, 0.63 to 1.00) accurately predicted treatment effects on the clinical end point. With a sufficient sample size, a treatment effect of 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr or greater on total slope over 3 years or chronic slope predicts a clinical benefit on CKD progress with at least 96% probability.

Conclusions

With large enough sample sizes, GFR slope may be a viable surrogate for clinical end points in CKD RCTs.

### Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment and reimbursement of treatments for the management of chronic kidney disease [^113tUANK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence base for the validity of surrogate endpoints in CKD

Historically, drug development for CKD has focused on patients with later stages of disease as they are at high risk of CKD progression. This is in part because the commonly used patient-relevant final or 'target' outcomes in clinical trials occur only after a prolonged disease course that may extend 10–20 years, a timeframe that is not feasible for trials of early CKD. Implementing treatments in the early stages of CKD could have a greater impact on delaying the time to progression to kidney failure and reducing the risk of progression than interventions applied at later stages of disease. As discussed above, surrogate endpoints can be used earlier in the CKD process and with smaller sample size and shorter follow-up duration.

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) define CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months with implications for health. This can include an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or other marker of kidney damage, which is most commonly, elevated albuminuria. Thus, GFR and urine albuminuria have been extensively evaluated as candidate surrogate endpoints because they are the most widely used biomarkers in CKD. The urine albumin concentration is often divided by the urine creatinine concentration to account for variations in urine dilution between individuals. This is a central reason for the recommendation to use it measured as urine albumin to creatinine ratio in a spot urine, to detect and stage CKD. In specific disease, total protein or urine albumin assessed using 24-h urine collections are also used. Here on in, we will continue to use the general term urine albumin (or albuminuria) to refer to all of the variations.

Over the past two decades, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) have led the evaluation of the validity of changes in GFR and albuminuria as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in CKD. Level 3 evidence (biological plausibility) for GFR decline as an endpoint of CKD progression is very strong. Change in GFR over time is the definition for the progression and remission of kidney disease–patients cannot reach kidney failure in the absence of a decline in GFR. Albuminuria is generally caused by increased permeability of the glomerular capillary wall to macromolecules. Experimental studies showed that increased tubular exposure to albumin promotes activation of inflammatory mediators causing tubulo-interstitial injury and further kidney damage. Albuminuria would not be expected to be a surrogate across all CKD etiologies. Unlike GFR, its use would require understanding that the specific disease affects albuminuria and that the intervention is expected to impact its change.

The cohort included 290 613 individuals, of whom 55 453 had chronic kidney disease and 30 277 had diabetes. All participants were followed to ascertain the incidence of death, end stage renal disease, and renal replacement therapy until 31 December 2007. Annual rates of these outcomes (stratified by age, presence of diabetes and presence of proteinuria) were estimated for up to five years after the index measurement of glomerular filtration rate, with censoring at end stage renal disease, death, or 31 December 2007 (table 2and table 3).

Mortality

For people without chronic kidney disease, age dependent population mortality rates were estimated from observed rates for Canadians. For people with chronic kidney disease, mortality rates were based on the annual rate observed within the Alberta Kidney Disease Network cohort after the initial assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate. We accounted for age related increases in mortality in those with chronic kidney disease based on the observed mortality rates for patients in different age groups in the network (table 2and table 3).

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^116wakmY]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease affects 10–16% of the general adult population in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the United States. Chronic kidney disease, typically defined by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or albuminuria, is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and progression to end stage renal disease. Go and colleagues found in administrative healthcare data that estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independently associated with hospitalisations, cardiovascular events, and death. In a collaborative meta-analysis of general population cohorts we found that mortality rises exponentially with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while albuminuria shows linear association across its entire measurement range. Recent data indicate that the risk associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate is even stronger when glomerular filtration rate is estimated using the more accurate equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration.

Existing data regarding potential sex differences in the risk of chronic kidney disease suggest that women have a lower incidence of end stage renal disease, lower cardiovascular risk, and (in countries with low maternal mortality) lower risk of all-cause mortality than men. Whether sex differences exist with respect to estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes, and in particular whether such differences exist based on the combined effect of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, is largely unknown.

Given the clinical uncertainty, we sought to determine if sex modifies the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and end stage renal disease, using a global consortium of 46 cohorts and more than two million participants.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

Diagnosis and classification of CKD

Chronic kidney disease is defined as a change in kidney structure or function that has existed for > 3 months with implications for health. Chronic kidney disease stages are categorized by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria categories (Figure 1). The CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) has developed eGFR equations based on measurements of creatinine and/or cystatin C. Even if an eGFR is ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the presence of albuminuria or other evidence of kidney disease can define CKD. A sustained decrease in eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e. CKD stages G3–5) is sufficient to make the diagnosis of CKD. The most advanced stage of CKD, G5, is characterized by an eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Albuminuria is an early marker of nephropathy and has a predictive value for the risk of kidney failure as well as for CVD and all-cause mortality, regardless of eGFR. Measurement of the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) in spontaneously voided urine allows for efficient identification and quantification of albuminuria. Of note, albuminuria measurement can potentially provide false positive results e.g. after exercise or during infection.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114jogtT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — loss of GFR within CKD stage 1 in people with elevated urinary albumin excretion may already represent DKD, and formulae estimating GFR from serum creatinine values are problematic in their application to patients with diabetes. Measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patients with diabetes and CKD, and the Work Group developed a novel grid (Table 6) to combine staging by albuminuria classification and GFR, although evidence to define DKD probabilities within each box is lacking. The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluation of other related factors, and apart from albuminuria and GFR, patients should be evaluated for the presence of hypertension, poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history of DKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke in persons without diabetes also is relevant, and because DKD typically does not occur in isolation, patients with DKD should have regular surveillance for other microvascular and macrovascular complications.

### Chronic kidney disease detection, staging and treatment in cardiovascular disease prevention [^116fj5ia]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, nearly 10% of the population has chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than 60mL/min/1.73m 2 and/or a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio greater than 30mg/g (3mg/mmol). Persons with CKD have a substantially high risk of cardiovascular disease. Indeed, most persons with CKD are far more likely to develop a cardiovascular event than to progress to end-stage kidney disease. Although early detection and staging of CKD could help prevent its cardiovascular consequences, current rates of testing for CKD are very low, even among high-risk populations such as persons with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we first describe the need to test for both estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria among persons at high risk of CKD in order to properly stage CKD and enhance cardiovascular risk stratification. We then discuss how detection and staging for CKD could help prioritise patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure who could derive the largest benefit from cardiovascular preventive interventions. In addition, we discuss the central role of CKD detection and staging in the initiation of cardiorenal preventive therapies, such as the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which have shown overwhelming evidence of cardiorenal protection. We conclude by discussing strategies to overcome historical barriers to CKD detection and treatment.

### GFR decline and subsequent risk of established kidney outcomes: a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials [^113XhgUJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The currently established end points for clinical trials of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, which approximates a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is increased interest in using alternative end points in clinical trials to shorten trial duration and reduce sample size. As part of an evaluation of using lesser declines in GFR as alternative end points, we examined the associations of various levels of eGFR decline with the subsequent development of established end points and assess the consistency of alternate levels of eGFR decline across varying clinical manifestations of kidney disease and interventions.

Study Design

Observational analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting & Participants

9,488 participants in 37 randomized controlled trials in CKD.

Predictor

Alternative end points, defined as 30% and 40% declines in eGFR from baseline to month 12. Effect modification by baseline eGFR, proteinuria, cause of disease, and interventions.

Outcomes

Established end point, defined as end-stage renal disease, eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m(2), or doubling of serum creatinine level.

Results

From baseline to 12 months, 16.1% and 7.8% of participants had eGFR declines of ≥ 30% or ≥ 40%, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2.0 (IQR, 1.2–3.1) years after the 12-month baseline period, 2,661 established end points were observed. A strong linear association was observed between eGFR decline and subsequent established end points. HRs for the established end point for 30% and 40% decreases in eGFR compared to a 0% decline were 9.6 (95% CI, 7.3–12.6) and 20.3 (95% CI, 14.1–29.3), respectively. The associations were consistent regardless of baseline eGFR, proteinuria, causes of disease, and interventions.

Limitations

Observational study subject to residual confounding.

Conclusions

The strong associations between lesser declines in eGFR and the subsequent development of established end points were consistent across different clinical characteristics of kidney disease and interventions and support implementation of alternative end points in clinical trials of CKD progression.

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### Diabetic kidney disease with and without albuminuria [^1175qPKo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, for people at risk of developing diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD), an initial increase in albumin excretion rate (AER) has been linked to a subsequent decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We review recent findings that suggest that in some people with diabetic CKD there is an uncoupling of progressive increases in AER and declining GFR.

Recent Findings

Approximately 20% of people with type 2 diabetes develop at least stage 3 CKD, defined as an estimated GFR (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m, after accounting for the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers, while remaining normoalbuminuric. A recent analysis from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study has shown that 24% of people with type 1 diabetes reached an eGFR threshold of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m that was not associated with a rise in albuminuria to the microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria range. This discordance between changes in GFR and AER has resulted in a search for new markers that identify people with diabetes who are at risk of declining GFR independent of progressive increases in AER.

Summary

The conventional paradigm of kidney disease in people with diabetes has been challenged. Changes in AER and GFR are being increasingly recognized as complementary rather than obligatory manifestations of diabetic CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease diagnosis and management: a review [^112cYLRs]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. Appropriate screening, diagnosis, and management by primary care clinicians are necessary to prevent adverse CKD-associated outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, end-stage kidney disease, and death.

Observations

Defined as a persistent abnormality in kidney structure or function (eg, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥ 30 mg per 24 hours) for more than 3 months, CKD affects 8% to 16% of the population worldwide. In developed countries, CKD is most commonly attributed to diabetes and hypertension. However, less than 5% of patients with early CKD report awareness of their disease. Among individuals diagnosed as having CKD, staging and new risk assessment tools that incorporate GFR and albuminuria can help guide treatment, monitoring, and referral strategies. Optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction (eg, statins and blood pressure management), treatment of albuminuria (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers), avoidance of potential nephrotoxins (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and adjustments to drug dosing (eg, many antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic agents). Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and anemia. Those at high risk of CKD progression (eg, estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria ≥ 300 mg per 24 hours, or rapid decline in estimated GFR) should be promptly referred to a nephrologist.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diagnosis, staging, and appropriate referral of CKD by primary care clinicians are important in reducing the burden of CKD worldwide.

Guidelines for diabetes and CKD — Likelihood of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria is stratified as follows: for GFR > 60 mL/min (CKD stage 1 + 2), normoalbuminuria is labeled "At risk", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR 30–60 mL/min (stage 3), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR < 30 mL/min (stage 4 + 5), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD". Staging caveats note that "RAS blockade could render microalbuminuric patients normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients microalbuminuric", and in early diabetes "GFR less than 90 mL/min may represent a significant loss of function".

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression — implementation considerations — emphasize that "It is important to differentiate between progression of chronic disease and acute injury", and that "small changes in GFR could be consistent with AKI, whereas only large changes in GFR would indicate progressive CKD", so "Clinicians will need to attend to other clinical indicators to be able to accurately identify the cause of changes in GFR". They also note that "Change in eGFR may be due to true change in GFR or due to changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine concentrations, including assay fluctuations", and that "Differentiating between these requires serial assessments and consideration of potential changes in the non-GFR determinants of creatinine". Finally, "Use of validated prediction models for progression of kidney disease may be able to incorporate numerous clinical factors and provide a single prognostic metric, which can guide decisions", and "Incorporation of such models into laboratory systems may facilitate their use".

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

### Presence of early CKD-related metabolic complications predict progression of stage 3 CKD: a case-controlled study [^113zKNge]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased considerably and is estimated to range from about 10–15% of the elderly population. Only a portion of patients with early stage 3 CKD progress to stage 4 where the risk of cardiovascular disease, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or death becomes substantially higher. Identifying the subset of patients who enter stage 3 and are most likely to progress to stage 4 CKD could both improve outcomes, by allowing more appropriate referrals for specialist care, as well as spare those unlikely to progress the adverse effects and costliness of an unnecessarily aggressive approach. This issue is particularly important in the geriatric population in whom it is unclear whether a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the stage 3 range is associated with the poor outcomes of renal disease and in whom advancing age is associated with slower progression of kidney disease.

Screening Enables Early Diagnosis OF CKD

Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic in its early stages and is diagnosed via estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which assesses kidney function, and detection of albuminuria, a marker for kidney damage. The ADA 2020 Standards of Care recommend that patients with newly diagnosed T2D should be screened for CKD with urinary albumin (e.g. spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) testing and eGFR. They should then be retested annually thereafter, with the frequency of retesting driven by the level of kidney damage and function (Fig. 1). For patients with a UACR > 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, monitoring should be performed twice annually to guide therapy. Of note, in 2013 the American College of Physicians made the recommendation that patients with T2D and CKD (stage 1–3) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) did not need to undergo annual testing for proteinuria. This recommendation has been retired, and therefore it is important that primary care providers (PCPs) take note of this change and adjust their practice accordingly. Based on the ADA guidelines, patients with stage 1–3 CKD should be screened between one and three times annually based on their level of albuminuria (Fig. 1).

The preferred method for assessment of albuminuria is the UACR, measured in a random spot urine collection. This method of assessment is easy to perform compared with a 24-h urine collection, which is inconvenient for patients and subject to incomplete collection. Concurrent measurement of urinary creatinine ensures that variations in albumin concentration due to hydration levels do not confound the result. A positive diagnosis of increased urinary albumin excretion, defined as ≥ 30 mg/g albumin/creatinine, should only be made when two of three samples collected over a 3- to 6-month period exceed that threshold.

Epidemiology and prognosis

The definition and classification of CKD was introduced by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative in 2002, and the international guideline group Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes in 2004. Kidney damage refers to kidney abnormalities observed during clinical evaluation indicating a reduction in kidney function. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities in kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that have been present for > 3 months and have an impact on health. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g (Figure 3). Because there is an increasing evidence indicating a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiorenal risk in the renal and nonrenal population, albuminuria is considered a prognostic marker for cardiovascular or renal risk, or both. Higher levels of albuminuria indicate a graded increase in risk for mortality independent of eGFR.

Classification and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines. GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate. Adapted from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group.

CKD is increasingly recognized as a global public health problemimposing huge medical and financial burdens on societies and health care systems with an estimated prevalence of 13.4% globally. The worldwide rise in the prevalence of CKD is accompanied by an increase in patients reaching CKD stage 5 requiring kidney replacement therapy. Currently, about 3 million patients are receiving kidney replacement therapy for CKD stage 5D worldwide out of 10 million who would qualify for kidney replacement therapy; these numbers are expected to grow by 50% to 100% until 2030, (Figure 4). Reasons for the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD, among others, include aging populations, increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and a low detection rate and therapeutic inertia in the early stages of CKD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of albuminuria with chronic kidney disease (CKD) regression?

Findings

In this cohort study of 58 004 adults with newly diagnosed moderate to severe CKD (eGFR, 15–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2), albuminuria level was directly associated with CKD progression and death, and inversely associated with sustained improvement of eGFR for 90 days or longer. Five-year probabilities of CKD regression were higher in people with lower urine albumin-creatinine ratios in a stepwise fashion.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there may be novel opportunities to discuss both favorable and adverse outcomes with adults with CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^113Whuek]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million adults in the United States, and is associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Patients should be assessed annually to determine whether they are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease based on clinical and sociodemographic factors. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and older age are the primary risk factors that warrant screening. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, family history of chronic kidney disease, and ethnic and racial minority status. Serum creatinine levels can be used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, and spot urine testing can detect proteinuria. After the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is made, staging based on estimated glomerular filtration rate determines prognosis, evaluation, and management. Further evaluation should focus on the specific type of kidney disease and on identifying complications related to the disease stage. Patients should be assessed for risk factors leading to the further loss of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2), significant proteinuria, or rapid loss of kidney function should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current state-of-the art in diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) using classification systems based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and kidney damage.

Recent Findings

CKD, as defined by current classification systems, has many pitfalls, but the presence and stage of CKD has important value in determining prognosis, particularly when the effects of albuminuria are added to eGFR SUMMARY: The diagnosis of CKD using current classification schema based on eGFR alone needs to be approached with some caution, particularly in the elderly without concomitant signs of kidney damage. The presence and magnitude of albuminuria has important diagnostic and prognostic significance.

### Estimated GFR trajectories of people entering CKD stage 4 and subsequent kidney disease outcomes and mortality [^111En2gR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trajectories of people entering chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 and their associations with subsequent kidney disease outcomes or death are not known.

Study Design

Longitudinal observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

26,246 patients in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System who entered CKD stage 4 in fiscal year 2008 followed up until October 2013.

Factors

5-year eGFR trajectories, demographic and health characteristics.

Outcomes

Composite kidney disease outcome of kidney failure, dialysis therapy or transplantation, and death.

Results

Latent class group modeling and functional characterization suggest the presence of 3 distinct trajectory classes: class 1 (72%), consistent slow decline with absolute eGFR change of -2.45 (IQR, -3.89 to -1.16) mL/min/1.73m(2) per year; class 2 (18%), consistent fast decline and eGFR change of -8.60 (IQR, -11.29 to -6.66) mL/min/1.73m(2) per year; and class 3 (10%), early nondecline and late fast decline with eGFR change of -0.4mL/min/1.73m(2) per year in years 1 to 3 and -7.98 and -21.36mL/min/1.73m(2) per year in years 4 and 5, respectively. During 4.34 years of follow-up, 9,809 (37%) patients had the composite kidney disease outcome and 14,550 (55%) patients died. Compared to the referent group (trajectory class 1), HRs for 1-year risk for composite kidney disease outcome for trajectory classes 2 and 3 were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.22) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59–0.75), whereas HRs for 1-year risk for death for classes 2 and 3 were 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10–1.28) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18–1.42), respectively. The 1-year risk for composite kidney disease outcome was 32% and was 42% more likely than the risk for death in trajectory classes 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the risk for death was 67% more likely than the risk for composite kidney disease outcome in trajectory class 3.

Limitations

Inclusion criteria and mostly male participants limit generalizability of study results.

Conclusions

We characterized 3 different eGFR trajectory classes of people entering CKD stage 4. Our results suggest that the pattern of eGFR trajectory informs the risk for kidney disease outcomes and death.

We report the prevalence and change in severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in DISCOVER, a global, 3-year, prospective, observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiating second-line glucose-lowering therapy. CKD stages were defined according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Overall, 7843 patients from 35 countries had a baseline serum creatinine measurement. Of these (56.7% male; mean age: 58.1years; mean eGFR: 87.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2), baseline prevalence estimates for stage 0–1, 2, 3 and 4–5 CKD were 51.4%, 37.7%, 9.4% and 1.4%, respectively. A total of 5819 patients (74.2%) also had at least one follow-up serum creatinine measurement (median time between measurements: 2.9years, interquartile range: 1.9–3.0years). Mean eGFR decreased slightly to 85.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2 over follow-up. CKD progression (increase of ≥ 1 stage) occurred in 15.7% of patients, and regression (decrease of ≥ 1 stage) in 12.0%. In summary, a substantial proportion of patients with T2D developed CKD or had CKD progression after the initiation of second-line therapy. Renal function should be regularly monitored in these patients, to ensure early CKD diagnosis and treatment.

### Chronic kidney disease: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment [^115Xcfoi]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population, and many people are unaware of their diagnosis. Screening may be considered for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age 60 years and older, family history of kidney disease, previous acute kidney injury, or preeclampsia. Diagnosis and staging of CKD are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), excessive urinary albumin excretion, or evidence of kidney parenchymal damage lasting more than three months. eGFR should be determined using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without the race variable. Risk calculators are available to estimate the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. When possible, serum cystatin C should be measured to confirm eGFR in patients with CKD. Blood pressure should be maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg, with a systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg or less for patients tolerant of therapy, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and metformin should be considered in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who have not reached their glycemic goal. Intravenous iodinated contrast media temporarily reduces eGFR and should be avoided in patients with advanced CKD. Interdisciplinary management of patients with CKD is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and patients at high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease should be referred to a nephrologist.

### Development and validation of a prediction model for future estimated glomerular filtration rate in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^116GGqAg]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, occurring in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Early awareness and identification of individuals at risk of rapid progression are at the forefront of CKD prevention. The disease is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function, which is assessed by sequential estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and can vary substantially between individuals. Monitoring is performed using noninvasive methods consisting of annual physical examinations, laboratory test results, and determination of eGFR. A clinically useful prediction model of future eGFR measurements based on these routinely collected clinical data may help clinicians guide and plan preventive interventions as well as improve patient understanding and patient-physician communication about the further course of kidney function decline.

Previous studies, that aimed to predict progressive loss of kidney function used an arbitrary definition to create a binary outcome based on continuously measured eGFR, limiting the accuracy of the prediction. Generally, prediction models focus on definitive kidney function end points (eg, kidney replacement therapy), even if these end points are artificially created based on repeatedly observed laboratory measurements, such as doubling of serum creatinine levels or eGFR slope-based approaches quantifying yearly loss. For example, Gurudas et aldefined the split for risk classification as the latest of the first 2 eGFR measurements lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, obtained at least 3 months apart, to predict the risk of incident stage 3 CKD. More commonly, eGFR slope-based approaches based on repeated eGFR recordings are used as proxies for annual estimated decline in kidney function. However, these end points are substantially less definitive in contrast to kidney replacement therapy and are limited by the inter- and intraparticipant variability inherent to eGFR readings as well as estimation accuracy that is dependent on the number of time points available. Despite the known ambiguity in eGFR slope estimation and the benefits of continuous monitoring of disease deterioration, prediction modeling for future eGFR values remains largely overlooked.

### GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for CKD progression in clinical trials [^111ifnhq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a paucity of therapies for chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the slow nature of the disease which poses challenges in selection of endpoints in randomized controlled trials (RCT). There is increasing evidence for the use of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-based endpoints either as percentage decline using time-to-event analyses, or as difference in slope between treatment arms. We reviewed the rationale for using surrogate endpoints and optimal methods for their evaluation prior to their use and evidence for GFR-based endpoints and particularly GFR slope as validated surrogate endpoints and considerations for their use in RCTs.

Recent Findings

In an individual patient meta-analysis of 47 studies (60 620 participants), treatment effects on the clinical endpoint were accurately predicted from treatment effects on 3-year total slope [median R = 0.97 (95% Bayesian confidence interval (BCI), 0.78–1.00] and on the chronic slope [R = 0.96 (95% BCI, 0.63–1.00)]. In a simulation study, GFR slope substantially reduced the required sample size and duration of follow-up compared to the clinical endpoint given high baseline GFR and absence of acute treatment effect. In the presence of acute effect, results were more complicated.

Summary

GFR decline is accepted, and GFR slope is being considered, by regulatory authorities as a validated surrogate endpoint for CKD RCTs.

### Utility and validity of estimated GFR-based surrogate time-to-event end points in CKD: a simulation study [^112ENi27]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is interest in surrogate end points for clinical trials of chronic kidney disease progression because currently established end points-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and doubling of serum creatinine level-are late events, requiring large clinical trials with long follow-up. Doubling of serum creatinine level is equivalent to a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We evaluated type 1 error and required sample size for clinical trials using surrogate end points based on lesser eGFR declines.

Study Design

Simulation study.

Setting & Participants

Simulations evaluating 3,060 scenarios representative of 19 treatment comparisons in 13 chronic kidney disease clinical trials.

Index Tests

Surrogate end points defined as composite end points based on ESRD and either 30% or 40% eGFR declines.

Reference Test

Clinical outcome (ESRD) for type 1 error. Established end point (composite of ESRD and 57% eGFR decline) for required sample size.

Results

Use of the 40% versus 57% eGFR decline end point consistently led to a reduction in sample size > 20% while maintaining risk for type 1 error < 10% in the presence of a small acute effect (< 1.25mL/min/1.73m(2)) for: (1) 2-, 3-, or 5-year trials with a high mean baseline eGFR (67.5mL/min/1.73m(2)), and (2) 2-year trials with an intermediate mean baseline eGFR (42.5mL/min/1.73m(2)). Use of the 30% versus the 40% eGFR decline end point often led to moderately larger reductions in sample size in the absence of an acute effect, but not in the presence of acute effects.

Limitations

The complexity of eGFR trajectories prevented evaluation of all scenarios for clinical trials.

Conclusions

Use of end points based on 30% or 40% eGFR declines is an appropriate strategy to reduce sample size in certain situations. However, risk for type 1 error is increased in the presence of acute effects, particularly for 30% eGFR declines. The decision to use these end points should be made after thorough evaluation of their expected performance under the conditions of specific clinical trials.

### Renal function decline in older men and women with advanced chronic kidney disease-results from the EQUAL study [^115yXaxA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) differs by sex. Population-based studies across the globe consistently show a higher prevalence of CKD in women compared with men, yet ∼60% of those starting renal replacement therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are men. This paradox has several potential explanations. First, the longer life expectancy in women along with the natural decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with age may partly explain the higher prevalence of CKD in women. Secondly, several (population-based) studies as well as a large meta-analysis of studies in non-diabetic CKD patients, point towards a faster decline of renal function in men. In contrast, others have demonstrated a more rapid progression in women in various (sub-)populations, whereas some found no difference between the sexes at all. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that women progress at an equal speed as men, with adjusted analyses even suggesting a faster progression in women. Given these inconclusive results, it is clear that the estimated sex-specific decline in renal function depends on the population studied; CKD stage, the presence of diabetes mellitus (postmenopausal), age, and population-based cohorts versus referred patients, are all factors that likely contribute to the variation in current evidence.

Studying renal function decline by sex is complicated by a sex-specific selection process caused by a higher mortality risk in men across all ranges of pre-ESKD estimated GFR (eGFR). The effect of eGFR decline and albuminuria on mortality risk seems stronger in women, adding complexity to the selection process. Furthermore, as men and women start dialysis at different levels of eGFR, censoring at dialysis initiation may be deemed informative when studying CKD progression. Consequently, it is important when investigating this topic to take into account informative censoring caused by mortality and dialysis initiation, as the estimated slopes of renal function decline by sex may otherwise be biased.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the differences in renal function decline between the sexes may aid sex-specific clinical monitoring and management. To date, very few studies have investigated renal function decline by sex specifically during pre-dialysis Stages 4 and 5 in referred CKD patients of older age, and none has taken into account the potential bias caused by the sex-specific risk of mortality and dialysis initiation. Consequently, here we aim to compare the slope of renal function decline in older men and women with advanced CKD, taking into account informative censoring due to mortality and dialysis. As a secondary aim, we will explore sex-specific determinants of renal function decline in this population.

### Conceptual model of CKD: applications and implications [^111JNNmB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The conceptual model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was developed by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and subsequently revised and adopted by an international consensus under the auspices of KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) in 2005. This model includes concepts of definition, staging, outcomes, and treatment, as well as risk factors for the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Treatments are available for patients with risk factors and for each stage of CKD; these include slowing the progression of kidney disease, preventing and treating the complications of decreased glomerular filtration rate, and reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors and treating cardiovascular disease. In principle, measures to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment could reduce adverse outcomes, improve the quality of life, and prolong the survival of individuals with CKD. The conceptual model for CKD is now being applied to a public health approach for the prevention of the development, progression, and complications of CKD. Primary prevention is defined as prevention of CKD; secondary and tertiary prevention are defined as improving outcomes of patients with CKD stages 1 to 4 and kidney failure (CKD stage 5), respectively. The conceptual model has also fostered debate about important questions: Is CKD a disease or a cardiovascular disease risk-factor condition? Do all patients with CKD need to be referred to a nephrologist? What does CKD care include? Should the classification be modified to include cause of disease and prognosis? Can CKD evolve from acute kidney disease, and is CKD reversible? Is albuminuria a manifestation of a kidney disease or systemic endothelial dysfunction? Is the age-related decrease in glomerular filtration rate normal or abnormal, and should we change the definition of CKD in the elderly? A combination of immediate action, data gathering, and research to establish the efficacy, effectiveness, and costs related to CKD are needed to respond to CKD as a public health problem.

### Systematic approach for the management of chronic kidney disease: moving beyond chronic kidney disease classification [^111HNPkJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review has two aims: to summarize the evolution of classification criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) for diagnosis, prognosis and forecasting population burden of illness; to move the discussion beyond classification to intervention by introducing an approach we describe as the 'Systematic Approach for the Management of CKD' (SAM-CKD).

Recent Findings

There is now ample evidence against the use of estimated GFR (eGFR) as the sole criterion for classifying CKD for the purpose of diagnosis, risk stratification and prediction of progression. There is ample evidence that significant proteinuria is a powerful predictor of progression but even more so when combined with reduced eGFR for individual and population risk projection. Hypertension also is an important indicator in CKD progression but not in all studies. Beyond classification, there are no studies addressing standardization of management of CKD to achieve the outcomes articulated by any of the practice guidelines.

Summary

In this article we have moved the discussions of CKD beyond classification by introducing a clinical management tool, SAM-CKD, which couples a broader classification model with a systematic tool for management to foster standardization of CKD management for the future.

### A meta-analysis of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure [^112XqDA3]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline is causally associated with kidney failure and is a candidate surrogate endpoint for clinical trials of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Analyses across a diverse spectrum of interventions and populations is required for acceptance of GFR decline as an endpoint. In an analysis of individual participant data, for each of 66 studies (total of 186,312 participants), we estimated treatment effects on the total GFR slope, computed from baseline to 3years, and chronic slope, starting at 3months after randomization, and on the clinical endpoint (doubling of serum creatinine, GFR < 15mlmin -1 per 1.73m 2 or kidney failure with replacement therapy). We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression model to relate treatment effects on GFR slope with those on the clinical endpoint across all studies and by disease groups (diabetes, glomerular diseases, CKD or cardiovascular diseases). Treatment effects on the clinical endpoint were strongly associated with treatment effects on total slope (median coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0.97 (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) 0.82–1.00)) and moderately associated with those on chronic slope (R 2 = 0.55 (95% BCI 0.25–0.77)). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across disease. Our results support the use of total slope as a primary endpoint for clinical trials of CKD progression.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Change in albuminuria and GFR as end points for clinical trials in early stages of CKD: a scientific workshop sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation in collaboration with the US food and drug administration and European medicines agency [^116qYhnz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are currently willing to consider a 30% to 40% glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline as a surrogate end point for kidney failure for clinical trials of kidney disease progression under appropriate conditions. However, these end points may not be practical for early stages of kidney disease. In March 2018, the National Kidney Foundation sponsored a scientific workshop in collaboration with the FDA and EMA to evaluate changes in albuminuria or GFR as candidate surrogate end points. Three parallel efforts were presented: meta-analyses of observational studies (cohorts), meta-analyses of clinical trials, and simulations of trial design. In cohorts, after accounting for measurement error, relationships between change in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) or estimated GFR (eGFR) slope and the clinical outcome of kidney disease progression were strong and consistent. In trials, the posterior median R 2 of treatment effects on the candidate surrogates with the clinical outcome was 0.47 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 0.02–0.96) for early change in UACR and 0.72 (95% BCI, 0.05–0.99) when restricted to baseline UACR > 30mg/g, and 0.97 (95% BCI, 0.78–1.00) for total eGFR slope at 3 years and 0.96 (95% BCI, 0.63–1.00) for chronic eGFR slope (ie, the slope excluding the first 3 months from baseline, when there might be acute changes in eGFR). The magnitude of the relationships of changes in the candidate surrogates with risk for clinical outcome was consistent across cohorts and trials: a UACR reduction of 30% or eGFR slope reduction by 0.5 to 1.0mL/min/1.73m 2 per year were associated with an HR of ∼0.7 for the clinical outcome in cohorts and trials. In simulations, using GFR slope as an end point substantially reduced the required sample size and duration of follow-up compared with the clinical end point when baseline eGFR was high, treatment effects were uniform, and there was no acute effect of the treatment. We conclude that both early change in albuminuria and GFR slope fulfill criteria for surrogacy for use as end points in clinical trials for chronic kidney disease progression under certain conditions, with stronger support for change in GFR than albuminuria. Implementation requires understanding conditions under which each surrogate is likely to perform well and restricting its use to those settings.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^112Rp1T2]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Routine assessment of UACR can help potentially identify CKD before eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and before the onset of symptoms associated with advanced disease. In a retrospective study of participants with normal‐range eGFR, mildly elevated UACR (≥ 7.0 mg/g) was associated with an increased incidence of CKD, a finding that suggests that UACR may be able to predict CKD early, prior to a decline in eGFR.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2024 guidelines recommend, at a minimum, annual UACR and eGFR assessments in all individuals with T2D, regardless of treatment. In people with diabetes and existing CKD with a higher risk of progression of kidney disease, UACR and eGFR should be monitored more frequently to guide treatment decisions.

The ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening of individuals with diabetes for CKD, and the KDIGO codified CKD classification based on eGFR and albuminuria is endorsed by the ADA and the ESC (Fig. 1). The KDIGO heatmap is a tool that can be used to diagnose CKD and when assessing the risk associated with CKD severity in individuals, with eGFR mapped on the left and albuminuria staging across the top. The color‐coded heatmap helps with easy identification of different levels of risk for CKD progression, acute kidney injury, CVD, CVD mortality, and all‐cause mortality.

The US Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative and the ESC also recommend UACR and eGFR assessments for individuals with diabetes. Furthermore, the ESC guidelines recommend identifying CVD risk in individuals by the presence of severe target‐organ damage assessed by reduced eGFR and elevated UACR. It is recommended that individuals with diabetes are routinely screened for kidney disease by assessing eGFR (defined by the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equations) and UACR.

The American Heart Association guidelines on CV–kidney–metabolic health recommend that among adults with CV–kidney–metabolic disease stage II (those with metabolic risk factors, moderate‐to‐high risk CKD, or both) or higher, UACR should be measured annually, in addition to eGFR estimation using serum creatinine or cystatin C to allow accurate KDIGO staging and CKD risk assessment. More frequent screening is indicated for individuals with a higher KDIGO risk.

### The impact of different GFR estimating equations on the prevalence of CKD and risk groups in a southeast Asian cohort using the new KDIGO guidelines [^113n8vEB]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risks of cardiovascular disease and ESRD progressively according to the severity of CKD. In 2002, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) organization published a guideline for diagnosis and classification of CKD into five stages according to severity using glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as the main criteria. The presence of proteinuria was mandatory for stages 1 and 2 (GFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Patients with stage 3 (GFR 30 to < 60) or higher were regarded classified as CKD without requirement for the presence of proteinuria. Recent studies have shown that individuals with GFR 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or less had increased risks compared to those with higher GFR. The presence of proteinuria also increased cardio-renal events significantly. Therefore, in 2009, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) group recommended that individuals should be classified according to proteinuria stages as well as by GFR stages. The diagnostic criteria for CKD remained unchanged, but stage 3 should be divided into 2 substages: 3a (GFR 45 to < 60), and 3b (GFR 30to < 45). In addition, clinicians and researchers were advised to use a 'heat map' generated by composite rankings of relative risks to categorize patients.

### ACP releases guideline on screening, monitoring, and treatment… [^112Wk8Hx]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy should be used to manage elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD. From the AFP Editors Chronic kidney disease is commonly defined as abnormalities of the kidney structure or function that are present for longer than three months with implications for health. CKD is typically divided into five stages based on severity as defined by a patient's glomerular filtration rate. The breakdown of stages in increasing order of severity is as follows: Stage 1: kidney damage with GFR ≥ 90 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 2: kidney damage with GFR of 60 to 89 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2 Stage 3: GFR of 30 to 59 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2 Stage 4: GFR of 15 to 29 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 5: GFR < 15 mL per minute per
2. 73 m 2, or kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation. Approximately 22. 4 million adults in the United States have stage 1 to 3 CKD, which is considered early-stage CKD.

Persons in the early stages are typically asymptomatic. However, these three stages, reduced GFR, and albuminuria are associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, fractures, bone loss, infections, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Based on a systematic evidence review, this guideline from the American College of Physicians presents recommendations on screening, monitoring, and treatment of stage 1 to 3 CKD in adults. The guideline identified the following benefits of screening, monitoring, and treatment of CKD: Screening: Early identification of undiagnosed or possibly asymptomatic CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD Monitoring: Identification of progression to later stages of CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD. Although testing for albuminuria and measurement of GFR are widely available in primary care settings, the risk of false-positive results is high.

There is also no evidence on the benefits of early treatment of CKD in those identified by screening; however, potential harms include false-positive results, disease labeling, and unnecessary testing and treatment.

Kidney diseases are an important public health problem, and chronic kidney disease is a noncommunicable disease of global significance. CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage or reduced kidney function for a period of at least 3 months, with implications for health. The level of disease severity has been used to classify CKD into various stages, from persistent kidney damage only with preserved kidney function > 90ml/min/1. 73m2; stage 1) to persistent kidney damage accompanied by mild reduction in kidney function to moderate to severe reduction in kidney function. Stage 5 refers to the advanced stage of CKD also termed "kidney failure, " which can progress to end-stage kidney disease, where dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation is essential to maintain life.

CDC's Kidney Disease Surveillance System is the first surveillance system of its kind developed in the United States to focus on tracking kidney disease prior to ESKD. It has a serious responsibility for serving as a timely and comprehensive surveillance and information system. Findings from this system highlighted on the project's website are intended to raise awareness of multiple facets of kidney disease, to spur individuals, communities, policymakers, researchers, clinicians, and health systems, to bring about incremental and sustainable improvements to reduce the impact of this often-neglected non-communicable disease. The Kidney Disease Surveillance System is funded by CDC as a contract with the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The project official from CDC is Meda E. Pavkov, MD, PhD.
