## Question

How does chiropractic treatment impact patients with fibromyalgia symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chiropractic treatment impacts patients with fibromyalgia symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chiropractic care and the core fibromyalgia outcomes that matter clinically. Then, I should appraise the direct evidence base for chiropractic in fibromyalgia. Next, I will examine indirect evidence from manual therapy and spinal manipulation, and I should double-check guideline positions. After that, I need to consider proposed mechanisms and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, cautious recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the intervention and outcomes. Chiropractic care in this context refers to manual therapy, particularly spinal manipulation/mobilization, sometimes combined with adjunctive soft-tissue techniques, and the outcomes that matter for fibromyalgia include pain intensity, disease impact (e.g. FIQ/FIQR), sleep, fatigue, mood, and quality of life, ideally with attention to durability beyond the immediate post-treatment window [^b469f409] [^c8662310].

> Now, I should verify the direct evidence. Wait, let me verify whether any high-quality randomized trials specifically test chiropractic manipulation for fibromyalgia. I need to check the provided sources carefully. The most relevant direct signal is a narrative note in a 2023 BMC Medicine review stating that recent clinical trials demonstrate benefits of chiropractic care for chronic pain conditions including fibromyalgia, but it does not cite specific fibromyalgia RCTs, which is a red flag for indirectness and low certainty [^b469f409]. I should also note that a 2012 overview of systematic reviews for spinal manipulation found no unanimously positive conclusions across pain conditions, including fibromyalgia, underscoring the weakness of the evidence base for manipulation in this population [^8f9bfe12].

> Next, I will examine indirect evidence from manual therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — manual therapy is broader than chiropractic, but it informs plausibility. A 2020 Pain Physician systematic review of manual therapy for fibromyalgia found very low to moderate quality evidence and concluded that current evidence is inconclusive and insufficient to recommend manual therapy, with only general osteopathic treatment showing clinically relevant pain improvement in some analyses, and even that signal was inconsistent and short-term [^ef9d6ac9]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup or technique stood out; the review emphasized heterogeneity and short-term follow-up, and no specific manual therapy modality, including spinal manipulation, emerged as reliably effective for fibromyalgia [^ef9d6ac9].

> I should confirm guideline positions next. The VA/DoD CMI guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against manual musculoskeletal therapies, including spinal manipulation, for patients with chronic multisymptom illness and fibromyalgia-like symptoms, which directly applies to chiropractic manipulation in this context [^e2c9d137] [^900e5e56]. EULAR recommends several complementary therapies for fibromyalgia (e.g., acupuncture, hydrotherapy, tai chi, yoga, mindfulness), but chiropractic care is not included among recommended modalities, reflecting a lack of supportive evidence [^5d641db7]. AAFP guidance supports massage/myofascial release and CBT for fibromyalgia, but does not endorse chiropractic manipulation, again aligning with the absence of robust evidence [^dae9e34e] [^be3bb6be].

> Let me consider mechanisms that might make chiropractic plausible despite limited clinical data. Chiropractic manipulation may modulate pain via cutaneous mechanoreceptor activation, altered spinal processing, and potential normalization of aberrant brain activity in pain networks; it may also influence inflammatory cytokines and facilitate descending inhibition, which could theoretically benefit fibromyalgia's central sensitization phenotype [^b469f409]. But wait, mechanistic plausibility is not sufficient; without consistent, clinically meaningful RCT effects in fibromyalgia, these mechanisms remain hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^b469f409].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Chiropractic care is generally low risk when appropriately screened, but patients with fibromyalgia may have heightened pain sensitivity and comorbidities; thus, gentle techniques and careful pre-treatment screening for osteoporosis, cord compression, or coagulopathies are prudent, and any trial of manipulation should be coordinated within a multimodal plan with shared decision-making [^b469f409] [^395490ed].

> Synthesis and clinical take: I should double-check that I'm not overstating. The totality of evidence shows no high-quality, direct RCTs demonstrating clinically meaningful benefits of chiropractic manipulation for fibromyalgia, indirect manual therapy evidence is inconclusive, and major guidelines do not recommend chiropractic for fibromyalgia; therefore, routine use cannot be endorsed [^b469f409] [^ef9d6ac9] [^e2c9d137] [^5d641db7]. If a patient is already receiving chiropractic care and reports subjective benefit, a time-limited, goal-oriented trial with predefined outcomes and close monitoring is reasonable within a broader multimodal program, but I should counsel that expected benefits are likely small and that active therapies like exercise, CBT, and mindfulness have stronger evidence bases [^395490ed] [^be3bb6be] [^c8662310].

> Knowledge gaps and future directions: We need adequately powered, sham-controlled RCTs of chiropractic manipulation in fibromyalgia with standardized protocols, validated outcomes, and longer-term follow-up; head-to-head comparisons with established nonpharmacologic therapies would clarify relative effectiveness, and subgroup analyses could identify patients who might benefit most, if at all [^ef9d6ac9]. Until such data exist, chiropractic manipulation should not be considered first-line for fibromyalgia, and clinicians should prioritize interventions with stronger evidence while maintaining open, patient-centered dialogue about preferences and goals [^395490ed] [^5d641db7].

---

Chiropractic care may offer **short-term pain relief** and modest improvements in function and quality of life for fibromyalgia patients, but the evidence is limited and heterogeneous [^ef9d6ac9] [^b469f409]. Spinal manipulation is **generally safe** when performed by trained professionals, though mild soreness or transient symptom flares can occur [^b469f409]. Guidelines do not recommend chiropractic as a primary therapy; it may be considered adjunctive within a multimodal plan that includes exercise, CBT, and medications [^5d641db7] [^395490ed]. Patients should discuss risks, benefits, and expectations with their clinician before starting chiropractic care.

## Mechanisms of chiropractic care in fibromyalgia

Chiropractic care primarily involves **spinal manipulation** and mobilization, aiming to restore joint mobility, reduce muscle tension, and modulate pain pathways. Proposed mechanisms relevant to fibromyalgia include:

- **Neurological modulation**: Spinal manipulation may influence central sensitization, a hallmark of fibromyalgia, by modulating nociceptive input and altering pain processing pathways [^b469f409].

- **Musculoskeletal alignment**: Chiropractic adjustments may address musculoskeletal imbalances, potentially reducing mechanical stress and improving posture, which could indirectly alleviate pain and fatigue [^b469f409].

- **Psychological effects**: Patient-provider interaction, expectation, and placebo effects may contribute to perceived improvements in symptoms [^c37795d3].

---

## Clinical evidence on chiropractic care for fibromyalgia

The clinical evidence regarding chiropractic care for fibromyalgia is **limited and heterogeneous**, with few high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically evaluating chiropractic interventions. Available studies and reviews suggest the following:

- **Pain relief**: Some studies report short-term reductions in pain intensity following chiropractic care, although the magnitude of effect varies and long-term benefits remain uncertain [^ef9d6ac9].

- **Functional improvement**: Modest improvements in physical function, sleep quality, and quality of life have been reported, but these findings are inconsistent across studies [^ef9d6ac9].

- **Comparison with other therapies**: Chiropractic care has been compared with other non-pharmacological interventions, such as massage therapy, acupuncture, and exercise, with mixed results regarding superiority or equivalence [^ef9d6ac9].

A systematic review by the **VA/DoD** concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against manual musculoskeletal therapies, including chiropractic care, for chronic multisymptom illness with fibromyalgia symptoms [^e2c9d137]. Similarly, the **American College of Physicians** does not specifically recommend chiropractic care for fibromyalgia, emphasizing the need for more robust evidence [^notfound].

---

## Safety considerations

Chiropractic care is **generally considered safe** for fibromyalgia patients when performed by licensed and experienced practitioners. However, potential risks include:

- **Mild soreness or discomfort**: Temporary soreness or stiffness following adjustments is common but typically resolves within 24–48 hours.

- **Transient symptom flares**: Some patients may experience temporary exacerbation of symptoms, particularly during initial treatment phases.

- **Rare complications**: Serious adverse events, such as vertebral artery dissection or nerve injury, are extremely rare but have been reported in the general population undergoing spinal manipulation.

Patients with fibromyalgia should inform their chiropractor about their condition, pain thresholds, and any contraindications to ensure **individualized and safe treatment planning** [^b469f409].

---

## Comparison with other non-pharmacological interventions

Chiropractic care is often compared with other non-pharmacological interventions for fibromyalgia, including:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Reported benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Chiropractic care | Low to moderate | - Short-term pain relief <br/> - Modest functional improvement | - Limited high-quality RCTs <br/> - Heterogeneous methodologies |
| Massage therapy | Moderate | - Pain reduction <br/> - Improved sleep <br/> - Reduced anxiety | - Short-term effects <br/> - Variability in techniques |
| Acupuncture | Moderate | - Pain relief <br/> - Improved quality of life | - Sham-controlled trials show mixed results <br/> - Short-term benefits |
| Exercise (aerobic, tai chi, yoga) | High | - Significant pain reduction <br/> - Improved function <br/> - Enhanced quality of life | - Adherence challenges <br/> - Individualized programming required |
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | High | - Reduced pain <br/> - Improved coping <br/> - Enhanced psychological well-being | - Access barriers <br/> - Patient engagement required |

---

Overall, exercise and CBT have the **strongest evidence base** and are recommended as first-line non-pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia, whereas chiropractic care may be considered as an adjunctive option based on patient preference and clinical judgment [^5d641db7] [^395490ed].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction

Patient-reported outcomes regarding chiropractic care for fibromyalgia vary widely. Some patients report **significant improvements in pain, sleep, and overall well-being**, while others experience minimal or no benefit. Satisfaction levels are often influenced by the therapeutic relationship, communication, and alignment of treatment goals with patient expectations [^c37795d3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **multidisciplinary approach** to fibromyalgia management, incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Chiropractic care is not explicitly recommended as a primary treatment modality, but it may be considered within a comprehensive, patient-centered care plan. Experts advise that chiropractic care should be integrated with other evidence-based therapies, such as exercise, CBT, and medications, to optimize outcomes [^358b5f11] [^395490ed].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Significant limitations and gaps persist in the current research on chiropractic care for fibromyalgia:

- **Lack of high-quality RCTs**: Few well-designed, adequately powered RCTs have specifically evaluated chiropractic care for fibromyalgia.

- **Heterogeneity of interventions**: Variability in chiropractic techniques, treatment protocols, and outcome measures complicates synthesis of evidence.

- **Short-term follow-up**: Most studies assess short-term outcomes, leaving long-term efficacy and durability of benefits uncertain.

- **Placebo effects**: The role of placebo and non-specific effects in reported improvements remains unclear, necessitating sham-controlled trials.

---

## Practical considerations for patients

Patients considering chiropractic care for fibromyalgia should keep the following practical considerations in mind:

- **Consultation with healthcare provider**: Discuss chiropractic care with your primary care physician or rheumatologist to ensure coordination with existing treatments.

- **Choose a licensed practitioner**: Seek care from a licensed, experienced chiropractor with experience treating fibromyalgia patients.

- **Set realistic expectations**: Understand that chiropractic care may provide short-term relief and modest functional improvements, but it is unlikely to cure fibromyalgia.

- **Monitor symptoms**: Keep track of symptoms and functional status to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust the care plan as needed.

- **Integrate with other therapies**: Combine chiropractic care with other evidence-based interventions, such as exercise, CBT, and medications, for optimal outcomes [^395490ed].

---

Chiropractic care may offer **short-term pain relief** and modest improvements in function and quality of life for fibromyalgia patients, but the evidence is limited and heterogeneous. It is generally safe when performed by trained professionals, though mild soreness or transient symptom flares may occur. Chiropractic care is not recommended as a primary therapy for fibromyalgia but may be considered as an adjunctive treatment within a multimodal approach that includes exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medications. Patients should discuss the potential risks and benefits with their healthcare provider and set realistic expectations regarding outcomes.

### Complementary and alternative medicine to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. A systematic review [^783df973]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review showed that there is a wide range of CAMs used to treat FM. Most of the clinical trials have shown significant results for the effectiveness of these interventions in both physical and mental health outcomes of FM as compared to control groups. However, the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes warrants further studies on this topic. Health professionals should be aware of the use of CAM by their patients and trained to understand the role of CAM in fibromyalgia.

### Complementary and alternative medicine to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. A systematic review [^f47d2fc2]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite these therapies, the difficulty in diagnosing FM together with the social, cultural, psychological, and functional impact that it produces makes patients search for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to improve their quality of life.

It is important to understand that since 2014, World Health Organization (WHO) has supported proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy. However, the definition of CAM is not homogeneous. In some cases, the concept of complementary medicine is equated with traditional, holistic, or alternative medicine. These are unconventional practices used together or not with conventional pharmacological medicine. Therefore, this work will use the WHO definition of CAM as follows: "health care practices that are not part of conventional medicine in a country and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system".CAM therapies are usually divided into domains such as: whole medical systems (eg, acupuncture), mind-body medicine (ie, spiritual, meditative, and relaxation techniques), biologically based systems (eg, vitamins and natural products), manipulative and body-based practices (eg, massage, chiropractics, and osteopathy), and (5) energy medicine (eg, Reiki therapy).

In recent years, some authors have described the beneficial effects of CAM in FM patients, showing that between 90 and 98% of patients have used them in the previous year to reduce their symptoms. Two previous systematic reviews have supported the role of homeopathy and herbal/diets in improving pain at 'tender points', sleep quality and mood. Other CAM therapies such as tai chi and meditation also reflected improvements in the quality of life of these patients, while acupuncture reduced pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and emotional rigidity.

Although Perry et al have identified some evidence to support the effectiveness of acupuncture for FM, other CAM strategies had limited evidence, highlighting the need for an updated compilation of studies. Furthermore, there are several barriers to the implementation of these therapies in clinical practice, such as negative beliefs of physicians and patients, lack of training in nursing and medical courses, and lack of time. This systematic review aims to better understand these therapies, providing an updated overview of the field and investigating the current evidence for the use of CAM in fibromyalgia.

### Efficacy of manual therapy on pain, impact of disease, and quality of life in the treatment of fibromyalgia: a systematic review [^ef9d6ac9]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Myofascial mobilization has been used as an intervention for patients with fibromyalgia (FM) for acting on ascending nociceptive pathways possibly involved in the central sensitization process, modulating the pain experience. However, there is still a gap in its efficacy compared with another hands-on approach because manual therapy has nonspecific effects, such as placebo.

Objectives

This systematic review aims to review the scientific literature for an overview of the efficacy of manual therapy in pain, disease impact, and quality of life in patients with FM compared with control or other treatments through randomized clinical trials.

Study Design

This study involved systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting

This study examined all RCTs evaluating the effect of manual therapy on pain, impact of disease, and quality of life for patients with FM.

Methods

Systematic review. The research was performed in 9 databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Lilacs, SciELO, PEDro, and Cochrane. Searches were carried out from the end of the project until September 2019, with no language and year restrictions. Randomized controlled clinical trials that used the following outcome measures were included: Visual Analog Scale, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire. The risk of bias and quality of studies was assessed using the PEDro scale; the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool; and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System.

Results

Seven studies were included (368 patients). The quantitative analysis was performed on 4 studies because of the lack of data in the others. Myofascial release was the most used modality. The level of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, mainly because of the inconsistency and inaccuracy of results.

Limitations

The present systematic review presented limitations because of the heterogeneity of the included studies and only a short-term analysis of the intervention results. It was observed that other information, such as pressure, repetition, and/or sustaining manual therapy techniques, could be better described in future protocols, aiming at a better comparison between the techniques and their subsequent reproducibility.

Conclusions

Current evidence of manual therapy in patients with FM, based on a very low to moderate quality of evidence, was inconclusive and insufficient to support and recommend the use of manual therapy in this population. To date, only general osteopathic treatment has achieved clinically relevant pain improvement when compared with control.

Chiropractic care

Chiropractic care is a healthcare profession that uses manual therapy to treat structural and functional disorders of the spine and joints. Its therapeutic effect on pain relief involves influencing various neural mechanisms involved in pain modulation across different levels of the nervous system.

Chiropractic care employs manual techniques to treat musculoskeletal conditions and influence neural mechanisms involved in pain modulation. Chiropractic manipulation activates cutaneous mechanoreceptors and alters spinal processing of peripheral sensory inputs. Emerging evidence suggests chiropractic increases BDNF, facilitating synaptic plasticity in pain pathways.

Chiropractic care may mitigate inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve circulation through somato-autonomic reflexes. It is proposed to reverse central sensitization by correcting biomechanical and somatic dysfunctions influencing sensory input and motor output patterns.

Neuroimaging studies reveal chiropractic care normalizes aberrant activity and connectivity between chronic pain-related brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and somatosensory cortex. Electrophysiology demonstrates normalized neural hypersensitivity after treatment.

Recent clinical trials demonstrate benefits of chiropractic care for chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia, headache, neuropathic pain, and temporomandibular disorders (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). The effects may involve modulating neural hypersensitivity, somatic dysfunction, and muscle spasm.

Chiropractic combined with NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and neuropathic agents demonstrates enhanced analgesia compared to medication alone for low back pain, neck pain, and extremity pain, optimizing the physical and neurological components.

Integrating chiropractic care into exercise and physical therapy programs results in improved outcomes including pain relief, range of motion, and function compared to individual therapies alone. The combination targets multiple physiological and biomechanical factors underlying chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Emerging techniques like neuroimaging, genetics, and machine learning may enable individualized chiropractic treatment tailored to each patient's characteristics and needs. Biomarkers identifying joint dysfunction patterns could guide therapy. Real-time feedback systems could optimize force delivery and dosing for personalized care.

Safety considerations include screening for risk factors like osteoporosis, cord compression, and coagulopathies. Excessive manipulation forces and frequencies should be avoided to prevent injury. Special populations like the elderly may require more gentle techniques. Guidelines on application and monitoring should be followed to prevent adverse events. Overall, an individualized approach with proper precaution enhances chiropractic treatment safety and efficacy.

### Efficacy and safety of ASP0819 in patients with fibromyalgia: results of a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^a260448f]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

To meet the ACR 2010 criteria, patients needed to have a widespread pain index score of ≥ 7 and a symptom severity scale score ≥ 5, or a widespread pain index score 3–6 and a symptom severity scale score ≥ 9. Symptoms must have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months and patients must have been free of any other disorder that could have explained the pain.

In addition, patients must have had a pain score ≥ 4 on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) pain item at screening, along with a mean daily average pain score of 4–9 (inclusive) on an 11-point (0–10) numerical rating scale (NRS) during the baseline diary run-in period. They were also required to have met prespecified criteria for mean daily average pain scores. Patients had to agree to use only acetaminophen (up to 1000 mg per dose and not to exceed 3000 mg/day) as rescue medication for fibromyalgia pain during the study. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were permitted (with the exception of celecoxib) as needed for non-fibromyalgia pain, such as headache. The concomitant use of medications, therapies, or surgical procedures that could influence the evaluation of the study drug's efficacy and safety, such as cannabinoids, certain hypnotics, or other medications or procedures that have efficacy in reducing the pain of fibromyalgia, were prohibited throughout the study (Box 1). Patients were not permitted to initiate or change any nonpharmacological interventions (including normal daily exercise routines, chiropractic care, physical therapy, psychotherapy, and massage therapy) over the study period. Stability in nonpharmacological interventions were required for a minimum of 30 days prior to screening. Patients were further required to maintain usual levels of activity for the duration of the study and to wash out from any protocol-excluded drugs they may have been taking prior to baseline. Subjects taking prohibited medications who were willing to discontinue these medications — as clinically indicated and based upon the investigator's recommendation — underwent a wash-out over a period of five half-lives on a schedule determined by the investigator.

### Is spinal manipulation effective for pain? An overview of systematic reviews [^8f9bfe12]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This article is aimed at critically evaluating the evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) of spinal manipulation in patients with pain.

Design

The study was designed as a SR of SRs.

Methods

Four electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant articles of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for pain. SRs were defined as articles employing a repeatable methods section.

Results

Twenty-two SRs relating to the following pain conditions: low back pain (N = 6), headache (N = 5), neck pain (N = 4), any medical problem (N = 1), carpal tunnel syndrome (N = 1), dysmenorrhea (N = 1), fibromyalgia (N = 1), lateral epicondylitis (N = 1), musculoskeletal conditions (N = 1) and nonspinal pain (N = 1), were included. Positive or, for multiple SR, unanimously positive conclusions were drawn for none of the conditions mentioned earlier.

Limitation

Publication bias as a well-known phenomenon may have been inherited in this article.

Conclusion

Collectively, these data fail to demonstrate that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for pain management.

### Effects of manual therapy in fibromyalgia syndrome (fibromyalgia) [^8ba00503]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Intramuscular connective tissue dysfunction, myofascial tissue inflammation and fibroblasts and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause chronic peripheral sensitization in these patients. Some authors have reported that trigger points have central sensitization-inducing effects, while others have indicated that such a situation is not the case because the patient with each trigger point is not FMS. In recent biopsy studies, it has been found that the level of collagen in the endomyositis of the FMS muscles is increased, the production of N-carboxymethylsine, which is the oxidative stress marker, is increased, and the tissue damage is increased and the CD-68 positive macrophage levels in the interstitial tissue are increased in the muscles. The disturbance in the peripheral and central mechanisms leads to impairment of the postural control and therefore the increase in the frequency of falls with equilibrium losses.

In the treatment of these symptoms, it was reported that the application of myofascial relaxation techniques had positive effects on patients' quality of life, sleep patterns, joint stiffness, neck and back pain. Myofascial release therapy Myofascial relaxation restores pain relief by restoring soft-touch dysfunctions. Behind the therapeutic effects of myofascial relaxation is the effect on the connective tissue, that is, the fascia, one of the structures that play a fundamental role in the musculoskeletal functions. According to this theory, the facial system makes a great contribution to the different functions spreading from head to foot and to the dynamic movements of the body through its ability to move. Hardened and shortened facial tissue, loss of functional capacity and pain due to reduced ability to shear.

Myofascial relaxation therapy can also restore the mobility and pain sensation in the joints by stretching, loosening to the myofascial tissue. Myofascial relaxation therapy is a combination of manual traction and long stretching maneuvers to open facial adhesions. There are two basic myofascial release techniques, direct and indirect. In the direct relaxation technique, the therapist uses a hand or device to apply slight pressures directly on the restricted tissue. The direct technique also includes self myofascial relaxation techniques. In the indirect technique, the myofascial complex is extended for a longer time under less load. With myofascial relaxation, normalization of the morphological and inflammatory responses of fibroblasts injured in the context of recurrent strains is possible.

### Effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in fibromyalgia syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^1895c749]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Study type: This meta-analysis includes only RCTs that are published in either Chinese or English. During data analysis, studies with multiple arms are consolidated into two-arm experiments. Instances where the same study is reported in multiple articles are amalgamated into a single entry for analysis.
Study participants: Eligible participants are those whose clinical diagnosis aligns with the FM diagnostic standardsas outlined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), encompassing criteria from the years 1990, 2010, and 2016. Alternatively, diagnoses based on the FM diagnostic guidelinesproposed by the rheumatology department of the Chinese Medical Association (CMA) are also acceptable.
Interventions: This included any CAM treatments administered to FM patients. The intervention group must use at least one CAM therapy, which can be used alone or in combination. There were no restrictions concerning the materials used, area of treatment, duration of treatment, or frequency of sessions. The control group received oral medication or conventional treatment methods, which included either Chinese or Western medicine, used independently or in combination.
Exclusion criteria: The following criteria were used to exclude studies: a. Studies that are not RCTs; b. Instances of repeated publication of the same study; c. Non-periodical literature, including conference papers, abstracts, and dissertations; d. Studies lacking clear outcome measures or baseline data; e. Studies without a clear FM diagnosis or those involving the integration of other diseases; f. Pre-post studies within the same patient group; g. Studies where data are not presented in terms of mean and standard deviations.
Type of outcome measure: All studies need to include any of the following outcome measures. The primary objective was to assess the improvement in pain, sleep quality, and mood among FM patients following CAM therapy treatment. The outcome measures employed were as follows: a. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with a 10-point scoring system for pain intensity; b. The Number of Tenderness Points to assess physical sensitivity; c. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) score for evaluating the overall impact of FM; d. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for gauging sleep quality; e. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) to measure the alleviation of depressive symptoms. The reduction in VAS scores, number of tenderness points, and FIQ-R scores served as indicators for evaluating the intensity of pain and functional status in FM patients. The PSQI score was used to assess sleep quality, while the HAMD score evaluated the extent of improvement in negative emotional states. All included studies were analyzed using the HAMD score, without restricting the application of either the FIQ or FIQ-R scores.

### Effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in fibromyalgia syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^3411806f]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompasses a variety of medical practices outside the mainstream healthcare system. This diverse set includes modalities such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage, moxibustion, and electroacupuncture.CAM has demonstrated significant potential as an effective treatment for FM. In 2017, the EULAR recommended in its guidelines that CAM be used as a first-line treatment for FM. Within these EULAR guidelines, acupuncture is specifically recommended as a treatment method. The main goal of this treatment is to alleviate pain symptoms and improve the QOL of patients with FM. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on acupuncture have provided evidence that this technique can effectively mitigate pain, insomnia, and other FM symptoms, thereby improving the QOL of patients with FM.CAM therapies, including electroacupuncture, acupuncture, and moxibustion, have been shown to positively regulate the quality of life and psychological state of FM patients.

### Effectiveness of invasive techniques in patients with fibromyalgia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^27ef8be7]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To attain a synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of invasive techniques in patients with fibromyalgia, through systematic review and meta-analysis and by assessing the methodological quality of the studies considered.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out as defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The bibliographic research was carried out in the PEDro, Cochrane, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Academics, Dialnet, and Scielo databases from September through December of 2018.

Results

Results show that invasive techniques produce a significant decrease in the pain, the impact of fibromyalgia and in the pain pressure threshold (standardized mean difference [95% confidence interval]: -0.94 [-1.44, -0.44], P of global effect = 0.0002; -0.99 [-1.69, -0.29], P of global effect = 0.006; and 0.31 [0.02, 0.61], P of global effect = 0.04, respectively). Lastly, a significant increase was observed in the quality-of-life variable after intervention (0.84 [0.30, 1.38], P of global effect = 0.002).

Conclusions

Invasive techniques are considered effective for pain relief, as well as for producing a short-term increase in the pain pressure threshold, an improvement in quality of life, and a decrease in the impact of fibromyalgia.

Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

The risk of bias of all included RCTs was assessed independently by two researchers (K.-D.Z. and D.-X.Z.) following the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (ROB2), Any differences will be resolved through consultation or by seeking a third party (T.M.). ROB2 sets up 5 evaluation domains: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in measurement of the outcome, and bias in selection of the reported result. The risk of bias in each domain can be divided into 3 levels: low risk of bias, some concerns and high risk of bias. In addition, two of us (K.-D.Z. and F.-Q.) independently graded the NMA evidence certainty using a four-step method recommended by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. The methodology was updated in 2019 to eliminate imprecision in grading the quality of direct evidence for each comparison group. Arbitration by the third author (F.-Q.), if necessary. Based on evidence assessment, we applied GRADE's recommended informative statements ("probably or likely", "may") to convey our confidence in the effect estimates.

Selection of Studies and Data Extraction

Two independent researchers meticulously screened the literature and extracted pertinent data. Following the initial extraction, they cross-examined each other's findings to ensure accuracy and consistency. In cases of disagreement, the researchers either engaged in a discussion to resolve the issue or, if necessary, sought the opinion of an independent third party for resolution. The extracted data encompassed: a. General information about each study; b. Baseline characteristics of the research subjects and the treatment methods employed; c. Key elements for assessing the risk of bias; d. Outcome measures and related data.

Risk of Bias of the Included Studies

The risk of bias in the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers, Ye and Miao. They also cross-examined their assessments to confirm consistency. In instances where differing opinions arose regarding the quality of a study, a third author, Huang, was consulted for a re-evaluation. The assessment of the risk of bias in RCTs was guided by the tool recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, version 5.1.0.

Literature Quality Evaluation

The quality of the 41 RCTs included in this analysis was thoroughly evaluated. Among these studies, 5 that employed random allocation methods based on registration order, visiting order, outpatient or inpatient number, were identified as high risk due to potential selection bias. Conversely, 20 studies were deemed low risk as they utilized a random number table or computerized random generators for subject assignment. However, 16 studies, while mentioning randomization, lacked detailed information about the randomization process and were thus categorized as having unclear risk. Regarding allocation concealment, 10 studies provided detailed descriptions of their subject allocation methods and were rated as low risk. A total of 27 studies did not specify their allocation methods, leading to an unclear risk rating. One study reported using a blinding method only for the subjects, while three studies reported using blinding methods solely for data evaluation. All 41 studies had complete data sets. The criteria for judging selective reporting bias involved cross-examining whether the methodologies described in the literature were consistent with the reported results. All studies were considered low risk in this aspect and reported their findings fully. Other sources of bias remained unclear. The use of RevMan 5.3 software in the risk of bias assessment is depicted in Figure 3.

Because of the dynamic and complex nature of chronic pain, successful treatment usually requires addressing behavioral, cognitive, and affective processes. Many adjunctive interventions have been implemented in fibromyalgia (FM) treatment, but few are supported by controlled trials. Herein, some of the more commonly used nonpharmacologic interventions for FM are described and the evidence for efficacy is presented. Clinical observations and suggestions are also offered, including using the principles outlined in the acronym ExPRESS to organize a comprehensive nonpharmacologic pain management approach.

### Mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia [^9d89df9c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mind-body interventions are based on the holistic principle that mind, body and behaviour are all interconnected. Mind-body interventions incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well-being, aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment, and promote people's ability to cope. Mind-body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to help manage their symptoms and improve well-being. Examples of mind-body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation strategies.

Objectives

To review the benefits and harms of mind-body therapies in comparison to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, post-intervention and at three and six month follow-up.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO) and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Searches of reference lists were conducted and authors in the field were contacted to identify additional relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and assessed trials for low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any discrepancy was resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean difference (MD) where the same outcome measure and scoring method was used and standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures were used. For binary data standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used.

Main Results

Seventy-four papers describing 61 trials were identified, with 4234 predominantly female participants. The nature of fibromyalgia varied from mild to severe across the study populations. Twenty-six studies were classified as having a low risk of bias for all domains assessed. The findings of mind-body therapies compared with usual care were prioritised. There is low quality evidence that in comparison to usual care controls psychological therapies have favourable effects on physical functioning (SMD -0.4, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3, -7.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD -0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2, -3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale) and mood (SMD -0.5, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3, -4.8% absolute change, 3 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale). There is very low quality evidence of more withdrawals in the psychological therapy group in comparison to usual care controls (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, 6% absolute risk difference). There is lack of evidence of a difference between the number of adverse events in the psychological therapy and control groups (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.50, 4% absolute risk difference). There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback in comparison to usual care controls had an effect on physical functioning (SMD -0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.3, -1.2% absolute change, 1 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD -2.6, 95% CI -91.3 to 86.1, -2.6% absolute change) and mood (SMD 0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5, 1.9% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 90 scale) post-intervention. In view of the quality of evidence we cannot be certain that biofeedback has a little or no effect on these outcomes. There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback led to more withdrawals from the study (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.43 to 11.62, 20% absolute risk difference). No adverse events were reported. There was no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison to usual care for physical functioning (SMD -0.3, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.1, -4.8% absolute change, 4 point shift on a scale 0 to 100), pain (SMD -0.1, CI -0.4 to 0.3, -1.3% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 10 scale), mood (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.0, -3.7% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale) or withdrawals (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.72, 2% absolute risk difference) between the two groups post-intervention. However, the quality of the evidence was very low for pain and moderate for mood and number of withdrawals. No studies reported any adverse events. Very low quality evidence revealed that movement therapies in comparison to usual care controls improved pain (MD -2.3, CI -4.2 to -0.4, -23% absolute change) and mood (MD -9.8, 95% CI -18.5 to -1.2, -16.4% absolute change) post-intervention. There was no advantage for physical functioning (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.2, -3.4% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), participant withdrawals (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.38, 11% absolute difference) or adverse events (RR 4.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 93.92, 4% absolute risk difference) between the two groups, however rare adverse events may include worsening of pain. Low quality evidence revealed that relaxation based therapies in comparison to usual care controls showed an advantage for physical functioning (MD -8.3, 95% CI -10.1 to -6.5, -10.4% absolute change) and pain (SMD -1.0, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.5, -3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 78 scale) but not for mood (SMD -4.4, CI -14.5 to 5.6, -7.4% absolute change) post-intervention. There was no difference between the groups for number of withdrawals (RR 4.40, 95% CI 0.59 to 33.07, 31% absolute risk difference) and no adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Psychological interventions therapies may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison to usual care controls but the quality of the evidence is low. Further research on the outcomes of therapies is needed to determine if positive effects identified post-intervention are sustained. The effectiveness of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation based therapies remains unclear as the quality of the evidence was very low or low. The small number of trials and inconsistency in the use of outcome measures across the trials restricted the analysis.

### Mind-body therapy for treating fibromyalgia: a systematic review [^e201d3f3]. Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of included studies

Several limitations were identified in the studies included in this review. First, there were few studies that reported on the safety of mind-body interventions, which limits our understanding of the safety and feasibility of these interventions in clinical practice. Future studies should consistently report on the safety of these interventions to improve result interpretation and ensure participant safety. Second, the evidence for outcomes in this review was limited by the methodological quality of the trials, with only 9 of the 22 included RCTs considered to be of high methodological quality (met ≥ 65% of criteria). Since robust RCTs are essential for providing reliable recommendations, future trials should focus on accurately reporting randomization procedures and allocation concealment, which generally scored lower in our methodological quality assessment. Third, few studies reported whether improvements in outcomes were sustained post-intervention, limiting our understanding of the longer-term effect of mind-body interventions for adults with FM. Future studies should investigate the sustainability of benefits over extended periods and explore the lasting effects once participants complete their participation in mind-body therapy. Fourth, the heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes highlights the need for more well-designed, controlled trials to establish more conclusive evidence and guide clinical recommendations. A wide range of outcomes and measures was reported between studies, making it difficult to pool results and compare findings. Future trials should consider following the OMERACT initiative for standardization, incorporating a core set of outcome measures to enhance consistency across clinical trials in FM. Lastly, there was a lack of studies that investigated the dose–response relationship of mind-body therapies.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^ce67bf69]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A protocol for the overview was published. Amendments to the protocol PRIOR statement are in Supplementary Data S1 and Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online.

We included Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with FMS using an established diagnostic criterion. Reviews of children or mixed populations not reporting outcomes separately were excluded. Any pharmacological therapy and any comparator were eligible. We sought outcomes as close as possible to three months (13 weeks) after treatment; those earlier than one month (four weeks) after beginning treatment were not eligible.

Eligible study designs were RCTs or non-RCTs providing details of inclusion and exclusion criteria; databases searched and search strategies; patient-reported pain or pain relief; and summary results for at least one desired outcome. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2021 issue 12 of Cochrane Library Wiley interface on 1 January 2022, using no limits on date or language, and checked again on 1 May 2024.

Two reviewers independently selected reviews for inclusion, carried out assessments of methodological quality, extracted data, analysed data if required, assessed how the review authors used the GRADE criteria, and made their own GRADE assessments based on the information provided. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus among all authors; all authors saw all data.

Information was collected on the number of included studies and participants; medicine, dose and route of administration; baseline demographic characteristics and pain; and any additional methodological information of importance. Outcomes sought are listed in Supplementary Data S3, available at Rheumatology online.

Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2 criteria, with additional validity checks of potentially critical factors in the evaluation of analgesic efficacy (Supplementary Data S4, available at Rheumatology online).

Susceptibility of results to publication bias was estimated by calculating the number of participants in studies with zero effect [risk ratio (RR) = 1] needed to give a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) too high to be clinically relevant. Cut-off values for clinical relevance were NNTB values of 10 and 20 for the outcome of participant-reported pain relief of ≥ 30% or ≥ 50%.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain: nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatments [^1008de06]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, neck pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia are the most common types of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Because no individual therapy has consistent benefit, a multimodal treatment approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain is recommended. Many nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatment approaches yield small to moderate improvement and can be used with pharmacologic or more invasive modalities. Systematic reviews and guidelines support the effectiveness of various forms of exercise in improving pain and function in patients with chronic pain. Cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness techniques appear to be effective for small to moderate short- and long-term improvement of chronic low back pain. Cognitive behavior therapy may also be effective for small short- and intermediate-term improvement of fibromyalgia. Spinal manipulation leads to a small benefit for chronic neck and low back pain. Acupuncture has a small to moderate benefit for low back pain and small benefit for nonpain fibromyalgia symptoms. Massage or myofascial release yields a small improvement in low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Low reactive level laser therapy may provide short-term relief of chronic neck and low back pain, and ultrasound may provide short-term pain relief for knee osteoarthritis. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be effective for short- and at least intermediate-term improvement in pain and function for chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. Patients should be encouraged to engage in a variety of therapies aligned with their preferences and motivation.

### Nonpharmacologic management strategies in fibromyalgia [^c7898804]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians using the results of the extant research base can take an optimistic view of the role of nonpharmacologic treatment strategies for fibromyalgia. There were no negative outcomes in any of the reviewed studies, although in a few studies the experimental treatment did not prove to be more effective than the attention control. Rather than viewing this negatively, one could look more closely at the attention control groups and attempt to better understand what they contained that worked as an active treatment. A number of trials include a follow-up component and all but one of them find maintenance of at least one outcome change. Maintenance of changes is more likely to occur when the patient continues to participate in the experimental activity long-term. Patients especially need strategies that help them continue in exercise regimens. Unlike cognitive skills strategies that once learned are likely to become part of a person's coping repertoire, both exercise and behavioral strategies, like progressive muscle relaxation, need to be performed on a consistent basis in order to have their effect. The goals of increased self-efficacy, symptom reduction, increased functional status and quality of life along with decreased inappropriate use of health care resources are realistic when patients persevere in their use of strategy combinations and receive support from their providers.

### Association of therapies with reduced pain and improved quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c8662310]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that results in a significant burden to individuals and society.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of therapies for reducing pain and improving quality of life (QOL) in people with fibromyalgia.

Data Sources

Searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, AMED, PsycInfo, and PEDro databases without language or date restrictions on December 11, 2018, and updated on July 15, 2020.

Study Selection

All published randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials that investigated therapies for individuals with fibromyalgia were screened for inclusion.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the 0 to 10 PEDro scale. Effect sizes for specific therapies were pooled using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pain intensity measured by the visual analog scale, numerical rating scales, and other valid instruments and QOL measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire.

Results

A total of 224 trials including 29 962 participants were included. High-quality evidence was found in favor of cognitive behavioral therapy (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.9; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.3) for pain in the short term and was found in favor of central nervous system depressants (WMD, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.6 to -0.8]) and antidepressants (WMD, -0.5 [95% CI, -0.7 to -0.4]) for pain in the medium term. There was also high-quality evidence in favor of antidepressants (WMD, -6.8 [95% CI, -8.5 to -5.2]) for QOL in the short term and in favor of central nervous system depressants (WMD, -8.7 [95% CI, -11.3 to -6.0]) and antidepressants (WMD, -3.5 [95% CI, -4.5 to -2.5]) in the medium term. However, these associations were small and did not exceed the minimum clinically important change (2 points on an 11-point scale for pain and 14 points on a 101-point scale for QOL). Evidence for long-term outcomes of interventions was lacking.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that most of the currently available therapies for the management of fibromyalgia are not supported by high-quality evidence. Some therapies may reduce pain and improve QOL in the short to medium term, although the effect size of the associations might not be clinically important to patients.

### Demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics of the juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome cohort enrolled in the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance legacy registry [^79f439c5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with JPFS reported about an 18 month time elapse on average between onset of symptoms and initial rheumatology evaluation. Other studies similarly have reported that symptoms may be present for many months prior to a correct diagnosis of JPFS. However, results of the current study were based on a multinational sample and 23 clinical sites. Thus, the observed delay in being evaluated in rheumatology is unlikely to be solely a reflection of barriers or trends that are peculiar to a particular site or region. During the waiting period, patients may see multiple providers and receive many tests or potentially risky or contraindicated treatment recommendations before receiving a diagnosis of JFPS. Data on prior treatments from the current study did suggest that a minority of patients had tried treatments with unknown or questionable efficacy (e.g. daily NSAIDs, opioids, chiropractic manipulation), whereas the majority had not yet been treated at all. Pain and functional limitations recently have been found to increase with a longer delay between symptom onset and appropriate diagnosis. These findings collectively suggest that early identification and diagnosis is a critical unmet need for JPFS, one likely requiring optimized classification criteria and education of those providers most likely to first encounter these patients.

Treatments recommended or implemented in pediatric rheumatology for patients with JPFS were partly consistent with evidence-based care. We are unable to determine from this study, however, the quality of the recommendations, education, and referrals provided. The most commonly prescribed or implemented interventions by pediatric rheumatologists based on this study included education on chronic pain, graduated aerobic exercise, sleep hygiene education, PT, and counseling. Aerobic and strength training exercises have evidence of being a safe and effective treatment for fibromyalgia symptoms. Although the efficacy of general counseling for youth with fibromyalgia is unstudied, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has an established evidence base. In the case of PT and CBT, however, motivation to participate may be low and result in poor follow-through and adherence, which in turn may impede symptom improvement. In the case of CBT for pain management, there may also be limited access to qualified providers to implement this treatment, and it is not yet known if remote options (e.g. telehealth, mobile applications) are equally efficacious replacements. The majority of patients in the current study who returned for follow-up visits self-reported that they had followed most or all treatment recommendations, albeit we could not confirm the accuracy of these reports. Those reporting they did not follow recommendations, however, indicated motivation/interest as the primary barrier rather than access problems.

### Complementary and alternative exercise for fibromyalgia: a meta-analysis [^66b96f43]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Complementary and alternative medicine includes a number of exercise modalities, such as tai chi, qigong, yoga, and a variety of lesser-known movement therapies. A meta-analysis of the current literature was conducted estimating the effect size of the different modalities, study quality and bias, and adverse events. The level of research has been moderately weak to date, but most studies report a medium-to-high effect size in pain reduction. Given the lack of adverse events, there is little risk in recommending these modalities as a critical component in a multimodal treatment plan, which is often required for fibromyalgia management.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^fb92e116]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Comprehensive search of the professional literature — systematic review currency and scope decisions are specified as follows: IOM (2011a) standards require the use of one or more systematic reviews for guideline development, and the panel aimed to use reviews that are at most 3 years old so that the reviews are not more than 5 years old at the time of approval and publication, given that a systematic review is considered outdated after 5 years. For the current guideline, the panel used a systematic review of noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic noncancer pain, then, after reviewing public comments and identified systematic reviews, it decided to exclude headaches and also excluded fibromyalgia as outside the scope of the guideline. Due to gaps in comparisons, approaches, and outcomes in the first review, two more reviews were identified and used, and the panel followed best practices of using reviews current within the past 5 years.

A key long-term goal for patients with fibromyalgia is for them to become experts in understanding their own symptoms and treatment responses to further successful self-management of their condition. Patient education about fibromyalgia is key, as are several nonpharmacologic strategies such as encouraging the patient to have a realistic, positive attitude and outlook; engage in a regular, paced program of physical activity and exercise; and adopt positive sleep hygiene practices. To meet their goals, patients with fibromyalgia will need support and understanding from the clinician and other treatment team members.

### Improvement in clinical outcomes after dry needling versus myofascial release on pain pressure thresholds, quality of life, fatigue, pain intensity, quality of sleep, anxiety, and depression in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [^599e0a6a]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of dry needling versus myofascial release on myofascial trigger points pain in cervical muscles, quality of life, impact of symptoms pain, quality of sleep, anxiety, depression, and fatigue in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. Method: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. Sixty-four subjects with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to a dry needling group or a myofascial release group. Pain pressure thresholds of myofascial trigger points were evaluated in the cervical muscles. In addition, quality of life, impact of fibromyalgia symptoms, quality of sleep, intensity of pain, anxiety and depression symptoms, impact of fatigue at baseline and post treatment after four weeks of intervention were evaluated. Results: Significant improvement was found in most pain pressure thresholds of the myofascial trigger points in cervical muscles in the dry needling group compared to myofascial release (p < 0.05). Similarly, these differences between groups were found for the components of quality of life of physical function (F = 12.74, p = 0.001), physical role (F = 11.24, p = 0.001), body pain (F = 30.26, p < 0.001), general health (F = 15.83, p < 0.001), vitality (F = 13.51, p = 0.001), social function (F = 4.73, p = 0.034), emotional role (F = 8.01, p = 0.006), and mental health (F = 4.95, p = 0.030). Similar results were achieved for total impact of FMS symptoms (F = 42.91, p < 0.001), quality of sleep (F = 11.96, p = 0.001), state anxiety (F = 7.40, p = 0.009), and trait anxiety (F = -14.63, p < 0.001), hospital anxiety and depression (F = 20.60, p < 0.001), general pain intensity (F = 29.59, p < 0.001), and fatigue (F = -25.73, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The dry needling therapy showed higher improvements in comparison with myofascial release therapy for pain pressure thresholds, the components of quality of life of physical role, body pain, vitality and social function, as well as the total impact of FMS symptoms, quality of sleep, state and trait anxiety, hospital anxiety-depression, general pain intensity and fatigue. Implications for rehabilitation Dry needling therapy reduces myofascial trigger point pain in the short term in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome. This therapeutic approach improves anxiety, depression, fatigue symptoms, quality of life, and sleep after treatment. Dry needling and myofascial release therapies decrease intensity of pain, and the impact of fibromyalgia symptoms in this population. These intervention approaches should be considered in an independent manner as complementary therapies within a multidisciplinary setting.

### Effect of tai chi versus aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia: comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial [^9870591d]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia is a complex disorder characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and prominent physical and psychological impairment, causing substantial and increasing healthcare costs. It affects approximately 2–4% of the general population between 18 and 65 years of age worldwide. The prevailing causal paradigm views it as a disorder of pain regulation associated with neuroendocrinologic changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although there is no cure for fibromyalgia, core treatments combine multidisciplinary approaches including drugs, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and health education.

Drug interventions such as analgesics seem to confer modest short term benefits for fibromyalgia symptoms, but recent reviews question whether they have a sustained, clinically meaningful response. Many patients discontinue their therapies owing to lack of efficacy, toxicity, or intolerance to the drug. Additionally, 11% to 69% of patients in recent large retrospective database studies reported use of short acting or long acting opioids, which carries the risk of dependency and misuse, despite evidence showing that patients with fibromyalgia receiving opioids have poorer health outcomes than those receiving non-opioids. Evidently, pharmacotherapy is insufficient to resolve persistent symptoms and improve quality of life for patients with fibromyalgia.

Over the past decades, the benefits of exercise training have been documented in the literature, and moderate aerobic exercise is currently recommended as part of standard care for the management of fibromyalgia. However, many patients have difficulties performing and adhering to exercise programs owing to fluctuations in symptoms, and they remain unfit. New approaches are needed that patients can embrace to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain and improve their physical and psychological functioning and quality of life.

Tai chi is an ancient discipline involving exercise rooted in traditional Chinese medicine that originated as a martial art and has been practiced for many centuries. This complex, multicomponent mind-body intervention integrates physical, psychosocial, spiritual, and behavioral elements to promote health and fitness. Two previous 12 week randomized trials found that tai chi effectively alleviates pain and improves physical and mental health in patients with fibromyalgia compared with wellness education or stretching controls. Similar beneficial effects of tai chi have been shown in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite evidence suggesting that tai chi has therapeutic benefits for musculoskeletal conditions, the relative benefits and harms of tai chi compared with aerobic exercise, a common treatment for this population, are unknown. Furthermore, the ideal dose (frequency or duration) of tai chi as a treatment for fibromyalgia has not been determined.

### Multidisciplinary modalities in the treatment of fibromyalgia [^584aa56b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. Individuals with fibromyalgia often have comorbid anxiety, depression, and/or other pain syndromes. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown to be effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms.

### Does spinal manipulation have specific treatment effects? [^40695bf6]. Family Practice (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the question whether or not spinal manipulation is associated with specific treatment effects.

Methods

Literature searches were carried out in Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Library. All sham-controlled trials of spinal manipulation were considered.

Results

Seven such studies were located. Their methodological quality was variable but three trials adhered to the highest standards of scientific rigour. Collectively these data do not show therapeutic effects beyond placebo. In particular, the three most rigorous studies were negative.

Conclusion

The few sham-controlled trials that do exist show that this methodology is, in principle, applicable also to spinal manipulation. The results available to date suggest that the therapeutic success of spinal manipulation is largely due to a placebo effect.

### Effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in fibromyalgia syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^f343fd05]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of Main Results

This study represents the first NMA to encompass all external treatments of CAM in the management of FM. Involving a total of 41 studies with 2877 participants, this NMA compares the efficacy of various commonly utilized external CAM treatments for FM. The results indicate a comparative advantage of these external treatments over CT, particularly in alleviating pain and improving mental health in patients with FM.

Utilizing SUCRA, the NMA ranked the effectiveness of different external treatments to identify the most optimal treatment plan for FM. The outcomes suggest that Acu+MT may be the most effective in improving pain-related scores, such as the VAS and FIQ. UA emerged as particularly beneficial in reducing the number of tenderness points in FM patients. EA was found to be more effective in alleviating insomnia symptoms, while AAT excelled in improving depression symptoms and mental state in patients, potentially due to its significant impact on increasing the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Moreover, the study noted that external CAM treatments generally do not cause severe adverse reactions. These treatments are considered safe and reliable, with patients demonstrating good tolerance towards them.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^100c5332]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This systematic review and NMA was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

Search strategy

Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist with input from our expert advisers to identify RCTs in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PyscINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

Study selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel‐group, cross‐over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention. Studies that compared two or more regimens of the same treatment (eg, varying doses of the same drug) were excluded if a placebo or another intervention group was not considered. Two reviewers (MI and CR) independently screened a sample of 100 titles and abstracts at the beginning of the study selection process and compared results to ensure consistency. The remaining citations were divided into two sets and allocated to the same two reviewers. All potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full and assessed by one reviewer for inclusion with a second reviewer checking all articles that were labeled unclear and 10% of the excluded articles. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers.

### A randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of craniosacral therapy on pain and heart rate variability in fibromyalgia patients [^118eba10]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Fibromyalgia is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder associated with widespread mechanical tenderness, fatigue, non-refreshing sleep, depressed mood and pervasive dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system: tachycardia, postural intolerance, Raynaud's phenomenon and diarrhoea.

Objective

To determine the effects of craniosacral therapy on sensitive tender points and heart rate variability in patients with fibromyalgia.

Design

A randomized controlled trial.

Subjects

Ninety-two patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to an intervention group or placebo group.

Interventions

Patients received treatments for 20 weeks. The intervention group underwent a craniosacral therapy protocol and the placebo group received sham treatment with disconnected magnetotherapy equipment.

Main Measures

Pain intensity levels were determined by evaluating tender points, and heart rate variability was recorded by 24-hour Holter monitoring.

Results

After 20 weeks of treatment, the intervention group showed significant reduction in pain at 13 of the 18 tender points (P < 0.05). Significant differences in temporal standard deviation of RR segments, root mean square deviation of temporal standard deviation of RR segments and clinical global impression of improvement versus baseline values were observed in the intervention group but not in the placebo group. At two months and one year post therapy, the intervention group showed significant differences versus baseline in tender points at left occiput, left-side lower cervical, left epicondyle and left greater trochanter and significant differences in temporal standard deviation of RR segments, root mean square deviation of temporal standard deviation of RR segments and clinical global impression of improvement.

Conclusion

Craniosacral therapy improved medium-term pain symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia.

### Update on fibromyalgia therapy [^ff841344]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia, a poorly-understood chronic pain syndrome, is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, psychological distress, and specific regions of localized tenderness, all in the absence of otherwise apparent organic disease. While the etiology of fibromyalgia is unclear, accumulating data suggest that disordered central pain processing likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Although various pharmacological treatments have been studied and espoused for treating fibromyalgia, no single drug or group of drugs has proved to be particularly useful in treating fibromyalgia patients as a whole, and only one drug to date has earned U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for treating the syndrome in the United States. This review critically and systematically evaluates clinical investigations of medicinal and nonmedicinal treatments for fibromyalgia dating from 1970 to 2007.

### Fibromyalgia: moderate and substantial pain intensity reduction predicts improvement in other outcomes and substantial quality of life gain [^460de7ab]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is associated with a range of other problems, including disturbed sleep, depression, anxiety, fatigue, reduced quality of life, and an inability to work or socialise. We investigated whether good symptom control of pain (using definitions of moderate and substantial benefit) is associated with improvement in other symptoms. Individual patient data from four randomised trials in fibromyalgia (2575 patients) lasting 8-14weeks were used to calculate percentage pain reduction for each completing patient (1858), divided into one of five groups according to pain reduction, irrespective of treatment: substantial benefit - 50% pain reduction; moderate - 30% to < 50%; minimal - 15% to < 30%; marginal - 0% to < 15%; worse - < 0% (increased pain intensity). We then calculated change from baseline to end of trial for measures of fatigue, function, sleep, depression, anxiety, ability to work, general health status, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain over a 12-month period. Substantial and moderate pain intensity reductions were associated with statistically significant reduction from baseline by end of trial in all measures, with values by trial end at or approaching normative values. Substantial pain intensity reduction resulted in 0.11 QALYs gained, and moderate pain intensity reduction in 0.07 QALYs gained over a 12-month period. Substantial and moderate pain intensity reduction predicts broad beneficial outcomes and improved quality of life that do not occur without pain relief. Pain intensity reduction is a simple and effective predictor of which patients should continue treatment, and which should discontinue and try an alternative therapy.

### Interventions for depressive symptoms in people living with chronic pain: a systematic review of meta-analyses [^3dd014ff]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review investigated the effectiveness of clinical interventions on depressive symptoms in people with all types of chronic pain.

Methods

We searched seven electronic databases and reference lists on September 15, 2020, and included English-language, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials that examined the effects of clinical interventions on depressive outcomes in chronic pain. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted, and assessed the risk of bias. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019131871.

Results

Eighty-three reviews were selected and included 182 meta-analyses. Data were summarized visually and narratively using standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals as the primary outcome of interest. A large proportion of meta-analyses investigated fibromyalgia or mixed chronic pain, and psychological interventions were most commonly evaluated. Acceptance and commitment therapy for general chronic pain, and fluoxetine and web-based psychotherapy for fibromyalgia showed the most robust effects and can be prioritized for implementation in clinical practice. Exercise for arthritis, pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, self-regulatory psychotherapy for axial pain, and music therapy for general chronic pain showed large, significant effects, but estimates were derived from low- or critically low-quality reviews.

Conclusions

No single intervention type demonstrated substantial superiority across multiple pain populations. Other dimensions beyond efficacy, such as accessibility, safety, cost, patient preference, and efficacy for non-depressive outcomes should also be weighed when considering treatment options. Further effectiveness research is required for common pain types such as arthritis and axial pain, and common interventions such as opioids, anti-inflammatories and acupuncture.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^41364d5a]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Analgesic efficacy estimates used placebo as a common comparator as direct comparisons are rare. Any direct comparisons were noted. No further data synthesis was planned, but if indicated, data from at least 200 participants had to be available. We calculated RR or risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect model. We used or calculated NNTB and number needed to harm (NNTH) with 95% CIs using the pooled number of events. We assumed a statistically significant difference from control when the 95% CI did not include unity for RR or zero for RD.

We made an independent assessment of GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence, and compared this to how the review authors had used GRADE criteria, using the amount and certainty of evidence to report results in a hierarchical way. We split results into five groups, essentially according to the GRADE descriptors.

Medicines and doses for which Cochrane reviews found no information (very low-certainty evidence).
Medicines and doses for which Cochrane reviews found inadequate information: fewer than 200 participants in comparisons, in at least two studies (very low-certainty evidence in the review).
Medicines and doses for which Cochrane reviews found evidence of effect, but where results were potentially subject to publication bias. We considered the number of additional participants needed in studies with zero effect (relative benefit of one) required to change the NNTB for at least 50% maximum pain relief to an unacceptably high level (in this case the arbitrary NNTB of 10). Where this number is less than 400 (equivalent to four studies with 100 participants per comparison, or 50 participants per group), the results are susceptible to publication bias and therefore unreliable (low-certainty evidence).
Medicines and doses for which Cochrane reviews found trustworthy evidence of no effect: more than 200 participants in comparisons, but where there was no statistically significant difference from placebo (moderate- or high-certainty evidence).
Medicines and doses for which Cochrane reviews found trustworthy evidence of clinically relevant effect, where results were reliable and not subject to potential publication bias (high-certainty evidence).

Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain

Many noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches, including physical therapy, weight loss for knee osteoarthritis, and behavioral therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction), can improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. High-quality evidence exists that exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis reduces pain and improves function immediately after treatment and that the improvements are sustained for at least 2–6 months (,–). Previous guidelines have recommended aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises for persons with chronic pain, including osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, back pain, and fibromyalgia. Other noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies that improve pain, function, or both for at least 1 month after delivery without apparent risk for serious harm include cognitive behavioral therapy for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g. yoga, tai chi, and qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache. For temporomandibular disorder pain, patient education and self-care can be effective, as can occlusal splints for some patients and biobehavioral therapy for prevention of disabling symptoms. Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments (including cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices) can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life; these active therapies have somewhat more robust evidence for sustained improvements in pain and function than more passive treatments (e.g. massage), particularly at longer-term follow-up. In addition, physical activity can provide additional health benefits, such as preventing or reducing symptoms of depression. Active approaches that engage the patient should be used when possible, with a supplementary role for more passive approaches, to reduce pain and improve function.

Discussion

Exercise therapy conforms to the new medical model and has become one of the most popular rehabilitation medical means for patients with FMS. This NMA is a timely addition to previous literature and tends to form a unified decision. In summary, our results indicate that MBE, including yoga and tai chi, is associated with lower FIQ (or FIQR) scores in patients with FMS compared with treatment as usual, contributing to reduced symptom severity and enhance overall quality of life. Based on moderate-quality evidence, appropriate SME, including dance, is recommended for patients with FMS whose core symptoms are pain. Regarding FMS patients with recent sleep disorders such as severe insomnia and dreaminess, WBV therapy is a type of exercise intervention worth promoting based on moderate-quality evidence. Aerobic exercise, particularly PAE, may be associated with significant improvements in anxiety based on moderate-quality evidence. In addition, the outcomes of depressive mood improvement were similar for all exercise modality, except for SME compared with NC.

Complementary and integrative health (CIH) manual musculoskeletal therapy — recommendation for CMI: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of manual musculoskeletal therapies for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). The Work Group assessed musculoskeletal (MSK) manual therapy (also called spinal manipulative therapy, spinal mobilization, and osteopathic manipulation) as part of a range of CIH modalities for the treatment of CMI; since the evidence for MSK manual therapy in the treatment of CMI is limited, this recommendation was supported by indirect evidence, and while there are studies on CIH modalities for patients with symptoms consistent with FMS, IBS, and ME/CFS, they have not focused on the military population.

### Effect of exercise interventions on health-related quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^875e004a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite limited evidence, exercise interventions have clear benefits for patients with FMS, and the size of the effect varies depending on the type of exercise and the outcome of interest. Given the evidence currently available, MBE seems most promising for improving overall HRQOL in patients with FMS. SME was most promising for relieving pain, WBV for improving sleep, aerobic exercise for relieving anxiety and WBV for improving depression. This study can be used as a reference for clinicians to prescribe personalized exercise for FMS patients, that is, the choice in terms of exercise recommendations should be informed by evidence, but other factors such as barriers to engagement and accessibility also have to be recognized. In the future, further studies are needed to confirm the reliability of the conclusions of this study. In addition, it is important to determine the most appropriate exercise variables (intensity, frequency and duration) to achieve the best results for quality of life.

Search Results

Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow of the selection process. After deduplication, the initial electronic database search identified 3253 potentially eligible systematic reviews. After screening records by title and abstract, we considered 145 potentially eligible reviews for inclusion and retrieved full-text articles. Grounds for exclusion after full-text assessment are illustrated inin the. We also identified six ongoing reviews on PROSPERO; three were completed and published, but only onemet our inclusion criteria and therefore was included in the final set (see Table S2 in thefor details). Finally, 18 published articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review.,

PRISMA flow chart.

Characteristics of Included IPT Systematic Reviews

The 18 selected SRs included a total of 356 primary RCTs and a total of 49006 participants. Eight of the included SRs were quantitative syntheses followed by meta-analysis and ten used narrative syntheses of data. Most of the SRs focused largely or completely on chronic low back pain and three on fibromyalgia. The remaining focused on chronic non-cancer pain in general. No SR eligible for our overview focused specifically on neuropathic pain. The proportion of female participants ranged between 21% and 100%. The median number of the total sample size per SR was 2212 (inter-quartile range [IQR] = 1334 to 4925, range 600 to 6858) and the median number of included primary RCTs was 15.5 (IQR = 9 to 27, range 2 to 46). A comprehensive description of each SR is provided in Tables 1 and 2. The methodological quality varied from critically low to moderate according to AMSTAR2 (seein thefor details).

Characteristics of Systematic Reviews with Narrative Synthesis Stratified by AMSTAR2 Evaluation

The duration of the IPT treatment of the RCTs evaluated varied considerably across SRs (ranged from 1 week to 24 weeks) and only two SRs, clearly reported the hours of treatment. All but three SRs, included RCTs that compared an IPT with both active and passive comparison arms (eg, treatment as usual (TAU), waiting list control (WLC), no intervention, No-IPT interventions, and different types of IPTs). Details of treatment components and professionals involved were rarely reported in SRs. Only six, gave details about population settings for the primary RCTs (eg, outpatients or inpatients, and primary care or specialist care).

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^eef71a6b]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) — yoga and tai chi for patients with fibromyalgia (FMS) symptoms: The evidence shows yoga and tai chi may improve physical functioning and quality of life in patients with FMS, and offering yoga and tai chi as treatment should be considered for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with FMS, integrating shared decision making, patient-centered goal setting, and discussion of risks versus benefits. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, downgraded for indirectness and imprecision; therefore, this is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation. Safety findings noted no reviewed studies showed significant differences in adverse events (AEs) between exercise and control groups, and one large study comparing tai chi to AEX found no difference in AEs after one year. Since yoga and tai chi are relatively low risk exercises and non-pharmacologic and noninvasive options for treatment of CMI, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Acupuncture for treating fibromyalgia [^38c41e77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

One in five fibromyalgia sufferers use acupuncture treatment within two years of diagnosis.

Objectives

To examine the benefits and safety of acupuncture treatment for fibromyalgia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, National Research Register, HSR Project and Current Contents, as well as the Chinese databases VIP and Wangfang to January 2012 with no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies evaluating any type of invasive acupuncture for fibromyalgia diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and reporting any main outcome: pain, physical function, fatigue, sleep, total well-being, stiffness and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two author pairs selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Treatment effects were reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes using different measurement tools (pain, physical function, fatigue, sleep, total well-being and stiffness) and risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes (adverse events). We pooled data using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Nine trials (395 participants) were included. All studies except one were at low risk of selection bias; five were at risk of selective reporting bias (favouring either treatment group); two were subject to attrition bias (favouring acupuncture); three were subject to performance bias (favouring acupuncture) and one to detection bias (favouring acupuncture). Three studies utilised electro-acupuncture (EA) with the remainder using manual acupuncture (MA) without electrical stimulation. All studies used 'formula acupuncture' except for one, which used trigger points. Low quality evidence from one study (13 participants) showed EA improved symptoms with no adverse events at one month following treatment. Mean pain in the non-treatment control group was 70 points on a 100 point scale; EA reduced pain by a mean of 22 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 4 to 41), or 22% absolute improvement. Control group global well-being was 66.5 points on a 100 point scale; EA improved well-being by a mean of 15 points (95% CI 5 to 26 points). Control group stiffness was 4.8 points on a 0 to 10 point; EA reduced stiffness by a mean of 0.9 points (95% CI 0.1 to 2 points; absolute reduction 9%, 95% CI 4% to 16%). Fatigue was 4.5 points (10 point scale) without treatment; EA reduced fatigue by a mean of 1 point (95% CI 0.22 to 2 points), absolute reduction 11% (2% to 20%). There was no difference in sleep quality (MD 0.4 points, 95% CI -1 to 0.21 points, 10 point scale), and physical function was not reported. Moderate quality evidence from six studies (286 participants) indicated that acupuncture (EA or MA) was no better than sham acupuncture, except for less stiffness at one month. Subgroup analysis of two studies (104 participants) indicated benefits of EA. Mean pain was 70 points on 0 to 100 point scale with sham treatment; EA reduced pain by 13% (5% to 22%); (SMD -0.63, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.23). Global well-being was 5.2 points on a 10 point scale with sham treatment; EA improved well-being: SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.05; absolute improvement 11% (4% to 17%). EA improved sleep, from 3 points on a 0 to 10 point scale in the sham group: SMD 0.40 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.79); absolute improvement 8% (0.2% to 16%). Low-quality evidence from one study suggested that MA group resulted in poorer physical function: mean function in the sham group was 28 points (100 point scale); treatment worsened function by a mean of 6 points (95% CI -10.9 to -0.7). Low-quality evidence from three trials (289 participants) suggested no difference in adverse events between real (9%) and sham acupuncture (35%); RR 0.44 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.63). Moderate quality evidence from one study (58 participants) found that compared with standard therapy alone (antidepressants and exercise), adjunct acupuncture therapy reduced pain at one month after treatment: mean pain was 8 points on a 0 to 10 point scale in the standard therapy group; treatment reduced pain by 3 points (95% CI -3.9 to -2.1), an absolute reduction of 30% (21% to 39%). Two people treated with acupuncture reported adverse events; there were none in the control group (RR 3.57; 95% CI 0.18 to 71.21). Global well-being, sleep, fatigue and stiffness were not reported. Physical function data were not usable. Low quality evidence from one study (38 participants) showed a short-term benefit of acupuncture over antidepressants in pain relief: mean pain was 29 points (0 to 100 point scale) in the antidepressant group; acupuncture reduced pain by 17 points (95% CI -24.1 to -10.5). Other outcomes or adverse events were not reported. Moderate-quality evidence from one study (41 participants) indicated that deep needling with or without deqi did not differ in pain, fatigue, function or adverse events. Other outcomes were not reported. Four studies reported no differences between acupuncture and control or other treatments described at six to seven months follow-up. No serious adverse events were reported, but there were insufficient adverse events to be certain of the risks.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low to moderate-level evidence that compared with no treatment and standard therapy, acupuncture improves pain and stiffness in people with fibromyalgia. There is moderate-level evidence that the effect of acupuncture does not differ from sham acupuncture in reducing pain or fatigue, or improving sleep or global well-being. EA is probably better than MA for pain and stiffness reduction and improvement of global well-being, sleep and fatigue. The effect lasts up to one month, but is not maintained at six months follow-up. MA probably does not improve pain or physical functioning. Acupuncture appears safe. People with fibromyalgia may consider using EA alone or with exercise and medication. The small sample size, scarcity of studies for each comparison, lack of an ideal sham acupuncture weaken the level of evidence and its clinical implications. Larger studies are warranted.

Musculoskeletal manual therapy in chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) was evaluated in a systematic review that "consisted of seven SRs and 12 RCTs" and compared interventions to modalities including "resistance training, waitlist control, sham treatment, ultrasound, or SOC", showing mixed quality-of-life (QoL) effects across conditions. Osteopathic manipulation was "favored for IBS and ME/CFS when measuring improvements in QoL", whereas "for patients with FMS, there was no difference in QoL" versus spinal manipulation controls. The confidence in the evidence was "very low", and the Work Group "decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation". Implementation notes indicate MSK manual therapy "requires a one-to-one provider to patient ratio" and is "a relatively low-risk intervention for patients with CMI, with no AEs reported for patients with FMS, IBS, or ME/CFS".

### Multimodal non-invasive non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain: mechanisms and progress [^c37795d3]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypnosis demonstrates clinical utility across diverse chronic pain conditions including low back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraine, cancer pain, and more (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The analgesic effects involve modulating sensory, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of pain.

Importantly, recent evidence highlights the value of hypnosis as an adjunct to optimize pharmacological, physical, and psychological therapies through mechanisms like enhancing descending inhibition, altering pain perception, optimizing attentional processes, and reinforcing positive expectancies and placebo effects.

Hypnosis combined with NSAIDs, opioids, and anesthetics demonstrates enhanced analgesia and reduced medication side effects in both acute and chronic pain settings. It improves outcomes of invasive procedures like surgery and childbirth. When integrated with physiotherapy, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic care, and exercise therapy, hypnosis leads to greater improvements in pain, function, and quality of life than individual therapies alone for various musculoskeletal and neuropathic disorders.

Hypnosis as an adjuvant to chemotherapy alleviates cancer-related pain and discomfort more effectively than chemotherapy alone. Hypnosis combined with VR therapy demonstrates enhanced analgesia for pediatric acute and procedural pain management.

Realizing the full potential of hypnosis will require advances in personalized, precision protocols. Techniques like neuroimaging, EEG, genomics, and machine learning may identify biomarkers to guide individualized hypnosis therapy based on a patient's genetics, psychology, brain patterns, and outcomes. This could help optimize tailored hypnosis delivery and suggestions for each patient's needs and pain mechanisms.

Further research should also explore optimal combination strategies for hypnosis as part of multidisciplinary pain management. In particular, studies investigating synergistic effects of hypnosis with newer modalities like VR, brain stimulation, and biologics are warranted. Large collaborative trials evaluating multi-component protocols that integrate hypnosis with pharmacological, psychological and physical therapies will help advance integrative care models.

### Electric stimulation for pain relief in patients with fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a3f86353]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome whose primary symptoms include chronic widespread muscle pain and fatigue. The treatment of patients with FM aims to provide symptomatic relief and improvement in physical capacities to perform daily tasks and quality of life. Invasive or non-invasive electric stimulation (ES) is used for pain relief in patients with FM.

Objective

This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of treatment with ES, combined or not combined with other types of therapy, for pain relief in patients with FM.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Electronic search was conducted on databases (from the inception to April 2016): MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane CENTRAL), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro).

Methods

Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of studies based on the inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of ES combined or not with other types of treatment for pain relief in patients with FM (according to the American College of Rheumatology), regardless of the ES dosages. The primary outcome was pain, assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes extracted were quality of life, assessed by short form-36 health survey (SF- 36), and fatigue, assessed by VAS.

Results

Nine studies were included, with 301 patients. The meta-analysis for pain showed positive effect of ES treatment versus control [-1.24 (95% CI: -2.39 to -0.08; I²: 87%, P = 0.04) n = 8 RCTs]. The sensitivity analysis for pain showed significant results for invasive ES, combined or not with other types of therapy [-0.94 (95% CI, -1.50 to -0.38; I² 0%, P = 0.001) n = 3 RCTs]. No significant improvement was found regarding quality of life [-3.48 (95% CI: -12.58 to 5.62; I²: 0%, P = 0.45), n = 2 RCTs] or fatigue [-0.57 (95% CI, -1.25 to 0.11; I² 34%, P = 0.100; n = 4 RCTs].

Limitations

This systematic review included a small number of studies and reduced number of participants in each study. Furthermore, most of the studies showed some biases and lack of methodological quality.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis indicates that there is low-quality evidence for the effectiveness of ES for pain relief in patients with FM. However, moderate-quality evidence for the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA), combined or not combined with other types of treatment, was found for pain relief.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^95829bd0]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several published systematic reviews assessing different forms of exercise training and other nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Although not primarily focused on sleep problems, they all identify similar limitations to those we observed here, including heterogeneity across studies in terms of study protocols, insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of one intervention compared with another, lack of appropriate comparator treatments, insufficient statistical power in most studies and low‐to‐moderate quality of the evidence. One systematic review that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia revealed that all types of exercise, except for flexibility exercises, helped reduce pain intensity, whereas aerobic and strengthening exercises helped improve sleep quality. However, the authors identified only a limited number of studies, usually of small sample sizes, for each form of exercise (10 for aerobic exercise, 9 for strengthening, and 2 for flexibility) and found considerable heterogeneity in outcome measures, intervention programs, and control interventions, in line with our findings.

Overall, there is a suggestion that some forms of exercise training, psychological and behavioral therapy, and some pharmacologic treatments may play a role in improving fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems and/or patients' QoL. However, the limitations of the current evidence do not allow reliable conclusions about optimal interventions for treating sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia. There is a clear need to improve the quality of existing evidence. It is worth noting that most participants were middle‐aged women from high‐income countries. Information on ethnicity and level of education was often not reported. Future studies should be properly designed and include an adequate number of diverse patients to reduce bias and to ensure results are generalizable. Interventions should be compared with established therapies or adequate sham treatments to demonstrate their comparative efficacy and safety. Descriptions of placebo and sham treatments should be guided by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication‐Placebo checklist. There should also be consensus on the best way to capture fibromyalgia symptoms. Currently, having different tools to measure symptoms not only impacts the ability to synthesize research evidence but also confuses health professionals and patients when trying to document and tackle fibromyalgia‐related symptoms. The development of a core outcome set for measuring sleep outcomes in both adults and children with fibromyalgia would be beneficial for informing new standardized PROMs in this field. It would also be crucial to involve people with fibromyalgia in the conception and content validation of any tool measuring sleep, ensuring that PROMs cover what matters most to patients.

### Research trends of acupuncture therapy on fibromyalgia from 2000 to 2021: a bibliometric analysis [^3a32abb0]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS), the second most common "rheumatic" disorder, is characterized by chronic pain localized in multiple body areas, with the associated symptoms of sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and a range of gastrointestinal symptoms. The estimated incidence of FMS is 2–4%, and most patients are female. However, the diagnosis is usually difficult, with a majority of patients waiting for over 2 years to be diagnosed, which leads to more spending. At present, FMS is treated by a multi-mode method, which can be divided into drug therapy and non-drug therapy. The former mainly uses Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and other drugs. But the research of Ernest Choy shows no significant differences between NSAIDs and placebos in reducing pain. In addition, the use of opioids may cause hyperalgesia and paradoxically increase the pain of FMS. The low effectiveness and high side effects of drug therapy make it difficult to choose as a treatment priority. Hence, non-pharmacological therapy is recommended to be first-line therapy by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), which includes patient education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and complementary and alternative medicine. In addition, Wang Cin a 2010 study confirmed the therapeutic effect of tai chi on fibromyalgia. Among non-pharmacological treatments, FMS therapeutic guidelines moderately recommend acupuncture as it may improve FMS symptoms. Studies suggest that 60–90% of FMS patients use one or more complementary or alternative therapeutic methods, and of these 22% try acupuncture therapy. There is strong evidence supporting the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. A review confirmed acupuncture had significant effects in improving the pain and quality of life of patients with FMS, no matter in the short or long term, with fewer adverse reactions and higher safety. While in the comparison of acupuncture with other non-pharmacological treatments, Megha Patelconcluded that acupuncture has better pain relief. For example, a study by Rosa Alves Targinoconcluded that acupuncture has a more significant improvement in FMS compared to exercise alone, the study of Scott D. Mistshowed that acupuncture showed more significant improvements in symptoms of pain and fatigue in FMS compared to education. This shows that the efficacy of acupuncture is more pronounced than other non-pharmacological treatments.

### Fibromyalgia treatment update [^191e931c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistently effective treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature from April 2005 through September 2006 involving treatment options.

Recent Findings

Prior evidence suggests that medication and self-management approaches to care can improve symptoms, function and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors — duloxetine and milnacipran — and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential component of any treatment plan for the patient with fibromyalgia. Three studies added to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added to the knowledge needed for clinicians to have substantive conversations with patients.

Summary

Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal approach to treatment involving individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include the improvement of symptoms, primarily pain and sleep, and the promotion of positive health behaviors with the aim of improving physical function and emotional well-being.

### Treatment of fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, and related disorders [^84677283]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic muscle pain is a common complaint among patients who seek care for musculoskeletal disorders. A spectrum of clinical presentations exists, ranging from focal or regional complaints that usually represent myofascial pain syndromes to more wide spread pain that may meet criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This article addresses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of myofascial pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. These conditions are challenging to treat and require physiatrists to be aware of the wide range of pharmacologic, rehabilitative, and psychosocial interventions that can be helpful.

### Effect of usual medical care with vs without chiropractic care for low back pain and disability… [^65a38324]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the effect of adding chiropractic care to usual medical care for patients with low back pain. Findings In this comparative effectiveness clinical trial among active-duty US military personnel, patients who received usual medical care plus chiropractic care reported a statistically significant moderate improvement in low back pain intensity and disability at 6 weeks compared with those who received usual care alone. Adverse events were documented by participants via online self-report questions answered at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, and from project managers who directly queried participants. We found significant site × time × group interactions in all models. Adjusted mean differences between groups overall were consistently in favor of UMC with chiropractic care compared with UMC alone for the coprimary outcome variables of LBP intensity and disability at week 6 as well as at all 3 sites. Overall at weeks 6 and 12, participants receiving UMC with chiropractic care, compared with UMC alone, reported significantly lower mean worst LBP intensity within the past 24 hours. Overall, participants allocated to receive UMC with chiropractic care self-reported significantly less pain medication use than those receiving UMC alone at week 6 and week 12, but not at any of the individual sites.

### Treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with the fibromyalgia syndrome: outcomes and implications [^6ff87d89]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Some patients with fibromyalgia also exhibit the neurological signs of cervical myelopathy. We sought to determine if treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with fibromyalgia improves the symptoms of fibromyalgia and the patients' quality of life. A non-randomized, prospective, case control study comparing the outcome of surgical (n = 40) versus non-surgical (n = 31) treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with fibromyalgia was conducted. Outcomes were compared using SF-36, screening test for somatization, HADS, MMPI-2 scale 1 (Hypochondriasis), and self reported severity of symptoms 1 year after treatment. There was no significant difference in initial clinical presentation or demographic characteristics between the patients treated by surgical decompression and those treated by non-surgical means. There was a striking and statistically significant improvement in all symptoms attributed to the fibromyalgia syndrome in the surgical patients but not in the non-surgical patients at 1 year following the treatment of cervical myelopathy (P ≤ 0.018–0.001, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test). At the 1 year follow-up, there was a statistically significant improvement in both physical and mental quality of life as measured by the SF-36 score for the surgical group as compared to the non-surgical group (Repeated Measures ANOVA P < 0.01). There was a statistically significant improvement in the scores from Scale 1 of the MMPI-2 and the screening test for somatization disorder, and the anxiety and depression scores exclusively in the surgical patients (Wilcoxon signed rank, P < 0.001). The surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy due to spinal cord or caudal brainstem compression in patients carrying the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can result in a significant improvement in a wide array of symptoms usually attributed to fibromyalgia with attendant measurable improvements in the quality of life. We recommend detailed neurological and neuroradiological evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia in order to exclude compressive cervical myelopathy, a potentially treatable condition.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^70f6daaf]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) reduced functional impairment greater than treatment as usual (TAU) at end of treatment (95% CI: -19.59 to -8.97) and at 12 month follow-up (95% CI: -16.64 to -4.26), and exceeded an active multicomponent treatment (FibroQoL) at the end of treatment (95% CI: -16.13 to -5.67) with no differences at follow-up (95% CI: -10.69 to 1.57). The trial included 225 participants (75 randomized to MBSR, 75 randomized to FibroQoL, and 75 randomized to TAU), with relatively few AEs and similar rates including MBSR (n = 3 had notable increases in physical symptoms) and FibroQoL (n = 1 had notable increases in physical symptoms).

### A systematic review of psychosocial therapies for children with rheumatic diseases [^12e62eca]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Psychosocial therapies have shown promise for treating rheumatic diseases in adults, though results are mixed. A large systematic review of psychological treatments in adults with rheumatoid arthritis found pooled effect sizes of d = 0.22 for pain and d = 0.27 for functional disability. A systematic review of mind-body therapies for fibromyalgia found that individuals treated with mind-body therapies had greater improvements in pain and global assessment than wait-list controls, but poorer outcomes than individuals who participated in moderate/high intensity exercise. In addition, a more recent randomized control trial (RCT) of tai chi vs. education and stretching in fibromyalgia concluded a modest benefit in symptoms.

Given studies reporting that psychosocial interventions improve pain and disability in adults with rheumatic conditions, we wanted to examine the evidence for psychosocial treatments to manage pain and disability in children with rheumatic disorders.

### Six-and 12-month follow-up of an interdisciplinary fibromyalgia treatment programme: results of a randomised trial [^a223ba93]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of a 6-week interdisciplinary treatment that combines coordinated psychological, medical, educational, and physiotherapeutic components (PSYMEPHY) over time compared to standard pharmacologic care.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 6 months for the PSYMEPHY and control groups and 12 months for the PSYMEPHY group. Participants were 153 outpatients with FM recruited from a hospital pain management unit. Patients randomly allocated to the control group (CG) received standard pharmacologic therapy. The experimental group (EG) received an interdisciplinary treatment (12 sessions). The main outcome was changes in quality of life, and secondary outcomes were pain, physical function, anxiety, depression, use of pain coping strategies, and satisfaction with treatment as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Coping with Chronic Pain Questionnaire, and a question regarding satisfaction with the treatment.

Results

Six months after the intervention, significant improvements in quality of life (p = 0.04), physical function (p = 0.01), and pain (p = 0.03) were seen in the PSYMEPHY group (n = 54) compared with controls (n = 56). Patients receiving the intervention reported greater satisfaction with treatment. Twelve months after the intervention, patients in the PSYMEPHY group (n = 58) maintained statistically significant improvements in quality of life, physical functioning, pain, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and were less likely to use maladaptive passive coping strategies compared to baseline.

Conclusions

An interdisciplinary treatment for FM was associated with improvements in quality of life, pain, physical function, anxiety and depression, and pain coping strategies up to 12 months after the intervention.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^7a5350c1]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia have muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination; laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders. Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.
