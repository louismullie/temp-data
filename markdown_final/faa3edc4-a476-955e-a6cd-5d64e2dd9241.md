## Question

Causes of iron deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of iron deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pathophysiology and the distinction between absolute and functional iron deficiency. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic groups: blood loss, impaired absorption, increased demand, and reduced intake. Next, I will examine population-specific patterns and special contexts like pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, I will integrate prevalence data and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the core framework. Iron deficiency arises when iron supply fails to meet physiologic demand, and it can be absolute (depleted stores) or functional (adequate stores but restricted availability, often due to hepcidin-driven sequestration in inflammation), which explains why ferritin can be misleading in inflammatory states and why transferrin saturation helps distinguish these entities [^2455baf2] [^9600e994].

> I will now examine blood loss as the most common cause. In premenopausal women, heavy menstrual bleeding is the leading etiology, with estimates that 38% of reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia in high-income settings, underscoring the magnitude of menstrual iron loss and its underrecognition [^2455baf2] [^c0e26ecb]. In men and postmenopausal women, gastrointestinal blood loss predominates, and guidelines recommend urgent bidirectional endoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or other GI pathology when iron deficiency anemia is confirmed without an obvious cause, given the cancer risk signal [^b39cea74] [^bb17945e]. I should also remember NSAID use as a frequent contributor to occult GI bleeding and that dual pathology can coexist in a minority of cases, which is why comprehensive evaluation is prudent in older adults [^bb17945e].

> Next, I should review impaired absorption. Celiac disease is a key reversible cause in many populations and should be screened routinely when iron deficiency is identified, particularly in younger patients or those with GI symptoms, because malabsorption can perpetuate deficiency despite adequate intake [^b39cea74] [^d926af9f]. Atrophic gastritis and prior gastric surgery, including bariatric procedures, reduce acid-dependent iron solubilization and proximal small-bowel absorption, often necessitating parenteral iron when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^1abf7ee4] [^2455baf2]. In inflammatory bowel disease, chronic mucosal inflammation, blood loss, and resections combine to produce very high rates of iron deficiency, with prevalence estimates ranging from 13% to 90% depending on activity and cohort, and management often favors intravenous iron due to malabsorption and intolerance [^e6e41ef8] [^e7f3d933].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intake alone. In high-income countries, inadequate dietary iron is a less common sole cause, but it remains relevant in restrictive diets, strict veganism without supplementation, and in older adults with poor nutrition, while in low- and middle-income countries, low intake plus infectious burdens drive much of the global burden of iron deficiency anemia [^2455baf2] [^48f70d93]. I should double-check that contemporary data still support this gradient, and yes, recent reviews continue to emphasize that while intake matters, blood loss and absorption issues dominate in many settings [^2455baf2].

> I need to ensure I capture increased physiologic demand. Pregnancy substantially increases iron requirements, and iron deficiency rises from about 7% in the first trimester to roughly 28% by the third trimester in U.S. data, explaining why universal screening and supplementation are commonly recommended despite USPSTF uncertainty about routine screening benefits, and why IV iron becomes important when oral therapy is not tolerated or absorption is limited in later trimesters [^4143568b] [^fe3083da]. Infants and adolescents also have high requirements due to growth, which is why early childhood and adolescence are peak periods for deficiency risk if intake and losses are not balanced [^2455baf2].

> Let me consider functional iron deficiency next. In chronic inflammatory states such as CKD, heart failure, and cancer, hepcidin upregulation sequesters iron in macrophages, limiting availability for erythropoiesis despite adequate or even increased stores, so ferritin may be normal or high while transferrin saturation is low, and IV iron can overcome this blockade and improve symptoms and outcomes in selected patients [^9600e994] [^e7f3d933]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse IV iron in these contexts when anemia is significant or symptomatic, and yes, cardiology, nephrology, and gastroenterology guidance increasingly support parenteral iron in functional deficiency states [^e7f3d933] [^d926af9f].

> But wait, what about population-specific nuances. In older adults, iron deficiency is often multifactorial, with occult GI blood loss, malabsorption, and chronic disease coexisting, so a tailored, risk-stratified endoscopic approach is recommended while balancing comorbidity and patient preferences [^871c0f7d] [^f7fc4df2]. In premenopausal women, I should remember that a GI source is still present in a minority even when menstrual loss seems obvious, so persistent or refractory deficiency warrants GI evaluation after gynecologic causes are addressed [^bb2bc3f2]. In children, dietary patterns, cow's milk excess, and lead exposure contribute, and screening at 12 months is advised in many programs given neurodevelopmental risks of uncorrected deficiency [^8b511868] [^0aff3b3a].

> I should double-check prevalence anchors to frame magnitude. Absolute iron deficiency affects about 14% of U.S. adults, with functional deficiency around 15%, and globally iron deficiency anemia impacts roughly 1.2 billion people, confirming this as a major public health burden with sex- and age-related patterns that mirror the etiologies above [^e18ecc80] [^2455baf2]. These figures reinforce the need to individualize evaluation by demographic and comorbidity profile rather than apply a one-size-fits-all workup [^2455baf2].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. The causes of iron deficiency fall into four broad buckets: chronic blood loss, impaired absorption, increased physiologic demand, and inadequate intake, with blood loss and absorption defects dominating in most adults and demand surges explaining high risk in pregnancy and growth periods; functional iron deficiency from inflammatory hepcidin effects adds complexity in chronic disease and often requires parenteral therapy to bypass the blockade [^2455baf2] [^9600e994]. Effective care requires matching the investigative strategy to the patient's sex, age, and comorbidities, treating the underlying cause, and selecting oral versus IV iron based on tolerance, absorption, and urgency of repletion [^b39cea74] [^d926af9f].

---

Iron deficiency arises from **chronic blood loss** (menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding, NSAID use) [^21e45e1c], **impaired absorption** (celiac disease, bariatric surgery, atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori) [^2455baf2], and **increased demand** (pregnancy, growth, intense exercise) [^c12523f9] [^2455baf2]. Functional iron deficiency also occurs in chronic inflammation (CKD, heart failure, IBD, cancer) due to hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration [^9600e994] [^409646b6]. Identifying and treating the **underlying cause** is essential to correct deficiency and prevent recurrence [^99564ccb].

---

## Chronic blood loss

Chronic blood loss is the **most common cause** of iron deficiency, as each milliliter of blood contains about 0.5 mg of iron [^notfound].

- **Menstrual blood loss**: Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) is the leading cause in premenopausal women, with average losses of 20–80 mL per cycle, and up to 42 mg of iron lost per cycle in severe cases [^d83b9680] [^c0e26ecb].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Occult GI bleeding from peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, malignancy, angiodysplasia, or NSAID use is a major cause, especially in men and postmenopausal women [^bb17945e] [^21e45e1c].

- **Hookworm infestation**: Common in tropical regions, causing significant intestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia [^21e45e1c].

---

## Impaired iron absorption

Even with adequate intake, **malabsorption** can cause deficiency.

- **Celiac disease**: Villous atrophy reduces iron absorption; iron deficiency is often the presenting feature [^notfound].

- **Bariatric surgery**: Bypass procedures reduce iron absorption by bypassing the duodenum and jejunum, where iron is absorbed [^1abf7ee4].

- **Atrophic gastritis**: Hypochlorhydria impairs iron solubilization and absorption [^notfound].

- **Helicobacter pylori**: Gastritis and ulceration reduce absorption and cause occult bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Increased iron demand

Certain physiologic states **increase iron needs** beyond typical intake.

- **Pregnancy**: Iron requirements rise from 0.8 mg/day in early pregnancy to 7.5 mg/day in late gestation due to fetal growth and placental development [^notfound].

- **Infancy and adolescence**: Rapid growth increases iron needs; infants require ~1 mg/kg/day [^notfound].

- **Intense physical training**: Athletes have increased iron turnover and losses through GI microbleeding and hemolysis [^notfound].

---

## Functional iron deficiency

Functional iron deficiency occurs when iron is present in stores but **unavailable for erythropoiesis** due to inflammation-driven hepcidin excess, which inhibits iron export from macrophages and enterocytes [^9600e994]. This is common in chronic kidney disease, heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer, and is characterized by low serum iron and transferrin saturation with normal or high ferritin [^f2002ab5].

---

## Dietary insufficiency

Dietary insufficiency alone is **less common** in developed settings but can contribute, especially in restrictive diets or when combined with other factors. Strict vegan diets without supplementation, chronic malnutrition, and exclusive breastfeeding beyond 6 months without iron-fortified foods are notable contributors [^2455baf2] [^bb2bc3f2].

### The effect of iron deficiency and anaemia on women's health [^9773c46a]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency and anaemia are global health problems and major causes of morbidity in women. Current definitions of anaemia in women are historic and have been challenged by recent data from observational studies. Menstrual loss, abnormal uterine bleeding and pregnancy put women at risk of developing iron deficiency which can result in severe fatigue, reduced exercise capacity and poor work performance. Iron deficiency and anaemia during pregnancy are associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including neurocognitive deficits in children born to iron-deficient mothers. Both iron deficiency and anaemia are common in women undergoing surgery but their association with poor outcomes remains uncertain. The enduring burden of iron deficiency and anaemia in women suggests that current strategies for recognition, prevention and treatment are limited in their utility. Improvements in our understanding of iron homeostasis and the development of new iron preparations, which are better absorbed with fewer side-effects, may improve therapeutic effectiveness of oral iron. Intravenous iron is efficacious for correcting anaemia rapidly but high-quality data on patient-centred outcomes and cost-effectiveness are currently lacking. Many recommendations for the treatment of iron deficiency and anaemia in national guidelines are not supported by high-quality evidence. There is a need for robust epidemiological data and well-designed clinical trials. The latter will require collaborative working between researchers and patients to design studies in ways that incorporate patients' perspectives on the research process and target outcomes that matter to them.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency among adults in the US?

Findings

This cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 8021 US adults estimated that absolute iron deficiency affects 14% and functional iron deficiency affects 15% of adults in the US. Absolute iron deficiency most often affects young women, whereas functional iron deficiency affects women and men of all ages.

Meaning

These findings suggest that absolute and functional iron deficiency represent common public health problems, and further research on the role of functional iron deficiency in adverse health outcomes and on iron deficiency screening strategies is needed.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Vaccine efficacy and iron deficiency: an intertwined pair? [^7990dde7]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Vaccines are the most effective measure to prevent deaths and illness from infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of several paediatric vaccines is lower in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where mortality from vaccine-preventable infections remains high. Vaccine efficacy can also be decreased in adults in the context of some common comorbidities. Identifying and correcting the specific causes of impaired vaccine efficacy is of substantial value to global health. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 2 billion people, and its prevalence in LMICs could increase as food security is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this Viewpoint, we highlight evidence showing that iron deficiency limits adaptive immunity and responses to vaccines, representing an under-appreciated additional disadvantage to iron deficient populations. We propose a framework for urgent detailed studies of iron-vaccine interactions to investigate and clarify the issue. This framework includes retrospective analysis of newly available datasets derived from trials of COVID-19 and other vaccines, and prospective testing of whether nutritional iron interventions, commonly used worldwide to combat anaemia, improve vaccine performance.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^bac5d8cd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^a97d6fd3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^144de4cf]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

### Iron deficiency anemia: problems in diagnosis and prevention at the population level [^f9d55cd6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is common among people living in low- and middle-income countries, and alleviation of the global burden of anemia is an essential global health target over the next decade. Estimates have attributed about half the cases of anemia worldwide to iron deficiency; a range of other causes probably make a similar overall contribution. Individuals living in low-income settings experience a simultaneous high burden of infection with inflammation and iron deficiency. At least in children, iron supplementation exacerbates the risk of infection in both malaria-endemic and nonendemic low-income countries, whereas iron deficiency is protective against clinical and severe malaria.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Iron deficiency [^4c598cf8]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia affects > 1.2 billions individuals worldwide, and iron deficiency in the absence of anemia is even more frequent. Total-body (absolute) iron deficiency is caused by physiologically increased iron requirements in children, adolescents, young and pregnant women, by reduced iron intake, or by pathological defective absorption or chronic blood loss. Adaptation to iron deficiency at the tissue level is controlled by iron regulatory proteins to increase iron uptake and retention; at the systemic level, suppression of the iron hormone hepcidin increases iron release to plasma by absorptive enterocytes and recycling macrophages. The diagnosis of absolute iron deficiency is easy unless the condition is masked by inflammatory conditions. All cases of iron deficiency should be assessed for treatment and underlying cause. Special attention is needed in areas endemic for malaria and other infections to avoid worsening of infection by iron treatment. Ongoing efforts aim at optimizing iron salts-based therapy by protocols of administration based on the physiology of hepcidin control and reducing the common adverse effects of oral iron. IV iron, especially last-generation compounds administered at high doses in single infusions, is becoming an effective alternative in an increasing number of conditions because of a more rapid and persistent hematological response and acceptable safety profile. Risks/benefits of the different treatments should be weighed in a personalized therapeutic approach to iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^fb4d52b7]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

"Iron deficiency is very common but often overlooked, especially in people with chronic conditions. Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and, therefore, its timely detection and treatment is important, because iron is essential to the functioning of all organs" 1

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^f4d9f034]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^bb17945e]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

1. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

2. IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia affects about a third of the global population and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Iron deficiency is one of the dominant causes, and the resulting anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)) has a point prevalence of 2%–5% among adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world.

IDA is the most common form of anaemia seen in primary care in the UK. It is estimated to account for more than 57 000 emergency admissions to UK hospitals each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than £55 million per annum.

While menstrual loss is commonly the cause of IDA in premenopausal women, IDA in adult men and postmenopausal women is often due to chronic blood loss from the GI tract. IDA may be the first presenting manifestation of colonic or oesophago-gastric carcinoma, highlighting the importance of swift and complete investigation. There are however many other recognised causes of IDA (table 1) including malabsorption (most commonly from coeliac disease (CD) in the UK), poor dietary intake, blood donation, gastrectomy and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). IDA is often multifactorial, and dual pathology (ie, significant disease in both upper and lower GI tract) is found in 1%–10% of cases — this should be particularly considered in the older patient.

Table 1
Pathological disorders associated with iron deficiency anaemia

IDA may present in primary care, or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and historically the management of IDA was often suboptimal — with investigation being slow, inadequate or incomplete. Over recent years, however, the recognition that IDA may reflect serious underlying GI pathology has resulted in increasing involvement of gastroenterology services. IDA may now account for 10% or more of all gastroenterology referrals, and a typical district hospital unit in the UK with a catchment of 250 000 may have in excess of 400 IDA referrals per annum.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### Iron deficiency anaemia: a review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^6ed77a2e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women the commonest cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy. Specific patient groups such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin and iron-deficient patients without anaemia may need an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy. Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement plus diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance or treatment failure with oral therapy.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^8567d688]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

### The misogyny of iron deficiency [^a2b49790]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaemia is common, particularly in women and the commonest underlying cause, iron deficiency, is often overlooked. Anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing anaesthesia; however, women are defined as being anaemic at a lower haemoglobin level than men. In this narrative review, we present the history of iron deficiency anaemia and how women's health has often been overlooked. Iron deficiency was first described as 'chlorosis' and a cause of 'hysteria' in women and initial treatment was by iron filings in cold wine. We present data of population screening demonstrating how common iron deficiency is, affecting 12–18% of apparently 'fit and healthy' women, with the most common cause being heavy menstrual bleeding; both conditions being often unrecognised. We describe a range of symptoms reported by women, that vary from fatigue to brain fog, hair loss and eating ice. We also describe experiments exploring the physical impact of iron deficiency, showing that reduced exercise performance is related to iron deficiency independent of haemoglobin concentration, as well as the impact of iron supplementation in women improving oxygen consumption and fitness. Overall, we demonstrate the need to single out women and investigate iron deficiency rather than accept the dogma of normality and differential treatment; this is to say, the need to change the current standard of care for women undergoing anaesthesia.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

2 CONCLUSIONS

Iron deficiency is a very common but often overlooked condition, especially in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. It is a highly relevant comorbidity and accounts for poor outcomes, prolonged hospitalization and poor QoL in this patient population. Here, we have proposed several practical recommendations for the definition and diagnosis of iron deficiency in CHF, CKD and IBD. Based on this definition and diagnosis threshold, simple diagnostic algorithms and management for these conditions have been discussed. The intention of these recommendations is to provide consensus expert opinion where there is variability in the guidelines or gaps in the current evidence base.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management… [^bb2bc3f2]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is diminished red blood cell production due to low iron stores in the body. It is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. 1, 2 Iron deficiency anemia can result from inadequate iron intake, decreased iron absorption, increased iron demand, and increased iron loss. 3 Identifying the underlying etiology and administering the appropriate therapy are keys to the evaluation and management of this condition. 2 As such, iron deficiency should still be considered in all cases of anemia unless the mean corpuscular volume is greater than 95 μm³, because this cutoff has a sensitivity of 97. 6 percent. 6 Other causes of microcytosis include chronic inflammatory states, lead poisoning, thalassemia, and sideroblastic anemia.

1.

16 Risk factors include low birth weight, history of prematurity, exposure to lead, exclusive breastfeeding beyond four months of life, and weaning to whole milk and complementary foods without iron-fortified foods. 16 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening children from low-income or newly immigrated families at nine to 12 months of age, and consideration of screening for preterm and low-birth-weight infants before six months of age if they are not given iron-fortified formula. 10, 15, 17–21 PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN Excessive menstruation is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia in premenopausal women in developed countries; however, a GI source is present in 6 to 30 percent of cases. 20, 22, 23 If the gynecologic workup is negative and the patient does not respond to iron therapy, endoscopy should be performed to exclude an occult GI source. 20, 22, 23.

Excessive or irregular menstrual bleeding affects 9 to 14 percent of all women and can lead to varying degrees of iron deficiency anemia. 24 Etiologies include thyroid disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, coagulopathies, uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, and use of antipsychotics or antiepileptics. Initial evaluation includes a history, physical examination, and pregnancy and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^0146f4d6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA — for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss.

Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.

IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease — with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^447052dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron plays an important role in many biological functions. Absolute iron deficiency results from a severe reduction or absence of iron stores. Functional iron deficiency occurs in the presence of adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability (thus, it is not a true deficiency of body stores). Although most research has focused on adverse outcomes among people with iron deficiency and anemia, iron deficiency affects nonerythropoietic tissue, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, in the absence of anemia. Iron deficiency has been associated with restless leg syndrome, decreased physical capacity, impaired neurocognitive function, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and other adverse outcomes independent of anemia.

Infants and children, people of childbearing potential, and people with certain conditions, such as anemia, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, have high rates of iron deficiency. The prevalence of iron deficiency outside these groups and the potential underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, the prevalence of functional iron deficiency has not been determined. Iron deficiency can be prevented or treated through dietary interventions or nonprescription iron supplements, but the current use of nonprescription iron supplements and dietary iron intake and iron deficiency prevalence have not been studied. These estimates are needed to identify populations at risk of iron deficiency–related adverse outcomes, inform screening recommendations, and establish research priorities. We estimated the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency and iron supplement use in the US from 2017 to 2020 across age, sex, and comorbidity categories.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^fe3083da]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation. Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred. With contemporary formulations, allergic reactions are rare.

### Screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: a structured review and gap analysis against UK national screening criteria [^a581a1a7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia in pregnancy is a worldwide problem. The incidence and aetiology vary considerably between low and high-income countries, with iron deficiency considered the most common cause in the latter. Somewhat surprisingly, recent prevalence estimates of maternal anaemia in pregnancy in the UK and other high-income countries, suggest there has been no significant decrease in the prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy in the last decade. The UK prevalence of maternal anaemia in the antenatal period was estimated as 24% in a recent cross sectional study.

There is a spectrum of iron deficiency in pregnancy ranging from iron depletion without anaemia (absent iron stores with a normal haemoglobin concentration) to overt anaemia. Although iron deficiency in pregnancy is, in principle, identifiable, treatable and possibly preventable with iron supplementation, there is uncertainty about its significance as a clinical and public health problem, and whether systematic screening and treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy would improve maternal and infant outcomes.

The UK guidelines that underpin the clinical management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy are summarised in Table 1. There are also a variety of international and national guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organisation, United States of America, Australia and New Zealand has been reviewed elsewhere. Recommendations for current practice in the UK are to assess the mother's haemoglobin concentration at booking and at 28 weeks' gestation and ensure there are systems in place to follow up abnormal results; routine assessment of iron status is not recommended in all women.

Table 1
Summary of existing guidance for the management of anaemia or iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy in the UK

Abbreviations: (AHCPR) US Agency for Health Care and Policy Research, (GRADE) Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; GPP clinical good practice point

Whilst 'screening' for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy is consistently recommended in these guidelines, the approach in practice differs significantly by country. Screening in this review refers to a systematic integrated programme targeting all pregnant women; including testing, diagnosis, treatment, training and quality assurance. As yet, there has been no formal screening programme to implement these recommendations in the UK.

The aim of this analysis was to review the case for screening pregnant women for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia, using, as a framework, the criteria set out by the UK National Screening Committee. Additional objectives were to identify any gaps in the evidence and outline opportunities for further research to answer the question about the case for screening.

Anemia, the most common hematologic abnormality, is a reduction in the concentration of erythrocytes or hemoglobin in blood. The two most common causes of anemia in pregnancy and the puerperium are iron deficiency and acute blood loss. Iron requirements increase during pregnancy, and a failure to maintain sufficient levels of iron may result in adverse maternal-fetal consequences. The purpose of this document is to provide a brief overview of the causes of anemia in pregnancy, review iron requirements, and provide recommendations for screening and clinical management of anemia during pregnancy.

Iron deficiency is a common disorder in pediatric patients. Although the most common manifestation is that of anemia, iron deficiency is frequently the source of a host of neurologic disorders presenting to general pediatric neurologic practices. These disorders include developmental delay, stroke, breath-holding episodes, pseudotumor cerebri, and cranial nerve palsies. Although frequent, the identification of iron deficiency as part of the differential diagnosis in these disorders is uncommon and frequently goes untreated. The purpose of the current review is to highlight what is understood regarding iron deficiency and it's underlying pathophysiology as it relates to the brain, and the association of iron deficiency with common neurologic pediatric disease.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^2455baf2]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Anemia in pregnancy [^3a57675d]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Anemia in pregnancy is a global health problem affecting nearly half of all pregnant women worldwide. High fetal demands for iron render iron deficiency the most common cause of anemia of pregnancy, with other micronutrient deficiencies contributing less frequently. In certain geographical populations, human pathogens such as hookworm, malarial parasite and human immunodeficiency virus are important factors in anemia of pregnancy. The hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease and thalassemia, represent diverse causes of anemia of pregnancy, requiring specialized care. Aplastic anemia is a rare, morbid cause of anemia of pregnancy and is managed with transfusions until the completion of pregnancy.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^048df49a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is a common condition and a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, mainly due to subsequent anemia. A depletion of iron stores that does not yet result in anemia, simply referred to as nonanemic iron deficiency, has recently gained attention as a distinct clinical entity. Associated with various symptoms, including fatigue, restless legs syndrome, and hair loss, nonanemic iron deficiency has been estimated to be more common than anemic iron deficiency.

Measurement of (serum) ferritin is considered the mainstay of iron deficiency diagnosis, and ferritin is a commonly requested laboratory test in various high-resource primary care settings. In particular, a Swiss study revealed that 27% of the population received serum ferritin testing in 2018, and ferritin ranked among the most frequently ordered laboratory tests in Swiss primary care between 2009 and 2018. At the same time, iron deficiency guidelines are conflicting as to which populations benefit most from ferritin testing. For example, the US Preventive Services Task Force specifically mentions children and pregnant womenbut makes no recommendation for the general population. A prominent Swiss primary care guideline discourages iron deficiency screening in the general population, with exceptions for conditions that require special consideration due to increased risk, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or when evidence suggests a benefit from replete iron stores, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The condition

The condition must be an important health problem

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world and represents the most common cause of maternal anaemia. Pregnant women and children are particularly vulnerable to iron deficiency anaemia due to the high demand for iron associated with growth. A number of studies were identified suggesting that there is a high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy in the UK.

Multiple studies of maternal anaemia have evaluated haematological outcomes and/or measures of iron status, however a limited number of these have evaluated clinical consequences. Table 3 summarises a number of important clinical outcomes of iron deficiency anaemia reported in the literature. It also gives an indication of the quality of the evidence based on available systematic review evidence as assessed using GRADE methodology. A key information gap is the lack of clinical outcomes as reported by women themselves.

Table 3
Clinical outcomes associated with maternal iron deficiency anaemia

The majority of studies analysing the impacts of iron status tend to comprise populations with iron deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency per se is thought to affect tissue oxidative capacity, whereas iron deficiency anaemia also affects oxygen carrying capacity. Whilst there are placebo controlled trials in high income settings that have shown that iron supplementation is effective at preventing anaemia in pregnancy; there are no published randomised trials that have evaluated the clinical effects of iron deficiency without anaemia on maternal and infant outcomes in pregnancy. Evidence from one small cohort study in a high income country suggested a large proportion of pregnant women with normal haemoglobin have iron depletion, which is associated with postnatal depression. There is randomised trial evidence of the clinical effects of iron deficiency alone from other population groups, which may be relevant in pregnancy e.g. iron deficiency associated with fatigue in menstruating women; with impaired physical performance in female athletes and with reversible cognitive and behavioural deficits in early infant development. Maternal iron deficiency is associated with low neonatal iron stores in the neonate and it has been suggested that the period of particular vulnerability for iron deficiency in the fetus and newborn is between the last trimester and the first two years of life.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L⁻¹ or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87?

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^48e789ff]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia during pregnancy. According to survey data from 1999 to 2006, overall estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is near 18% and increases across the 3 trimesters of pregnancy (from 6.9% to 14.3% to 28.4%). An estimated 5% of pregnant persons have iron deficiency anemia.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with and without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Population

Asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined. The USPSTF also concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^21e45e1c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Identification of women and girls with iron deficiency in the reproductive years [^7a1beec4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world. It is of concern for women and girls of reproductive age as, despite frequent normalization, excessive menstrual blood loss and the iron demands associated with pregnancy increase the risk of developing an ID. Iron deficiency reduces health-related quality of life with symptoms of fatigue, heart palpitations, difficulty concentrating, and poor mental health. When left untreated, ID can escalate to iron deficiency anemia (IDA), where there is an insufficiency of red blood cells, or hemoglobin within these cells, to meet the bodily demands for oxygen transport. Substantial guidance on screening for ID can be found in specific at-risk groups, including pregnant women and patients with renal, cardiac, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, it was unclear whether guidance is available for women of reproductive age. We performed a literature search to explore the current recommendations for screening women of reproductive age for ID. While four manuscripts supportive of screening were found, no official guidance appears to exist regarding screening for this group. In line with the World Health Organization's 10 Principles of Screening, we present a case for ID screening in women and girls of reproductive age.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia: framing the issue [^c0e26ecb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

For girls and women in their reproductive years, the symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is the most common cause of iron deficiency (ID), including the extreme manifestation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). It is recognized that these two clinical entities are not only ubiquitous, but their interrelationship is poorly appreciated and frequently normalized by society, healthcare providers, and affected girls and women themselves. Both HMB and ID/IDA adversely impact quality of life-HMB during the episodes of bleeding and ID daily as long as the ID exists. These combined issues undermine the lives of reproductive-aged girls and women of all ages, from menarche to menopause. At the same time, pervading culture and the often insidious nature of these disorders frequently lead to societal normalization, including by healthcare professionals. The effects on cognitive function as well as the related work and school absenteeism and presenteeism can undermine the efforts and function of women in all walks of life, be they students, educators, employers, or employees. There is also an increasing body of evidence suggesting that ID, even in early pregnancy, may adversely impact fetal neurodevelopment with enduring effects on a spectrum of cognitive and psychological disorders-effects that can have widespread impacts on society. Collectively, this critically important evidence begs the implementation of diagnostic and management guidelines aimed at identifying iron-deficient girls and women, repleting their iron stores, and, when present, effectively treating the most common reason for the problem-the various causes of the symptom of HMB.

Specific comorbidities

30. Functional iron deficiency (FID) is a common contributory factor to the anaemia associated with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

31. Iron deficiency is common in chronic heart failure (CHF), and is often multifactorial (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

32. Parenteral IRT may improve symptoms and quality of life in CHF with FID (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

33. In the management of iron deficiency associated with CKD or CHF, reference to the appropriate specialist published guidelines is recommended (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

34. IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

35. Intolerance and malabsorption of oral IRT can be particular problems in the treatment of IBD-associated IDA, and parenteral IRT may be required (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Several chronic disorders such as CKD, CHF and IBD are associated with iron deficiency. While the cause of iron deficiency in these conditions is often multifactorial, altered production of hepcidin and ferroportin is thought to be a major contributory factor. Nevertheless, the presence of iron deficiency should be actively sought because IRT may improve patient outcomes. The assessment and management of iron deficiency in these conditions do have certain nuances, and consultation with detailed published guidelines is therefore recommended. Similar clinical considerations apply to other inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^4676ac6f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### Identification and management of iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department [^315a9e69]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in the United States and worldwide. Yet, clinical guidelines for the identification and management of this disorder in the emergency department are lacking.

Objective Of Review

This clinical review examines strategies for identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department, with a focus on the role of oral iron therapy, intravenous iron therapy, as well as red blood cell transfusion. The article highlights both the available evidence on this topic and the need for future research.

Discussion

The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has important clinical implications and, although testing is generally straightforward, it may be under-recognized. The scant literature available describing emergency department practice patterns for iron deficiency anemia suggests there is room for improvement. In particular, intravenous iron may be underutilized and red blood cell transfusions administered too liberally.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency anemia is common and many patients can be treated effectively with oral iron. For selected patients with moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron is safe and more effective than oral iron. Red blood cell transfusions should be used rarely for hemodynamically stable patients with iron deficiency irrespective of hemoglobin levels.

### The diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and its potential relationship to hair loss [^2655b332]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the world's most common nutritional deficiency and is associated with developmental delay, impaired behavior, diminished intellectual performance, and decreased resistance to infection. In premenopausal women, the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia are menstrual blood loss and pregnancy. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia are gastrointestinal blood loss and malabsorption. Hemoglobin concentration can be used to screen for iron deficiency, whereas serum ferritin concentration can be used to confirm iron deficiency. However, the serum ferritin concentration may be elevated in patients with infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. Other tests may be needed, such as erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, transferrin concentration, serum iron concentration, and transferrin saturation. The cause of iron deficiency must be identified. If the patient is male, postmenopausal female, or has risk factors for blood loss, then the patient should be evaluated for sources of blood loss, especially gastrointestinal (eg, colon cancer). Several studies have examined the relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss. Almost all have addressed women exclusively and have focused on noncicatricial hair loss. Some suggest that iron deficiency may be related to alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and diffuse hair loss, while others do not. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for iron deficiency in patients with hair loss. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend giving iron supplementation therapy to patients with hair loss and iron deficiency in the absence of iron deficiency anemia. The decision to do either should be based on clinical judgment. It is our practice at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to screen male and female patients with both cicatricial and noncicatricial hair loss for iron deficiency. Although this practice is not evidence based per se, we believe that treatment for hair loss is enhanced when iron deficiency, with or without anemia, is treated. Iron deficiency anemia should be treated. Treating iron deficiency without anemia is controversial. Treatment of nutritional iron deficiency anemia includes adequate dietary intake and oral iron supplementation. Excessive iron supplementation can cause iron overload and should be avoided, especially in high-risk patients such as those with hereditary hemochromatosis. Patients who do not respond to iron replacement therapy should undergo additional testing to identify other underlying causes of iron deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency, fatigue and muscle strength and function in older hospitalized patients [^a82bb0d0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, which includes absolute iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency. Absolute iron deficiency is defined as depleted body iron stores due to an imbalance between iron uptake and utilization. Low serum ferritin concentrations (< 30 ng/l) are the hallmark of absolute iron deficiency. Functional iron deficiency arises due to reduced availability of iron stores even when storage iron is normal or increased. Iron deficiency is a very common finding in older persons with prevalence rates from 11% among community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years to over 50% in nursing home residents and in geriatric inpatients. Anemia, in which iron deficiency is one of the major causes, is a well-known risk factor for impaired activities of daily living (ADL) in older persons. Indeed, it is associated with a decline in functional capacity, fatigue, a higher rate of hospitalization, impaired cognitive function, depression, and increased risk of falling and mortality. Findings of an observational study among 579 older hospitalized patients aged ≥ 70 years demonstrated a significant lower ADL, as measured by Barthel Index (BI), in anemic patients. However, whether there is a causative relationship remains unclear.

### Iron deficiency anemia | AAFP… [^d83b9680]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. It can cause reduced work capacity in adults 1 and impact motor and mental development in children and adolescents. 2 There is some evidence that iron deficiency without anemia affects cognition in adolescent girls 3 and causes fatigue in adult women. 4 IDA may affect visual and auditory functioning 3 and is weakly associated with poor cognitive development in children.
4. Etiology Iron metabolism is unusual in that it is controlled by absorption rather than excretion. Iron is only lost through blood loss or loss of cells as they slough. Men and nonmenstruating women lose about 1 mg of iron per day. Menstruating women lose from 0. 6 to
2. 5 percent more per day. An average 132-lb woman might lose an extra 10 mg of iron per menstruation cycle, but the loss could be more than 42 mg per cycle depending on how heavily she menstruates.

Iron absorption, which occurs mostly in the jejunum, is only 5 to 10 percent of dietary intake in persons in homeostasis. In states of overload, absorption decreases. Absorption can increase three- to fivefold in states of depletion. Dietary iron is available in two forms: heme iron, which is found in meat; and nonheme iron, which is found in plant and dairy foods. 7 Iron deficiency results when iron demand by the body is not met by iron absorption from the diet. Thus, patients with IDA presenting in primary care may have inadequate dietary intake, hampered absorption, or physiologic losses in a woman of reproductive age. It also could be a sign of blood loss, known or occult. IDA is never an end diagnosis; the work-up is not complete until the reason for IDA is known. Risk factors Table 2 8–13 lists risk factors associated with IDA.

Low socioeconomic status is not a risk factor for IDA in women who never get pregnant, but it is a risk factor when coupled with the increased iron demands imposed by pregnancy. Black women have a lower mean hemoglobin and a wider standard deviation than white women, even after adjustment for iron status. 8 There is a high rate of IDA among Mexican women living in the United States that is not accounted for by dietary intake or parity, suggesting there may be an unidentified, possibly racial factor predisposing these women to iron deficiency. 11.

### Evidence gaps for the global problem of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age [^75cf49a0]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The symptom of heavy menstrual bleeding and the frequently associated condition of iron deficiency (ID) individually and collectively adversely impact the lives of women and girls of reproductive age in various ways. The insidious but sometimes profound effects of periconceptual ID on the developing fetus may continue throughout the individual's life with consequences that are also felt by families, friends, and society at large. Unfortunately, in most instances, current healthcare policies are not designed to address the plethora of issues in a fashion that will result in meaningful improvement in health and other outcomes that affect both individuals and society. Identification and prioritization of the many evidence gaps will be an essential component of the strategy for change. This article identifies and describes the evidence gaps and provides direction for investigators and those involved in healthcare policy.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^f50ccba9]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

### Gaps in the evidence for prevention and treatment of maternal anaemia: a review of systematic reviews [^6cb5503f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is the most common disorder of pregnancy with estimates of global prevalence reaching over 40%. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia but other causes include nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow suppression and haemolytic or hereditary diseases. Blood loss during, as well as shortly after, birth may further contribute to postpartum anaemia.

The consequences of anaemia in pregnancy are potentially far-reaching, both for mother and infant. Several studies have identified anaemia as a risk factor for intrauterine fetal death, premature birth, low birth weight and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Some suggest a link between maternal anaemia in pregnancy and later developmental problems in children. Postpartum maternal anaemia may be associated with breathlessness, lethargy, infection, lactation failure and depression. Despite this, there is evidence of significant variation in practice and sub-optimal management of maternal anaemia, possibly due to a lack of consistent, detailed information derived from good quality evidence.

We carried out a review of systematic reviews to summarise the evidence base, to identify gaps in the evidence and to develop a research agenda for this important component of maternity care. The primary focus of this review was the range of interventions used to prevent and treat anaemia in pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. The project focussed on systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as the most robust form of study design to address the effectiveness of interventions. Given the expected clinical diversity in practices and populations, we choose not to include reviews that focussed on resource poor countries. This review of systematic reviews followed principles set out in the Cochrane Handbook.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^55a4f5df]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.10 Iron deficiency in high‐risk populations with chronic inflammatory conditions

Chronic conditions cannot be viewed in isolation and there will be circumstances where individuals may have further increased susceptibility to iron deficiency. To optimize outcomes for these patients, risks need to be pre‐empted wherever possible. Three important populations to consider among your patients are: women (particularly those who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, and those who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]); the elderly; and those undergoing surgery.

Women of reproductive age are one of the most at‐risk population groups for iron deficiency anemia. Between 4 and 52% of women of reproductive age are reported to suffer from HMB, with a wide range reflecting disparities between study populations and how HMB is defined 88 Notably, a recent European study demonstrated that 63% of the participating HMB patients were suffering from iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. 89 Iron deficiency in combination with HMB can have debilitating consequences on the QoL and wellbeing of the sufferer. 90, 91, 92, 93 Thus, many of these women enter pregnancy with low iron stores and are often already anemic. Approximately 42% of pregnant women worldwide have anemia, with iron deficiency anemia being the primary cause, and this may have a serious detrimental effect on the outcome for both mother and child. 2, 94, 95, 96 In pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality, possibly due to not being able to withstand the adverse effect of excessive blood loss at delivery and the increased risk of infection. 96 Iron deficiency anemia also affects the child and has been linked with increased risk of preterm labor and subsequent low birthweight, and perinatal complications. 97 Moreover, there is an association between maternal iron status in pregnancy with that of the infant; with infants born to anemic mothers being more likely to be anemic themselves. 98 Iron deficiency also carries negative long‐term impact on the mother–child relationship and the child's cognitive development, of which the latter has shown to persist for up to 10 years, even after iron repletion. 95, 99, 100

1.7 Iron deficiency in inflammatory bowel disease

Iron deficiency affects between 13 and 90% of patients with IBD, depending on the population that is studied, eg, in‐ or outpatients, active or quiescent, as well as severity of the disease. 4 The main causes of iron deficiency in IBD arise from impaired GI iron absorption due to chronic inflammation, bowel resection (especially in Crohn's disease), disease triggered malnutrition and (mainly chronic) blood loss. 27 As with nephrologists, not all gastroenterologists fully appreciate the importance of managing iron deficiency. This may be because the role of iron deficiency anemia in IBD is not fully understood — evidence often depends on the selected patients from tertiary referral centers, including: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; hospitalized patients versus outpatients; or patients with and without surgical interventions. 27, 64 Iron deficiency can be easily corrected before the onset of anemia; however, the current evidence base focuses on iron deficiency anemia and its treatment. 22

Iron deficiency anemia is recognized as one of the most common complications and extra‐intestinal manifestations of IBD. However, over 50% of patients who are diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia are not treated. 65 In a recent survey, it was shown that approximately one‐third of patients diagnosed with IBD, who are unsure of their anemia status, do not discuss the possibility of developing iron deficiency anemia with healthcare professionals. 22 In this same survey, patients attributed weakness and chronic fatigue to both IBD and iron deficiency anemia. 22 Chronic fatigue associated with iron deficiency anemia may be debilitating and has been suggested to be the primary cause of impaired QoL in anemic IBD patients, to the same extent as other symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. 22, 27, 66 Notably, improvements in iron status with IV iron treatment have led to significantly improved QoL in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, according to IBD QoL questionnaire scores (P < 0.001) and SF‐36 physical (P < 0.001) and mental component (P = 0.024) scores. 18 Furthermore, changes in Hb levels (but not the activity of the underlying disease) were associated with significant changes in SF‐36 (P = 0.005) and IBD QoL questionnaire (P = 0.009) scores in IBD patients with iron deficiency anemia. 67

### Iron deficiency – United States, 1999–2000 [^a5de8a1b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, has negative effects on work capacity and on motor and mental development in infants, children, and adolescents, and maternal iron deficiency anemia might cause low birthweight and preterm delivery. Although iron deficiency is more common in developing countries, a significant prevalence was observed in the United States during the early 1990s among certain populations, such as toddlers and females of childbearing age. One of the national health objectives for 2010 is to reduce iron deficiency in these vulnerable populations by 3–4 percentage points (objective no. 19–12). CDC has published recommendations to prevent iron deficiency in the United States. To characterize the iron status of persons in the United States, CDC calculated the prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia by applying a multiple-indicator model to data from the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999–2000). These values were compared with those observed in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III [1988–1994]) using the same multiple-indicator model. This report summarizes the results of this analysis, which indicate that iron deficiency remains 2–5 percentage points above the 2010 national health objectives. To prevent iron deficiency, vulnerable populations should be encouraged to eat iron-rich foods and breast-feed or use iron-fortified formula for infants.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^6742d215]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Lilian White, MD Posted on April 28, 2025 Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia globally, comprising an estimated 50% of patients with anemia. Women younger than 50 years are the most likely population to be affected. Iron deficiency due to poor nutrition is the most common cause of anemia in children. Iron deficiency without anemia is estimated to be twice as prevalent as iron deficiency with anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, menstrual blood loss, impaired absorption, inadequate dietary intake, and inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia.

A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Helicobacter pylori infection. The AGA guidelines additionally recommend bidirectional endoscopy in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopy may also be considered in premenopausal women; however, a trial of oral iron supplementation is a reasonable initial step in these patients in the absence of concerning symptoms. A hemoglobin increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL over 1 month is considered a successful response and supports the diagnosis. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis.

In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended. Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

### Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^13dc4e8a]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

We made four important changes related to the estimation of burden attributable to iron deficiency. First, the definitions of the GBD cause "dietary iron deficiency" and the risk factor "iron deficiency" are no longer identical. The GBD cause name was changed from "iron-deficiency anaemia" to "dietary iron deficiency" to clarify the focus on inadequate intake and exclusion of other causes that can manifest as absolute or functional iron deficiency. Second, although the GBD risk factor name remained "iron deficiency", the exposure estimates were expanded to include all iron deficiency, irrespective of whether or not inadequate dietary intake is the underlying cause (appendix 1 section 4). This change was based on review of the Child Health Epidemiology Research Group (CHERG) Iron Report, whose component studies revealed no distinction as to the aetiology of iron deficiency. Third, on the basis of the studies included in the CHERG Iron Report, which only assessed overall maternal mortality as an outcome, we added all subcauses of maternal disorders as outcomes of iron deficiency (the risk), leading to higher estimates of the burden attributable to iron deficiency among women of reproductive age. Fourth, on the basis of the absence of evidence supporting dietary iron deficiency as a primary cause of death, dietary iron deficiency was removed from the GBD 2017 cause of death analysis, resulting in zero mortality burden and lower overall estimates of burden for dietary iron deficiency (the cause). Dietary iron deficiency (the cause) is expressed in terms of prevalence and YLDs, but the exposure to iron deficiency (the risk) remains expressed as the counterfactual haemoglobin concentration that would be present in a given population group in the absence of all causes of anaemia that manifest as iron deficiency.

Special situations — young women

IDA is common in young women, and major contributory factors include menstrual losses, pregnancy and poor dietary intake (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
Underlying GI pathology is uncommon in young women with IDA, and so after screening for CD, we recommend that further investigation is warranted only if there are additional clinical features of concern — as detailed in the text (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
If GI investigation in a pregnant woman is deemed necessary prior to delivery, gastroscopy and (after the first trimester) MR enterography are considered safe in pregnancy (evidence quality — low, consensus — 91%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — young men

Confirmed IDA is uncommon in young men, but when found we recommend that it warrants the same investigational algorithm as for older people (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — the elderly

Iron deficiency is common in the elderly, and is often multifactorial in aetiology (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that the risks and benefits of invasive endoscopic and alternative investigation(s) are carefully considered in those with major comorbidities and/or limited performance status (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

Special situations — specific comorbidities

Functional iron deficiency (FID) is a common contributory factor to the anaemia associated with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Iron deficiency is common in chronic heart failure (CHF), and is often multifactorial (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Parenteral IRT may improve symptoms and quality of life in CHF with FID (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
In the management of iron deficiency associated with CKD or CHF, reference to the appropriate specialist published guidelines is recommended (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
Intolerance and malabsorption of oral IRT can be particular problems in the treatment of IBD-associated IDA, and parenteral IRT may be required (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^409646b6]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Common misconceptions in the diagnosis and management of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease [^216164e6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common systemic complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); so common that it is almost invariably not investigated and rarely treated. Several misconceptions are the reason for these clinical errors, and our goal will be to review them. The most common misconceptions are: anemia is uncommon in IBD; iron deficiency is also uncommon; just by treating the intestinal disease, anemia will be corrected; iron deficiency is the only cause for anemia in IBD; ferritin is an accurate parameter for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in IBD; the impact of anemia on the quality of life of IBD patients is limited; iron supplementation is rarely needed in IBD; high-dose oral iron solves the problem of iron malabsorption in IBD; intravenous (IV) iron is dangerous and of no proven benefit in IBD; IV iron is useful only for severe anemia; and erythropoietin has no role in the treatment of IBD anemia. These misconceptions are not evidence-based. On the contrary, there is enough evidence to support the following statements: (a) anemia is very common in IBD, (b) anemia should be investigated with care because many factors can be responsible, (c) treatment of anemia results in clear improvement in the objective parameters of well-being, especially in the quality of life, (d) IV iron is safe and effective in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in IBD patients, and (e) erythropoietin is useful in a subset of patients with refractory anemia. Anemia diagnosis and treatment must not be neglected in IBD patients, and several misconceptions should be promptly abandoned.

### Anemia of inflammation [^f2002ab5]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^edf5c77b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study also identified age-related and sex-related patterns in the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency. The prevalence of absolute iron deficiency was highest among women younger than 50 years, possibly due to heavy menstrual bleeding, as suggested by a prior studyof female individuals between the ages of 12 and 21 years. Among older adults, absolute iron deficiency may be related to occult bleeding, whereas functional iron deficiency may be related to comorbidities that increase hepcidin levels. Since the causes, and potentially the treatments, for absolute and functional iron deficiency differ, these age-related and sex-related patterns may have implications for the management of iron deficiency.

Limitations

Our study has certain limitations. The exact causes of iron deficiency were not systematically ascertained in NHANES. Repeated measures of ferritin and transferrin saturation levels were not available, so trends over time were not feasible. These results are based on a 3-year period of data. The number of people sampled from certain subgroups was small and led to imprecise estimates. We assessed dietary iron intake, but did not account for factors that may influence dietary iron absorption, such as dietary vitamin C content.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^ab7f58a9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### How I treat anemia in pregnancy: iron, cobalamin, and folate [^f8989e77]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia of pregnancy, an important risk factor for fetal and maternal morbidity, is considered a global health problem, affecting almost 50% of pregnant women. In this article, diagnosis and management of iron, cobalamin, and folate deficiencies, the most frequent causes of anemia in pregnancy, are discussed. Three clinical cases are considered. Iron deficiency is the most common cause. Laboratory tests defining iron deficiency, the recognition of developmental delays and cognitive abnormalities in iron-deficient neonates, and literature addressing the efficacy and safety of IV iron in pregnancy are reviewed. An algorithm is proposed to help clinicians diagnose and treat iron deficiency, recommending oral iron in the first trimester and IV iron later. Association of folate deficiency with neural tube defects and impact of fortification programs are discussed. With increased obesity and bariatric surgery rates, prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in pregnancy is rising. Low maternal cobalamin may be associated with fetal growth retardation, fetal insulin resistance, and excess adiposity. The importance of treating cobalamin deficiency in pregnancy is considered. A case of malarial anemia emphasizes the complex relationship between iron deficiency, iron treatment, and malaria infection in endemic areas; the heightened impact of combined etiologies on anemia severity is highlighted.

Diagnosis and classification of iron deficiency

Two types of ID need to be distinguished: absolute, and functional ID,– (Figure 3).

Figure 3
The concept of absolute and functional iron deficiency.

Absolute ID reflects depleted iron stores, often with intact iron homoeostasis mechanisms and erythropoiesis. The commonest causes are: low-dietary iron, impaired gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and GI blood loss, menorrhagia (Figure 3). Functional ID reflects inadequate iron supply to meet the demand despite normal or abundant body iron stores, because iron is trapped inside cells of the reticuloendothelial system and is unavailable for cellular metabolism, (Figure 3). It is believed to be mainly caused by pro-inflammatory activation with hepcidin overproduction (see above).–

Approximately 80% of the total body iron is in the erythron, being a component of haemoglobin. Reduced iron delivery to erythroblasts and reticulocytes limits erythropoiesis, and ID is the commonest cause of anaemia. Diagnostic algorithms have been developed to optimize the detection and classification of ID, and to monitor iron stores to provide adequate and optimal management of anaemia. –

### Iron deficiency anemia: impact on women's reproductive health [^b9f3b09f]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are highly prevalent among women across their life span, especially during the reproductive age. An iron-deficient state has been associated with a number of adverse health consequences, affecting all aspects of the physical and emotional well-being of women. Heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy state, and the postpartum period are the major causes of ID/IDA. However, despite the high prevalence and the impact on quality of life, ID/IDA among fertile age women remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. The present Views and Reviews provides an overview on IDA in women's health, describing the background on iron metabolism, heavy menstrual bleeding pathogenetic mechanisms, including a focus on uterine disorders, such as uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. Iron replacement therapies, patient blood management, and treatment options for uterine disorders also are explored.
