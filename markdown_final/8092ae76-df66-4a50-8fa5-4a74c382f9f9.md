## Question

Propofol anesthesia in older patients undergoing cancer surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about propofol anesthesia in older adults undergoing cancer surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence for neurocognitive outcomes, especially delirium. Then, I should verify long-term oncologic outcomes from randomized trials. Next, I will examine mechanistic and immunologic data and reconcile them with clinical outcomes. After that, I need to check hemodynamic and dosing considerations in older adults. I will then review procedure-specific nuances and conflicting data. Finally, I should align conclusions with contemporary guidelines and outline practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal randomized evidence on delirium and early neurocognitive recovery. The SPOP1 multicenter randomized trial in 1,195 older adults (≥ 65 years) undergoing major cancer surgery found that propofol-based anesthesia reduced postoperative delirium within 7 days to 8.4% vs 12.4% with sevoflurane (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48–0.95; adjusted RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.90), with the effect concentrated on postoperative day 1, and no differences in major complications, ICU admission, or 30-day cognition, which strengthens confidence in a true delirium benefit signal in this population [^112ZGbtq] [^115PtftW]. Wait, let me verify the early cognitive data as well; a smaller randomized study in older adults showed delayed neurocognitive recovery at 1 week was lower with propofol than sevoflurane (14.8% vs 23.2%; OR 0.577, 95% CI 0.342–0.975), supporting a neurocognitive advantage in the immediate postoperative window, though I should note the lower credibility rating and smaller sample size when weighting conclusions [^112ZReQb].

> Next, I should review long-term oncologic outcomes from randomized trials to avoid over-extrapolating mechanistic hypotheses. The long-term follow-up of SPOP1 showed no difference in overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or event-free survival at a median 43 months between propofol and sevoflurane (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83–1.26), indicating no oncologic survival advantage for propofol in mixed major cancer surgery cohorts [^115bvkwZ]. Hold on, I should verify disease-specific randomized data; the pragmatic CAN randomized trial in breast cancer likewise found no difference in 5-year overall survival with propofol vs sevoflurane (91.9% vs 92.2%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.73–1.44), reinforcing that randomized evidence has not demonstrated a survival benefit for propofol in cancer surgery to date [^113fTDbb] [^114Zz8vw] [^116pXPf8]. I need to ensure I'm not missing procedure-specific RCTs; a randomized trial in colorectal cancer surgery also found no difference in circulating immune cell fractions (including NK cells) between propofol and sevoflurane, arguing against a clinically meaningful immunologic advantage of propofol in that context [^116QuFah].

> I will now examine mechanistic and immunologic data and reconcile them with clinical outcomes. Propofol has plausible anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in animal models, and some observational studies suggested better survival with propofol, but a meta-analysis of perioperative inflammatory biomarkers found no consistent difference between propofol and sevoflurane in IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, or CRP, suggesting patient and surgical factors dominate the inflammatory response rather than anesthetic choice [^112EvoN7]. But wait, what if circulating tumor cell dynamics differed by anesthetic? A randomized trial in breast cancer found no difference in postoperative circulating tumor cell counts over 72 hours between propofol and sevoflurane, undermining a key translational hypothesis linking anesthetic choice to micrometastatic burden in that setting [^111QV4XQ]. Let me reconsider the immunophenotyping data; again, the colorectal RCT showed no superiority of propofol for NK or T-cell subsets, aligning with the neutral clinical outcomes signal in randomized studies [^116QuFah].

> Now, I need to check hemodynamic and dosing considerations in older adults, because propofol's hypotension risk may offset some benefits. Observational data show frequent overdosing of propofol in patients ≥ 65 years, with mean induction doses around 1.7–1.8 mg/kg exceeding geriatric recommendations, and higher doses correlate with post-induction hypotension, particularly in those > 70 years, though not independently with 30-day mortality in that dataset [^1123NPBe] [^115ASsij]. I should double-check guideline-concordant dosing; geriatric best-practice guidance recommends 1.5–1.8 mg/kg for induction with slower titration and avoidance of rapid boluses, and maintenance infusions commonly 50–100 mcg/kg/min with downward adjustments for frailty and hemodynamics, which aligns with FDA labeling emphasizing cautious titration in elderly or debilitated patients [^111AU1m6] [^117Cyxn9]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives; remimazolam may offer more stable hemodynamics than propofol in older or hypertensive patients in small trials, suggesting a role when hypotension risk is high, though larger confirmatory studies are needed [^111pSUEi] [^111uyyBE].

> Next, I should review procedure-specific nuances and conflicting data to avoid overgeneralization. In head and neck free flap surgery, a randomized trial found fewer postoperative pulmonary complications with propofol-based TIVA than with inhalational anesthesia, plausibly related to more stable hemodynamics and less intraoperative fluid, which is clinically meaningful in that high-risk population [^116Smp7m]. Hmm, wait a minute, the opposite was reported in another RCT of head and neck cancer surgery where sevoflurane reduced minor pulmonary complications compared with propofol; these conflicting results likely reflect differences in fluid strategy, tracheostomy timing, and risk profiles, so I should be cautious in extrapolating a uniform pulmonary benefit for either technique across settings [^1158NChL]. I need to ensure I cover cardiac surgery; meta-analytic data suggest higher mortality with propofol in cardiac surgery contexts, but this is hypothesis-generating and not directly applicable to noncardiac oncologic surgery, so it should not drive anesthetic choice in cancer surgery outside the cardiac domain [^115F3u57] [^1162i9eg].

> Let me align with contemporary guidance before concluding. The 2025 ASA Practice Advisory for perioperative care of older adults notes persistent evidence gaps and calls for more well-designed RCTs comparing TIVA with inhaled agents across procedures, reflecting that current evidence is mixed and insufficient to mandate a universal preference for propofol or volatile anesthesia on survival grounds alone [^112ie4v9]. I should confirm that this stance coheres with disease-specific randomized data; indeed, the neutral long-term outcomes in SPOP1 and CAN reinforce that neither technique is clearly superior for oncologic survival, supporting individualized selection based on patient risk, procedure, and institutional expertise [^115bvkwZ] [^113fTDbb].

> Putting this together, I should state the clinical bottom line clearly and then justify it. For older adults undergoing major cancer surgery, propofol-based anesthesia reduces postoperative delirium and may lessen early neurocognitive dysfunction compared with sevoflurane, without improving long-term survival or recurrence-free survival in randomized trials, so the delirium benefit is the most reliable outcome signal to act upon in shared decision-making [^112ZGbtq] [^112ZReQb] [^115bvkwZ] [^113fTDbb]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; given propofol's hemodynamic liabilities in the elderly, careful dosing, slow titration, and proactive blood pressure management are essential, and in frail or hypotension-prone patients, remimazolam or volatile-based strategies may be reasonable alternatives while maintaining multimodal analgesia and delirium prevention bundles [^111AU1m6] [^117Cyxn9] [^111pSUEi] [^111uyyBE].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical recommendations with built-in safeguards. I recommend propofol TIVA as a reasonable first choice in older adults at elevated delirium risk when hemodynamics can be safely managed, paired with geriatric dosing (induction 1.0–1.5 mg/kg, slow titration; maintenance 50–100 mcg/kg/min with BIS guidance and vigilant MAP monitoring), and I would avoid rapid boluses in frail or ASA III–IV patients. If hypotension risk is high, consider remimazolam or a volatile-based technique with tight hemodynamic control and delirium mitigation strategies, and document shared decision-making regarding the delirium benefit versus hemodynamic trade-offs [^115tdnbA] [^117Cyxn9] [^111pSUEi] [^111uyyBE]. I should confirm that we continue to monitor for emerging RCTs, as ongoing and planned studies may refine procedure-specific guidance, but current randomized evidence does not support choosing propofol to improve cancer survival, so oncologic outcome should not be the primary driver of anesthetic selection in this context [^112ie4v9] [^115bvkwZ] [^113fTDbb].

Propofol-based anesthesia in older cancer surgery patients **reduces postoperative delirium** [^112ZGbtq] and may improve early cognitive recovery [^112ZReQb] compared with sevoflurane, but **does not improve long-term survival** or recurrence-free survival [^115bvkwZ] [^114Zz8vw]. Propofol is associated with less PONV [^116oZ5YX] and a more stable hemodynamic profile in some settings [^116Smp7m], yet carries a higher risk of hypotension and may require vasopressor support [^111uyyBE]. There is no clear oncologic survival benefit, so anesthetic choice should be individualized based on patient risk, comorbidities, and surgical context [^113czvaR].

## Clinical outcomes

### Postoperative delirium and cognitive function

- **Delirium**: Propofol reduces delirium by ~32% vs sevoflurane (8.4% vs 12.4%; RR 0.68) in older adults undergoing major cancer surgery [^112ZGbtq].

- **Cognitive recovery**: Propofol may reduce delayed neurocognitive recovery at 1 week vs sevoflurane (14.8% vs 23.2%; OR 0.577) [^112ZReQb].

- **Sleep quality**: Propofol improves first postoperative night sleep vs sevoflurane in older abdominal surgery patients [^112GaciL].

---

### Long-term survival and recurrence

Long-term survival is **similar with propofol vs sevoflurane** (adjusted HR 1.02) in older adults after major cancer surgery [^115bvkwZ]. Recurrence-free survival likewise shows **no significant difference** between propofol and sevoflurane (adjusted HR 1.07) [^115bvkwZ].

---

### Postoperative complications

- **Pulmonary complications**: Propofol reduces postoperative pulmonary complications vs inhalational anesthesia in head and neck free flap surgery [^116Smp7m].

- **Acute kidney injury**: No difference in AKI after gastric or lung cancer surgery between propofol and sevoflurane [^111QwC9f] [^113TJ5Ay].

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Propofol may cause more hypotension than sevoflurane or remimazolam, sometimes requiring vasopressors [^111uyyBE].

---

## Physiological considerations in elderly patients

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

In elderly patients, **clearance** is reduced and the **volume of distribution** is increased, leading to higher plasma concentrations and prolonged effect. Sensitivity is greater, with **enhanced hypnotic and hemodynamic effects**, necessitating **dose reductions** [^111AU1m6].

---

### Hemodynamic effects

Hypotension is more common with propofol, particularly in the elderly, and may necessitate **vasopressor support** [^111pSUEi]. In contrast, **hemodynamic stability** is generally better with sevoflurane, though both agents can cause hypotension.

---

## Immunomodulatory effects and cancer progression

Propofol may **preserve NK cell activity** and reduce pro-tumorigenic cytokines, whereas sevoflurane may suppress NK function and increase metastatic potential. Despite these biologic differences, **clinical translation** has not shown improved survival or recurrence-free outcomes with propofol [^115bvkwZ] [^114Zz8vw].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Hypotension**: More frequent with propofol, especially in the elderly [^115ASsij].

- **Injection pain**: Common with propofol but generally manageable.

- **Respiratory depression**: Comparable to sevoflurane with appropriate monitoring.

- **Postoperative nausea and vomiting**: Lower with propofol than sevoflurane [^116oZ5YX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized anesthetic planning** based on patient comorbidities, surgical context, and institutional expertise [^notfound]. Propofol is reasonable for patients at high risk of delirium or PONV, whereas sevoflurane may be preferred when hemodynamic stability is paramount.

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Propofol** | **Sevoflurane** |
|-|-|-|
| Postoperative delirium | Lower incidence [^112ZGbtq] | Higher incidence |
| Long-term survival | No difference [^115bvkwZ] | No difference |
| Recurrence-free survival | No difference [^115bvkwZ] | No difference |
| Postoperative nausea and vomiting | Lower incidence [^116oZ5YX] | Higher incidence |
| Hemodynamic stability | More hypotension [^notfound] | More stable |
| Pulmonary complications | Lower in some surgeries [^116Smp7m] | Higher in some surgeries |

Propofol-based anesthesia in older cancer patients **reduces delirium and PONV** [^112ZGbtq] [^116oZ5YX] and may improve early cognitive recovery [^112ZReQb], but **does not improve long-term survival** or recurrence-free survival [^115bvkwZ] [^114Zz8vw]. It may cause more hypotension, so anesthetic choice should be individualized to patient risk, comorbidities, and surgical context [^111pSUEi] [^113czvaR].

### Lidocaine effects on neutrophil extracellular trapping and angiogenesis biomarkers in postoperative breast cancer patients with different anesthesia methods: a prospective, randomized trial [^113gtQgE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer, a global health challenge, ranks as the leading or second-leading cause of death worldwide and holds the top position in China. Notably, female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally and remains the primary cause of cancer-related deaths among women. The predominant management approach for breast cancer involves surgical resection. However, this procedure induces a stress response, leading to the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and molecules into the bloodstream. These substances have the potential to compromise cell-mediated immunity, creating an environment conducive to the survival and growth of residual tumor cells, thereby accelerating tumor cell proliferation and facilitating premature metastasis.

To enhance the cure and survival rates for breast cancer, it is imperative to reduce local recurrence and metastasis following surgery. The interaction between anesthesia techniques, drug selection, and the cellular immune system may be factors that influence tumor recurrence and metastasis. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has demonstrated enhanced recurrence-free survival and overall survival compared to inhalation anesthesia in both animal models and retrospective clinical studies. Nevertheless, a recent CAN study comprising 1764 breast cancer patients showed no difference in overall survival between general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane for breast cancer surgery. Notably, local anesthetics, particularly the amide local anesthetic lidocaine, exhibit significant non-local anesthetic effects, including potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects as a systemic intravenous infusion. Recent studies have unveiled lidocaine's distinct anticancer properties, such as inducing tumor cell apoptosis and regulating tumor cell biology.

### Effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on prognosis in patients with cancer undergoing surgical procedures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111eP1za]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Cancer poses a substantial global health challenge, placing a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, surgery remains a primary treatment modality for solid tumours. Researchers are increasingly interested in investigating whether anaesthetic techniques and agents used during cancer resection affect long-term recurrence or metastasis of tumours. Laboratory research and most retrospective clinical studies suggest a potential advantage of propofol-based total i.v. anaesthesia over volatile anaesthesia in enhancing outcomes for patients with cancer undergoing surgery. However, conflicting evidence suggests that propofol promotes tumour metastasis through GABA A receptor-dependent Src modulation in certain tumours. Thus, careful consideration and further scrutiny are necessary when using these anaesthetic agents in cancer resection surgeries.

Appropriate use of DEX in tumour resection remains a subject of debate. According to retrospective studies, the usage rate of DEX is 40–50%, highlighting the need to investigate its effects in patients undergoing cancer resection. Recent studies have produced conflicting findings: some have suggested that DEX promotes tumour cell proliferation, metastasis, and migration in vitro, and could potentially reduce overall postoperative survival in oncological patients undergoing lung resection. Conversely, other research has indicated that DEX can attenuate tumour cell metastasis and progression during the perioperative period. To address these discrepancies, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraoperative DEX administration, with the goal of providing evidence-based guidance for the selection of anaesthetic drugs in surgical oncology. Our primary objective was to assess the impact of DEX on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with cancer, with the hypothesis that DEX improves the outcomes of patients with cancer and reduces cancer recurrence rates.

### Impact of neuromuscular block on myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) incidence in the early postoperative stage of older patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection: a randomized controlled study [^112pW28o]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study confirmed that deep neuromuscular block could reduce the intraoperative dosage of propofol and remifentanil, shorten the length of hospital stay and reduce the patients' pain intensity 72 h after surgery, which were partially consistent with the previous studies. Maintaining different degrees of the neuromuscular block under TOF guidance intraoperatively did not change the MINS incidence within 7 days after surgery. Therefore, concern about the occurrence of MINS cannot be taken as a reason to refuse the application of moderate neuromuscular block in older patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.

### Long-term survival in older patients given propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia for major cancer surgery: follow-up of a multicentre randomised trial [^115bvkwZ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Experimental evidence indicates that i.v. anaesthesia might reduce cancer recurrence compared with volatile anaesthesia, but clinical information is observational only. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that propofol-based anaesthesia improves survival over 3 or more years after potentially curative major cancer surgery.

Methods

This was a long-term follow-up of a multicentre randomised trial in 14 tertiary hospitals in China. We enrolled 1228 patients aged 65–90 yr who were scheduled for major cancer surgery. They were randomised to either propofol-based i.v. anaesthesia or to sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. The primary endpoint was overall survival after surgery. Secondary endpoints included recurrence-free and event-free survival.

Results

Amongst subjects randomised, 1195 (mean age 72 yr; 773 [65%] male) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. At the end of follow-up (median 43 months), there were 188 deaths amongst 598 patients (31%) assigned to propofol-based anaesthesia compared with 175 deaths amongst 597 patients (29%) assigned to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia; adjusted hazard ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83–1.26; P = 0.834. Recurrence-free survival was 223/598 (37%) in patients given propofol anaesthesia vs 206/597 (35%) given sevoflurane anaesthesia; adjusted hazard ratio 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89–1.30; P = 0.465. Event-free survival was 294/598 (49%) in patients given propofol anaesthesia vs 274/597 (46%) given sevoflurane anaesthesia; adjusted hazard ratio 1.09; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; P = 0.298.

Conclusions

Long-term survival after major cancer surgery was similar with i.v. and volatile anaesthesia. Propofol-based iv. anaesthesia should not be used for cancer surgery with the expectation that it will improve overall or cancer-specific survival.

### Anesthetics and long-term survival after cancer surgery-total intravenous versus volatile anesthesia: a retrospective study [^111ecmi8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In Korea, more than 200,000 new cancer patients are diagnosed each year and one in four deaths is due to cancer. Although considerable progress has been made in chemotherapy and radiation therapy, excision of cancerous lesions remains a preferred treatment option for patients with solid tumors. However, the cancer may metastasize or proliferate during surgery; moreover, surgery can spread cancer cells throughout the body, so both doctors and patients are keenly aware of the postoperative prognosis. Cancer recurrence and metastasis are influenced by cancer propagation, patient immunity, and related factors.

Methods of general anesthesia for tumor resection of malignant tumors include the use of volatile anesthetics and the use of intravenous anesthetics. Several in vitro studies have investigated the use of volatile inhaled anesthetics (VIA) to increase the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and insulin-like growth factor, which are factors involved in tumor growth. There is a possibility of adverse effects on the prognosis of surgical patients. On the other hand, propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, has been reported to reduce the expression of HIF-1α and inhibit tumor growth.

In 2016, Wigmore et al. revealed that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has a favorable effect on the prognosis of cancer patients. Subsequently, many similar studies have been described in the literature. In 2017, a retrospective study showed that the use of inhalation anesthetics in 191 esophageal cancer patients had a negative effect on prognosis. In a study published in 2018 regarding 1158 patients with colorectal cancer, patients who received TIVA had a better prognosis than those who received desflurane anesthesia. However, other recent studies have shown that cancer prognosis is not related to the type of anesthesia. So far, there have been no reports that propofol-based TIVA is significantly more harmful to patient survival.

This study investigated whether 5-year overall mortality differed between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received VIA during major cancer surgeries in our hospital. Based on the findings reported by Wigmore et al. we hypothesized that patients who received TIVA would show a high 5-year survival rate after cancer surgery (i.e. resection for gastric, lung, liver, colon, or breast cancer), compared to patients who received VIA.

### Comparison of propofol, droperidol, and metoclopramide for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients [^114TwNWz]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy (with axillary dissection) experience PONV. We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg, droperidol 20 microg/kg, metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo (isotonic saline) immediately after skin suture. A standard general anesthetic technique, including sevoflurane and air in oxygen, was used. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. To maintain the integrity of the study results, none of the patients received preanesthetic medication.

Results

A total of 100 women (mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years; height, 154 [6] cm; weight, 54 [7] kg) were included in the study. Each study group comprised 25 patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics, surgery type, or awakening time. The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol (P = 0.005), 32% with droperidol (P = 0.011), and 60% with metoclopramide (P = NS), compared with placebo (68%). No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol, and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide (P = 0.022 and P = 0.043, respectively). Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups.

Conclusions

The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg/kg and droperidol 20 microg/kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small, select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery. The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg and placebo.

### Influence of propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia on peri-operative outcome measures: a narrative review [^1141WqAA]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia is well known for its smooth, clear-headed recovery and anti-emetic properties, but there are also many lesser known beneficial properties that can potentially influence surgical outcome. We will discuss the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of propofol and their roles in pain, organ protection and immunity. We will also discuss the use of propofol in cancer surgery, neurosurgery and older patients.

Table 1
Descriptions of Potential Adverse Effects

Patients older than 18 years with thyroid carcinoma who were scheduled for elective open thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were eligible for our study. They were surveyed before and after surgery. We excluded individuals who had communication problems, were unable to speak or read Chinese, or incapable of understanding the contents of questionnaire. Those who refused to participate were also excluded. We distributed 500 preoperative questionnaires from May 2016 to July 2016 and aimed to collect at least 400 completed questionnaires. All the completed questionnaires were collected anonymously.

The final preoperative questionnaire consisted of two parts: standard demographic items including age, sex, and previous experience of surgery, and a rankings section. In the rankings section, we asked patients to rank the 10 specific items. We used priority ranking scales to determine their preferences. Detailed instructions were given to the included patients to help them understand this ranking technique well. For example, "please rank each of these problems (you might experience) in relation to each other from 1 to 10 (1 = the most undesirable to 10 = the most desirable). Assume that each hypothetical situation occurs with equal frequency and would have the same duration. Each ranking number should be used only once". One trained investigator (W.W.) who did not participate in patients' anesthesia was responsible for distributing the questionnaire, explaining and answering any question asked by patients during this process. Moreover, the investigator reminded patients that there was no standard or right answer and they were encouraged to express their own views. Preoperative questionnaires would be considered valid or correct only if the normal outcome was ranked 10 (highest). Thus, we excluded all preoperative questionnaires that were not fully completed or were incorrect in our final analysis.

### Effect of propofol on breast cancer cell, the immune system, and patient outcome [^1169fku5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

For many years, the relationship between anesthetic techniques and cancer outcomes has captured interest in oncological surgery. The current literature suggests that the choice of anesthetic is correlated with cancer patient survival or recurrence after surgery with propofol considered beneficial compared to volatile anesthetics. The potential benefits of propofol might include impairment of cancer cell functions, preservation of immune function and reduction in surgical stress. However, the existing laboratory studies and clinical trials including propofol are inconsistent and inconclusive. Most in vitro studies focus on the analysis of changes in cancer cell behavior in response to propofol but do not delve deeply into potential mechanism. The beneficial effects of propofol on immune system are largely restricted to NK cells. Moreover, most clinical studies are retrospective, which are not sufficient to recommend changes in anesthesia practice. Hopefully the ongoing prospective clinical trials may offer a more definite answer. In the meantime, additional studies are required to help unravel the role anesthetics in the immune function using animal models, and explore potential therapy to counteract the dentrimental effect of certain anesthetics. In terms of direct effect of propofol on cancer cell, protein/gene targets are necessary to decipher the molecular mechanism, particularly with respect to the heterogeneity of breast cancer. Additional in vivo and in vitro studies are urgently needed to improve our current clinical guidance.

Total intravenous anesthesia — research gaps note that additional well-designed randomized clinical trials in older adults comparing total intravenous anesthesia to inhaled agents across various procedures are needed due to inconsistencies in the current evidence base, and trials building on the feasibility pilot Trajectories of Recovery after Intravenous Propofol versus Inhaled Volatile anesthesia, funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (Washington, D.C.), are needed.

### Impact of prognostic nutritional index change on prognosis after colorectal cancer surgery under propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia [^115VPzic]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the impact of two anesthetic agents, namely propofol-based or sevoflurane-based anesthesia, on the prognosis of CRC and other types of cancer, previous studies have yielded conflicting results. For instance, a meta-analysis suggested that total intravenous anesthesia, which includes the use of propofol, may lead to lower mortality rates compared to inhalational anesthesia. Additionally, a retrospective study demonstrated that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia was associated with improved survival in patients with gastric cancer. Conversely, a study conducted by Makito et al. suggested a limited association between the type of anesthesia and improved OS in patients undergoing surgery for digestive cancers. These inconsistent findings highlight the need for further research in this area. In our study, we did not observe any significant effects of anesthesia methods on the prognosis of CRC.

Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between changes in PNI and anesthesia on the prognosis of patients with CRC in our study. However, the improved OS and PFS were only evident among patients with a significant decrease in PNI when undergoing propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia. PNI serves as an evaluative index for assessing nutritional and immunological status. Patients with a low PNI may exhibit compromised nutritional status and reduced systemic immunity, which can impact prognosis through local immune responses. Furthermore, the surgical procedure itself activates neural and inflammatory signaling pathways, which are associated with immune dysfunction and cancer development. Therefore, the combined effects of deteriorating nutritional status, surgical trauma, and anesthesia methods on immune mechanisms may contribute to the more pronounced protective effect of propofol-based anesthesia.

### Total intravenous or inhalational volatile anaesthesia and survival after colorectal cancer surgery: a Swedish national registry study [^116UKBZj]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The existing literature highlights the urgent need for well‐designed randomised trials in patients with colorectal cancer to determine the potential effects of anaesthetic technique on cancer outcomes. Pre‐clinical data support the hypothesis that propofol has anti‐tumorigenic properties and that inhalational volatile anaesthetic agents are pro‐tumorigenic, and a majority of retrospective clinical studies indicate a survival benefit in favour of propofol; these findings should ideally be tested in randomised clinical trials. However, given the nature of the outcome measure being analysed, few trials are to be expected and large retrospective observational studies based on prospectively collected data may be the best alternative.

In conclusion, this study using merged data from two national quality registries, revealed no discernible association between the choice of anaesthetic agent for maintenance of anaesthesia at surgery and long‐term survival outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. Pending results from randomised studies, we find no basis for advocating a modification of local protocols regarding the risk of cancer recurrence based on the choice of anaesthetic agent.

### Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia is associated with better survival than desflurane anesthesia in colon cancer surgery [^113HvqGW]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

What We Already Know About This Topic

WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Previous research has shown different effects of anesthetics on cancer cell growth. Here, the authors investigated the association between type of anesthetic and patient survival after elective colon cancer surgery.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included patients who received elective colon cancer surgery between January 2005 and December 2014. Patients were grouped according to anesthesia received: propofol or desflurane. After exclusion of those who received combined propofol anesthesia with inhalation anesthesia or epidural anesthesia, survival curves were constructed from the date of surgery to death. After propensity matching, univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to compare hazard ratios for death. Subgroup analyses were performed for tumor-node-metastasis staging and postoperative metastasis.

Results

A total of 706 patients (307 deaths, 43.5%) with desflurane anesthesia and 657 (88 deaths, 13.4%) with propofol anesthesia were eligible for analysis. After propensity matching, 579 patients remained in each group (189 deaths, 32.6%, in the desflurane group vs. 87, 15.0%, in the propofol group). In the matched analyses, the propofol-treated group had a better survival, irrespective of lower tumor-node-metastasis stage (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.42; P < 0.001) or higher tumor-node-metastasis stage (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.55; P < 0.001) and presence of metastases (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86; P = 0.002) or absence of metastases (hazard ratio, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.62; P = 0.016). Simple propensity score adjustment produced similar findings.

Conclusions

Propofol anesthesia for colon cancer surgery is associated with better survival irrespective of tumor-node-metastasis stage.

### Impact of general anaesthesia on breast cancer survival: a 5-year follow up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, the CAN-study, comparing propofol and sevoflurane [^116pXPf8]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Anaesthesia may impact long-term cancer survival. In the Cancer and Anaesthesia study, we hypothesised that the hypnotic drug propofol will have an advantage of at least five percentage points in five-year survival over the inhalational anaesthetic sevoflurane for breast cancer surgery.

Methods

From 2118 eligible breast cancer patients scheduled for primary curable, invasive breast cancer surgery, 1764 were recruited after ethical approval and individual informed consent to this open label, single-blind, randomised trial at four county- and three university hospitals in Sweden and one Chinese university hospital. Of surveyed patients, 354 were excluded, mainly due to refusal to participate. Patients were randomised by computer at the monitoring organisation to general anaesthesia maintenance with either intravenous propofol or inhaled sevoflurane in a 1:1 ratio in permuted blocks. Data related to anaesthesia, surgery, oncology, and demographics were registered. The primary endpoint was five-year overall survival. Data are presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Hazard Ratios based on Cox univariable regression analyses by both intention-to-treat and per-protocol. EudraCT, 2013–002380–25 and.

Findings

Of 1764 patients, included from December 3, 2013, to September 29, 2017, 1670 remained for analysis. The numbers who survived at least five years were 773/841 (91.9% (95% CI 90.1–93.8)) in the propofol group and 764/829 (92.2% (90.3–94.0)) in the sevoflurane group, (HR 1.03 (0.73–1.44); P = 0.875); the corresponding results in the per-protocol-analysis were: 733/798 (91.9% (90.0–93.8)) and 653/710 (92.0% (90.0–94.0)) (HR = 1.01 (0.71–1.44); P = 0.955). Survival after a median follow-up of 76.7 months did not indicate any difference between the groups (HR 0.97, 0.72–1.29; P = 0.829, log rank test).

Interpretation

No difference in overall survival was found between general anaesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane for breast cancer surgery.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1142aMbT]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has limitations. First, the risk of bias was judged high in 16% of included studies but notably the statistically significant increase in mortality was confirmed after excluding studies with a high risk of bias. Further concerns for risk of bias were mainly due to the technical impossibility of a double-blind design in such complicated settings (e.g. perioperative and ICU). Second, we acknowledge that meta-analytic findings are often considered hypothesis-generating especially because they often include several small studies. In addition, our meta-analysis pooled mortality data from very different settings (e.g. anesthesia in several surgeries versus deep or light sedation in the ICU) and at different timepoints. However, more than half of worldwide ICU admissions pertain to postoperative patients and all our subgroup analyses and in particular the one including large studies only followed the same magnitude and direction of the primary analysis. Since the 252 studies included in our meta-analysis reported mortality at 17 different follow-up times, restriction to only one predefined timepoint would exclude most studies. We therefore used mortality at the longest follow-up available, which is an accepted approach to increase the number of eligible studies without influencing pooled point estimates of the effects at the study level. Furthermore, the symmetrical funnel plot allowed us to exclude small studies publication bias. Third, many included studies reported no death in at least one arm, leading to a wide confidence interval of the treatment effect. However, the robustness of our findings was supported by the low heterogeneity and consistency of the primary and subgroup analyses. Fourth, we did not perform the predetermined subgroup analysis on duration of drug infusion, but these data were not available to be extracted and we decided to introduce a subgroup analysis with ICU studies only.

### Bioelectrical impedance analysis of body composition for the anesthetic induction dose of propofol in older patients [^115tdnbA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Older people are currently the fastest growing segment of the worldwide population, and older patients are increasingly submitted to a multiplicity of surgical procedures. Physiologic changes and cognitive dysfunction associated with age, the presence of multiple comorbidities, the use of multiple medications and frailty increase the risk of older patients to adverse postoperative outcomes. As a result, older people present a larger variation in terms of morbidity and physiological characteristics, which affect the predictability of their response to medications. Variation in frailty likely contributes to this heterogeneity but its effects on pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are not yet well understood. Consequently, chronological age is a weak contributing factor of pharmacological response. Age-related physiologic changes per se are not always clinically significant and should not result in the same dose regimen alterations for all chronological old patients. Despite these considerations, current guidelines recommend lower doses of anesthetic agents for all chronologically older patients. For induction of general anesthesia with propofol, it is generally recommended to decrease propofol dose from 40 mg every 10 s (2–2.5 mg/kg) to 20 mg every 10 s (1–1.5 mg/kg) until induction onset.

### Expression profiles of immune cells after propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia for colorectal cancer surgery: a prospective double-blind randomized trial [^116QuFah]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The antitumor effects of natural killer cells, helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells after cancer surgery were reported previously. This study hypothesized that propofol-based anesthesia would have fewer harmful effects on immune cells than volatile anesthetics-based anesthesia during colorectal cancer surgery.

Methods

In total, 153 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were randomized and included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the fraction of circulating natural killer cells over time in the propofol and sevoflurane groups. The fractions of circulating natural killer, type 1, type 17 helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells were investigated. The fractions of CD39 and CD73 expressions on circulating regulatory T cells were investigated, along with the proportions of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.

Results

The fraction of circulating natural killer cells was not significantly different between the propofol and sevoflurane groups until 24 h postoperatively (20.4 ± 13.4% vs. 20.8 ± 11.3%, 17.9 ± 12.7% vs. 20.7 ± 11.9%, and 18.6 ± 11.6% vs. 21.3 ± 10.8% before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h after anesthesia, respectively; difference [95% CI], -0.3 [-4.3 to 3.6], -2.8 [-6.8 to 1.1], and -2.6 [-6.2 to 1.0]; P = 0.863, P = 0.136, and P = 0.151 before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h, respectively). The fractions of circulating type 1 and type 17 helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and CD39+ and CD73+ circulating regulatory T cells were not significantly different between the two groups. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in both groups remained within the normal range and was not different between the groups.

Conclusions

Propofol-based anesthesia was not superior to sevoflurane-based anesthesia in terms of alleviating suppression of immune cells including natural killer cells and T lymphocytes during colorectal cancer surgery.

### Delirium in older patients given propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia for major cancer surgery: a multicentre randomised trial [^115PtftW]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

The study SPOP1 was published by Shuang-Jie Cao and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Br J Anaesth. This study is related to the following diseases: Gastric cancer, Small bowel adenocarcinoma, Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, Appendiceal neoplasm, Colon cancer, Rectal cancer, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Cholangiocarcinoma, Gallbladder cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Small cell lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer, Esophageal cancer, Renal cell carcinoma, Bladder cancer, Prostate cancer, Endometrial cancer, Ovarian cancer, Uterine sarcoma, Breast cancer, Papillary thyroid carcinoma, Medullary thyroid carcinoma, Anaplastic thyroid cancer, Follicular thyroid carcinoma, Oropharyngeal cancer, Nasopharyngeal cancer and General anesthesia. In the SPOP1 study, the trial question was: is propofol-based anesthesia superior to sevoflurane-based anesthesia in older patients undergoing major cancer surgery? In the SPOP1 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SPOP1 study, the population was: 1195 patients (422 female, 773 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 65–90 years undergoing major cancer surgery expected to last ≥ 2 hours with general anesthesia. The key exclusion criteria were preoperative history of schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease or myasthenia gravis; inability to communicate in preoperative period; severe hepatic dysfunction; requirement of preoperative dialysis. In the SPOP1 study, the interventions were: n = 598 propofol anesthesia (continuous or target-controlled infusion of propofol) n = 597 sevoflurane anesthesia (continuous or target-controlled infusion of sevoflurane). In the SPOP1 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days (8.4% vs. 12.4%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). In the SPOP1 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in ICU admission after surgery (27% vs. 24%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.34) No significant difference in major complications (24% vs. 22%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31) No significant difference in cognitive function at 30 days (28.2 vs. 28.5; MD -0.3, 95% CI -0.8 to 0.3). In the SPOP1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the SPOP1 study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 65–90 years undergoing major cancer surgery expected to last ≥ 2 hours with general anesthesia, propofol anesthesia was superior to sevoflurane anesthesia with respect to the incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days.

### The effect of the type of anaesthesia on long-term outcomes after cancer resection surgery: a narrative review [^1148UhNR]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The peri-operative period may create a biological environment conducive to cancer cell survival and dissemination. Microscopic residual tumours (micrometastases) can be dislodged even with excellent surgical technique. At the same time, the stress response from surgery can temporarily impair immune function and activate inflammatory processes, increasing the risk of tumour proliferation.

Methods

This narrative review investigates how peri-operative anaesthetic and analgesic interventions may influence cancer recurrence and metastasis by exploring evidence from both experimental and clinical studies. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant preclinical and clinical studies published.

Results

While surgery remains the best curative option for many cancers, metastasis remains the leading cause of death. Numerous studies have suggested that different anaesthetic drugs and techniques could impact cancer outcomes including volatile anaesthetic agents; total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol; local anaesthetics; regional anaesthesia; and opioids. This review focuses on these five commonly used anaesthetic approaches and evaluates their potential impact on cancer progression.

Discussion

There is a complex interplay between anaesthetic and analgesic techniques and cancer outcomes. Despite promising data from laboratory experimental models, the balance of available clinical trials indicates an equivalent influence of all evaluated anaesthetic techniques on long-term oncologic outcomes, except, possibly, for peritumoral or intraperitoneal local anaesthetic infiltration.

### Comparison of outcomes after breast cancer surgery between inhalational and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qNXDs]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia increases postoperative rescue analgesia in breast cancer surgery and reduces PONV compared with inhalation anaesthesia; the benefit of propofol in the preservation of anti-cancer immunity is obvious over inhalational anaesthetics, but it is difficult to conclude that propofol can exert long-term beneficial effects, and the evidence in this regard should be anticipated from large multinational RCTs.

### Outcomes of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia on patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery: a retrospective observational study [^114a8naC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a worrying health threat in China, ranking sixth among new cancer cases in 2020, with approximately 320,000 new claims and the 4th highest mortality rate. The incidence of EC in China is much higher than that in Western countries, with more than half of new annual cases of EC worldwide occurring in China. EC is one of the most fatal malignancies with very poor overall 5-year survival rates (10% ~ 40%). Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common pathological type of EC in China. In contrast, esophageal adenocarcinoma is the predominant type in the Western World. The mainstream treatment method is radical resection of esophageal cancer.

Anesthetic techniques have varying effects on innate and cellular immunity, activation of adrenergic inflammatory pathways, and activation of cancer promoting cellular signaling pathways; these effects may translate into an influence of anesthetic technique on long term cancer outcomes. Laboratory and animal studies have suggested that volatile anesthetic drugs are more likely to enhance the activity of the cancer cells through suppression of immune cell function, modulation of the neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, and cancer cell signaling. Other study also shown that volatile anesthetics used in cancer surgery may be associated with worse tumor prognosis. In contrast, intravenous anesthetic agents such as propofol have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects that may protect against perioperative immune suppression.

At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support the superiority inhalational or intravenous anesthesia in esophageal cancer surgery. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to compare the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with esophageal cancer surgery using Propofol-based TIVA and sevoflurane-based INHA.

### Anesthetics and long-term survival after cancer surgery-total intravenous versus volatile anesthesia: a retrospective study [^1147EaA4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between the TIVA and VIA groups in patients who underwent major cancer surgeries in our hospital. Therefore, we cannot conclude that propofol-based TIVA is more suitable than VIA for use in cancer surgery. Unexpectedly, patients with stomach cancer showed better survival when they had hypertension than when they did not have hypertension. To increase the objectivity of these results, further studies with a larger number of patients are needed.

### Anaesthesia, analgesia, and cancer outcomes: time to think like oncologists? [^112uPCzL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Cao and colleagues present a follow-up analysis of a previous RCT among > 1200 older adults (mean age 72 yr) undergoing cancer surgery, originally designed to evaluate the effect of propofol or sevoflurane general anaesthesia on delirium, here to evaluate the effect of anaesthetic technique on overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Neither anaesthetic technique conferred an advantage on oncological outcomes. We suggest that although it is entirely plausible that the observed results are truly robust neutral findings, the present study could be limited, like most published studies in the field, by its heterogeneity and understandable absence of underlying individual patient-specific tumour genomic data. We argue for a precision oncology approach to onco-anaesthesiology research that recognises that cancer is not one but rather many diseases and that tumour genomics (and multi-omics) is a fundamental determinant relating drugs to longer-term outcomes.

### Comparison of outcomes after breast cancer surgery between inhalational and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11278iA7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence from 3 RCTs in this meta-analysis showed that propofol was associated with a higher recurrence-free survival rate after breast surgery, but could not reduce recurrence or the overall survival rate. A recent large multicentre RCT (n = 2108) from 13 hospital (from Argentina, Austria, China, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, the USA, et al) showed that propofol/paravertebral anaesthesia could not reduce long-term recurrence compared with sevoflurane/opioid anaesthesia in breast cancer surgery, but some retrospective studies showed the advantage of propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia over inhalational anaesthesia in reducing long-term recurrence and metastasis. Different populations have variations of sensitivities to propofol and volatile anesthetics, which is probably due to genetic differences and differences in lifestyle. The inconsistency between the results on long-term survival from our meta-analysis and from the previous retrospective studies might be, the populations in our meta-analysis are from China and South Korea, and the sample size is relatively small, so that the results from our meta-analysis are too low to say anything about the long-term outcome. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a large and international multicentre RCT to verify the potential protective effect of propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia on long-term prognosis.

There are some limitations in this meta-analysis. First, few studies reported postoperative analgesic consumption, and it was difficult to pool the related results for the comparison between propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia and inhalational anaesthesia. Second, only 3 RCTs compared long-term outcomes;, the patients were from eastern Asian countries, the sample size was small, and the follow-up time was relatively short. Third, heterogeneity existed in some of the results, so biases cannot be ignored in the meta-analysis. Forth, most of the included RCTs were conducted in Asian countries, as different populations are differently sensitive to propofol and volatile anesthetics, probably modified by both genetic differences and differences in lifestyle, so that the results might not be generalizable. More multinational RCTs need to be done in the near future.

### Association between propofol dose and 1-year mortality in patients with or without a diagnosis of solid cancer [^114mKDtP]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical data suggest suppression of cancer proliferation by propofol, and retrospective studies suggest improved survival after cancer surgery with propofol-based anaesthesia.

Methods

To determine whether propofol dose administered for anaesthesia is associated with 1-yr mortality in patients with and without a diagnosis of solid cancer, we analysed adult patients undergoing monitored anaesthesia care or general anaesthesia at two academic medical centres in Boston, MA, USA. Logistic regression with interaction term analysis was applied with propofol dose (mg kg -1) as primary and diagnosis of solid cancer as co-primary exposure, and 1-yr mortality as the primary outcome.

Results

Of 280 081 patient cases, 10 744 (3.8%) died within 1 yr. Increasing propofol dose was associated with reduced odds of 1-yr mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.93 per 10 mg kg -1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89–0.98; absolute risk reduction fifth vs first quintile 0.5%; 95% CI: 0.2–0.7). This association was modified by a diagnosis of solid cancer (P < 0.001 for interaction). Increasing propofol dose was associated with reduced odds of 1-yr mortality in patients without solid cancer (aOR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71–0.85), but not in patients with solid cancer (0.99; 0.94–1.04), a finding that was replicated when examining 5-yr mortality.

Conclusions

Increasing propofol dose is associated with lower 1-yr mortality in patients without, but not in patients with, a diagnosis of solid cancer. We found evidence for competing effects, modifying the association between propofol dose and mortality.

### Anesthesia and long-term oncological outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113tXPz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether propofol elicits a survival benefit over volatile anesthetics during cancer surgery remains inconclusive. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the effects of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with any volatile anesthesia on long-term oncological outcomes. The secondary aim is to compare propofol-based TIVA with specific volatile agents on long-term oncological outcomes.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception through March 3, 2020. Randomized control trials and observational studies that compared the effects of propofol-based TIVA and volatile anesthesia on long-term oncological outcomes, which also reported hazard ratios (HR) as effect estimates, were considered eligible for inclusion. Using the inverse variance method with a random-effects model, HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Trial sequential analysis was incorporated to test if the results were subject to a type I or type II error.

Results

Nineteen retrospective observational studies were included. Patients who received propofol-based TIVA during cancer surgery were associated with significantly better overall survival than those who received volatile anesthesia (HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.66–0.94, P = 0.008, I2 = 82%). In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed in recurrence-free survival between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and volatile anesthesia during cancer surgery (HR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.61–1.07, P = 0.137, I2 = 85%). In the subgroup analysis by different volatile anesthetics, patients who received propofol-based TIVA were associated with better overall survival than those who received desflurane (HR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.36–0.80, P = 0.003, I2 = 80%). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received sevoflurane (HR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.74–1.14, P = 0.439, I2 = 70%). In the trial sequential analysis of overall survival, the cumulative Z curve reached the required heterogeneity-adjusted information size and crossed the traditional significance boundary. In contrast, in the trial sequential analysis of recurrence-free survival, the cumulative Z curve did not cross the traditional significance boundary. However, the required heterogeneity-adjusted information size has not yet been reached.

Conclusions

Propofol-based TIVA is generally associated with better overall survival than volatile anesthesia during cancer surgery. Further large-scaled, high-quality randomized control trials are warranted to confirm our findings.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofol after continuous infusion in elderly patients [^11682JYH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Propofol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, is a classic intravenous anesthetic that is characterized by a quick onset, rapid systemic clearance and small individual variations in the required dose. It is widely used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and for sedation in ICU or gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, it is encumbered with disadvantages such as respiratory depression, hemodynamic disorders, cardiac inhibition and injection pain.

A new intravenous anesthetic, ciprofol (HSK3486; Haisco Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd, Chengdu, China), was developed to avoid the adverse effects of propofol. Ciprofol is similar to propofol in chemical structure (Fig. 1) but with single R-configured diastereoisomers. Ciprofol exhibits stronger binding to the GABA A receptor, elicits a greater enhancement of GABA A receptor-mediated neuronal currents in vitro and reduces the pain of injection compared to propofol. Additionally, ciprofol is also characterized by rapid induction and elimination and has been shown to be safe for anesthesia induction, maintenance, and sedation among ICU patients.

Fig. 1
Structures of ciprofol and propofol

An increasing number of older patients require anesthesia and surgery in China. Older patients are frail and have decreased tolerance to anesthesia and surgery, and increased risks for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, ensuring the quality and safety of anesthesia in elderly patients is particularly important, ideally via the development of individualized anesthesia plans with an emphasis on ensuring hemodynamic stability and selecting an appropriate general anesthesia protocol. To date, clinical research on ciprofol in elderly patients has focused on the efficacy, safety and dose of anesthesia induction. However, there are few studies on continuous drug infusion, especially regarding the pharmacokinetics of continuous ciprofol infusions in elderly patients.

Therefore, in this single-center, randomized controlled study, elderly patients (over 60 years old) who underwent elective surgery for gastrointestinal tumors were recruited to assess the pharmacokinetics after continuous infusions of ciprofol in elderly patients in China. We evaluated the safety of ciprofol during the induction and maintenance period. The secondary objective was to study the blood concentration of ciprofol and its correlation with the bispectral index (BIS) in elderly patients. This study could provide a basis for the application of ciprofol in elderly patients.

### Impact of general anaesthesia on breast cancer survival: a 5-year follow up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, the CAN-study, comparing propofol and sevoflurane [^116P5ACo]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We hypothesised, that propofol-based general anaesthesia would improve outcome by five percentage-points compared with sevoflurane. This difference was found in our first retrospective study (breast- and colo-rectal cancer), albeit the P-value for the Hazard Ratio for sevoflurane vs propofol was 0.051 after adjustments for uneven distribution of confounders and effect modifiers. We calculated the statistical power from the retrospective study and national Swedish breast cancer survival data. With 1650 patients in the breast cancer cohort, 80% power was obtained to detect a survival difference of five percentage points with a P-value of less than 0.05. Adding an additional 114 patients (7%) provided a reasonable safety margin for patient loss or technical failures.

The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population included all eligible breast cancer patients between December 3, 2013, and September 29, 2017, that were not excluded due to exclusion criteria or lost to follow up. The per-protocol (PP) population included only the patients from the ITT population who received the allocated intervention in each arm, respectively.

Demographic and postoperative data were evaluated by descriptive methods, and all variables are presented as aggregated data. Categorical variables are summarised in frequency tables (presenting frequencies and proportions) by type of anaesthesia. The quantitative variables are summarised by number of observations, median, inter-quartile ranges (IQR) by anaesthesia. A separate summary is presented for patients undergoing one or more procedures in general anaesthesia in addition to the study procedure, as well as pooled summaries. Overall survival is presented as Kaplan-Meier curves and hazard ratios based on univariable Cox regression analyses for overall deaths. In addition, univariable Cox regression models were estimated for pre-specified subgroups (see Table S1 and Figs. S3–S6), but no formal testing for effect modifications was performed. Overall survival was defined from index date to death due to any causes or end of follow up. In addition, for the Swedish subjects, cause-specific survival was calculated as the time from index date to death due to breast cancer, in where death due to other causes than breast cancer was considered as censored observations. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant and the hypothesis testing was 2-sided. The statistical analysis was carried out using R version 4.2.1. (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Vienna, Austria).

### Reply to "Propofol and survival: an updated meta ‑ analysis of randomized clinical trials" [^112HecLG]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The variable of time becomes vital all the time that patients with different follow-up periods are being included in the same pool for an effect analysis. A common methodological error is missing different times of follow-up for the calculation of the development of an outcome in a longitudinal fashion. This is the rationale behind using time-to event analyses. In the circumstances in which the time-periods are similar, an assumption of equality can be made, and RRs or ORs can be used. But as in the comparative groups, a median follow-up, and the ranges of follow-up were not stated. Mortality is a variable dependent and affected by time. It lacks all clinical significance attributing a negative mortality effect to a drug without knowing after how much time this effect will be seen.

Currently, a vital part of the results should be in the different scenario of the patients, and this cannot be determined with the results obtained by the meta-analysis. There are certain scenarios in which propofol has been seen to be superior to other agents. The work of Shehabi et al. in 2023 carried out in adults less than 65 years, sedation with a combination of propofol with dexmedetomidine revealed that the incremental dose of propofol was associated with a decreased mortality, while those with dexmedetomidine had an increased mortality 90 days. Based on this, the time hypothesis arises, the variability of the outcomes between studies, the fact of taking too short and/or too long times can alter the interpretation in relation to the main outcome. This study showed a faster induction and movement of the lower body and the patient by achieving a higher recovery area score compared to dexmedetomidine, the importance of this work lies in the fact that it took into account the perspective of patients in sedation of short stay, a rarely explored outcome. Finally, in terms of mortality, Schaefer et al. conducted a study in more than 200,000 patients where increasing propofol dose was associated with reduced odds of 1-year mortality in patients without solid cancer (aOR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71–0.85), it seems that the clinical scenario given by the clinical characteristics of the patient and the propofol dose can play a determining role in terms of outcome.

While this meta-analysis provided valuable insights into the use of propofol, it is important for future studies to address these limitations. The inclusion of specific control groups and the reporting of in RCTs and reporting the different follow-up periods, are crucial to ensure that the findings are accurate and reliable.

### Propofol compared with sevoflurane general anaesthesia is associated with decreased delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults [^112ZReQb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of general anaesthetics may affect postoperative cognitive outcomes. This study was designed to compare the potential impact of propofol-based vs sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia on the development of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults early after major cancer surgery.

Methods

Older adults (aged ≥ 65 and < 90 yr) who were scheduled to undergo major cancer surgery (≥ 2 h) were randomised to receive either propofol- or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Cognitive function was assessed before and 1 week after surgery with a battery of neuropsychological tests. Age- and education-matched non-surgical controls were recruited, and their cognitive functions were tested at comparable time intervals in order to adjust for learning effects from repeated tests. Delayed neurocognitive recovery was diagnosed according to the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction 1 definition.

Results

From April 1, 2015 to October 15, 2016, 392 patients were enrolled and randomised. Of these patients, 387 completed the intervention and 30-day follow-up, and 379 completed 1-week neuropsychological tests. Fifty-nine control subjects were enrolled and completed repeated neuropsychological tests. The incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery at 1 week was significantly lower in the propofol group [14.8% (28/189)] than in the sevoflurane group [23.2% (44/190); odds ratio = 0.577; 95% confidence interval, 0.342–0.975; P = 0.038]. Safety outcomes did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusions

When compared with sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia, propofol-based general anaesthesia might decrease the incidence of delayed neurocognitive recovery in older adults after major cancer surgery.

### Impact of prognostic nutritional index change on prognosis after colorectal cancer surgery under propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia [^113VA4WJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study conducted the initial investigation into the interplay between PNI change and the choice of anesthesia (propofol or sevoflurane) on the prognosis following CRC surgery. The results indicate that among CRC surgery patients who experienced a substantial reduction in PNI, those who received propofol-based anesthesia demonstrated a reduced risk of disease progression compared to those who received sevoflurane-based anesthesia. These findings offer potential prognostic indicators and suggest a potential anesthesia protocol for CRC surgery. Further prospective cohort studies and well-designed clinical trials are invited to confirmed the findings.

### Effect of propofol on breast cancer cell, the immune system, and patient outcome [^114edzmj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Propofol and clinical trials in breast cancer

Three retrospective studies have compared propofol with volatile anesthetic agents on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery (Table 2). The first study, published in 2014 by Enlund and colleagues, reviewed surgical data from 1837 breast cancer patients with 620 in the propofol group and 1217 in the sevoflurane group. Differences in overall survival rates (propofol vs sevoflurane) for breast cancer were 3% (95% confidence interval, 1 to 4%, p < 0.001) at 1 year, and 2% (− 2 to 6%, non-significant) at 5 years, in favor of propofol. However, the observed differences were eliminated after adjustment for confounders (history of cardiac ischemia was 1.8 times more likely in the sevoflurane group). The second study analyzed 325 patients with 173 in the propofol group and 152 in the sevoflurane group. No difference was observed in the overall 5-year survival rate between two groups, although the propofol group did have a lower rate of cancer recurrence (p = 0.037). The third study collected 2645 cases, which included 2589 in the volatile anesthesia group and 56 in the propofol group. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative recurrence or survival probability. Taken together, these studies suggest that propofol may either improve overall survival rates or lower the rate of cancer recurrence, but the evidence is not overwhelming. It is good to consider the limitations of these studies. First, there is the inherent limitation of retrospective studies in that they do not standardize clinical care and do not randomize patient groups. Therefore, the effects of confounding factors and selection bias cannot be easily eliminated. Second, one of the studies (Lee et al.) had a relative small patient population and another (Kim et al.) had an extremely uneven distribution between the two anesthetic groups.

### Delirium in older patients given propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia for major cancer surgery: a multicentre randomised trial [^112ZGbtq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and disturbing postoperative complication that might be ameliorated by propofol-based anaesthesia. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that there is less delirium after propofol-based than after sevoflurane-based anaesthesia within 7 days of major cancer surgery.

Methods

This multicentre randomised trial was conducted in 14 tertiary care hospitals in China. Patients aged 65–90 yr undergoing major cancer surgery were randomised to either propofol-based anaesthesia or to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium within 7 postoperative days.

Results

A total of 1228 subjects were enrolled and randomised, with 1195 subjects included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mean age 71 yr; 422 [35%] women); one subject died before delirium assessment. Delirium occurred in 8.4% (50/597) of subjects given propofol-based anaesthesia vs 12.4% (74/597) of subjects given sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (relative risk 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.48–0.95]; P = 0.023; adjusted relative risk 0.59 [95% CI: 0.39–0.90]; P = 0.014). Delirium reduction mainly occurred on the first day after surgery, with a prevalence of 5.4% (32/597) with propofol anaesthesia vs 10.7% (64/597) with sevoflurane anaesthesia (relative risk 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33–0.75]; P = 0.001). Secondary endpoints, including ICU admission, postoperative duration of hospitalisation, major complications within 30 days, cognitive function at 30 days and 3 yr, and safety outcomes, did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions

Delirium was a third less common after propofol than sevoflurane anaesthesia in older patients having major cancer surgery. Clinicians might therefore reasonably select propofol-based anaesthesia in patients at high risk of postoperative delirium.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115F3u57]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the comparison between volatile agents and total intravenous anesthetics has been extensively investigated over the decades, no established evidence in terms of survival exists. The cardioprotective effects of volatile anesthetics were well described, especially in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Possible beneficial survival effects of volatile anesthetics in cardiac surgical settings were suggested in several meta-analyses. Among 252 studies included in our meta-analysis, 172 assessed volatile agents as comparator. The subgroup analysis of studies using volatile agents as comparator found a statistically significant mortality increase in patients randomized to propofol, which contributed to the significant mortality difference in the overall analysis. Of note, the recent largest RCT found no difference in mortality or other organ dysfunction between volatile and total intravenous anesthesia. We hypothesize that the use of propofol in the majority of patients who were randomized to the volatile group blunted the detrimental effect of propofol on survival in this trial. In our meta-analysis, several cardiac surgery trials randomized only intraoperative hypnotic agents and few of them used propofol in the propofol and comparator arms after surgery, which might attenuate mortality increase by propofol in the cardiac surgery subgroup.

Several observational studies and a meta-analysis suggested propofol could increase recurrence-free survival compared to volatile anesthesia in cancer patients. However, the present meta-analysis found an increased mortality risk in the propofol arm among patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (mostly oncologic surgery), even though the difference was not statistically significant. Given that previous evidence was mainly based on non-randomized studies and our analysis includes only randomized trials, the available evidence does not support propofol in cancer surgery while waiting for ongoing large randomized trials.

We did not find a significant mortality difference in the subgroup analysis of ICU studies only. There are several possible explanations for why the detrimental effect of propofol was mitigated in ICU settings (1.7% absolute risk increase and 13% non-significant relative risk increase in mortality in the propofol group). ICU patients are generally heterogeneous in terms of chronic comorbidities and acute pathology that led to their admission to intensive care, and their overall mortality is higher than other populations. These characteristics make it difficult to detect a mortality difference in randomized trials. Propofol is associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation than benzodiazepines, which might result in less ventilator-acquired pneumonia and better clinical outcomes. In recent large randomized studies on propofol in intensive care patients, mortality was a secondary end-point, which might explain a non-significant difference.

### Effect of sevoflurane-based or propofol-based anesthesia on acute kidney injury after surgery for gastric cancer: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis [^111QwC9f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of major abdominal surgery that is associated with adverse patient outcomes including death. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative AKI after gastric cancer surgery, comparing patients who received propofol-based TIVA with those who received sevoflurane-based INHA.

Methods

We analyzed the medical records of all patients aged 19 years or older who underwent radical surgery for primary gastric cancer at the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital between January 2010 and September 2018. After propensity score matching, the incidence of AKI in the first 3 postoperative days was compared between patients who received propofol and those who received sevoflurane.

Results

3533 patients were included in the study. After propensity score matching, 1206 patients were assigned to each group. The logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence of AKI was not different in the two groups before (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, P = 0.731) and after propensity score matching (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.47, P = 0.926). Before propensity score matching, acute kidney injury occurred in 146 sevoflurane and 85 propofol patients. The overall incidence was 6.4% in the sevoflurane group and 6.7% in the propofol group. After propensity score matching, acute kidney injury occurred in 60 sevoflurane and 61 propofol patients. The overall incidence was 5.0% in the sevoflurane group and 5.1% in the propofol group.

Conclusion

In this retrospective study, no significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative AKI after gastrectomy between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received sevoflurane-based INHA in this retrospective study.

### Effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on recovery of gastrointestinal function after abdominal surgery in older adults: a randomized clinical trial [^112pF2WN]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of the intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine on the recovery of gastrointestinal function in older adults. The study's findings demonstrated that dexmedetomidine decreased the time to first flatus and feces compared with saline placebo but did not find any statistically significant difference in postoperative gastrointestinal function as measured by the I-FEED score. Notably, the use of intraoperative dexmedetomidine had no effect on the incidence of delirium in the first 3 postoperative days. However, opioid medication use, pain scores, hospitalization costs, and hospital length of stay were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared with the control group.

Our results are consistent with those of previous studies, in which the intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter time to first flatus than saline placebo. Li et alrandomized 66 patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery to receive dexmedetomidine (a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg infused over 15 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1 μg/kg per hour) or normal saline and found that patients in the dexmedetomidine group had a shorter time to first flatus and lower overall use of sufentanil analgesic medication. In a randomized clinical trial examining laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer, Chen et alalso found that intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine (a loading dose of 1 μg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3 μg/kg per hour) was associated with reductions in time to first flatus, first feces, and return to a regular solid diet. However, several studies have reported contradictory results. In a study of 20 healthy participants who received 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine over 20 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 0.7 μg/kg per hour for 190 minutes, dexmedetomidine markedly inhibited gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit compared with normal saline. In a study involving critically ill patients, no difference in gastric emptying time was observed after receipt of intraoperative dexmedetomidine vs propofol. Two preclinical studies reported that dexmedetomidine markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of morphine on gastrointestinal transit and substantially inhibited gastrointestinal transit.

### Effects of different depth of anesthesia on perioperative inflammatory reaction and hospital outcomes in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy [^117LnXbL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the effect of different depth of anesthesia on inflammatory factors and hospital outcomes in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, in order to select an appropriate depth of anesthesia to improve the prognosis of patients undergoing surgery and improve the quality of life of patients.

Methods

A total of 80 elderly patients aged 65 and above who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in our hospital were by convenience sampling and randomly divided into two groups: 55 groups (group H) and 45 groups (group L), 40 cases in each group. The depth of anesthesia was maintained using a closed-loop target-controlled infusion system: the EEG bispectral index was set to 55 in the H group and 45 in the L group. Venous blood samples were collected 2 h (T2), 24 h (T3) and 72 h (T4) after the start of surgery. The intraoperative dosage of propofol and remifentanil, operation duration, postoperative PACU stay time, intraoperative consciousness occurrence, postoperative hospital stay and postoperative pulmonary inflammatory events were recorded.

Results

The patient characteristic of the two groups had no statistical difference and were comparable (P > 0.05). The intraoperative dosage of propofol in group H was lower than that in group L (P < 0.05). Compared with the L group, the plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in the H group were significantly increased at T2 (P < 0.05), and the plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly increased at T4 (P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in both groups at T2, T3 and T4 than at T1, while at T4, the concentration of TNF-α in group H was higher than at T1 (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

When the BIS value of the depth of anesthesia is 45, the perioperative release of inflammatory factors in elderly patients with laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer is less than BIS 55, and does not affect the prognosis.

### Effect of etomidate vs propofol for total intravenous anesthesia on major postoperative complications in older patients: a randomized clinical trial [^113kmPtx]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

At the end of surgery, infusion of etomidate or propofol was discontinued. Patients were called by their name, and the time to response to verbal command was recorded. Sufentanil was used for patient-controlled analgesia. At 6 hours after surgery, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was scored using the World Health Organization scale, and patients were asked to report pain using a visual analog scale.

Patients were followed up every morning until discharge to identify any complications and PONV and visual analog scale pain scores for the preceding 24 hours. On the day after surgery, patients were asked to rate on a 1-to-10 scale their comfort (1 indicated very uncomfortable, and 10 indicated very comfortable) and satisfaction with anesthesia (1 indicated very unsatisfactory, and 10 indicated very satisfactory). At 5 centers, venous blood samples were collected at 7on the day of surgery, at the end of anesthesia, and at 7on postoperative days 1 and 3. Serum cortisol, aldosterone, and corticotropin (formerly adrenocorticotropic hormone) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Mortality was followed up by telephone contact with patients at postoperative months 6 and 12.

End Points and Sample Size Calculation and Power

The primary end point was a composite of major in-hospital postoperative complications, as defined in the eMethods in Supplement 2, during the hospital stay. Secondary end points included time to response to verbal command and time to extubation; time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit; patient self-reported pain as well as comfort and satisfaction with anesthesia; hypertension and hypotension incidence; PONV scores; serum concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone, and corticotropin at the end of anesthesia and at 7on postoperative days 1 and 3; and all-cause mortality at postoperative months 6 and 12.

The primary objective was to evaluate whether etomidate was noninferior to propofol in terms of the rate of major in-hospital complications after abdominal surgery in older patients. According to a preliminary study, the expected complication incidence was 7.5% in the etomidate group and 8.0% in the propofol group. The Δ was set at 3% based on expert advice. With α = .025 and β = 0.2, the number needed to demonstrate noninferiority was 917 patients per group (total sample size: 1834). Assuming a 5% ineligibility rate, 1930 patients were required to undergo screening.

### Volatile anaesthesia and peri-operative outcomes related to cancer: a feasibility and pilot study for a large randomised control trial [^111YVyP5]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Published data suggest that the type of general anaesthesia used during surgical resection for cancer may impact on patient long-term outcome. However, robust prospective clinical evidence is essential to guide a change in clinical practice. We explored the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to investigate the impact of total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol vs. inhalational volatile anaesthesia on postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We undertook a randomised, double-blind feasibility and pilot study of propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia during cancer resection surgery at three tertiary hospitals in Australia and the USA. Patients were randomly allocated to receive propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia. Primary outcomes for this study were successful recruitment to the study and successful delivery of the assigned anaesthetic treatment as per randomisation arm. Of the 217 eligible patients approached, 146 were recruited, a recruitment rate of 67.3% (95%CI 60.6–73.5%). One hundred and forty-five patients adhered to the randomised treatment arm, 99.3% (95%CI 96.2–100%). Intra-operative patient characteristics and postoperative complications were comparable between the two intervention groups. This feasibility and pilot study supports the viability of the protocol for a large, randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of anaesthesia technique on postoperative cancer outcomes. The volatile anaesthesia and peri-operative outcomes related to cancer (VAPOR-C) study that is planned to follow this feasibility study is an international, multicentre trial with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for the anaesthetic management of patients undergoing major cancer surgery.

### Effects of propofol / remifentanil-based total intravenous anesthesia versus sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia on the release of VEGF-C and TGF-β and prognosis after breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized and controlled study [^114JsAFF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study was a prospective, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial with equal randomization and was performed at Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Ethic approval was obtained from Ethic Committee of Cancer Hospital (approval number: NCC2013YZ-06). The study was registered atregistry system on 20 August 2018 (ChiCTR1800017910). The enrollment started from January 2016 and ended at August 2016. The follow-up was completed at June 2018.

Participants

After taking written informed consent, adult female patients aged 18 to 80 years, ASA physical status Iand II, undergoing MRM or BCS for confirmed breast cancer were enrolled in the study. MRM was defined as mastectomy and axillary clearance. BCS was referred to wide local excision of breast tissue and axillary nodes sampling/clearance. Exclusion criteria included age younger than 18 or older than 80 years old; previous breast cancer surgery (except tumor biopsy); bilateral breast surgery; preoperative chemotherapy; contraindication to use of sevoflurane, propofol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Randomization

The patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol/remifentanil -based TIVA (TIVA group) or sevoflurane- based inhalational anesthesia (SEV group). Randomization was done using a sealed envelope system. A physician (Dr. Liu) not involved in the study randomly inserted 50 of each two anesthetic designations to 100 sequentially numbered envelopes. The allocation sequence was generated using a random number generator. The envelop was opened before anesthetic induction by the investigators to determine which anesthetic technique was going to be performed. The non-operational investigator (Dr. BNW) was responsible for taking outcome measurements. Individuals who conducted laboratory assays were kept blinded to allocation.

### Which anesthesia regimen is best to reduce pulmonary complications after head and neck surgery? [^1158NChL]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The differences between intravenous and inhalation anesthesia in clinical postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) have been studied in cardiac and lung resection surgery. Clinical evidence for the effects of these two anesthetics on PPCs in other types of surgery is still missing. We aimed to assess the impact of sevoflurane and propofol on the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer.

Study Design

Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

We assigned 220 adults at intermediate-to-high risk of PPCs scheduled for head and neck cancer surgery with radial forearm or fibular flap reconstruction to either propofol or sevoflurane as a general anesthetic. The occurrence of pulmonary complications according to the Clavien-Dindo score was defined as the primary (within 7days after surgery) outcome.

Results

The PPC incidence during 7days after surgery was 32.4% and 18.2% in the propofol and sevoflurane groups, respectively (P = 0.027). The corresponding incidence of PPCs in patients who underwent tracheotomy at the end of surgery in the two groups was 44.8% and 24.5%, respectively (P = 0.030). In addition, the Clavien-Dindo classification showed significant differences between groups in minor complications (grades I and II) but not in major complications (grades III-V).

Conclusions

Compared with intravenous anesthesia, the administration of sevoflurane reduces the incidence of minor PPCs (grades I and II) in moderate- and high-risk patients who have undergone tracheotomy after head and neck cancer surgery with radial forearm or fibular flap reconstruction.

### Effect of etomidate vs propofol for total intravenous anesthesia on major postoperative complications in older patients: a randomized clinical trial [^112B4wWb]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Major postoperative complications contribute to adverse outcomes and high resource use in older patients. Etomidate and propofol are widely used general anesthetics. Although etomidate may be advantageous for induction of anesthesia in patients at high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality because of its hemodynamic stability, concerns regarding relative adrenal insufficiency and its potential impact on outcomes may lead many anesthesiologists and anesthesia practitioners to instead favor propofol in this setting. However, there is limited evidence regarding outcomes of etomidate in high-risk patients, especially when used for anesthesia maintenance.

In patients with trauma, patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and even patients with critical illness, single-dose etomidate for induction of anesthesia showed no difference in mortality compared with other agents, whereas the influence of etomidate on morbidity, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, remains controversial. Furthermore, because most studies have focused on bolus administration of etomidate for anesthesia induction, there is a lack of data on the effects of continuous infusion of etomidate for anesthesia maintenance on hemodynamics, adrenocortical suppression, and clinical outcomes.

We conducted the randomized clinical trial EPIC (Etomidate vs Propofol for In-hospital Complications) to test the primary hypothesis that etomidate for induction and maintenance of anesthesia does not increase in-hospital morbidity after abdominal surgery in older patients compared with propofol. We also compared mortality rates with etomidate vs propofol at 6 and 12 months after surgery.

### Impact of general anaesthesia on breast cancer survival: a 5-year follow up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, the CAN-study, comparing propofol and sevoflurane [^114Zz8vw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaesthesia may impact long-term cancer survival. In the Cancer and Anaesthesia study, we hypothesised that the hypnotic drug propofol will have an advantage of at least five percentage points in five-year survival over the inhalational anaesthetic sevoflurane for breast cancer surgery.

Methods

From 2118 eligible breast cancer patients scheduled for primary curable, invasive breast cancer surgery, 1764 were recruited after ethical approval and individual informed consent to this open label, single-blind, randomised trial at four county- and three university hospitals in Sweden and one Chinese university hospital. Of surveyed patients, 354 were excluded, mainly due to refusal to participate. Patients were randomised by computer at the monitoring organisation to general anaesthesia maintenance with either intravenous propofol or inhaled sevoflurane in a 1:1 ratio in permuted blocks. Data related to anaesthesia, surgery, oncology, and demographics were registered. The primary endpoint was five-year overall survival. Data are presented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Hazard Ratios based on Cox univariable regression analyses by both intention-to-treat and per-protocol. EudraCT, 2013–002380–25 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01975064.

Findings

Of 1764 patients, included from December 3, 2013, to September 29, 2017, 1670 remained for analysis. The numbers who survived at least five years were 773/841 (91.9% (95% CI 90.1–93.8)) in the propofol group and 764/829 (92.2% (90.3–94.0)) in the sevoflurane group, (HR 1.03 (0.73–1.44); P = 0.875); the corresponding results in the per-protocol-analysis were: 733/798 (91.9% (90.0–93.8)) and 653/710 (92.0% (90.0–94.0)) (HR = 1.01 (0.71–1.44); P = 0.955). Survival after a median follow-up of 76.7 months did not indicate any difference between the groups (HR 0.97, 0.72–1.29; P = 0.829, log rank test).

Interpretation

No difference in overall survival was found between general anaesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane for breast cancer surgery.

### Effect of total intravenous anesthesia on postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing microvascular reconstruction for head and neck cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^116Smp7m]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Free flap surgery is a lengthy procedure with massive tissue destruction and reconstruction, which makes postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) a noticeable issue among patients with head and neck cancer. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) has better survival outcomes than inhalational anesthesia (INH) in several types of cancer surgery. A previous retrospective study found that patients in the TIVA group had a lower PPC rate, which may be correlated with a lower intraoperative fluid requirement. We hypothesize that the protective effect remains among patients undergoing free flap surgery for head and neck cancer in a prospective and goal-directed fluid therapy setting.

Objective

To assess the effect of TIVA vs INH on PPCs in patients undergoing microvascular reconstruction for head and neck cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, 2-arm, randomized clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Taiwan; a total of 78 patients 18 years and older with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification 1 to 3 who were scheduled for elective free flap surgery under general anesthesia were included. The trial started in October 2017, completed in October 2019, and finished analysis in January 2022.

Interventions

Patients were enrolled and randomized to the TIVA or INH group. All patients received goal-directed fluid therapy and hemodynamic management if they had a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 75 mm Hg or a reduction of 10% from baseline MAP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of PPCs. The secondary outcomes were the differences in intraoperative hemodynamic values (mean arterial pressure, MAP; cardiac index, CI; systemic vascular resistance index, SVRI; and stroke volume variation, SVV).

Results

A total of 70 patients (65 men [93%]; 5 women [7%]) completed the trial; median (IQR) age was 52.0 (48–59) years in the TIVA group and 57.0 (46–64) years in the INH group. The demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, except that patients in the TIVA group had a slightly lower body mass index. Patients in the TIVA group had a lower risk of developing PPCs (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.08–0.80). The TIVA group had significantly higher MAP, lower CI, and higher SVRI than the INH group after the third hour of monitoring. The TIVA group showed a relatively stable hourly MAP, CI, SVRI, and SVV across time points, while the INH group showed a more varying pattern. The generalized estimating equation showed no clinical differences in the trend of hemodynamic parameters across time between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, using propofol-based TIVA reduced the incidence of PPCs in free flap surgery. This finding may be related to more stable hemodynamic manifestations and a lower total balance of fluid throughout the surgery.

### On the horns of a dilemma: choosing total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile anaesthesia for cancer surgery, an enduring controversy [^1153RZfV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Two methods for administering general anaesthesia are widely used: propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (propofol-TIVA) and inhalation volatile agent-based anaesthesia. Both modalities, which have been standards of care for several decades, boast a robust safety profile. Nevertheless, the potential differential effects of these anaesthetic techniques on immediate, intermediate, and extended postoperative outcomes remain a subject of inquiry. We discuss a recently published longitudinal analysis stemming from a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing sevoflurane-based inhalation anaesthesia with propofol-TIVA in older patients with cancer, which showed a reduced incidence of emergence and postoperative delirium, comparable postoperative complication rates within 30 days after surgery, and comparable long-term survival rates. We undertake an assessment of the trial's methodological strengths and limitations, contextualise its results within the broader scientific evidence, and explore avenues for resolving the extant controversies in anaesthetic choice for cancer surgery. We aim to pave the way for the incorporation of precision medicine paradigms into the evolving landscape of perioperative care for patients with cancer.

### Comparison of outcomes after breast cancer surgery between inhalational and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117VE67a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0 software (STATA, College Station). The effect size for continuous data was expressed as the standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The effect size for dichotomous outcomes was expressed as the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. The χ 2 test and the I 2 value were used to determine the level of heterogeneity; in the case of heterogeneity (P < 0.1 or I 2 ≥ 50%), a random effect model was used, and subgroup analysis was performed whenever possible to identify the sources of heterogeneity and to test the robustness of uncertainty. In the case of homogeneity (P ≥ 0.1 or I 2 < 50%), a fixed effect model was used. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test, and there was no significant publication bias if P > 0.05.

Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted using TSA0.9.5.5 Beta software; the required information size (RIS) was estimated using 0.05 for type 1 error, 0.20 for type 2 error, and the relative risk reduction from the control group event rate in low-bias-risk trials included in the meta-analysis. The TSA can be interpreted by viewing the boundaries and assessing whether the cumulative meta-analysis has crossed them.

### The effects of esketamine on postoperative delirium in older patients with fragile brain function during the non-acute phase following lung cancer surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^111QQn18]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Esketamine has been used in the prevention of postoperative neurocognitive disorders in trauma surgery, gastrointestinal surgery and other fields due to its significant anti-inflammatory effect. However, its effect on postoperative delirium (POD) in older patients with fragile brain function after lung cancer remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of low-dose esketamine on POD in older patients with fragile brain function following lung cancer surgery during the perioperative period.

Methods

One hundred and eight older patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical lung cancer surgery were randomly assigned to the control group or the esketamine group. All patients received standardized anesthesia without pre-anesthesia medication. Esketamine group received esketamine 0.25 mg/kg during anesthesia induction and esketamine 0.1 mg/kg/h during anesthesia maintenance for 30 min. Control group received an equal volume of normal saline during both induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used to evaluate the incidence(%) of POD at 24 h and 72 h post-surgery. Serum concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and calcium-binding protein β(S100β)(mean ± SD) were measured intravenously before and one day after surgery to assess inflammation. Additionally, intraoperative dosages of propofol, sufentanil, and remifentani(mean ± SD)were recorded, along with postoperative extubation time, SpO 2 after extubation (mean ± SD), incidence (%) of vertigo, remedial analgesia, rates of nausea and vomiting, duration of recovery room stay, and total hospital stay (mean ± SD).

Results

Compared with the control group, the incidence of POD was significantly lower in the esketamine group at 24 h post-operation (3.8% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.046), but no difference at 72 h post-operation (0% vs. 7.5%, P = 0.126). No significant difference in serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β was observed between the two groups on the day before surgery (P > 0.05). However, one day post-operation serum concentration of IL-6 and S100β in the esketamine group were significantly lower than those in the control group (5.14 ± 1.70 vs. 6.03 ± 2.13, P = 0.019;380.08 ± 204.01 vs. 479.32 ± 213.07, P = 0.016). The consumption of sufentanil in the esketamine group was lower than those in the control group (28.06 ± 3.76 vs. 29.85 ± 4.21, P = 0.023). Extubation time, the rate of remedial analgesia, and recovery room stay duration were shorter in the esketamine group compared to the control group(27.08 ± 8.46 vs. 30.4. ± 7.72, P = 0.035; 5.7% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.038; 58.96 ± 16.98 vs. 65.83 ± 15.31, P = 0.031). After extubation, SpO 2 levels were higher in the esketamine group (98.02 ± 1.65 vs. 97.21 ± 1.56, P = 0.011), and total hospital stay was shorter than in the control group (8.75 ± 2.83 vs. 11 ± 5.96, P = 0.015). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative dizziness, nausea, and vomiting between the two groups.

Conclusion

Esketamine may reduce the incidence of early postoperative delirium in older patients with fragile brain function undergoing lung cancer surgery during the non-acute phase, appear to inhibit inflammation levels, and be associated with shortening postoperative recovery time.

### Recurrence of breast cancer after regional or general anaesthesia: a randomised controlled trial [^115X28eL]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia was published by Daniel I Sessler and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the trial question was: what is the role of regional anesthesia-analgesia in breast cancer recurrence after potentially curative surgery? In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the population was: 2132 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women aged < 85 years having potentially curative primary breast cancer resections. The key exclusion criteria were previous surgery for breast cancer (except diagnostic biopsies), inflammatory breast cancer, scheduled free-flap reconstruction, contraindications to either anesthetic approach or analgesic, or other cancer not in long-term remission. In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the interventions were: n = 1043 regional anesthesia-analgesia (paravertebral blocks and propofol) n = 1065 general anesthesia (sevoflurane and opioid analgesia). In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in local or metastatic breast cancer recurrence (10% vs. 10%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28). In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in incisional pain at 6 months and 12 months (52% vs. 52%; aOR 1, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17). In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in QoL as assessed by scores on SF-12, death. significant difference in postoperative nausea (8% vs. 20%). In the Breast cancer recurrence after regional vs. general anesthesia study, the conclusion was: in women aged < 85 years having potentially curative primary breast cancer resections, regional anesthesia-analgesia was not superior to general anesthesia with respect to local or metastatic breast cancer recurrence.

### Cancer surgery: how may anesthesia influence outcome? [^113eVvDW]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published literature regarding the effects of anesthesia on cancer surgery to prevent tumor cell proliferation/migration or induce apoptosis.

Background

Surgery is the main treatment for potentially curable solid tumors, but most cancer-related deaths in patients who have received previous surgical treatment are caused by metastatic disease. There is increasing evidence that anesthetic technique has the potential to affect long-term outcome after cancer surgery.

Methods

This work reviews the English published literature that was obtained by performing a search of the PubMed database up to January 2014. We selected articles that provided evidence or reviewed the possible actions of anesthetics on cancer cells or the influence of anesthesia in recurrence/outcome.

Results

Inhaled anesthetics induce immunosuppression and activate inflammatory cascade activation, whereas propofol has a protective action. Opioids might promote cancer recurrence and metastasis. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that local anesthetics inhibit proliferation and migration of cancer cells and induce apoptosis.

Conclusions

Anesthesiologists should follow current best clinical practice and include all strategies that effectively decrease pain and attenuate stress. Regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia, adding anti-inflammatory drugs, play an unquestionable role in the control of perioperative pain and may improve recurrence-free survival.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112aFEzj]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We registered the present meta-analysis in the PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42022323143). We used the following PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design) criteria: patients receiving general anesthesia or sedation (P); propofol (I); any comparator drug (C); mortality at the longest follow-up available (O); randomized clinical trials (S). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for completed checklist).

Search strategy and selection criteria

Four researchers independently searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant studies from inception to August 19, 2022. We also searched for abstracts of major congresses within these three years to minimize the risk of missing eligible but not yet published studies. The complete PubMed search strategy we used to identify studies of interest is presented in Additional file 1. All RCTs comparing propofol versus any comparator in any clinical setting were considered eligible. Exclusion criteria were randomized trials with a non-parallel design (i.e. cross-over), overlapping publications, non-human experimental studies, studies where the comparator was loco-regional anesthesia, studies where propofol was used for palliative or end-of-life care, or studies where propofol was used as a single bolus in the intervention arm or during different minor procedures (e.g. gastrointestinal endoscopies, bronchoscopies, painful procedures requiring sedation). No restriction was applied to patient age or language. After removing duplicates, two investigators assessed eligibility at the title/abstract level and downloaded the full text of all potentially relevant articles. In case of disagreement, the final assessment was discussed with two other senior investigators.

### Propofol use in the elderly population: prevalence of overdose and association with 30-day mortality [^115ASsij]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Geriatric patients are more sensitive to the anesthetic effects of propofol and its adverse effects, such as hypotension, than is the general population; thus, a reduced dose (1–1.5 mg/kg) is recommended for the induction of anesthesia. The extent to which clinicians follow established dosing guidelines has not been well described. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of propofol overdose in the elderly population to determine whether propofol overdose occurs and is associated with increased hypotension and 30-day mortality.

Methods

In this retrospective study in patients who received propofol for the induction of general anesthesia, data on demographic characteristics, preoperative medications, intraoperative management, and 30-day mortality were collected. The dose of propofol used for the induction of anesthesia and the median blood pressure in the pre- and immediate postinduction periods were determined. Hypotension was defined as either: (1) a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of > 40% concurrent with a MAP of < 70 mm Hg; or (2) a MAP of < 60 mm Hg.

Findings

A total of 17,540 patients were included in the analysis; 4033 (23.0%) were aged > 65 years. The median (interquartile range) propofol dose in the group aged > 65 years was 1.8 (1.4–2.2) mg/kg, above the recommended dose, in comparison to 2.2 (1.9–2.5) mg/kg in younger patients. On multivariate analysis, increased propofol dose was associated with increased postinduction hypotension, especially in patients over 70 years of age, but not 30-day mortality.

Implications

Older patients received greater-than-recommended doses of propofol for induction, which may have led to significant dose-dependent hypotension. Despite this finding, the dose of propofol for induction was not independently associated with a greater 30-day mortality rate. More education regarding geriatric concerns is needed for encouraging anesthesiologists to tailor the plan for anesthesia in geriatric patients. However, overall postsurgical mortality is a function of preoperative risk and type surgical procedure.

### Comparison of outcomes after breast cancer surgery between inhalational and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rfxHs]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy and is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women. Surgical excision is the principle treatment, but surgery-induced stress, anaesthetics, and opioids are factors that adversely influence postoperative recovery and anti-cancer immunity.

General anaesthesia is the main technique for breast surgery, and it includes propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia and inhalational anaesthesia. It was shown that propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia was associated with lower postoperative pain intensity and analgesic consumption in abdominal, orthopaedic, gynaecological surgeries as well as neurosurgery in one meta-analysis, but the relationship between propofol and inhalational anaesthetics with postoperative pain outcomes in breast cancer surgery is unclear, and the results are conflicting according to previous studies. Acute postoperative pain, if not managed properly, can prolong the hospital stay, increase healthcare costs, delay recovery and even lead to chronic pain after breast surgery. Opioids are essential during breast surgery and provide analgesia for postoperative pain when necessary, but perioperative opioids can cause many side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pruritus and constipation; can inhibit cell-mediated immunity; and can exert potential adverse effects on long-term prognosis. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to elucidate how propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia and inhalational anaesthesia affect postoperative pain outcomes and opioid consumption in breast cancer surgery.

It is known from basic studies that inhalational anaesthetics induce immunosuppression and promote cancer progression and metastasis, but propofol can not. It seems that propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia has an advantage over inhalational anaesthesia in the preservation of cell-mediated immunity and long-term prognosis in cancer patients. Some recent retrospective observational studies showed that there were no differences between the two anaesthesia methods in recurrence or recurrence-free survival in breast cancer.

Thus, in this study, we conducted a meta-analysis, pooled the related results from prospective randomized controlled trials, and tried to determine the relationship between short- and long-term outcomes with propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia and inhalational anaesthesia in breast cancer surgery.

### Impact of prognostic nutritional index change on prognosis after colorectal cancer surgery under propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia [^116icf86]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

This retrospective cohort study received approval from the Ethical Review Committees of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. The investigation was conducted in compliance with the ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its subsequent amendments. The medical records of all patients who underwent CRC surgery at the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between January 2016 and December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed.

All patients underwent radical resection in accordance with the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for CRC established by the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) in 2018. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) patients aged 18 years or older, (2) patients who underwent curative-intent pancreatic resection, (3) patients with comprehensive clinical examination and histopathologically confirmed results, (4) patients who experienced satisfactory postoperative recovery and were discharged, and (5) patients who could be followed up for a minimum of 3 months. A total of 755 CRC patients who had undergone radical surgery for CRC were initially identified through the electronic medical record system.

However, several patients were subsequently excluded for the following reasons: (1) patients who received both propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 117), (2) patients with coexisting major diseases (e.g. heart diseases and other cancers) (n = 64), (3) patients with incomplete baseline information (n = 30), (4) patients who underwent multiple operations during the study period (n = 29), (5) patients with incomplete resection (n = 12), and (6) patients lost to follow-up (n = 89). Ultimately, a total of 414 CRC patients were included in the analysis. The flowchart depicting the patient selection process is presented in Fig. 1.

### Anesthetics and long-term survival after cancer surgery-total intravenous versus volatile anesthesia: a retrospective study [^112XN53y]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, there was no effect of TIVA or VIA on the survival rate of the overall population of patients undergoing surgery for the five major types of cancer. There was no significant association between the type of anesthetic used and prognosis following cancer surgery.

Each anesthetic has a unique effect on immune regulation and cancer growth factor production. It has been reported that propofol exhibits better immunomodulatory properties than volatile anesthetics. Some studies have shown that survival rates after cancer surgery are better for patients who receive TIVA than for those who receive VIA. After matching, postoperative survival was investigated in 1158 patients with colon cancer; the propofol-treated group had better survival (189 deaths, 32.6%, in the desflurane group vs. 87, 15.0%, in the propofol group). A recent study showed that propofol was associated with better survival after surgery in 670 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. For patients with breast cancer, propofol may reduce the relapse rate within 5 years, but a study of patients in the Korea Cancer Center showed no difference in 5-year survival based on the type of anesthetic used during surgery. A comparison of 3532 patients with breast cancer at Seoul National University Hospital revealed no differences in recurrence-free survival and overall survival, based on the type of anesthetic used during surgery. An analysis of 1794 patients with gastric cancer demonstrated that TIVA was associated with better survival after surgery. Depending on the time of gastric cancer resection surgery, some patients had a long-term survival of 80–90 months. Another study of 1538 patients with gastric cancer found that propofol-based TIVA had no significant effect on 1-year overall survival or cancer-related mortality after surgery, but this could have been related to the short 1-year study period. Finally, a study of 392 patients with non-small cell carcinoma showed no benefit for long-term prognosis when TIVA was used during surgery.

### Anesthesia and circulating tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial [^111QV4XQ]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of anesthetic drugs on cancer outcomes remains unclear. This trial aimed to assess postoperative circulating tumor cell counts-an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer-to determine how anesthesia may indirectly affect prognosis. It was hypothesized that patients receiving sevoflurane would have higher postoperative tumor cell counts.

Methods

The parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two centers in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 to 85 yr without metastases and scheduled for primary breast cancer surgery were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. The patients and outcome assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was circulating tumor cell counts over time, assessed at three time points postoperatively (0, 48, and 72h) by the CellSearch assay. Secondary outcomes included maximal circulating tumor cells value, positivity (cutoff: at least 1 and at least 5 tumor cells/7.5ml blood), and the association between natural killer cell activity and tumor cell counts. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02005770).

Results

Between March 2014 and April 2018, 210 participants were enrolled, assigned to sevoflurane (n = 107) or propofol (n = 103) anesthesia, and eventually included in the analysis. Anesthesia type did not affect circulating tumor cell counts over time (median circulating tumor cell count [interquartile range]; for propofol: 1 [0 to 4] at 0h, 1 [0 to 2] at 48h, and 0 [0 to 1] at 72h; and for sevoflurane: 1 [0 to 4] at 0h, 0 [0 to 2] at 48h, and 1 [0 to 2] at 72h; rate ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.95 to 1.71]; P = 0.103) or positivity. In one secondary analysis, administrating sevoflurane led to a significant increase in maximal tumor cell counts postoperatively. There was no association between natural killer cell activity and circulating tumor cell counts.

Conclusions

In this randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of anesthesia on an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer, there was no difference between sevoflurane and propofol with respect to circulating tumor cell counts over time.

### Review article: the role of the perioperative period in recurrence after cancer surgery [^114696QX]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

A wealth of basic science data supports the hypothesis that the surgical stress response increases the likelihood of cancer dissemination and metastasis during and after cancer surgery. Anesthetic management of the cancer patient, therefore, could potentially influence long-term outcome. Preclinical data suggest that beneficial approaches might include selection of induction drugs such as propofol, minimizing the use of volatile anesthetics, and coadministration of cyclooxygenase antagonists with systemic opioids. Retrospective clinical trials suggest that the addition of regional anesthesia might decrease recurrence after cancer surgery. Other factors such as blood transfusion, temperature regulation, and statin administration may also affect long-term outcome.

### Impact of prognostic nutritional index change on prognosis after colorectal cancer surgery under propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia [^112NpjYY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the Global Cancer Statistics 2020 report published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC) has emerged as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality and the third most prevalent cancer worldwide. It is estimated that over 1.9 million new cases and 935,000 deaths occurred in 2020, accounting for approximately one-tenth of all cancer cases and deaths. Currently, surgical resection stands as the established and primary treatment modality for CRC. Despite significant advancements in surgical and medical techniques, the prognosis for patients with CRC still requires improvement. Apart from surgical techniques, numerous factors preoperatively, intraoperatively, or during the postoperative period have been proposed to be associated with the prognosis of CRC.

Surgical interventions elicit an inflammatory response attributed to tissue damage. Within the perioperative period, various factors, including immune and nutritional status, have been proposed to contribute to a micro-metastatic process, consequently leading to unfavorable long-term oncological outcomes. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which incorporates serum albumin levels and total lymphocyte count in peripheral blood, represents a widely employed metric for evaluating the nutritional and immunological statuses of cancer patients. The alteration in PNI before and after surgery reflects the dynamic changes in patients' immune responses and nutritional statuses. Notably, the baseline prognostic nutritional index and changes in pre-treatment body mass index have been associated with the response to immunotherapy in patients with advanced cancer. However, no studies have investigated the association between preoperative PNI changes and patient outcomes following CRC surgery.

Diverse anesthesia techniques can potentially influence the oncological prognosis by modulating innate and cellular immunity and activating adrenergic-inflammatory pathways. Volatile inhalational agents and intravenous anesthetic agents are commonly employed for anesthesia maintenance during cancer surgeries. It has been proposed that volatile inhalational agents, such as sevoflurane, might enhance cancer cell activity by suppressing immune cell function. Conversely, intravenous anesthetic agents, such as propofol, possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that could potentially mitigate immune suppression. Several studies have compared the overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) of cancer patients undergoing inhalational anesthesia versus total intravenous anesthesia, but the results have been inconclusive. A meta-analysis involving patients undergoing diverse cancer surgeries indicated that total intravenous anesthesia was not associated with improved recurrence-free survival but exhibited improved OS compared to volatile anesthesia. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether these effects could be modified by the inflammatory status.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofol for general anesthesia induction in female patients with frailty: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111BZYE2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol is the most widely used intravenous anesthetic agent for general anesthesia induction because of its rapid action and ease of control. However, it significantly inhibits the cardiovascular system and is usually associated with hypotension during general anesthesia induction. A drop in blood pressure, particularly in older patients with frailty, might limit its clinical application; therefore, alternative drugs are clinically required.

Frailty is a complex and multisystem syndrome characterized by reductions in physiological reserve, which could be assessed by calculating the frailty index according to the "accumulated deficits". Frailty is usually associated with increased risks for perioperative complications, such as stroke, and prolonged postoperative recovery. The intraoperative considerations for frailty management significantly impact the prognosis in patients with frailty undergoing surgery. Compared with robust patients, the maintenance of cardiovascular parameters under general anesthesia may be more challenging in patients with frailty. Applying appropriate general anesthetics that can reduce the challenges posed by frailty is therefore paramount.

Ciprofol is an intravenous anesthetic, recently developed by modifying the chemical structure of propofol, with the aim of keeping the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of propofol but reducing adverse drug reactions. Ciprofol has been approved for sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy, bronchoscopy, intensive care, and for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and has been reported to be non-inferior to propofol in terms of efficacy and safety. Although the incidence of hypotension was not the primary outcome in recent studies that used ciprofol in general anesthesia for gynecologic surgery, it seemed lower in the ciprofol group than in the propofol group, suggesting ciprofol as a potential candidate for hemodynamics maintenance during general anesthesia. The participants were generally robust, and the average age was less than 45 years in both these previous studies; however, the efficacy and safety of ciprofol in patients with frailty remain unknown.

This randomized, double-blind clinical trial recruited patients with frailty undergoing elective general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of ciprofol in general anesthesia induction by comparing the anesthetic effects and adverse events of ciprofol and propofol in a frail population.

### Effect of sevoflurane-based or propofol-based anaesthesia on the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis [^113TJ5Ay]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol may help to protect against ischaemic acute kidney injury (AKI); however, research on this topic is sparse.

Objective

The current study aimed to investigate whether there were differences in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia.

Design

A retrospective observational study.

Setting

A single tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Medical records of patients aged 19 years or older who underwent curative lung resection surgery for nonsmall cell lung cancer between January 2005 and February 2018 were examined.

Main Outcome Measures

After propensity score matching, the incidence of AKI in the first 3 postoperative days was compared between patients who received propofol and those who received sevoflurane. Logistic regression analyses were also used to investigate whether propofol-based TIVA lowered the risk of postoperative AKI.

Results

The analysis included 2872 patients (1477 in the sevoflurane group and 1395 in the propofol group). After propensity score matching, 661 patients were included in each group; 24 (3.6%) of the 661 patients in the sevoflurane group developed AKI compared with 23 (3.5%) of the 661 patients in the propofol group (95% confidence intervals of difference in incidence -0.019 to 0.022, P = 0.882). The logistic regression analyses revealed that the incidence of AKI was not different in the two groups (odds ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.71, P = 0.882).

Conclusion

In this retrospective study, no significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative AKI after lung resection surgery between patients who received propofol-based TIVA and those who received sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia. Considering the methodological limitation of this retrospective study, further studies are required to confirm these results.

### Effect of propofol on breast cancer cell, the immune system, and patient outcome [^113em37V]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide after lung cancer. In 2017, it is estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and 40,610 women will die of breast cancer. More than 90% of women diagnosed with early stage (I or II) breast cancer have mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, and over 70% of women with advanced breast cancer (stage III or IV) have these surgeries. Surgical resection of solid breast tumors is the primary and most effective treatment. However, local or metastatic recurrence after surgery does occur and is a major cause of cancer death. Localized and regionalized breast cancer patients have more than 80% 5-year survival rate, but breast cancer patients with distant organs only have 27% 5-year survival rate. In fact, the perioperative period presents many risks to patients. The process of surgery inevitably induces a profound stress response, which suppresses cell-mediated immunity, and enhances tumor growth and spread. This is also a growing recognition that the anesthetics used during mastectomy may affect the long-term outcome.

Propofol is the most extensively used intravenous anesthetic for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the United States. Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane are also in common use. The two classes of anesthetics have different effects on immune function. The choice of anesthetic used during cancer surgery may affect patient outcome. A recent retrospective study found significantly better long-term survival rates for patients receiving propofol (3714 patients, 504 deaths, 13.5%), compared to patients receiving volatile anesthetics (3316 patients, 796 deaths, 24%), following cancer surgery between 2010 and 2013 at a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.

In this article, we review the effects of propofol on breast cancer cell biology, the immune system, and postoperative pain. We discuss recent retrospective studies and upcoming prospective studies on the influence of propofol on long-term outcomes of breast cancer patients. The literature in this review was obtained by searching PubMed© with search terms "propofol" and "breast cancer" on December 3, 2017, and limited to articles written in English.

Appendix III — Anesthetic induction agents in older patients: Suggested dose adjustments are provided with usual quoted dosages. For propofol, bolus 2–2.5 mg/kg and infusion 100–250 μg/kg/min have suggested adjustments of 1.5–1.8 mg/kg or 20 percent reduction in bolus dose and 30 percent reduction in infusion. For thiopentone (thiopental sodium), the usual 2.5–5 mg/kg has a suggested 2.1–4.2 mg/kg or 20 percent reduction in bolus dose. For midazolam, the usual 0.2–0.3 mg/kg has suggested 0.05–0.15 mg/kg in premedicated patients with 20 percent reduction in patients aged > 55 y and 75 percent reduction in patients aged > 90 y. For etomidate, the usual 0.3–0.4 mg/kg has a suggested 0.2 mg/kg.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1162i9eg]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key findings

This meta-analysis of 252 randomized trials found that propofol significantly increases mortality compared with other hypnotic agents. Of note, the magnitude and direction of the treatment effect were maintained in all analyzed subgroups. The harm of propofol was remarkable in the cardiac surgical setting and in those studies with volatile agents as comparator.

Relationship with previous literature

Propofol is a short-acting hypnotic agent with reasonable costs and acceptable hemodynamic impact. There are 300 million patients undergoing surgeries and 13–20 million ICU patients experiencing mechanical ventilation worldwide annually. Since these patients receive hypnotics during the most fragile period of their life, even a small benefit or harm of these drugs would represent a public health issue. However, no megatrial comparing different anesthetics exists, and large randomized trials performed so far did not provide a definitive answer due to possible confounders and study design. As a result, anesthesiologists and intensivists choose the hypnotic agents based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, pathophysiology, and surrogate endpoints such as hemodynamic parameters, mild symptoms and complications (e.g. postoperative nausea and vomiting), and costs. However, when pooling all available randomized evidence, it is possible to identify even subtle survival differences of each anesthetic agent in the existing literature.

### Sevoflurane versus propofol on immediate postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass: a comparative analysis [^115B1tC9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that among patients undergoing cardiac surgery and using CPB, those anesthetized with SEV performed better in terms of POCD incidence, cognitive recovery, and postoperative recovery time compared to propofol. Specifically, patients in the SEV group showed fewer cognitive impairment symptoms in a shorter period of time after surgery, and cognitive test results at 3 months after surgery showed that the cognitive function recovery rate of this group of patients was faster than that of the PRO group.

The risk of POCD in patients undergoing CS may also be affected by intraoperative trauma in addition to anesthesia. Moreover, the incidence of POCD was significantly higher in patients undergoing CS under CPB compared to other patients. Therefore, the formulation of a reasonable anesthesia strategy will help to protect the cerebral blood oxygen supply and the central nervous system of patients, which is of great help to prevent POCD.

At present, the comparison of clinical advantages between SEV and PRO in surgical patients is still controversial. For example, Schoen J et al. reported that SEV is more effective than PRO in promoting short-term postoperative cognitive recovery in patients undergoing CS. According to Zhang Y et al. SEV is not as effective as PRO in preventing delayed neurocognitive recovery in elderly patients undergoing major cancer surgery. In our study, the anesthetic effects were evaluated in terms of CPB duration, anesthesia time, respiratory recovery time, and anesthesia recovery time. The PRO group was significantly shorter than the SEV group in all of the above indexes except the comparable CPB duration, suggesting that PRO has a better anesthetic effect for patients undergoing CS under CPB. Shortening anesthesia time and recovery times could positively impact patient outcomes by reducing the duration of exposure to anesthetic agents, potentially decreasing the risk of POCD. Faster recovery from anesthesia and respiratory function may also limit the time patients spend in a vulnerable post-anesthesia state, contributing to improved cognitive function and reducing the incidence of POCD in the PRO group.

### Efficacy and safety of remimazolam compared with propofol in hypertensive patients undergoing breast cancer surgery: a single-center, randomized, controlled study [^111uyyBE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we compared general anesthesia with remimazolam and propofol in terms of PIH in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Our results revealed that the remimazolam group had a lower incidence of PIH than that of the propofol group. We used several definitions of hypotension, and although the incidence of hypotension varied between the two groups, the results remained consistent (Supplemental Table 1). It can be concluded that induction with remimazolam in hypertensive patients may result in more stable blood pressure than that with propofol. Studies have reported an association between intraoperative hypotension and mortality far beyond the peri-operative period, with significant associations for 30-day and 1-year mortalities. As the most important part of intraoperative hypotension, PIH is considered an independent risk factor for predicting adverse clinical outcomes. Transient hypotension is associated with tissue hypoperfusion and subsequent complications, such as prolonged intensive care unit stay and postoperative ventilation need, which can increase postoperative mortality. Reich et al. advised against propofol induction in patients with a baseline MAP of < 70 mmHg because increasing the dose of propofol increased the risk of PIH. Although many studies have reported that remimazolam is preferred to propofol in hemodynamic stability, they mainly target healthy people and patients undergoing gastroendoscopy and cardiac surgery, and studies on patients with hypertension have not been reported. Our study observed a significant decrease in the incidence of PIH in adults with hypertension in the remimazolam group compared to the propofol group. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in elderly patients with hypertension. This lack of significance may be attributed to the insufficient sample size. To obtain more accurate results, it is recommended to increase the sample size for further observations. Finally, we measured the incidence of hypertension during intubation in both groups (Supplementary Table 2) and found no significant difference. Our study demonstrated the hemodynamic benefits of remimazolam in hypertensive populations.

### Impact of general anaesthesia on breast cancer survival: a 5-year follow up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, the CAN-study, comparing propofol and sevoflurane [^113fTDbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This pragmatic, randomised, open label, single-blinded, multicentre, and binational study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Uppsala, Sweden, Dnr 2013/314, on August 14, 2013 (Email:), registered at the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT, on August 16, 2013 (2013–002380–25), and aton November 2, 2013. A separate approval was obtained in Beijing, China (Peking University First Hospital, 2015/1003). Four county hospitals and three university hospitals in Sweden and one university hospital in China participated. The study protocol can be found at.

Patient screening was organised slightly differently at the participating sites, usually performed at review of the surgical program or before pre-anaesthesia visits. All patients were included by the local primary investigator or another listed anaesthetist or surgeon after written and verbal information and signed consent.

Inclusion criteria: The patients should be at least 18 years of age, both sexes, scheduled for elective, curable, invasive primary breast cancer surgery with general anaesthesia with or without local infiltration or regional anaesthesia with a local anaesthetic agent.

Exclusion criteria: Patients scheduled for emergency surgery, palliative surgery, in-situ cancer, presence of any contraindication (according to the substances' valid Summary of Product Characteristics), or lack of suitability for any reason, as judged by the local investigator, e.g. communicative disturbances (language or intellectual) were not included in the study.

Randomisation and masking

The study patients were randomly allocated to anaesthesia maintenance with either propofol or sevoflurane in a 1:1 ratio. The computerised randomisation list was generated centrally by the monitoring organisation, Uppsala Clinical Research Center (UCR), in a permuted block fashion and transferred to a sequence of sealed, opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes with unique numbers for each study site. The envelopes were distributed to each study site at its initiation meeting by the Coordinating-PI. When a patient was considered eligible for the study and gave informed written and verbal consent, the randomisation was performed by opening the next envelope in sequence. Once assigned to a treatment group by randomisation, a patient could not be withdrawn from the study population except on the patient's own initiative. Furthermore, cross-over between treatment assignments (propofol to sevoflurane, or vice versa) was not permitted. Blinding did not apply to participating anaesthetists, but to patients, statisticians, and those assessing outcomes.

### Effect of propofol on breast cancer cell, the immune system, and patient outcome [^112je49q]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Surgery is the first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studies suggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery may influence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anesthetic agent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here we review the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, the immune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics have different effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reduce the development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery. Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, the evidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofol combined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affects the breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospective studies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existing evidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affects cancer cells and the immune system.

### Comparison of the effects of remimazolam and propofol on postoperative delirium in elderly surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^114tbdev]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute disorder of brain function characterized by sudden changes in consciousness, attention, and cognition. Postoperative delirium (POD) is prevalent among older adults, with incidence rates ranging from 11–51%. Symptoms of POD include impaired consciousness, hallucinations, poor concentration, and insomnia.

Postoperative delirium can significantly impact surgical outcomes. In cardiac valve replacement surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass, POD incidence can reach 25%. Similarly, reported rates among elderly colorectal cancer surgery patients range from 13.8–30%. Postoperative delirium not only disrupts the recovery process but also contributes to increased postoperative complications and mortality rates, ultimately leading to higher healthcare costs. Furthermore, it prolongs hospital stays, exacerbates morbidity, and adversely affects long-term cognitive function.

The mechanisms of postoperative delirium are complex and not fully understood, but identified risk factors include advanced age, intraoperative opioid use, hypotension, benzodiazepine use, and postoperative pain. Intraoperative anesthesia management significantly affects POD occurrence, with benzodiazepines and postoperative inflammatory responses being significant contributors. Studies suggest optimizing sedation and analgesia strategies can help mitigate these risk factors and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, enhancing anesthesia management is crucial for reducing the risk associated with POD.

In summary, addressing the risk of postoperative delirium among older adults is of significant clinical importance. Optimizing anesthesia protocols and enhancing postoperative care can reduce the incidence of POD, improve patient outcomes, and decrease healthcare costs. This comprehensive approach not only enhances the quality of life for older patients but also elevates the overall standards of medical services, thereby warranting serious attention and further research from anesthesiologists.

In contemporary surgical sedation and anesthesia, midazolam and propofol remain the primary hypnotics, frequently administered in conjunction with opioid analgesics such as fentanyl or sufentanil. Propofol is notably recognized for its highly effective intravenous sedation properties, characterized by a rapid onset of 15 to 40 s, a brief half-life, and swift patient recovery. These attributes make propofol an optimal choice for both standalone applications and in combination with opioids. However, recent evidence suggests a potential correlation between propofol usage and the incidence of POD, which may be attributed to its interactions with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

### Impact of general anaesthesia on breast cancer survival: a 5-year follow up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, the CAN-study, comparing propofol and sevoflurane [^116egmtC]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With more than 700,000 deaths annually, breast cancer is the fourth most common cause of death for both sexes from cancer globally. Surgical excision is a cornerstone of treatment and anaesthesia is a prerequisite for this.

Animal-, in vitro-, and retrospective clinical studies demonstrate that survival may be affected by the anaesthetic technique for many solid cancers, e.g. gastroesophageal cancer and hepatobiliary cancer. Plausible biological explanations exist, e.g. opposite effects on the immune system with suppression from inhaled anaesthetics, genotoxicity from this group, and also upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor, making cancer cells more viable, while propofol seems to have the opposite effect. For breast cancer, vascular endothelial growth factor C, which promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, is increased under sevoflurane/opioid anaesthesia, but not under propofol/paravertebral anaesthesia. In addition, the antitumor activity of natural killer cells was higher in women anaesthetised with propofol/paravertebral for breast cancer compared with women anaesthetised with sevoflurane/opioid, and the same relationship was true for cancer cell apoptosis. It seems that intravenous propofol is a better choice than inhaled anaesthetics. However, despite these data, subsequent retrospective studies suggest that the hypothesis does not apply to breast cancer. Moreover, in a prospective RCT, Sessler et al. found comparable rates of breast cancer recurrence in a comparison of a combination of propofol and paravertebral block with sevoflurane and opioids.

We initiated the Cancer and Anaesthesia study (CAN), based on survival outcomes from an early retrospective study, involving both breast cancer and colorectal cancer. The aim was to prospectively include patients for surgery of these cancer types and randomise to general anaesthesia based on propofol or sevoflurane and then compare long-term survival in the CAN study. In this report, we present the data for the breast cancer patients, as the inclusions to the colorectal part were completed only recently. Five-year overall survival was decided as the primary outcome. We hypothesised that propofol-based general anaesthesia improves five-year survival for breast cancer by five percentage points.

### Anesthetics and long-term survival after cancer surgery-total intravenous versus volatile anesthesia: a retrospective study [^113BS5xS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Thus far, the findings have differed among studies depending on the type of cancer, the research institute involved, the duration of the investigation, and whether overall survival or recurrence-free survival is assessed. However, there have been no reports that propofol-based TIVA is significantly more harmful to patient survival. Although it did not include the most recent reports, a meta-analysis of 21,000 patients showed that both recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates were higher in the TIVA group than in the volatile anesthesia group. Despite these data, one survey revealed that most anesthesiologists preferred inhalation anesthesia. As many as 43% of respondents presumed that TIVA could reduce cancer recurrence; however, only 29% of them used TIVA for cancer surgery. Factors affecting cancer prognosis are very diverse and complex; therefore, they may not differ simply because of the anesthetic used. In our hospital, regardless of whether the surgery involves cancer treatment, most anesthesiologists use sevoflurane or desflurane for general anesthesia. Notably, the proportion of patients who received TIVA for general anesthesia in 2018 at Chungnam National University Hospital was 1575 of 12,659 (12%). This is likely because the benefits of the TIVA are not yet clear and a syringe infuser is not available.

### Propofol versus sevoflurane anesthesia on postoperative sleep quality in older patients after major abdominal surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^112GaciL]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Sleep disturbances are common in older patients following major surgery. Both propofol and sevoflurane are frequently used anesthetics. In this study, we compared the effect of propofol- versus sevoflurane-based anesthesia on postoperative sleep quality in this patient population.

Design

A randomized clinical trial.

Setting

A university hospital.

Patients

Patients aged 65 to 90 years who were scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery.

Interventions

Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either propofol-based intravenous anesthesia or sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia.

Measurements

Primary endpoint was total sleep time monitored by actigraphy on the first postoperative night. Secondary endpoints included plasma orexin-A concentrations at various timepoints from baseline (before anesthesia) until the second postoperative morning.

Main Results

From May 23, 2022 to April 3, 2023, 144 patients (mean age 72.9 years; 58.3% male) were enrolled and randomly assigned. Total sleep time on the first postoperative night was longer with propofol anesthesia (median 150 min [interquartile range 99 to 200]) than with sevoflurane anesthesia (111 min [80 to 160]; median difference 29 min [95% CI 4 to 53]; P = 0.025). Plasma orexin-A concentration was lower in the propofol group at 1 h after anesthesia induction (median difference - 31.3 pg/mL [95% CI -58.1 to -2.2]; P = 0.033) and 6:00 on the first postoperative morning (median difference - 29.8 pg/mL [95% CI -58.3 to -2.3]; P = 0.036).

Conclusions

Among older patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, propofol anesthesia, compared with sevoflurane anesthesia, was associated with a longer total sleep time on the first postoperative night. This difference may be partially attributable to lowered plasma orexin-A level.

Trial Registration

This randomized trial was approved by Biomedical Research Ethical Committee of Peking University First Hospital (No.2022–155) on April 26, 2022. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2200060120) URL: https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj = 169584, May 19, 2022.

### Inflammatory biomarker levels after propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia: a meta-analysis [^112EvoN7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The perioperative inflammatory response may be implicated in adverse outcomes including neurocognitive dysfunction and cancer recurrence after oncological surgery. The immunomodulatory role of anesthetic agents has been demonstrated in vitro; however, its clinical relevance is unclear. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare propofol and sevoflurane with respect to biomarkers of perioperative inflammation. The secondary aim was to correlate markers of inflammation with clinical measures of perioperative cognition.

Methods

Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials examining perioperative inflammation after general anesthesia using propofol compared to sevoflurane. Inflammatory biomarkers investigated were interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The secondary outcome was incidence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Meta-analysis with metaregression was performed to determine the difference between propofol and sevoflurane.

Results

Twenty-three studies were included with 1611 participants. Studies varied by surgery type, duration, and participant age. There was an increase in the mean inflammatory biomarker levels following surgery, with meta-analysis revealing no difference in effect between propofol and sevoflurane. Heterogeneity between studies was high, with surgery type, duration, and patient age contributing to the variance across studies. Only 5 studies examined postoperative cognitive outcomes; thus, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Nonetheless, of these 5 studies, 4 reported a reduced incidence of cognitive decline associated with propofol use.

Conclusions

Surgery induces an inflammatory response; however, the inflammatory response did not differ as a function of anesthetic technique. This absence of an effect suggests that patient and surgical variables may have a far more significant impact on the postoperative inflammatory responses than anesthetic technique. The majority of studies assessing perioperative cognition in older patients reported a benefit associated with the use of propofol; however, larger trials using homogenous outcomes are needed to demonstrate such an effect.

### Effect of different anesthesia depths on perioperative heart rate variability and hemodynamics in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing general anesthesia [^111yjoyn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

General information comparison

A total of 111 middle-aged and elderly patients with gastric cancer undergoing partial gastrectomy or subtotal gastrectomy at our hospital were selected as the study subjects and divided into Groups A, B, and C. Patients received individualized administrations of sufentanil, remifentanil, and propofol. The dosages were based on the body weight and individual needs, including: (1) Sufentanil: The patients received a total dose of sufentanil ranging from 50 to 100 µg/kg, depending on their body weight and individual requirements for analgesia. (2) Remifentanil: The patients received a continuous infusion of remifentanil at a rate of 0.1–0.3 µg/kg/min, adjusted based on their hemodynamic parameters and depth of anesthesia. (3) Propofol: The patients received a continuous infusion of propofol at a rate of 5–10 mg/kg/h, adjusted to maintain the desired BIS level.

### Propofol [^117Cyxn9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3	Maintenance of General Anesthesia for Patients Greater than or Equal to 2 Months of Age

Propofol injectable emulsion has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents.

In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression.

Adult Patients

In adults, anesthesia can be maintained by administering propofol injectable emulsion by infusion or intermittent intravenous bolus injection. The patient's clinical response will determine the infusion rate or the amount and frequency of incremental injections.

Continuous Infusion

Propofol injectable emulsion 100 mcg/kg/min to 200 mcg/kg/min administered in a variable rate infusion with 60% to 70% nitrous oxide and oxygen provides anesthesia for patients undergoing general surgery. Maintenance by infusion of propofol injectable emulsion should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 mcg/kg/min to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 minutes to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.

### Volatile versus propofol general anesthesia and long-term survival after breast cancer surgery: a national registry retrospective cohort study [^11132F9x]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several retrospective studies using administrative or single-center data have failed to show any difference between general anesthesia using propofol versus inhaled volatiles on long-term survival after breast cancer surgery. Although randomized controlled trials are ongoing, validated data from national clinical registries may advance the reliability of existing knowledge.

Methods

Data on breast cancer surgery performed under general anesthesia between 2013 and 2019 from the Swedish PeriOperative Registry and the National Quality Registry for Breast Cancer were record-linked. Overall survival was compared between patients receiving propofol and patients receiving inhaled volatile for anesthesia maintenance.

Results

Of 18,674 subjects, 13,873 patients (74.3%) received propofol and 4,801 (25.7%) received an inhaled volatile for general anesthesia maintenance. The two cohorts differed in most respects. Patients receiving inhaled volatile were older (67 yr vs. 65 yr), sicker (888 [19.0%] American Society of Anesthesiologists status 3 to 5 vs. 1,742 [12.8%]), and the breast cancer to be more advanced. Median follow-up was 33 months (interquartile range, 19 to 48). In the full, unmatched cohort, there was a statistically significantly higher overall survival among patients receiving propofol (13,489 of 13,873 [97.2%]) versus inhaled volatile (4,039 of 4,801 [84.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90; P < 0.001). After 1:1 propensity score matching (4,658 matched pairs), there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (propofol 4,284 of 4,658 [92.0%]) versus inhaled volatile (4,288 of 4,658 [92.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.13; P = 0.756).

Conclusions

Among patients undergoing breast cancer surgery under general anesthesia, no association was observed between the choice of propofol or an inhaled volatile maintenance and overall survival.

### Variation in propofol induction doses administered to surgical patients over age 65 [^1123NPBe]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Advanced age is associated with increased susceptibility to acute adverse effects of propofol. The present study aimed to describe patterns of propofol dosing for induction of general anesthesia before endotracheal intubation in a nationwide sample of older adults presenting for surgery.

Design

Retrospective observational study using the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group data set.

Setting

Thirty-six institutions across the United States.

Participants

A total of 350,766 patients aged over 65years who received propofol for general anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation between 2014 and 2018.

Intervention

None.

Measurements

Total induction bolus dose of propofol administered.

Results

The mean (SD) weight-adjusted propofol dose was 1.7 (0.6) mg/kg. The mean prevalent propofol induction dose exceeded the upper bound of what has been described as the typical geriatric dose requirement across every age category examined. The percent of patients receiving propofol induction doses above the described typical geriatric range was 64.8% (95% CI 64.6–65.0), varying from 73.8% among patients aged 65–69 to 45.8% among patients aged 80 and older.

Conclusion

The present study of a large multicenter cohort demonstrates that prevalent propofol dosing commonly falls above the published typically required dose range for patients aged ≥ 65 in nationwide anesthetic practice. Widespread variability in induction dose administration remains incompletely explained by known patient variables. The nature and clinical consequences of these unexplained dosing decisions remain important topics for further study. Observed discordance between expected and actual induction dosing raises the question of whether there should be reconsideration of widespread provider practice or, alternatively, whether what is published as the typical propofol induction dose range should be revisited.

GA general anesthesia, TIVA total intravenous anesthesia, TCI target-controlled infusion, NK cell natural killer cell

To obtain hard evidence of a causal relationship between anesthetics and cancer outcomes, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed. There are six current prospective randomized clinical trials registered on databases worldwide comparing volatile anesthetics to propofol anesthesia. Three of them specifically focus on or include breast cancers (Table 2). The first study is analyzing the number of circulating tumors cells at 3 days after surgery. The primary outcome of the second study is NK cell activity at 1 and 24 h after surgery. Those two studies may further provide translational evidence on mechanism of propofol on cancer outcome. In the third study, the primary endpoint is the 5-year survival rate. All three studies compare the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane with propofol.

### Impact of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia versus inhalation anesthesia on long-term survival after cancer surgery in a nationwide cohort [^115Gzfnv]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the impact of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia (IA) on the overall survival following cancer surgery.

Background

The association between intraoperative anesthetics and patients' long-term outcomes following cancer surgery remains controversial.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used nationwide data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service. Adult patients who underwent cancer resection surgery (breast, gastric, lung, liver, kidney, colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, and bladder cancer) under general anesthesia between January 2007 and December 2016 were included. Patients were divided into propofol-based TIVA or IA groups according to the type of anesthesia received. A total of 312,985 patients (37,063 in the propofol-based TIVA group and 275,922 patients in the IA group) were eligible for analysis. The primary outcome was the comparison of overall survival following surgery between the groups in each cancer type. We compared the all-cause mortality between the 2 groups, stratified by cancer type using time-dependent Cox regression after propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting. We further examined the comparison of overall survival in a meta-analysis using data from our study and previously published data comparing propofol-based TIVA with IA after cancer surgery.

Results

The number of deaths in the propofol-based TIVA and IA groups was 5037 (13.6%) and 45,904 (16.6%), respectively; the median (interquartile range) follow-up duration was 1192 (637–2011) days. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed no significant association between the type of general anesthesia and overall survival after cancer surgery in the weighted cohort for each cancer type (all P > 0.05) and for total population [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–1.04]. In a meta-analysis, single-center studies showed higher overall survival in the TIVA group than in the IA group (pooled adjusted HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47–0.91, P = 0.01), while multicenter studies showed insignificant pooled adjusted HRs (pooled adjusted HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.82–1.33, P = 0.71).

Conclusions

There is no association between the type of general anesthesia used during cancer surgery and postoperative overall, 1-, and 5-year survival.

### Volatile versus total intravenous anesthesia for cancer prognosis in patients having digestive cancer surgery [^113czvaR]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous experimental and clinical studies have shown that anesthetic agents have varying effects on cancer prognosis; however, the results were inconsistent among these studies. The authors compared overall and recurrence-free survival in patients given volatile or intravenous anesthesia for digestive tract cancer surgery.

Methods

The authors selected patients who had elective esophagectomy, gastrectomy, hepatectomy, cholecystectomy, pancreatectomy, colectomy, and rectal cancer surgery from July 2010 to March 2018 using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Patients were divided into a volatile anesthesia group (desflurane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane with/without nitrous oxide) and a propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia group. The authors hypothesized that total intravenous anesthesia is associated with greater overall and recurrence-free survival than volatile anesthesia. Subgroup analyses were performed for each type of surgery.

Results

The authors identified 196,303 eligible patients (166,966 patients in the volatile anesthesia group and 29,337 patients in the propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia group). The numbers (proportions) of death in the volatile anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia groups were 17,319 (10.4%) and 3,339 (11.4%), respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.07; P = 0.28) or recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.03; P = 0.59), whereas instrumental variable analyses showed a slight difference in recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98; P = 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed no significant difference in overall or recurrence-free survival between the groups in any type of surgery.

Conclusions

Overall and recurrence-free survival were similar between volatile and intravenous anesthesia in patients having digestive tract surgery. Selection of the anesthetic approach for these patients should be based on other factors.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114vsU1j]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that propofol increases mortality by 10% when compared to other hypnotic agents. Large-scale prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.

### Propofol versus remimazolam on cognitive function, hemodynamics, and oxygenation during one-lung ventilation in older patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^111pSUEi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of remimazolam on postoperative cognitive function, intraoperative hemodynamics, and oxygenation in older patients undergoing lobectomy.

Design

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

A university hospital.

Participants

Eighty-four older patients with lung cancer who underwent lobectomy, aged ≥ 65 years.

Interventions

Patients were divided randomly into the remimazolam (group R) and propofol (group P) groups. Group R underwent remimazolam anesthesia induction and maintenance, whereas group P underwent propofol anesthesia induction and maintenance. Cognitive function was assessed with neuropsychological tests 1 day before surgery and 7 days after surgery. The Clock Drawing Test, Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Digit Symbol Switching Test (DSST), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan (AVLT-H) assessed visuospatial ability, language function, attention, and memory, respectively. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac index were recorded 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia (T0), 2 minutes after sedation (T1), 5 minutes after intubation with two-lung ventilation (T2), 30 minutes after one-lung ventilation (OLV) (T3), 60 minutes after OLV (T4), and at the end of surgery (T5), and the incidences of hypotension and bradycardia were recorded. The PaO 2, oxygenation index (OI), and intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) were assessed at T0, T2, T3, T4, and T5. The levels of S-100β and interleukin 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at T0, T5, 24 hours after surgery (T6), and on day 7 after surgery (T7).

Measurements and Main Results

The VFT, DSST, immediate recall AVLT-H, and short-delayed recall AVLT-H scores were significantly higher in group R than in group P on day 7 after surgery (p < 0.05). The SBP and MAP at T2 to T5 were significantly higher in group R than in group P, the incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in group R (9.5%) than in group P (35.7%) (p = 0.004), and remimazolam significantly reduced the dose of phenylephrine used (p < 0.05). The PaO 2 and OI at T4 were significantly higher in group R than in group P, and Qs/Qt was significantly lower in group R than in group P. The levels of S-100β at T5 were significantly lower in group R than in group P (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The results showed that remimazolam (versus propofol) may lessen the degree of short-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction measured by standard neuropsychological tests, better optimize intraoperative hemodynamics, and lead to improved oxygenation during OLV.

### Total intravenous or inhalational volatile anaesthesia and survival after colorectal cancer surgery: a Swedish national registry study [^1134eGcS]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

After obtaining ethical approval, we used pooled data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry and the Swedish Peri‐operative Registry. The Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry contains a comprehensive data set for everyone diagnosed with colorectal cancer in Sweden, including: tumour stage; type of surgery; oncological treatment; cancer follow‐up; and survival data with a coverage rate of 99% and high validity. The Swedish Peri‐operative Registry contains data on surgical procedures including which anaesthetic technique was used for induction and maintenance, but it does not discriminate between different inhalational volatile anaesthetic agents. The registry covers the entire peri‐operative process from pre‐operative assessment to discharge from the post‐anaesthesia care unit with a coverage rate of 99%. These registries rely on the unique social security number assigned to all Swedish citizens, they exhibit high data quality with built‐in validation processes and have achieved the designation 'quality registry', which the government requires for funding. In the present study, we adapted the statistical plan from a previous study carried out to determine the effect of anaesthetic technique on outcomes after breast cancer surgery (online Supporting Information Appendix S1).

All patients diagnosed with stage 1–3 colorectal cancer in Sweden who underwent surgery between 2014 and 2019, were identified from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry, and their data were supplemented with pooled anaesthesia information from the Swedish Peri‐operative Registry. In cases where a patient had multiple colorectal cancer sites, inclusion was based on the most advanced cancer site. For patients with a new cancer diagnosis during the follow‐up period, we included the earliest resection operation. Patients with missing information were not studied.

The independent/causal variable was the anaesthetic drug used for maintenance, i.e. propofol or an inhalational volatile anaesthetic agent (desflurane, isoflurane or sevoflurane). The dependent/control variables included: age at surgery; BMI; and ASA physical status. We considered them to be true confounders because of their potential association with both the choice of anaesthetic agent and overall survival. Other factors such as tumour stage (1/2/3); year of diagnosis; neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant oncological therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy); and type of surgery (laparotomy, laparoscopy), were judged to be associated with prognosis, but not with the choice of anaesthesia, and were therefore included as effect modifiers in a propensity score matching model.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115kBCa6]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol is one of the most widely used hypnotic agents in the world. Nonetheless, propofol might have detrimental effects on clinically relevant outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of other interventions' organ protective properties. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate if propofol reduced survival compared to any other hypnotic agent in any clinical setting.

Methods

We searched eligible studies in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials. The following inclusion criteria were used: random treatment allocation and comparison between propofol and any comparator in any clinical setting. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up available. We conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis for the risk ratio (RR). Using this RR and 95% confidence interval, we estimated the probability of any harm (RR > 1) through Bayesian statistics. We registered this systematic review and meta-analysis in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022323143).

Results

We identified 252 randomized trials comprising 30,757 patients. Mortality was higher in the propofol group than in the comparator group (760/14,754 [5.2%] vs. 682/16,003 [4.3%]; RR = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.20; p = 0.03; I² = 0%; number needed to harm = 235), corresponding to a 98.4% probability of any increase in mortality. A statistically significant mortality increase in the propofol group was confirmed in subgroups of cardiac surgery, adult patients, volatile agent as comparator, large studies, and studies with low mortality in the comparator arm.

Conclusions

Propofol may reduce survival in perioperative and critically ill patients. This needs careful assessment of the risk versus benefit of propofol compared to other agents while planning for large, pragmatic multicentric randomized controlled trials to provide a definitive answer.

### Outcomes of intravenous and inhalation anesthesia on patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery: a retrospective observational study [^112vPwcH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The immunomodulatory effect of anesthetics is considered to be an important mechanism for the effect of anesthetics on tumor prognosis. Sevoflurane has been shown to induce T-lymphocyte apoptosis, reduce natural killer (NK) cell activity, reduce Th1 / Th2 ratio, increase tumorigenic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPS) levels (key enzymes involved in basement membrane disassembly, thereby promoting tumor dissemination) to systematically damage immune function. In contrast, propofol increased the activity of cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, does not inhibit the activity of the NK cells, and reduced the tumorigenic cytokines, has the protective and anticancer effects. Propofol can also inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, it has the anti-tumor characteristics.

Perioperative variables such as intraoperative blood transfusion, degree of differentiation, and ASA grade may affect the immunomodulation, thus leading to recurrence or metastasis after cancer surgery. Blood transfusions can carry the risk of spreading disease, also have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis recently. A retrospective cohort study of perioperative transfusion on overall survival after esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) concluded that perioperative transfusion had no effect on the overall survival of ESCC patients. Our study also confirmed that OS in esophageal cancer patients was not associated with transfusion, and DFS was not associated with transfusion, which was consistent with previous studies. In the multivariate COX risk proportional regression model, the degree of differentiation was associated with OS, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies: a retrospective study of the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors for the surgical treatment of elderly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma showed the degree of differentiation of tumor cells was significantly higher for prognostic factors and survival rates in the higher differentiated group than in the middle and lower differentiated groups. ASA grade is used preoperative to assess patient status and patient status was associated with metastasis and recurrence. In our study, the OS and DFS were also confirmed as worse for ASA III than for ASA I.

Our study also collected primary tumor location, univariate analysis showed that after SIPTW(Table 2), patients with tumor location in the upper esophagus had a higher risk of death than those in the lower esophagus. This may be because the upper esophagus includes the neck and upper thoracic segments. Patients with proximal esophageal cancer often present with locally advanced disease, potentially curative surgery requiring extensive cutting resection, the risk of postoperative complications is higher. However, in the multivariate analysis, the result was negative, which may be due to the number of patients with upper esophageal cancer in the data we collected was too small. The upper esophageal cancer tumors are relatively rare, and only accounts for 10% of all esophageal cancer cases.

### Effect of intravenous lidocaine on propofol consumption in elderly patients undergoing colonoscopy: a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial [^112qcyQp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Colonoscopy is used for Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in elderly patients in an increasing number of countries. Propofol has become the first choose sedative drug for colonoscopy because of its rapid action, strong sedation, short half-life, rapid recovery, and higher satisfaction. However, it was reported that respiratory depression and cardiovascular events were common sedation-related complications during propofol-based sedation, especially in elderly patients. Moreover, age-related pharmacokinetic changes and patient comorbidities are of great concern during the sedation process. Midazolam and opioid drugs combined with propofol can reduce the consumption of propofol, and both can result in respiratory depression. Therefore, it is of crucial clinical value for anaesthesiologists to find the optimal adjunct drug to reduce propofol consumption and focus on the tolerability of propofol use in elderly patient undergoing colonoscopy.

In recent years, intravenous lidocaine as a propofol-adjuvant drug has been widely used in anaesthesia for reducing pain, decreasing opioid or sedative consumption, and accelerating postoperative bowel function recovery in many surgical procedures. Intravenous lidocaine can reduce the requirement of propofol by 50%, with less postoperative pain and fatigue in colonoscopy patients. However, there are no double-blinded, randomized, controlled trials focusing on the use of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg, followed by 2 mg/kg/h) in elderly patients undergoing colonoscopy. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on propofol consumption in elderly patients undergoing colonoscopy.

### Comparison of outcomes after breast cancer surgery between inhalational and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oZ5YX]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

General anaesthesia is the commonly provided for breast cancer surgery, but the effects of inhalational anaesthesia and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia on short- and long-term outcomes after breast cancer surgery are not clear. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to explore the superior anaesthetic for breast cancer surgery patients.

Methods

We searched the Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang databases (up to January, 2021) for RCTs in which inhalational anaesthesia and propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia were compared and short- and long-term outcomes were assessed in breast cancer surgical patients. The meta-analysis was performed by Stata 12.0.

Results

Twenty RCTs with a total of 2201 patients were included. Compared with inhalational anaesthesia, propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia was associated with more postoperative rescue analgesia (I 2 = 0%, RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07–1.30, P = 0.001) but a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (I 2 = 25.5%, RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62–0.81, P < 0.001) and postoperative rescue antiemetics (I 2 = 0%, RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.58–0.82, P < 0.001). Propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia preserved nature killer cell cytotoxicity (I 2 = 86.2%, SMD: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.13–1.39, P = 0.018), decreased IL-6 level (I 2 = 98.0%, SMD: −3.09, 95% CI: −5.70– −0.48, P = 0.021) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (I 2 = 0%, SMD: −0.28, 95% CI: −0.53– −0.03, P = 0.030), and increased 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (I 2 = 0%, RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20, P = 0.043) but did not affect recurrence or the overall survival rate (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Propofol-based intravenous anaesthesia increases postoperative rescue analgesia but reduces PONV compared with inhalational anaesthesia in breast cancer surgery. The benefit of propofol over inhalational anaesthetics in the preservation of anti-cancer immunity is obvious, but it is difficult to conclude that propofol can exert long-term benefits due to the small sample size.
