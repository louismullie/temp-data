## Question

How can I differentiate between vaginitis and vaginosis based on vaginal discharge

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate between vaginitis and vaginosis based on vaginal discharge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and pathophysiology to anchor the diagnostic framework. Then, I should move through a bedside algorithm that starts with discharge appearance, vaginal pH, and the whiff test. Next, I will incorporate microscopy patterns, correlate symptoms, and apply formal diagnostic criteria such as Amsel and Nugent. After that, I need to consider confirmatory laboratory methods including NAATs and culture when appropriate. Finally, I should review special scenarios like pregnancy, mixed infections, and diagnostic pitfalls to ensure clinical accuracy and completeness [^112rrSZy] [^112UAP5S] [^1139Lyf3].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I do not misclassify the syndromes. Vaginosis, in common clinical usage, refers to bacterial vaginosis, which is a polymicrobial dysbiosis and notably noninflammatory on microscopy with relative absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. In contrast, vaginitis is the broader inflammatory syndrome that includes vulvovaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis and can also be used colloquially to encompass all infectious causes of discharge, although BV itself is technically a noninflammatory state. Hold on, I should verify the microscopic distinction because it is a cornerstone. Yes, BV typically shows scant PMNs, whereas VVC and trichomoniasis show increased inflammatory cells on wet mount [^112UAP5S] [^1139Lyf3].

> I will now examine the discharge characteristics because this is the first practical branch point at the bedside. BV typically presents with thin, homogeneous, gray to white discharge with a fishy or amine odor. VVC often shows thick, white, curdy discharge with adherent plaques and associated erythema. Trichomoniasis commonly yields a yellow to green, frothy discharge that can be copious with cervical and vaginal irritation. Wait, I initially thought fishy odor was pathognomonic for BV when seen with homogeneous discharge, but I should be precise. It is highly specific and strongly suggestive in the right context, yet not absolutely pathognomonic on its own, so I need to corroborate with pH, whiff, and microscopy to avoid anchoring bias [^1139Lyf3] [^117UifPn] [^113wk5oq].

> Next, I should review vaginal pH because it quickly narrows the differential. I need to ensure the sample is from the lateral vaginal wall and not contaminated with cervical mucus or semen. A pH greater than or equal to 4.5 points away from simple VVC and toward BV or trichomoniasis, and trichomoniasis often drives the pH into a more alkaline range, frequently above 5.4. Conversely, a clearly normal acidic pH between 4.0 and 4.5 supports VVC and makes BV unlikely. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds and their interpretive caveats. These cutoffs remain standard in primary care algorithms and are widely adopted in guidelines [^1139Lyf3].

> Let me consider the whiff test because it adds orthogonal diagnostic information. Adding a drop of 10 percent KOH to vaginal fluid that yields a fishy amine odor favors BV by reflecting volatilized amines such as trimethylamine produced by anaerobes. I should confirm test characteristics before over-weighting it. The whiff test is one of the more specific clinical components for BV, with specificity reported around the low 90s, making a positive result useful for ruling in BV when combined with other criteria [^117UifPn] [^111Qy2g3].

> I will now examine microscopy findings because they provide direct organism or hallmark clue evidence. On saline wet mount, clue cells that are epithelial cells with obscured borders due to adherent coccobacilli support BV, whereas motile, pear-shaped, flagellated trichomonads indicate trichomoniasis. On KOH prep, budding yeast or pseudohyphae support VVC. Wait, let me verify inflammatory patterns. Abundant PMNs favor trichomoniasis or inflammatory vaginitis, while BV typically shows few PMNs, which is a key microscopic hallmark of its noninflammatory nature. I also need to check practical limitations. Wet mount and KOH require equipment, training, and certification, and performance in routine primary care is variable, which can lower sensitivity and drive diagnostic error if used in isolation [^1139Lyf3] [^112UAP5S] [^1156TcnZ] [^112LEkkc].

> I should correlate with symptom patterns next because they can refine pretest probabilities. BV often causes malodor that can worsen after intercourse, with minimal pruritus and scant objective inflammation on exam, and a substantial proportion of women can be asymptomatic at any given time. VVC typically produces intense pruritus, burning, erythema, and vulvar edema, consistent with inflammation. Trichomoniasis produces irritation and dysuria variably and may also be asymptomatic. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a figure that half of BV can be asymptomatic. Let me double-check. Detailed questioning studies show that a minority report classic odor or discharge, underscoring why objective testing is critical [^1139Lyf3] [^113s9HPS].

> Let me first confirm how to apply diagnostic criteria so that bedside impressions translate into a consistent diagnosis. For BV, Amsel's criteria require at least three of four findings, which include homogeneous discharge, pH greater than 4.5, a positive whiff, and clue cells in at least 20 percent of epithelial cells. Hold on, I should verify if a modified or simplified approach performs similarly. Some data suggest that two criteria, particularly pairing pH with either whiff or clue cells, can approximate the accuracy of the classic three of four, with pH among the most sensitive and whiff among the most specific single items. For VVC, diagnosis requires compatible inflammatory signs plus yeast on microscopy or positive culture, and for trichomoniasis, NAAT is preferred for sensitivity when microscopy is negative or unavailable [^117UifPn] [^113xqMni] [^113F2uPq] [^111Qy2g3] [^1139Lyf3] [^112KxgA3].

> I need to ensure confirmatory laboratory approaches are used when clinical or microscopic findings are equivocal or for quality assurance. The Nugent score on Gram stain remains the gold standard for BV, scoring lactobacillus depletion and anaerobe morphotypes, though it requires a trained microscopist. Molecular NAAT panels that detect markers of BV, Candida species, and Trichomonas vaginalis offer high positive and negative agreement compared with reference standards and can be performed on clinician- or patient-collected vaginal swabs with rapid turnaround. For VVC, culture helps speciate non albicans isolates and guide therapy in complicated cases. I should also acknowledge that clinician diagnosis shows only moderate concordance with molecular standards, which supports leveraging objective assays where feasible [^114zCios] [^114JT2g9] [^113xqMni] [^1153B6dU] [^113G3Ueo].

> Let me think about the practical synthesis at the bedside. A thin, homogeneous, malodorous discharge with pH at or above 4.5, positive whiff, and clue cells strongly supports BV, especially if microscopy shows few PMNs. Thick, white, curdy discharge with normal pH and KOH-demonstrated yeast supports VVC. Frothy yellow to green discharge with higher pH, abundant PMNs, and motile trichomonads on wet mount or NAAT positivity supports trichomoniasis. Hold on, I should verify that mixed infections are not uncommon and can blur classic patterns. Indeed, concurrent BV and VVC or BV and trichomoniasis can occur, so molecular panels can add value when features are overlapping or the initial therapy fails [^1139Lyf3] [^112UAP5S] [^111ynbGt].

> Next, I should review special clinical scenarios that alter pretest probabilities or test performance. In pregnancy, use the same diagnostic criteria for BV as in nonpregnant patients, but physiologic discharge can increase the difficulty of clinical diagnosis, making objective tests particularly helpful. I should confirm management principles in symptomatic pregnant patients. Guidelines support testing and treating symptomatic BV in pregnancy to relieve symptoms, while acknowledging that many are asymptomatic and that screening strategies vary by guideline and risk profile [^113soocm] [^1118uXGb].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic or has discordant findings. A significant proportion of BV is asymptomatic, so absence of complaints cannot exclude BV when objective criteria are met. Conversely, if symptoms are present but Amsel criteria are not met and microscopy is unrevealing, I should double-check for noninfectious etiologies of vaginitis such as atrophic or inflammatory vaginitis and consider NAAT panels to reduce missed infectious causes [^113s9HPS] [^114ubumW].

> I need to ensure I address the limitations of routine clinical diagnosis so we do not overstate bedside accuracy. Real-world studies show that point-of-care tests like pH, whiff, and wet mount are underutilized, and empiric treatment without objective testing leads to both undertreatment of true infections and overtreatment of negatives, with higher revisit rates. Agreement between clinician diagnosis and molecular assays is modest, especially for BV and trichomoniasis, which argues for integrating NAATs when available to improve diagnostic precision and antimicrobial stewardship [^115344AK] [^113G3Ueo] [^113FPMWu].

> Hold on, I should verify one microscopic hallmark because it helps anchor the vaginosis versus vaginitis distinction when the discharge is nonspecific. The relative absence of PMNs in BV compared with their abundance in candidal or trichomonal vaginitis is a reliable microscopic discriminator when slides are well prepared and examined by trained personnel, reinforcing the conceptual divide between noninflammatory dysbiosis and inflammatory infections [^112UAP5S] [^1139Lyf3].

> Finally, I need to ensure a reproducible, stepwise workflow. Start with focused history and visual discharge assessment, measure pH from lateral vaginal wall secretions, perform whiff testing, and do saline and KOH microscopy when possible. Apply Amsel for BV and document clue cell proportion, confirm VVC with KOH or culture when needed, and use NAAT for trichomoniasis or when microscopy is negative yet suspicion persists. Consider NAAT panels for indeterminate or recurrent cases or when mixed infection is suspected. If infectious causes are not confirmed, reassess for noninfectious vaginitis and dermatoses and avoid reflex empiric antibiotics or antifungals without objective support [^1139Lyf3] [^117UifPn] [^112KxgA3] [^114ubumW].

To differentiate vaginitis from vaginosis by discharge, focus on **discharge characteristics** and **diagnostic tests** [^112rrSZy]. Vaginitis shows thick, white, curdy or yellow-green, **frothy discharge** [^1139Lyf3] with **itching, burning, and erythema**, **normal pH (4.0–4.5)**, and **leukocytes on microscopy**. Vaginosis presents **thin, homogeneous, gray-white discharge** [^111PcbiB] with a **fishy odor** [^117UifPn], **minimal irritation** [^112UAP5S], **elevated pH (> 4.5)** [^112C9UWw], and **clue cells on microscopy** [^117UifPn]. Use **Amsel criteria** [^117UifPn] or **Nugent score** [^114zCios] for vaginosis, and **wet mount** or **NAAT** [^113FPMWu] [^112KxgA3] for vaginitis.

## Clinical definitions and pathophysiology

Vaginitis is inflammation of the vaginal mucosa with **prominent inflammatory symptoms**; causes include **infectious (Candida, Trichomonas)** [^1139Lyf3] and **noninfectious (atrophic, irritant, allergic)** forms [^114ubumW] [^112rrSZy]. Vaginosis is a **noninflammatory dysbiosis** — most commonly **bacterial vaginosis** — characterized by **lactobacilli depletion** and **anaerobic overgrowth**, with typically minimal inflammation [^112UAP5S] [^111PcbiB] [^111aLKtC].

## Vaginal discharge characteristics

| **Feature** | **Vaginitis** | **Vaginosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Consistency | Thick, curdy (Candida); frothy (Trichomonas) [^1139Lyf3] | Thin, homogeneous, gray-white [^117UifPn] |
| Odor | Absent or mild; fishy with Trichomonas [^1139Lyf3] | Strong fishy odor (amines) [^117UifPn] |
| pH | Normal (4.0–4.5) | Elevated (> 4.5) [^117UifPn] |
| Microscopy | Leukocytes; yeast or trichomonads | Clue cells; few leukocytes [^112UAP5S] |
| Symptoms | Itching, burning, erythema [^112rrSZy] | Minimal irritation [^112UAP5S] |

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory tests

### Vaginitis

- **Wet mount microscopy**: Yeast (budding/pseudohyphae) or motile trichomonads; leukocytes [^1139Lyf3].

- **pH testing**: Typically normal (4.0–4.5).

- **NAAT**: High sensitivity for Candida and Trichomonas [^113FPMWu] [^114JT2g9].

---

### Vaginosis

- **Amsel criteria**: ≥ 3 of 4 — thin homogeneous discharge, pH > 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells [^117UifPn].

- **Nugent score**: Gram stain scoring 7–10 indicates BV [^114zCios].

- **NAAT**: Detects BV-associated bacteria (e.g. Gardnerella, Atopobium).

---

## Clinical implications and management

Accurate differentiation guides therapy and prevents complications [^112C9UWw]. Vaginitis is managed with antifungals for Candida [^1139Lyf3] and with metronidazole or tinidazole for Trichomonas; **partners should also be treated for Trichomonas** [^1139Lyf3]. Vaginosis is treated with **metronidazole or clindamycin** [^114fsSas]; **partner treatment is not routinely required**.

## Summary table: key differentiating features

| **Feature** | **Vaginitis** | **Vaginosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Discharge consistency | Thick, curdy; frothy [^1139Lyf3] | Thin, homogeneous [^117UifPn] |
| Odor | Absent or mild; fishy with Trichomonas [^1139Lyf3] | Strong fishy odor [^117UifPn] |
| pH | Normal (4.0–4.5) [^112C9UWw] | Elevated (> 4.5) [^117UifPn] |
| Microscopy | Leukocytes; yeast or trichomonads [^113LrPTr] | Clue cells; few leukocytes [^112UAP5S] |
| Symptoms | Itching, burning, erythema [^112rrSZy] | Minimal irritation [^112UAP5S] |
| Diagnostic criteria | Wet mount; NAAT [^113FPMWu] | Amsel; Nugent; NAAT [^117UifPn] [^114zCios] |

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: A systematic review [^111PcbiB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of women worldwide are positive for bacterial vaginosis (BV), and this prevalence is reportedly higher among pregnant women from developing regions, including Latin America, Asia, and most African countries. The highest prevalence of BV has been reported among women of African descent. BV results from a disturbance in the vaginal ecosystem, characterized by the replacement of peroxidase-producing Lactobacilli — normally part of the vaginal flora — with anaerobic bacteria. A decrease in hydrogen peroxide-producing bacteria predisposes individuals to colonization by the causative organisms of BV. Microbiologically, this vaginal infection is marked by the replacement of lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota with variable mixtures of strictly and facultatively anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Mobiluncus spp.

- **Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis**: The diagnosis involves clinical methods (Amsel's criteria) and lab-based methods (Gram stain with an objective scoring system). Clinically, BV can be diagnosed by the presence of clue cells on microscopy, a vaginal pH ≥ 4.5, or the fishy odor of vaginal discharge. The Nugent score is regarded as the gold standard diagnostic criterion for BV. This laboratory-based method quantifies the number of Lactobacillus spp. present in vaginal swabs compared to other bacterial morphotypes such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and Prevotella/Bacteroides spp. Amsel's criteria are generally preferred in clinical settings since the Nugent criteria require considerable time and expert microscopic skills.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^113FPMWu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The reference standards remain as Gram stain with Nugent scoring for bacterial vaginosis and culture for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Nucleic acid amplification testing is generally accepted as a more sensitive diagnostic approach for *T. vaginalis* detection than wet mount microscopy. Challenges exist with the application of these reference methods; Gram stain is a specialized method that not all laboratories offer, and a lengthy turnaround time may occur with culture.

In addition to the accepted reference methods for bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also gives a "Level A" rating for the use of Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis and for wet mount microscopy or commercial diagnostic tests for vulvovaginal candidiasis diagnosis. Nyirjesy et al. found that clinicians often do not follow guidelines set out for the diagnosis of vaginitis owing to a lack of access to tools for in-clinic testing and a lack of awareness of guideline recommendations.

Findings of this study support the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration–cleared nucleic acid amplification testing for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and *T. vaginalis*, the three main causes of vaginitis. This assay, which can be processed on an instrument placed in either physician office laboratories or reference laboratories, takes approximately three hours to run between two and 24 samples simultaneously. Therefore, a same-day result is possible if the physician's office has the instrument readily available on-site.

### Vaginitis [^1139Lyf3]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis are the most common infectious causes of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal lactobacilli of the vagina are replaced by mostly anaerobic bacteria. Diagnosis is commonly made using the Amsel criteria, which include vaginal pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, milky discharge, and the presence of clue cells on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid. Both oral and topical clindamycin and metronidazole are equally effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis.

Symptoms and signs of trichomoniasis are not specific; diagnosis by microscopy is more reliable. Features of trichomoniasis include trichomonads seen microscopically in saline, more leukocytes than epithelial cells, a positive whiff test, and vaginal pH greater than 5.4. Any nitroimidazole drug (e.g. metronidazole) administered orally as a single dose or over a longer period resolves 90 percent of trichomoniasis cases. It is important that sex partners are treated simultaneously.

Most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis are diagnosed by the presence of vulvar inflammation plus vaginal discharge or through microscopic examination of vaginal secretions in 10 percent potassium hydroxide solution. Vaginal pH is usually normal (4.0 to 4.5). Vulvovaginal candidiasis should be treated with one of many topical or oral antifungals, which appear to be equally effective.

Rapid point-of-care tests are available to aid in the accurate diagnosis of infectious vaginitis. Atrophic vaginitis, a form of vaginitis caused by estrogen deficiency, produces symptoms of vaginal dryness and itching.

### The vaginal microbiome: II. Vaginal dysbiotic conditions [^112UAP5S]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Bacterial vaginosis**: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial disorder and is considered the most common cause of vaginal discharge, affecting millions of reproductive-aged women worldwide. It is associated with multiple adverse gynecologic and obstetric consequences, including an increased risk of preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).

- **The microbiome characteristics of BV**: The diagnosis of BV is complicated by the lack of consensus on its definition, the natural variability of the vaginal microbiome in women of diverse racial backgrounds, and its polymicrobial etiology. Symptomatic BV can be described as a syndrome based on the presence of clinical features (such as discharge and/or malodor) interpreted by vaginal fluid characteristics (i.e. Amsel criteria) or gram stain evaluation (the Nugent score), without a specific etiologic agent being defined. Bacterial vaginosis is not characterized by inflammation on microscopy, marked by the relative absence of polymorphonuclear cells on wet mount, and was therefore termed "vaginosis" instead of "vaginitis". Despite decades of research, the etiology of BV remains unknown; it is a form of vaginal dysbiosis, marked by the depletion of lactobacilli and the proliferation of various gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria.

- **Epidemiology and risk factors**: The epidemiology of BV strongly suggests that it may be acquired via sexual transmission and is associated with various risk factors, including having a new sexual partner, douching, and smoking. Although usually treatable with antibiotics, additional research is needed to fully understand its transmission and management strategies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^115344AK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Although vaginal symptoms are common, the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is not standardized. Diagnostic approaches and the appropriateness of treatment were evaluated for women with symptoms of vaginitis who were seeking care at community practice sites.

- **Methods**: Three hundred three symptomatic women, across eight University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-affiliated clinics, were evaluated per standard office-based practice. Four of five vaginal swabs (one cryopreserved) were collected for a US Food and Drug Administration-authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for vaginitis/vaginosis diagnosis, Nugent scoring (BV), yeast culture (VVC), and a second NAAT (for TV). Two hundred ninety women had evaluable samples. Medical record extraction facilitated verification of treatments prescribed within seven days of the index visit and return visit frequency within 90 days.

- **Results**: Women had a mean age of 29.4 ± 6.5 years, 90% were not pregnant, 79% were of white race, and 38% reported vaginitis treatment within the past month. Point-of-care tests, including vaginal pH (15%), potassium hydroxide/whiff (21%), and wet mount microscopy (17%), were rarely performed. Of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis, 81 (47%) received one or more inappropriate prescriptions. Of the 120 women without BV, TV, or VVC, 41 (34%) were prescribed antibiotics and/or antifungals. Among women without infectious vaginitis, return visits for vaginitis symptoms were more common among women treated empirically.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^1156TcnZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is a frequent reason that women seek medical care; its accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment and for preventing recurrence. The three most common causes are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on Amsel's or Nugent criteria. Criteria for vulvovaginal candidiasis include the presence of budding yeast or pseudohyphae on wet mount or a positive culture with or without compatible clinical findings. Trichomoniasis is diagnosed through observation on wet mount or in culture, or via biochemical detection through antigen-, nucleic acid hybridization-, or nucleic acid amplification-based assays.

Standard of care testing relies heavily upon microscope equipment and training and requires certification per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. In addition, the majority of real-world diagnoses are empirical, and less than half of all treatments are based on objective assays, which can result in incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Molecular assays that target bacterial vaginosis, spp., have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to results compared to culture-based methods. This may be especially important for bacterial vaginosis, which involves multiple organisms of the vaginal microbiota.

The Food and Drug Administration-approved BD MAX vaginal panel (investigational test; Becton, Dickinson and Company, BD Life Sciences — Diagnostic Systems), using the BD MAX system, involves amplification-based DNA detection for all three common causes of vaginitis.

### Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation [^114zCios]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (1991). High credibility.

The Nugent Scoring System for Bacterial Vaginosis is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This scoring system is based on the microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, specifically the presence and quantity of Lactobacillus morphotypes, Gardnerella vaginalis morphotypes, and curved gram-variable rods. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with a score of 7 or higher indicating bacterial vaginosis.

The Nugent Scoring System is primarily used in research settings due to its complexity and the need for a trained microscopist. It is considered the gold standard for diagnosing BV, but it may not be suitable for use in primary care or resource-limited settings where microscopy is not readily available. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in postmenopausal women due to changes in vaginal flora.

The Nugent scoring system is derived from the presence of certain bacterial morphotypes, specifically Lactobacillus morphotypes, Gardnerella and Bacteroides species, and curved Gram-negative rods.

To determine the score, a set number is assigned to each category based on the concentration observed:

- **Lactobacillus morphotypes**:
	- None = 4
	- Less than 1 = 3
	- 1 to 4 = 2
	- 5 to 30 = 1
	- 30 or more = 0

- **Gardnerella and Bacteroides species**:
	- None =

### Causes of chronic vaginitis: Analysis of a prospective database of affected women [^116bYGmJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To compare women with different chronic vaginal symptoms with a wide variety of sociodemographic, health, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics.

- **Methods**: Serially recruited subjects answered a questionnaire that asked about demographic information and symptoms and measured depression and stress scores. Patients underwent a standardized history, physical examination, and laboratory examination. Patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, physiologic leukorrhea, and other diagnoses were compared with one another. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc analyses were used for categorical and continuous data analysis.

- **Results**: Two hundred patients were enrolled in this study. The most common diagnoses were contact dermatitis (21%), recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (20.5%), atrophic vaginitis (14.5%), and vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (12.5%); 18% of women had two or more diagnoses. In the overall study sample, the mean age was 38.4 years, 78% were white, and 55% were college educated. Sixty-two percent had symptoms for over a year. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis patients were older and less likely to be menstruating. Those with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome had more frequent complaints of dyspareunia. Patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis felt that their symptoms had the greatest negative impact on work and social life. There were high rates of psychiatric disorder (43.5%) and atopic disease (42.5%).

### Clinical evaluation of a new molecular test for the detection of organisms causing vaginitis and vaginosis [^1153B6dU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

The study included 1488 participants, with 1478 providing evaluable specimens for at least one of the four MVP reportable results. Specimens were primarily excluded due to unavailable, invalid, or incomplete comparator test results and indeterminate MVP results. The evaluable study population comprised specimens from 1422 participants for BV, 1439 for Candida results, and 1407 for TV.

- **Study specimens**: The disposition of enrolled participants regarding self-collected and clinician-collected vaginal swabs is illustrated in Fig. 2. Exclusion reasons included unavailable/incomplete comparator test results, invalid comparator test results, incomplete or non-determinate Xpert test results, and incomplete specimen collection.

The demographics of the 1478 participants whose specimens were included in the final data sets reveal that 38.9% were between the ages of 18 and 29. The majority of enrolled women were white (56.4%) or Black/African American (39.2%). Half of these women (50.0%) reported a history of BV, with only 7.4% reporting pregnancy at the time of enrollment.

- **Clinical performance**: For overall MVP performance, as shown in Table 3, the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) for BV detection in CVS specimens were 93.8%, while in SVS specimens, these were 94.0% and 92.9%, respectively. Candida spp. group detection showed a PPA and NPA of 98.0% and 94.6% in CVS specimens, and 97.5% and 92.1% in SVS specimens.

### Clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^113F2uPq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate the accuracy of Amsel's criteria individually or in combinations of two for the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted. The study enrolled 135 women at UNICAMP and evaluated Amsel's four clinical criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values were calculated for each criterion individually, in combinations of two, and for the classic test when at least three criteria were present. The Nugent method was used as the gold standard.

The most sensitive individual criteria were pH and vaginal discharge (97%), although vaginal discharge had the lowest specificity (26%). The criterion with the highest specificity was the presence of clue cells (86%). The combination of two criteria demonstrated sensitivity ranging from 83% to 93% and specificity from 82% to 94%.

The study concluded that the accuracy of Amsel's clinical criteria, whether individually or in combinations of two, was as accurate as the presence of at least three criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^114JQ6ZE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

A strength of this study is the assessment of specimens collected prospectively from a large cohort of women enrolled from 21 geographic sites and a variety of clinical practice types across the United States. Also important are the employment of the consensus Nugent score and standardized methodology for obtaining Amsel criteria results for BV diagnosis, the use of dual media culture for the diagnosis of candidiasis, and the use of highly sensitive FDA-cleared NAATs for STI diagnosis.

Limitations of the study include the lack of comparative analyses for the 317 women in the cohort with signs and symptoms of vaginitis/vaginosis, but who were negative for BV, candidiasis, and all four STIs; some of the women enrolled in this category were originally diagnosed with non-infectious causes of irritation/itching/burning such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, irritant dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. We also did not include HIV infection status in the analysis of the women enrolled in the study, although most (99%) women in the cohort were categorized as HIV-negative. Finally, the number of CT and NG infections in the cohort studied was relatively small, which may have led to inaccuracies in estimating the significance of the association of these STIs with clinical and laboratory diagnoses. In spite of this, we found that, similar to previous studies, women with only CT infections had an OR of 2.44 for infection in BV+ vs BV− (adjusting for VVC), although this increase in risk was not significantly different from controls.

In conclusion, we found high rates for sexually transmitted infections.

### Bacterial vaginosis modifies the association between hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition [^114kjunj]. AIDS (2018). High credibility.

The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis is variable based on the clinical setting and may vary by race and behavioral practices. Although the prevalence may be underestimated as many women are asymptomatic, the greatest burden of bacterial vaginosis is noted in sub-Saharan Africa. Further, the sensitivity and specificity of clinical techniques are variable in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

For example, using Amsel's criteria with a wet-prep, which can be done easily as a point-of-care approach, is only about 70% sensitive for bacterial vaginosis. The presence of clue cells on wet-prep is highly sensitive and specific for bacterial vaginosis. Nugent scores from a Gram stain, currently considered the gold standard for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis, may have greater sensitivity but can be subject to variability in interpretation.

Utilizing more sensitive microbiome techniques, such as 16S gene rRNA sequencing, offers an opportunity to understand the microenvironment at the level of specific microbial species and define microbial diversity with a more specific methodology. Although historically, symptomatic bacterial vaginosis has been attributed to Gardnerella vaginalis, these newer technologies have identified other bacteria associated with dysbiotic vaginal microbial states, including Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp., and members of Clostridiales sometimes referred to as bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB).

Further, as recent studies have suggested that specific microbacteria in the vaginal environment may have a direct impact on health outcomes, continued research in this area is essential.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^113G3Ueo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

To compare the performance of vaginitis diagnosis based on clinical assessment to molecular detection of organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and Trichomonas vaginalis using a vaginal panel assay.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study included 489 enrolled participants from five collection sites where those with vaginitis symptoms had a vaginal assay swab collected during their visit and a clinical diagnosis made. The swab was later sent to a separate testing site to perform the vaginal panel assay. Outcome measures include positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (and accompanying 95% CIs) of clinical assessment with the vaginal panel assay. p < 0.05 was used to distinguish significant differences in paired proportions between the vaginal panel assay and clinical diagnosis, using the McNemar test. Inter-rater agreement between the two diagnostic approaches was determined using Cohen's kappa coefficient.

- **Results**: Clinical diagnosis had a positive percent agreement with the vaginal panel assay of 57.9% (95% CI 51.5–64.2%), 53.5% (95% CI 44.5–62.4%), and 28.0% (95% CI 12.1–49.4%) for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis, respectively. Negative percent agreement for clinical diagnosis was 80.2% (95% CI 74.3–85.2%), 77.0% (95% CI 72.1–81.4%), and 99.8% (95% CI 98.7–99.9%), respectively. Sixty-five percent (67/103), 44% (26/59), and 56% (10/18) of patients identified as having bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis by assay, respectively, were not treated for the infections.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: A systematic review [^115wAeHr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria.

- **Literature search**: PubMed, ScienceDirect, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane database searches were conducted until May 13th, 2023. The comprehensive search was performed using the following medical subject heading (MeSH) keywords: "bacterial vaginosis" OR "BV" AND "risk factors" AND "adverse outcomes" AND "pregnant" OR "pregnancy", with articles published between 2013 and 2023. Finally, the reference lists of articles were screened to determine any additional studies on BV among pregnant women in general. Searching and collecting the relevant papers were carried out independently by two reviewers.

- **Eligibility criteria**: A specific screening process was followed to include or exclude studies in this systematic review, conducted by two different authors based on predefined eligibility criteria. The selection process of articles is presented in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). The inclusion criteria were: (1) observational, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses on the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of BV among pregnant women, and (2) articles published in the English language only. The exclusion criteria were: (1) editorials, basic literature reviews, and case report studies, (2) conference abstracts, preprints, and duplicate publications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^113LbkQT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Although vaginal symptoms are common, the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is not standardized. Diagnostic approaches and the appropriateness of treatment were evaluated for women with symptoms of vaginitis who were seeking care at community practice sites.

Three hundred and three symptomatic women, across eight University of Pittsburgh Medical Center–affiliated clinics, were evaluated per standard office-based practice. Four out of five vaginal swabs (one cryopreserved) were collected for a US Food and Drug Administration–authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for vaginitis/vaginosis diagnosis; Nugent scoring (BV); yeast culture (VVC); and a second NAAT (for TV). Two hundred and ninety women had evaluable samples. Medical record extraction facilitated the verification of treatments prescribed within seven days of the index visit and the frequency of return visits within 90 days.

Women had a mean age of 29.4 ± 6.5 years, with 90% not pregnant, 79% of white race, and 38% reporting vaginitis treatment within the past month. Point-of-care tests, including vaginal pH (15%), potassium hydroxide/whiff (21%), and wet mount microscopy (17%), were rarely performed. Of the 170 women having a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis, 81 (47%) received one or more inappropriate prescriptions. Of the 120 women without BV, TV, or VVC, 41 (34%) were prescribed antibiotics and/or antifungals. Among women without infectious vaginitis, return visits for vaginitis symptoms were more common among women treated empirically.

### Characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women [^1156duqF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be common among women who report having sex with women (WSW) and often occurs in both members of monogamous couples. The results of Gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with BV in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of the 326 WSW included in this study. Lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had H₂O₂-producing strains.

- **Risk factors**: BV was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. Neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with BV.

- **Monogamous couples**: Vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%) of 58 monogamous couples; BV was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (p < 0.001, compared with expected distribution). BV was common among subjects who did not douche, did not have sexual activity with male partners, or did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for BV exist.

These data support the hypothesis that the sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for the acquisition of BV.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116G6uaa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

As women are seen in different clinical settings for symptoms indicative of vaginitis, it is important for treating clinicians to be aware that women with symptoms of vaginitis could be at an increased risk for an STI. The increased risk of some STIs in women who are positive for BV or Candida spp provides a strong impetus for comprehensive testing for STI. Integration of molecular testing for vaginitis and STI would establish consistent, objective, and sensitive testing methods, regardless of clinic type, to accurately identify and treat patients for these conditions.

### Analysis of standard methods for diagnosing vaginitis: HIV infection does not complicate the diagnosis of vaginitis [^115qMaQb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether the standard diagnostic methods for vaginitis behave similarly among HIV-infected and at-risk seronegative women.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed pairwise comparisons over time (1994–2003) for the different diagnostic methods for bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Nugent score and Amsel criteria), vulvovaginal candidiasis (potassium hydroxide smear and Pap smear), and trichomoniasis (culture, wet mount, and Pap smear) among HIV-infected and at-risk HIV seronegative women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study cohort. We stratified subjects by HIV status and among the HIV-infected women by CD4+ cell count strata.

- **Results**: For BV and trichomoniasis, kappa statistics comparing clinical diagnostic methods to laboratory-based methods improved after the first year. Significant differences in overall kappa statistics between HIV-infected and at-risk HIV-seronegative women were found only for vulvovaginal candidiasis, where potassium hydroxide smear and Pap smear findings were more tightly correlated among HIV-infected women than among at-risk HIV-seronegative women; among these HIV-infected women, concordance was highest at lower CD4 cell counts. No significant differences in kappa statistics were found for the diagnostic methods of BV or trichomoniasis, neither by HIV status nor CD4 cell count strata.

The standard diagnostic tests for BV, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis behave similarly in HIV-infected and at-risk seronegative women. Training and experience are critical for the accurate performance of the diagnostic methods.

### Nonspecific vaginitis. Diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations [^117UifPn]. The American Journal of Medicine (1983). High credibility.

Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis is a clinical tool used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This calculator is applicable to women presenting with symptoms of vaginal discharge, discomfort, or odor.

The clinical utility of Amsel's criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which can help guide appropriate treatment and prevent potential complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections.

The criteria include the presence of at least three of the following: thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge; clue cells on microscopy; pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5; and a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after the addition of 10% KOH (whiff test).

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of Amsel's criteria. However, it should be noted that this diagnostic tool may not be as accurate in postmenopausal women, as the vaginal environment naturally changes with age and may affect the results. Additionally, it should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other clinical findings and tests.

The Amsel's diagnostic criteria calculator helps determine the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis based on four specific clinical features. Each feature is assessed to ascertain its presence:

- **Homogeneous vaginal discharge**: This refers to a discharge that is consistently thin, white, and homogeneous in texture.

### Leukorrhea and bacterial vaginosis as in-office predictors of cervical infection in high-risk women [^115Y8RiY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether microscopic detection of leukorrhea or bacterial vaginosis can identify patients at high risk for cervical infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and to assess if pregnancy influences the predictive value of these findings.

The methods involved a wet-mount screening examination of vaginal discharge performed on all new patients seen at two resident-staffed clinics serving primarily indigent women. Leukorrhea was defined as more than 10 white blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination. The Amsel criteria were used to determine the presence of bacterial vaginosis, with a positive clue cell test result defined as more than 20% of epithelial cells. The diagnoses of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infection were established by deoxyribonucleic acid amplification tests.

The study population consisted of 194 women, 118 (61%) of whom were pregnant. Overall, 11% of women had positive cultures for chlamydia or gonorrhea. Although both leukorrhea and clue cells were independently associated with positive cervical cultures, multivariate analysis found that clue cells did not enhance the predictive value of leukorrhea alone among both pregnant (relative risk [RR] = 15.7) and nonpregnant (RR = 58.7) women. Negative predictive values for the screening test remained comparably high (98–100%), regardless of pregnancy status.

In conclusion, leukorrhea, whether in the presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis, was strongly associated with cervical infections with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae among both pregnant and nonpregnant patients.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114fsSas]. MMWR. Recommendations and reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bacterial vaginosis — more specifically antibiotic therapy — the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend offering any of the following regimens as second-line therapy for patients with BV:

- **Clindamycin 300 mg PO BID for 7 days**: Administer clindamycin orally twice a day for a week.

- **Clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days**: Use clindamycin ovules intravaginally at bedtime for three consecutive days.

- **Secnidazole 2 g PO granules in a single dose**: Provide secnidazole in a single oral dose.

- **Tinidazole 2 g PO once daily for 2 days**: Administer tinidazole orally once daily for two days.

- **Tinidazole 1 g PO once daily for 5 days**: Administer tinidazole orally once daily for five days.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis [^115PEgkq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Recent advances have furthered the understanding of their pathophysiology. Proper diagnosis, based on appropriate office evaluations and, in complicated cases, laboratory tests, is key to the rational selection of therapy. For women who have routine, uncomplicated episodes of VVC or BV, a variety of effective treatment options exist. Recurrent disease remains a challenge for these conditions, but it can often be managed successfully.

### Accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard [^111ynbGt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

To estimate the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of the three most common causes of acute vulvovaginal symptoms (bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis vaginitis, and trichomoniasis vaginalis), a traditional, standardized clinical diagnostic protocol was compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard.

This prospective clinical comparative study involved a sample of 535 active-duty United States military women presenting with vulvovaginal symptoms. Clinical diagnoses were made by research staff using a standardized protocol, which included history-taking, physical examination (including pelvic examination), determination of vaginal pH, a vaginal fluid amines test, and wet-prep microscopy. Vaginal fluid samples were obtained for DNA analysis. Importantly, the research clinicians were blinded to the DNA results.

The participants reported symptoms like abnormal discharge (50%), itching/irritation (33%), malodor (10%), burning (4%), or others such as vulvar pain and vaginal discomfort. According to the laboratory standard, there were 225 cases (42%) of bacterial vaginosis, 76 cases (14%) of candidiasis vaginitis, 8 cases (1.5%) of trichomoniasis vaginalis, 87 cases of mixed infections (16%), and 139 negative cases (26%). The clinical diagnosis showed a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 70.0% for bacterial vaginosis, 83.8% and 84.8% for candidiasis vaginitis, and 84.6% and 99.6% for trichomoniasis vaginalis when compared with the DNA probe standard.

In conclusion, when compared with a DNA probe standard, clinical diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity and specificity ranging from 81–85% and 70–99%, respectively.

### Is bacterial vaginosis a stronger risk factor for preterm birth when it is diagnosed earlier in gestation [^116arNBN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study statement is that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis, although this contention is based on small numbers of women.

- **Study design**: In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (< 7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation.

- **Results**: The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10.

- **Conclusion**: Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112SQVmb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Our findings demonstrate the limited accuracy of clinical diagnosis as an approach for managing vaginitis caused by bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, or *T. vaginalis* compared with the vaginal assay panel among women with symptoms of vaginitis seen in clinical settings. Consistent with the results here, Schwebke et al. previously demonstrated that the vaginal panel assay had better sensitivity (using a laboratory reference standard) than clinical diagnosis for all three causes of vaginitis. We observed that 65%, 44%, and 56% of individuals with vaginal assay-positive, clinical diagnosis-negative results for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and *T. vaginalis*, respectively, went untreated. Conversely, those women who were negative for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and *T. vaginalis* by assay testing were still overtreated according to clinical diagnosis 15%, 17%, and less than 1% of the time.

Previously, Hillier et al. demonstrated that almost half the women with a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received at least one inappropriate treatment. Not surprisingly, return visits based on persistent vaginitis symptoms were common in that study, occurring in 35%, 17%, and 42% of cases associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and *T. vaginalis*, respectively.

We found a significant difference in the paired proportions between the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the vaginal panel assay. Although Amsel's criteria represent the primary in…

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^112HQV73]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The investigational molecular test used in this study is the first Food and Drug Administration-cleared nucleic acid amplification test for the detection of the three major causes of vaginitis: bacterial vaginosis, species, and others. For these three causes, the investigational test consistently outperformed in-clinic testing and clinician diagnosis for sensitivity, with no depreciation in specificity [Tables 1 to 3 and Fig. 2 and 3]. Importantly, the investigational test had the highest overall percent agreement (OPA) with the reference test and better negative predictive value (NPV) for all causes compared to in-clinic testing and clinician diagnosis. Finally, the investigational test resulted in high diagnostic accuracy and likelihood ratios across all three vaginitis causes.

Traditionally, a diagnosis of vaginitis has been performed through clinical findings, medical history, and in-clinic testing, with the last representing an essential component for establishing a clinician diagnosis. For bacterial vaginosis, some combination of the Amsel's criteria is the mainstay for standard of care diagnosis in the clinic. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines suggest that three out of four Amsel's criteria should be positive (Amsel's original). However, Amsel's criteria are known to be highly subjective and open to interpretation. In the study, of all Amsel's components, pH had the highest sensitivity, while the whiff test had the highest specificity [Table 1]. Other studies have reported that the presence of clue cells is the key pathognomonic feature of bacterial vaginosis, but this requires high technical expertise and appropriate laboratory conditions.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112LEkkc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of vaginitis has been inaccurate. Wet mount microscopy has very low sensitivity for all three causes of vaginitis. Availability of a microscope, appropriate training, and certification (e.g. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) are required to perform microscopy in the clinical setting and accurately identify the correct causes of vaginitis. Non-microscopy-based diagnostic criteria, with either low sensitivity (e.g. vaginal discharge, whiff test) or low specificity (e.g. vaginal pH), do not consistently facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Women who receive empiric treatment for vaginitis without a known etiology are more likely to return for a physician visit within 90 days.

New technologies using molecular (DNA) targets that identify the etiologic factors for vaginitis have recently been developed to address some limitations associated with onsite testing during clinical visits. Nucleic acid amplification tests can achieve both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting the three main infectious causes of vaginitis. In a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection compared with Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis and with wet mount microscopy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and T vaginalis, while maintaining comparable specificity. This work suggests that nucleic acid amplification tests are a diagnostic improvement over the traditional clinical algorithms largely used in settings such as primary care physician offices.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: A systematic review [^116nFRSR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Data extraction was performed independently based on a data collection sheet designed by two reviewers. One person extracted the information and another person evaluated it. A list of included information was collected during the data extraction process, which has been tabulated as follows: (1) first author's name and study year, (2) country/region of study, (3) total number of study subjects, (4) study setting, (5) age range of participants, (6) patients' characteristics, (7) prevalence of BV, (8) name of microorganism involved, (9) risk factors of BV, (10) symptoms, (11) adverse outcomes in pregnancy, and (12) summary of findings (Table 1). Although a formal quality assessment tool was not utilized in this systematic review, the methodological rigor of the included studies was considered during the review process. Key aspects, such as study design, sample size, clarity of outcome measures, and statistical methods, were critically reviewed to ensure the reliability and validity of the findings. This qualitative assessment provided a basis for interpreting the results and drawing conclusions.

- **Study characteristics and qualitative findings**: Table 1 presents the study characteristics and qualitative findings on the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

- **Outcome measures**: Various adverse outcomes in relation to BV were investigated among the pregnant women receiving antenatal care. These outcomes included PTD, PTB, PROM, LBW, preterm labor (PTL), spontaneous abortion, premature baby, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), chorioamnionitis, and intrauterine fetal death.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^111tAqdi]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a strong independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. BV is found in 9% to 23% of pregnant women. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, pruritus, or malodor, but often women with BV are asymptomatic.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether screening and treating pregnant women for BV reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

- **Data sources**: Randomized clinical trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that measured pregnancy outcomes were identified from multiple searches in MEDLINE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Library, and national experts.

- **Study selection**: All randomized controlled trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that specifically measured pregnancy outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: The following information was abstracted: study design and blinding, diagnostic methods, antibiotic interventions, timing of antibiotic treatment in pregnancy, criteria for treatment, comorbidities, demographic details, risk factors for preterm delivery such as previous preterm delivery, compliance, rates of spontaneous and total preterm delivery less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks, preterm premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight less than 2500 grams, spontaneous abortion, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal sepsis. For each study, we measured the effect of treatment by calculating the difference in the rate of a given pregnancy outcome in the control group minus the treatment group (the absolute risk reduction [ARR]).

### Bacterial vaginosis in sexually experienced and non-sexually experienced young women entering the military [^115Mo8pF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis, as determined by Nugent Gram stain criteria, in a national sample of young women entering recruit training. This study also aimed to examine clinical associations with bacterial vaginosis and evaluate the performance of a pH test card and Papanicolaou smear against Gram stain as screening tools for bacterial vaginosis.

A cross-sectional study of 1,938 women was conducted. Self-collected vaginal swabs were applied to a colorimetric pH test card and a glass slide for Gram stain evaluation according to the Nugent criteria. Papanicolaou smears and samples for sexually transmitted disease screening were collected during routine entry pelvic examinations.

- **Results**: Bacterial vaginosis prevalence was 27%, with 28% in sexually experienced and 18% in non-sexually experienced women (P = 0.001). Among Asian/Pacific Islanders, the prevalence was 11%, which was lower than in other nonwhite ethnic groups (P = 0.004). Clinically, bacterial vaginosis was directly related to multiple sexual partners (P = 0.026), self-report of vaginal discharge (P = 0.001), self-report of vaginal odor (P < .001), and Chlamydia trachomatis infection (P = 0.002). It was inversely related to hormonal contraceptive use (P = 0.013). Notably, vaginal discharge did not achieve statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Compared with the Nugent criteria, the sensitivities and specificities for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis were as follows: colorimetric pH test: 72% and 67%; Papanicolaou smear: 72% and 79%, respectively.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^113LrPTr]. JAMA (2004). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using a combination of physical examination, pH testing, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

- **Data sources**: Using a structured literature review, information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures was abstracted. The review included published articles from 1966 to April 2003 that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under terms such as diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

- **Study selection**: Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they provided diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

- **Data extraction**: All three authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

- **Data synthesis**: Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to confidently distinguish between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0).

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^114Ehepx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The results from the study support the potential utility of the investigational test in the differential diagnosis of vaginitis. While some laboratory tests take 2 to 7 days to provide results, the investigational test results are generally available within 24 hours. Although future work is required to establish the cost/benefit ratio regarding the application of this investigational test in a practical setting, its high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (across a large spectrum of disease prevalence) should impart benefits and decrease the chance of needless treatment of patients that are negative for the disease. This may prove especially important in cases of vaginitis that involve multiple causes, where the sensitivity of clinician diagnosis may be limited.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^113wk5oq]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a disease that can be associated with several clinical features and risk factors.

- **Positive clinical tests and symptoms**: Associated symptoms include a positive vaginal sialidase test and a fishy vaginal odor. Patients may also experience an increase in vaginal fluid pH, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, and may present with a diagnosis of vaginitis.

- **Risk factors**: Known risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include practices such as douching, having multiple sexual partners, and HIV infection. A natural lack of lactobacilli bacteria in the vaginal flora is also a significant factor.

- **Diagnostic indicators**: Diagnostic indicators include a positive Gardnerella vaginalis DNA probe test, the presence of clue cells on a wet mount, and white or gray vaginal discharge observable on vaginal walls. Please note that even if there is no history of vaginal odor, bacterial vaginosis should still be considered if other symptoms or risk factors are present.

### What's new in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis [^115iKS42]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Most importantly, there is recognition of different subgroups of women with BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged behind, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing the disease.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin summary, number 215 [^112rrSZy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as inflammation or infection of the vagina and is associated with a spectrum of symptoms, including vulvovaginal itching, burning, irritation, dyspareunia, "fishy" vaginal odor, and abnormal vaginal discharge. Vaginal symptoms are some of the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists and may have important consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, sexual functioning, and self-image. Distinguishing vaginal from vulvar symptoms is important to direct evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this document is to provide updated evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the common causes of vaginitis in nonpregnant patients. Information on the treatment of vaginitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is covered elsewhere. Guidelines are subject to change. For the most up-to-date information on vaginitis diagnosis and treatment, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases webpage, which is available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^116y96DW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Clinical diagnosis and bacterial vaginosis detection**: The clinical diagnosis agreed with vaginal panel assay testing for vulvovaginal candidiasis identification in 68 cases but incorrectly called 59 cases negative that were positive by assay testing (positive percent agreement: 53.5%; 95% CI: 44.5–62.4%). Both diagnostic modalities resulted in negative vulvovaginal candidiasis results in 261 cases. However, the clinical diagnosis inaccurately detected 78 positive cases (false-positive rate: 23.0%) classified as negative by the assay (negative percent agreement: 77.0%; 95% CI: 72.1–81.4%). The difference between the two diagnostic methods was not significant (P = 0.124).

- **Clinical diagnosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis detection**: The clinical diagnosis of T vaginalis agreed with vaginal panel assay testing in seven cases but failed to identify 18 cases that were positive by assay testing (positive percent agreement: 28.0%; 95% CI: 12.1–49.4%). A total of 440 cases were classified as negative by both diagnostic methods, with one case (false-positive rate: 0.2%) classified as positive by clinical diagnosis but negative by the assay (negative percent agreement: 99.8%; 95% CI: 98.7–99.9%). The difference between the two diagnostic methods was statistically significant (P = 0.001).

### Deep neural networks offer morphologic classification and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^111g9fiw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is caused by the excessive and imbalanced growth of bacteria in the vagina, affecting 30 to 50% of women. Gram staining followed by Nugent scoring, based on bacterial morphotypes under the microscope, is considered the gold standard for BV diagnosis; however, this method is often labor-intensive and time-consuming, with results varying among individuals. We developed and optimized a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to automatically identify and classify three categories of Nugent scores from microscope images.

The CNN model was initially created using a panel of microscopic images with Nugent scores determined by experts. The model was trained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss function and optimized using a momentum optimizer. Separate sets of images collected from three hospitals were evaluated by the CNN model. It comprised 25 convolutional layers, 2 pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. The model achieved 82.4% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity with 5,815 validation images when altered vaginal flora and BV were considered positive samples. These rates were superior to those achieved by top-level technologists and obstetricians in China.

Our model's generalization capability was notably strong, exhibiting 75.1% accuracy across three categories of Nugent scores on an independent test set of 1,082 images. This accuracy was 6.6% higher than the average achieved by three technologists, each holding bachelor's degrees in medicine and qualified to make diagnostic decisions.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^112THiFT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The **sensitivity of diagnostic methods** for detection of one or multiple causes of vaginitis was evaluated. The sensitivity values for in-clinic testing, clinician diagnosis, and the investigational test are shown for bacterial vaginosis and other related conditions. The investigational test demonstrated a relatively high sensitivity, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.1%, surpassing the original Amsel test's 73.5% (P < 0.0001), the modified Amsel test's 78.4% (P < 0.0001), and clinician diagnosis at 74.5% (P < 0.0001).

The positive predictive value (PPV) of the investigational test was also higher compared to other methods, although this difference was not statistically significant. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in the study was recorded at 58%. Additional data, including likelihood ratios, for the investigational test versus clinician diagnosis and in-clinic testing for bacterial vaginosis can be found in supplementary materials.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^114JT2g9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical diagnosis occurred at the time of the visit without knowledge of the results obtained from the vaginal panel assay and was based on signs and symptoms related to vaginal discharge and wet mount microscopy-based diagnostic procedures, according to the local standard of care.

Vaginal panel assay testing was performed using a vaginal swab (BD MAX Urine Vaginal Endocervical Specimen Collection Swab) and a sample buffer tube in which the swab was inserted. This vaginal swab can be collected by a health care professional or by the patient, provided self-collection occurs in a clinical setting. The amplified, molecular-based assay provides qualitative (positive or negative) results for bacterial vaginosis, the Candida group (consisting of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. dubliniensis, plus C. glabrata and C. krusei separately owing to potential antifungal resistance), and T. vaginalis. The assay directly detects DNA associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis and T. vaginalis, and determines bacterial vaginosis status using a bioinformatics algorithm that detects the presence, absence, and relative load of bacterial vaginosis markers (Lactobacillus species [L. crispatus and L. jensenii], Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera -1, and bacterial vaginosis–associated bacteria-2). The vaginal panel assay was performed at a separate testing site in Quebec, Canada. The clinical diagnosis result was not available before conducting the assay.

Outcome measurements included positive, negative, and overall percent agreement for clinical diagnosis compared with the vaginal panel assay.

### Vaginitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25%, and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases.

Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin.

The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplificat.

### Are a speculum examination and wet mount always necessary for patients with vaginal symptoms? A pilot randomized controlled trial [^113R4ubq]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The suggested evaluation of vaginal symptoms is based on the wet mount diagnosis of candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis. We wondered if patients with vaginal symptoms could be managed initially based solely on symptoms.

- **Methods**: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in two urban family practice clinics and enrolled 46 premenopausal, nonpregnant women with acute vaginal symptoms. In the control arm, women were managed based on a speculum examination and wet mount. In the intervention arm, women were managed based on symptoms. Women were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis and called two weeks later to assess symptom resolution, adverse medication effects, need for revisit, and satisfaction with care.

- **Results**: Forty-one of 44 women (93%) felt better two weeks after the visit; 28 (64%) had complete resolution of symptoms. The intervention arm had slightly better resolution of symptoms (P = 0.046); there were no other differences between the two arms. Three women were diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases (trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea).

- **Conclusions**: Our pilot study suggests that in selected women, it may be reasonable to initially manage vaginal complaints based on symptoms. These results should be confirmed in other larger trials. Testing for sexually transmitted diseases is important in our population.

### The effect of introduction of a guideline on the management of vaginal discharge and in particular bacterial vaginosis in primary care [^1161vd78]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge, and its association with obstetric and gynecological complications is increasingly recognized. It was our impression that BV was poorly understood and underdiagnosed in family practice.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to explore the management of patients with vaginal symptoms by family practitioners and to determine if management changed after the assimilation of best practice guidelines.

- **Method**: Family practitioners were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire on their perceived practice and to record actual practice when consulted about vaginal symptoms, for a minimum of four weeks. Consensus best practice guidelines were then provided, and practice was recorded for a similar period.

- **Results**: Baseline data was received from 34 practitioners and suggested that the symptoms and signs of different vaginal infections were not well known. Most symptomatic patients were only investigated at re-presentation with unresolved symptoms or at recurrence, and 43% of respondents treated with empirical antifungals as a first-line approach. Pregnant patients were only occasionally asked about symptoms and only occasionally examined if symptomatic. Pre-guideline practice data from 30 practitioners showed 1.2 patient consultations per week, of which 60% were examined and 55% had a high vaginal swab (HVS) sent; only 2% had near-patient tests done. Post-guideline data from 23 family practitioners showed a lower recorded consultation rate at 0.7 per week, but 90% of these patients were examined and 77% had an HVS sent.

### Noncandidal vaginitis: A comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management [^114ubumW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is one of the most common causes of patient visits to gynecologists, primary care providers, and urgent care centers. However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurring symptoms despite treatment. The three most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease.

The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into one of two diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis.

The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease.

We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.

### Vulvovaginal symptoms in women with bacterial vaginosis [^113s9HPS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

A substantial, but highly variable, percentage of women with bacterial vaginosis are said to be asymptomatic. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of symptoms among women with bacterial vaginosis compared with women without bacterial vaginosis by direct, explicit, and detailed questioning of these women.

- **Methods**: Women presenting for a routine health care visit at 12 health department clinics in Birmingham, Alabama, were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study of vaginal flora. At the first visit, they underwent a pelvic examination, lower genital tract microbiological evaluation, and an interview that included detailed questions regarding lower genital tract symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms among women with and without bacterial vaginosis (Gram stain score 7 or higher) was compared.

- **Results**: Among 2,888 women without gonorrhea, Chlamydia, or trichomonas 75% of women with and 82% of women without bacterial vaginosis never noted any vaginal odor in the past 6 months (P < 0.001). The corresponding values were 63% and 65% for never noting vaginal "wetness" (P = 0.02); 58% and 57% for vaginal discharge (P = 0.65); 91% and 86% for irritation (P = 0.004); 88% and 85% for itching (P = 0.64); and 96% and 94% for dysuria (P = 0.002), respectively. Cumulatively, 58% of women with bacterial vaginosis noted odor, discharge, and/or wetness in the past 6 months compared with 57% of women without bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.70).

- **Conclusion**: The two classic symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, discharge and odor, are each reported by a minority of women with bacterial vaginosis.

### The diagnosis and treatment of infectious vaginitis [^115KpjM6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the vagina as a result of infectious agents is very common, occurring both as an overgrowth of normal or common colonizers and as a frank infection. The most common causes of infectious vaginitis are yeast, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasites. These infections produce an increase in vaginal secretion, vulvar symptoms such as itching or irritation from contact with irritating vaginal fluid, and sometimes odor. A careful microscopic examination of vaginal secretions generally yields the correct diagnosis. However, atypical or recalcitrant disease deserves a confirmatory culture, as noninfectious inflammatory processes can produce similar symptoms.

### Evaluation of clinical methods for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis [^111Qy2g3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether the clinical criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis can be simplified by using two clinical criteria rather than the standard three out of four criteria (Amsel's criteria), a prospective observational study was conducted. A sample of 269 women undergoing vaginal examination at the Women's Primary Care Center, Division of Research, or Colposcopy Clinic at Women & Infants Hospital was used. All four clinical criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis were collected, with Gram stain as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each individual criterion, combinations of criteria, and a colorimetric pH and amine card. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to estimate the preferred pH and percentage of clue cells for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.

The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in our study population was 38.7%. Vaginal pH was identified as the most sensitive criterion, at 89%, and a positive amine odor showed the highest specificity, at 93%. Similar specificity was observed with the combinations of two criteria and Amsel's criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated a preferred pH and percentage of clue cells of 5.0 and 20%, respectively. However, a pH of 4.5 or greater was found to improve sensitivity with a minimal loss of specificity.

In conclusion, the clinical criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis can be simplified to two clinical criteria without losing sensitivity and specificity.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116ZcbgY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginitis, which most often manifests clinically as abnormal discharge, dysuria, odor, or itching, is one of the most common causes of primary care office visits for women in the United States. Women seek care from a variety of provider types or clinical settings including obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN), family planning, family practice, internal medicine, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. For symptomatic women, diagnostic testing often depends on the clinic type, available diagnostic services, and provider assumptions about their clientele. These real-world factors could result in restricted diagnostic testing of some causes of vaginitis, to the exclusion of others.

In addition, comprehensive diagnostic testing for women in primary care settings can be hampered by a reliance on clinical methods (e.g. wet prep microscopy and visual assessment of discharge) that are subjective and/or require specialized equipment and training. In other cases, testing may carry stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As public funds continue to be withdrawn from STD-specific clinical services, primary care providers must take on the additional responsibility of providing these services for their clients. Making this type of testing both simple (e.g. through use of a single sample) and normative (i.e. it is provided for everyone with these symptoms) will both improve services for women and reduce the stigma associated with STI testing.

A distinction is often drawn by providers between vaginitis (which is generally not perceived as an STI) and STIs, which…

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis [^1151hDg8]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. We found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases.

Unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid. In organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with Lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mRNA. However, a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. When the two bacteria were combined, Gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of Lactobacillus jensenii. The loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^115ETtdx]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

**Key messages**: Patients with recurrent bacterial vaginosis more often had remote consultations. Diagnostic tests were not performed in 37% of patients with recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Patients with recent antibiotic use more often present with recurrent complaints. Re-evaluation of the diagnosis is warranted in patients with recurrent symptoms.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^116WD2Q2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

This study had limitations that prevent an exact interpretation of the findings. Several analyses presented here involved observations for each type of infection that were excluded due to noncompliance or inability to report. For example, listing these types of observations as "not compliant" or "not reportable" for the investigational test, instead of "failure to correctly diagnose", may have artificially improved its operating characteristics.

Other limitations include:

- **Overdiagnosis of vaginitis**: The investigational assay may have resulted in an overdiagnosis of vaginitis, as it cannot distinguish nonpathogenic colonization from pathogenic growth. This would be considered in clinician diagnosis. However, the clinical cutoff for the investigational test was set by the reference standard for diagnosing spp. (positive fungal culture report), making the results consistent with everyday practice.

- **Bacterial vaginosis detection**: Bacterial vaginosis may be detected by the Nugent score (7 to 10) but also be asymptomatic. The investigational test showed the best agreement with the Nugent score, which is the gold standard, but may have included asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. The bacterial vaginosis algorithm for the investigational test was set by the composite reference method of concordant positive and negative Nugent and Amsel's criteria. Therefore, only unambiguous specimens for bacterial vaginosis status were used to develop the algorithm.

Additionally, this study employed a cross-sectional design that did not evaluate clinical outcomes for patients with discordant results.
