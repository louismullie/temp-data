D. chromatin, DNA and amino acids.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which components are required for the process of translation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of translation and its essential reactants. Then, I should verify the roles of mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes in decoding and peptide bond formation. Next, I will examine why the distractors are incorrect, including RNA polymerase, DNA, and chromatin. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and confirm it aligns with authoritative sources and mechanistic studies of the ribosome and tRNA function.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: translation is the cellular process of synthesizing proteins using the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA, which implies that mRNA must be present to provide the template for codon sequences that specify amino acids [^8028b499] [^ac180264].

> Wait, let me verify the role of transfer RNA. tRNA is not optional; it is the adaptor that decodes each mRNA codon by base pairing via its anticodon and delivers the cognate amino acid to the ribosome, so translation cannot proceed without tRNA carrying amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain [^8028b499] [^1f149104].

> I need to check the ribosome's role next. The ribosome is the macromolecular machine that reads the mRNA, facilitates codon–anticodon pairing, catalyzes peptide bond formation, and coordinates translocation, so translation requires the ribosome as the central catalytic platform [^403d8a68] [^519bcea9].

> Hold on, let's not conflate transcription with translation. RNA polymerase is required for transcription to synthesize mRNA from DNA, but it is not part of the translation machinery itself, so including RNA polymerase in the translation components would be a mistake even though transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria [^d41b5bd7] [^3f60addd].

> I should double-check the DNA and chromatin distractors. DNA and chromatin belong to the nucleus and are involved in transcription and genome organization, not in the cytoplasmic process of translation, so they are not required components at the translation step itself [^d41b5bd7] [^8028b499].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the answer. Translation requires three essential components: mRNA to provide the codon template, tRNA to decode and deliver amino acids, and ribosomes to execute decoding and peptide synthesis, which matches option A and is consistently supported by mechanistic and definitional sources [^8028b499] [^ac180264] [^519bcea9].

---

The process of translation requires **mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes** [^8028b499] as the essential components. mRNA provides the genetic code, tRNA delivers the correct amino acids, and ribosomes catalyze peptide bond formation and coordinate the process [^403d8a68]. RNA polymerase is not required for translation; it is involved in transcription, not translation [^d41b5bd7]. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes**.

---

## Essential components of translation

### Messenger RNA (mRNA)

mRNA carries the **genetic information** from DNA to the ribosome, where it serves as the template for protein synthesis [^8028b499]. Each mRNA molecule contains a specific sequence of codons that dictate the order of amino acids in the resulting protein [^b29491a3].

---

### Transfer RNA (tRNA)

tRNA molecules are responsible for delivering **amino acids** to the ribosome in the correct sequence specified by the mRNA [^1f149104]. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon region that pairs with a specific codon on the mRNA, ensuring that the correct amino acid is incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain [^519bcea9].

---

### Ribosomes

Ribosomes are large macromolecular complexes composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins [^403d8a68]. They provide the **structural framework** and catalytic activity necessary for translation [^519bcea9]. Ribosomes facilitate the binding of mRNA and tRNA, catalyze the formation of peptide bonds, and coordinate the movement of the mRNA through the ribosome during translation [^f0630c6b].

---

## Role of each component in translation

| **Component** | **Function in translation** |
|-|-|
| mRNA | Provides the genetic template specifying the sequence of amino acids in the protein [^8028b499] |
| tRNA | Delivers amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence specified by the mRNA [^1f149104] |
| Ribosomes | Catalyzes peptide bond formation and coordinates the movement of mRNA and tRNA during translation [^403d8a68] |

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **Option B (mRNA, ribosomes, and RNA polymerase)**: RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, not translation [^d41b5bd7]. It is responsible for synthesizing mRNA from DNA, but it is not required for the process of translation itself [^8a2cdde1].

- **Option C (DNA, mRNA, and RNA polymerase)**: DNA and RNA polymerase are involved in transcription, not translation [^d41b5bd7]. Translation occurs in the cytoplasm and relies on mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes, not directly on DNA or RNA polymerase [^8028b499].

- **Option D (chromatin, DNA, and amino acids)**: Chromatin and DNA are involved in gene regulation and transcription, not translation [^d41b5bd7]. While amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, they are not considered essential components of the translation machinery itself [^8028b499].

---

## Conclusion

Translation is a fundamental biological process that requires the coordinated action of **mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes** [^8028b499]. mRNA provides the genetic template, tRNA delivers the appropriate amino acids, and ribosomes catalyze peptide bond formation and coordinate the entire process [^519bcea9]. RNA polymerase, DNA, and chromatin are not directly involved in translation, making option A the correct answer.

### Repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation in neurological disease [^4acbe310]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

NEXT STEPS IN RAN TRANSLATION

What are the critical next steps in RAN translation research? From the analysis so far, it is clear that research needs to move beyond the observational and into the mechanistic. For example, what are the precise RNA structural, sequence and protein factor requirements for RAN translation? Answering these questions will yield important clues to the breadth and scope of RAN translation. Future analysis also needs to be extended beyond immunological approaches to more detailed structural and biochemical analyses of RAN translation proteins in disease. Antibody-based techniques are often subject to artifacts and technical problems, which may be particularly problematic for antibodies directed against repeat motifs themselves. Additionally multiple approaches will be necessary to validate results, especially given the possibility of overlap between RAN translation and other cellular processes. For example, the products of RAN translation and frameshifting may appear to be identical when looking at regions only downstream of the repeat motif. Given the discovery of RAN translation, previous reports of frameshifting for disorders such as SCA3 and HD (–) warrant re-examination. A more general question is does RAN translation occur across all microsatellite expansion diseases and if so when, where and why? Additional studies will be required to sort out which RAN proteins are toxic and their potential contribution to disease.

### The European physiotherapy guideline for Parkinson's disease: translation for non-english speaking countries [^c8655c4a]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of the European Physiotherapy Guideline for Parkinson's Disease is limited in countries where the official language is not English.

Objective

To provide practical steps on how to translate the European Physiotherapy Guideline for Parkinson's Disease.

Methods

We used the translation process of the Portuguese version as an example of how to define the recommended steps. A combination of a forward-backward-translation and dual-panel approach was used.

Results

Ten recommended translation steps were defined: (1) authorization, (2) translation of sample chapter, (3) physiotherapy expert panel review, (4) backward translation, (5) approval by copyright holders, (6) translation of the remaining sections of the guideline, (7) review of the entire translation by expert panel, (8) review by a user panel, (9) conclude final draft, (10) publication and dissemination. Several adjustments were needed in the Portuguese version.

Conclusion

The additional adjustments that were required for the Portuguese version justify the need for the detailed and multifaceted translation process that was outlined in this manuscript.

### Some theoretical underpinnings of knowledge translation [^3fc71bfa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A careful analysis of the definition of knowledge translation highlights the importance of the judicious translation of research into practice and policy. There is, however, a considerable gap between research and practice. Closing the research-to-practice gap involves changing clinical practice, a complex and challenging endeavor. There is increasing recognition that efforts to change practice should be guided by conceptual models or frameworks to better understand the process of change. The authors conducted a focused literature search, developed inclusion criteria to identify planned action theories, and then extracted data from each theory to determine the origins, examine the meaning, judge the logical consistency, and define the degree of generalizability, parsimony, and testability. An analysis was conducted of the concepts found in each theory, and a set of action categories was developed that form the phases of planned action. Thirty-one planned action theories were identified that formed the basis of the analyses. An Access database was created, as well as a KT Theories User's Guide that synthesizes all the planned change models and theories, identifies common elements of each, and provides information on their use. There are many planned change models and frameworks with many common elements and action categories. Whenever any planned change model is used, change agents should consider documenting their experiences with the model so as to advance understanding of how useful the model is and to provide information to others who are attempting a similar project.

### Does the ribosome translate cancer? [^14064fe7]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2003). Medium credibility.

Ribosome biogenesis and translation control are essential cellular processes that are governed at numerous levels. Several tumour suppressors and proto-oncogenes have been found either to affect the formation of the mature ribosome or to regulate the activity of proteins known as translation factors. Disruption in one or more of the steps that control protein biosynthesis has been associated with alterations in the cell cycle and regulation of cell growth. Therefore, certain tumour suppressors and proto-oncogenes might regulate malignant progression by altering the protein synthesis machinery. Although many studies have correlated deregulation of protein biosynthesis with cancer, it remains to be established whether this translates directly into an increase in cancer susceptibility, and under what circumstances.

### Basic sciences fertilizing clinical microbiology and infection management [^9d124b05]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Note that the process of scientific knowledge “lost on translation” —that is, unsuccessful translation of basic insights into medical practice—has somewhat disaccredited in recent years the role of fundamental sciences. As in professional language translation technologies, the efficiency of translation depends mainly on the current scarcity of good “translators” (understanding both basic and practical languages) combined with the number and complexity of languages in the increasingly diversified field of sciences. The NIH-based National Centre for Advancing Translational Sciences initiative is a promising organizational tool, but as Fang and Casadevall stated, “history has taught us that the path from basic discoveries to scientific and technological applications is seldom a straight line”. In other words, we should consider that there is no dictionary providing translation of a “basic” word to an “applied” word; in fact each word-to-word translation is the result of a scientific inquiry by itself. Note that understanding a translation requires the recognition (even in an obscure way) of something common between the “basic” and “applied” expression, and that occurs probably across a trial-and-error process. Future advances in knowledge engineering and semantics, eventually combined with educational programs, might facilitate such complex tasks. But an essential message is that the existence of a bottleneck (the translation) should not impede the development of basic sciences, as basic “words” will be able to find by themselves a way of being translated into applied meanings, also in microbiology and infectious diseases. These opportunities for translational activity might paradoxically be more fruitful in nonprofit groups, where scientists have the real scientific freedom required for discovery, where individual volunteering or interning experience are vital to meet innovative approaches. In fact no systematic relationship between the “basic” versus “applied” research focus of a grant and its propensity to be cited by a patent has been found in recent studies [13].

### Development and validation of a PET / SPECT radiopharmaceutical in oncology [^cfbcafcf]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical translation

If a preclinical validation is successful, an imaging agent can become a clinical candidate and the process of clinical translation can begin. It is beyond the scope of this white paper to provide a thorough outline of all the steps for successfully translating a novel radiotracer into first-in-human studies, which has been reviewed elsewhere. Below is a brief overview on the general steps towards translation.

It is extremely important for the investigator to understand the process for bringing a candidate radiotracer from bench-to-bedside at their institution. This usually includes the development of the radiopharmaceutical in GMP conditions, familiarity with institutional rules for intellectual property coverage, execution of Material Transfer Agreements (if needed), Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, outsourcing of the synthesis, finding the right funding to cover the costs to obtain Phase 0/1 investigational new drug (IND) approval and last but not the least, clinical investigators interested in leading a potential clinical trial. A treating physician, on board from an early stage, will help to define preclinical pilot experiments that will be important for the writing of the first clinical protocol. A biostatistician is also key to identifying the sample size or number of patients to recruit.

### Translational fidelity and mistranslation in the cellular response to stress [^9e4b8e75]. Nature Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Faithful translation of mRNA into the corresponding polypeptide is a complex multistep process, requiring accurate amino acid selection, transfer RNA (tRNA) charging and mRNA decoding on the ribosome. Key players in this process are aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which not only catalyse the attachment of cognate amino acids to their respective tRNAs, but also selectively hydrolyse incorrectly activated non-cognate amino acids and/or misaminoacylated tRNAs. This aaRS proofreading provides quality control checkpoints that exclude non-cognate amino acids during translation, and in so doing helps to prevent the formation of an aberrant proteome. However, despite the intrinsic need for high accuracy during translation, and the widespread evolutionary conservation of aaRS proofreading pathways, requirements for translation quality control vary depending on cellular physiology and changes in growth conditions, and translation errors are not always detrimental. Recent work has demonstrated that mistranslation can also be beneficial to cells, and some organisms have selected for a higher degree of mistranslation than others. The aims of this Review Article are to summarize the known mechanisms of protein translational fidelity and explore the diversity and impact of mistranslation events as a potentially beneficial response to environmental and cellular stress.

### The anesthesiologist as translational scientist [^4d8b9ed4]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational science seeks to accelerate the multi-step process by which scientific discoveries are transformed into therapies that can improve the health of individuals and their communities. To facilitate crossing the traditional boundaries between basic and clinical research for instance, a systematic understanding of the scientific and operational principles that underlie each step of the translational cycle is developed to identify and address barriers to translation. Skills required by translational scientists, such as being systems thinkers and process innovators, overlap with those of anesthesiologists, and therefore, it is no surprise that anesthesiologists have contributed to this field. Indeed, the safety and efficacy of anesthesia care has greatly evolved over many decades because anesthesiologists have recognized the importance of readily incorporating physiological and pharmacological basic research findings into clinical practice. This article highlights the characteristics that make anesthesiologists well suited to be translational scientists. We also discuss one example of anesthesiology contributing to the field of translational science during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that anesthesiologists, regardless of their specific clinical or research interests, have the skill set to become effective and critical players in the field of translational science and emphasize the importance of continued leadership in this field to academic anesthesiology.

### Heterogeneity and specialized functions of translation machinery: from genes to organisms [^2690e8c4]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regulation of mRNA translation offers the opportunity to diversify the expression and abundance of proteins made from individual gene products in cells, tissues and organisms. Emerging evidence has highlighted variation in the composition and activity of several large, highly conserved translation complexes as a means to differentially control gene expression. Heterogeneity and specialized functions of individual components of the ribosome and of the translation initiation factor complexes eIF3 and eIF4F, which are required for recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA 5' untranslated region, have been identified. In this Review, we summarize the evidence for selective mRNA translation by components of these macromolecular complexes as a means to dynamically control the translation of the proteome in time and space. We further discuss the implications of this form of gene expression regulation for a growing number of human genetic disorders associated with mutations in the translation machinery.

### Fidelity versus flexibility: translating evidence-based research into practice [^9cf432f7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Understanding the process by which research is translated into practice is limited. This study sought to examine how interventions change during implementation.

Methods

Data were collected from July 2005 to September 2007. A real-time and cross-case comparison was conducted, examining ten interventions designed to improve health promotion in primary care practices in practice-based research networks. An iterative group process was used to analyze qualitative data (survey data, interviews, site visits, and project diary entries made by grantees approximately every 2 weeks) and to identify intervention adaptations reported during implementation.

Results

All interventions required changes as they were integrated into practice. Modifications differed by project and by practice, and were often unanticipated. Three broad categories of changes were identified and include modifications undertaken to accommodate practices' and patients' circumstances as well as personnel costs. In addition, research teams played a crucial role in fostering intervention uptake through their use of personal influence and by providing motivation, retraining, and instrumental assistance to practices. These efforts by the research teams, although rarely considered an essential component of the intervention, were an active ingredient in successful implementation and translation.

Conclusions

Changes are common when interventions are implemented into practice settings. The translation of evidence into practice will be improved when research design and reporting standards are modified to help quality-improvement teams understand both these adaptations and the effort required to implement interventions in practice.

### The crosstalk between metabolism and translation [^c17c0040]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolism and mRNA translation represent critical steps involved in modulating gene expression and cellular physiology. Being the most energy-consuming process in the cell, mRNA translation is strictly linked to cellular metabolism and in synchrony with it. Indeed, several mRNAs for metabolic pathways are regulated at the translational level, resulting in translation being a coordinator of metabolism. On the other hand, there is a growing appreciation for how metabolism impacts several aspects of RNA biology. For example, metabolic pathways and metabolites directly control the selectivity and efficiency of the translational machinery, as well as post-transcriptional modifications of RNA to fine-tune protein synthesis. Consistently, alterations in the intricate interplay between translational control and cellular metabolism have emerged as a critical axis underlying human diseases. A better understanding of such events will foresee innovative therapeutic strategies in human disease states.

### Current status and future opportunities in lung precision medicine research with a focus on biomarkers. An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement [^75ac9bdd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute research statement—lung biomarker translation and priorities—notes that health providers routinely use select biomarker-based tests in clinical practice, but some providers lack confidence in deciding when biomarker tests are needed, and that researchers performing biomarker-related studies require greater clarity regarding the translation process. It provides guidance on how to understand and evaluate use of biomarker tests for lung diseases and identifies research topics that could be prioritized in the future. Translational studies to clinically validate biomarkers are needed, in which significance is valued over innovation. More biomarker discovery research, in which hypothesis generation is viewed favorably, is necessary. Efforts to integrate existing heterogeneous datasets via appropriate data-mining strategies are required.

### Thinking about the future cognitive remediation therapy – what works and could we do better? [^9602693a]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

We naturally think of treatment development as proceeding in a linear fashion, from understanding the causes of a specific disorder to designing treatment interventions with targets identified by the etiology. It does not necessarily work that way, especially for psychological treatments. Psychological treatments are often based more on theories about cognitive and behavioral functioning than theories of etiology, and analyses of treatment effects contribute to our understanding of the disorder as much as vice versa. Because a treatment is developed from a prototype to general use, critical questions are addressed in a cyclic, iterative process: Can the treatment be clearly and reliably defined? What are its active ingredients? Is it acceptable to recipients and providers? Are the treatment procedures consistent with theory? Are the treatment effects consistent with theory (ie, do we understand how it works)? Do the risks and costs of the treatment outweigh the benefits? Can it be efficiently provided in real world service systems?

The progress from basic science to standard treatment is getting increasing attention in the research community. There is new appreciation that it does not just happen automatically. “Translational research” is a concept that reflects this realization. Each step in the translational pipeline serves a distinct purpose and has implications for treatment validation. However, conventional understandings of evidence-based practice are not necessarily sensitive to the cyclic nature of treatment development. Translation into practice is not simply the final destination in a linear stepwise process. The pipeline loops and meanders (illustrated in figure 1).

Fig. 1. 
Possible pathways in the meandering pipeline of treatment development

This discussion considers the dissemination of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), a rapidly developing treatment approach that targets the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. Examining the nature of rate-limiting factors, in terms of conceptual, theoretical, and clinical validation, clarifies the directions that research needs to take to overcome the barriers in the translational pipeline and allows this new treatment tool to be disseminated.

### Non-equilibrium dynamics of a nascent polypeptide during translation suppress its misfolding [^e87fa809]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Through folding, polypeptides adopt the specific three-dimensional structures required for their function. In the cell, some of these structures begin to form co-translationally –. However, the overall stability of the folded protein is reduced with respect to the folded state off the ribosome – and the rate of folding can be slower. Such suppression of folding rates during vectorial synthesis by the ribosome is thought to increase the amount of active protein by promoting folding in a domain-wise manner and by preventing off-pathway misfolded states,.

Studies have shown that smaller domains can fold inside the ribosome exit tunnel starting when the ribosome has decoded 25 amino acids downstream of the domain boundary,, whereas larger nascent domains require synthesis of ~ 40 amino acids past the domain boundary to fold,,. Overall, these results suggest that the nascent chain can fold as soon as there is enough space in the tunnel or at the ribosome surface such that the folded state is not sterically precluded. Accordingly, most co-translational folding studies employ stalled ribosome-bound nascent chain complexes (RNCs), which also ensure a uniform population during analysis,,. However, whether the stalling is permanent (e.g. generated by mRNA truncation) or temporary (e.g. induced by ribosome stalling sequences such as SecM), the implicit assumption has been that the observed folding dynamics faithfully reflect the dynamics that occur during synthesis, as the transitions are thought to be fast relative to the rate of translation and the folding process is presumed to occur at equilibrium,. Although this assumption may be justified in some casesit presupposes that the rates of elongation and folding are the only relevant ones controlling the overall behavior of the nascent chain. In fact, other processes may occur contemporaneously and the chain may not begin to fold immediately upon synthesis.

### Following translation by single ribosomes one codon at a time [^f0630c6b]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

We have followed individual ribosomes as they translate single messenger RNA hairpins tethered by the ends to optical tweezers. Here we reveal that translation occurs through successive translocation--and-pause cycles. The distribution of pause lengths, with a median of 2.8 s, indicates that at least two rate-determining processes control each pause. Each translocation step measures three bases--one codon-and occurs in less than 0.1 s. Analysis of the times required for translocation reveals, surprisingly, that there are three substeps in each step. Pause lengths, and thus the overall rate of translation, depend on the secondary structure of the mRNA; the applied force destabilizes secondary structure and decreases pause durations, but does not affect translocation times. Translocation and RNA unwinding are strictly coupled ribosomal functions.

### Immunity and the regulation of protein synthesis: surprising connections [^19fb5772]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The plasticity that is needed by the cell to respond to rapid changes in its environment cannot only be provided by means of transcriptional regulation, which generally confers on cells a set of stable properties. Alternatively, the control of mRNA translation allows the cell to modulate rapidly and over short period of time its gene expression program, without invoking the slower nuclear pathways for mRNA synthesis and transport. Several recent findings indicate that regulation of translation affects directly antigen presentation, cytokine production, as well as the survival of dendritic cells. I describe here some of the regulatory mechanisms that control translation in response to microbial products or cytokine exposure and their contribution to the overall immune response.

### The place of implementation science in the translational medicine continuum [^bedd5447]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that the transfer of knowledge from biomedical discoveries into patient and public benefit should be accelerated. At the same time there is a persistent lack of conceptual clarity about the precise nature of the phases of the translational continuum necessary to implement this. In this paper, we: (i) propose an integrated schema to understand the five sequential phases that link basic biomedical research with clinical science and implementation; (ii) discuss the nature of three blocks along this translational pathway; (iii) outline key issues that need to be addressed in removing such barriers. The five research phases described are: (0) basic science discovery; (1) early human studies; (2) early clinical trials; (3) late clinical trials; (4) implementation (which includes adoption in principle, early implementation and persistence of implementation). This schema also sets out three points at which communication blocks can occur. The application of 'implementation science' is in its early stages within mental health and psychiatric research. This paper therefore aims to develop a consistent terminology to understand the discovery, development, dissemination and implementation of new interventions. By better understanding the factors that promote or delay knowledge to flow across these blocks, we can accelerate progression along translational medicine pathways and so realize earlier patient benefit.

### Translational control in cellular and developmental processes [^c0cf5e2b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2012). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence indicates that translational control of specific mRNAs contributes importantly to genetic regulation across the breadth of cellular and developmental processes. Synthesis of protein from a specific mRNA can be controlled by RNA-binding proteins at the level of translational initiation and elongation, and translational control is also sometimes coupled to mRNA localization mechanisms. Recent discoveries from invertebrate and vertebrate systems have uncovered novel modes of translational regulation, have provided new insights into how specific regulators target the general translational machinery and have identified several new links between translational control and human disease.

### Exploring the translation process for multilingual implementation research studies: a collaborative autoethnography [^55f95a6f]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Box 1 
Practical approaches for teams conducting work in translation

Allow time for translators to develop their voice and tone.
Use notes and discussion to better understand ‘untranslatable’ elements.
Ensure a clear connection to the implementation team from the start to clarify contextual elements.
Create an ‘word bank’ of unified translated words or phrases as a living document accessible to the translation team.
Build connections across the translation team for cross-checking and problem-solving.
Give space for the translation team to work introspectively and explore their positionality and reflexivity during the work.

Importantly, our findings emphasise that to ensure rigour in their work, implementation research teams using qualitative data should make concerted effort to consider both the translation process as well as its outcomes. Translation processes can be conceptualised using established approaches such as the TRAPD approach of translation, review, adjudication, pretest and documentation used for survey translation, or other similar approaches that encourage researchers to think systematically about translation.Without such a rigourous translation process, depth may be lost from the translated outputs used for qualitative analysis. Conceptually this interrogation of process aligns with the goals of implementation research, but instead asks the research team to reflect inwards on its own processes.Translation is commonly seen only as a procedural step, necessary to ensure that research enters English, the lingua franca of modern academic knowledge dissemination.Our findings show that the translation process itself is a microcosm of tensions, negotiation, reflection and sense-making that both shapes and is shaped by the data itself. This is an area with great potential for reflective implementation research and an important place for attention and exploration to ensure accurate representation of qualitative data. Further it is an important jumping off point from where emerging discourses can challenge power asymmetries in the global production of knowledge and an opportunity to avoid epistemic injustice by valuing the words of those omitted from the dominant academic discourse.As efforts to decolonise implementation research (and health research more broadly) progress, a deeper understanding and attention to the translation process will be key to dismantling hegemonic language structures, prioritising perspectives and experiences from marginalised groups, and shifting the power balance towards meaningful sharing of knowledge across languages beyond English.

### Bedside to bench: integrating quantitative clinical pharmacology and reverse translation to optimize drug development [^dae7c0bb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO ENABLE REVERSE TRANSLATION

Reducing attrition rates of drug candidates across the stages of drug development is a goal for the pharmaceutical industry. While multiple causes can be identified for attrition of drug candidates, there remains little doubt that mechanistic insights are needed for gaining full understanding. Thus, various candidate nomination processes at each phase of development are implemented at pharmaceutical organizations to evaluate if the molecule has demonstrated sufficient merit to move forward in development. Milligan et al. illustrated the evolution of model‐based drug development (MBDD) to a fully implemented concept with its applications across the early discovery to late‐stage development in a clinical utilization setting. 3 The authors shared various elements of MBDD from identifying the right pathway to the right patients and quantitative tools that can be utilized across each of these activities.

As shown in Figure 1, while forward translation occurs in a traditional manner from bench to bedside, we propose that reverse translation does not necessarily have to follow this pattern. Using quantitative tools that are currently available, each of the various stages of drug development can utilize relevant internal and external data from clinical safety and efficacy data for appropriate decision‐making. This knowledge transfer from clinic to bench provides opportunity for utilizing clinical data for optimizing target engagement and therapeutic index during discovery and early clinical studies, set the target for clinical qualification for proof‐of‐concept studies, and define the right patient population and dose for efficacy at the clinical development stage. Each of the above learnings can be extremely valuable for the research and development organizations at a stage where there is an increasing expectation to accelerate drug development. Furthermore, some therapeutic areas such as oncology have noticed rapid development of highly efficacious immunotherapies with a wealth of clinical data generated in the recent past, thus making seamless reverse knowledge integration even more crucial. 4 Insights gained from probing the relationship between genetics and epigenetics and drug response to define optimal oncology combination therapies may further enhance the demand for quantitative reverse translation in real time during drug development.

### Recommendations for robust and reproducible preclinical research in personalised medicine [^f80d903d]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Personalised medicine is a medical model that aims to provide tailor-made prevention and treatment strategies for defined groups of individuals. The concept brings new challenges to the translational step, both in clinical relevance and validity of models. We have developed a set of recommendations aimed at improving the robustness of preclinical methods in translational research for personalised medicine.

Methods

These recommendations have been developed following four main steps: (1) a scoping review of the literature with a gap analysis, (2) working sessions with a wide range of experts in the field, (3) a consensus workshop, and (4) preparation of the final set of recommendations.

Results

Despite the progress in developing innovative and complex preclinical model systems, to date there are fundamental deficits in translational methods that prevent the further development of personalised medicine. The literature review highlighted five main gaps, relating to the relevance of experimental models, quality assessment practices, reporting, regulation, and a gap between preclinical and clinical research. We identified five points of focus for the recommendations, based on the consensus reached during the consultation meetings: (1) clinically relevant translational research, (2) robust model development, (3) transparency and education, (4) revised regulation, and (5) interaction with clinical research and patient engagement. Here, we present a set of 15 recommendations aimed at improving the robustness of preclinical methods in translational research for personalised medicine.

Conclusions

Appropriate preclinical models should be an integral contributor to interventional clinical trial success rates, and predictive translational models are a fundamental requirement to realise the dream of personalised medicine. The implementation of these guidelines is ambitious, and it is only through the active involvement of all relevant stakeholders in this field that we will be able to make an impact and effectuate a change which will facilitate improved translation of personalised medicine in the future.

### Translation initiation of viral mRNAs [^4121c905]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Viruses depend on cells for their replication but have evolved mechanisms to achieve this in an efficient and, in some instances, a cell-type-specific manner. The expression of viral proteins is frequently subject to translational control. The dominant target of such control is the initiation step of protein synthesis. Indeed, during the early stages of infection, viral mRNAs must compete with their host counterparts for the protein synthetic machinery, especially for the limited pool of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) that mediate the recruitment of ribosomes to both viral and cellular mRNAs. To circumvent this competition viruses use diverse strategies so that ribosomes can be recruited selectively to viral mRNAs. In this review we focus on the initiation of protein synthesis and outline some of the strategies used by viruses to ensure efficient translation initiation of their mRNAs.

### Cognitive and social issues in emergency medicine knowledge translation: a research agenda [^d5bd11a2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The individual practitioner is a linchpin in the process of translating new knowledge into practice, particularly in the emergency department, where physician autonomy is high, resources are limited, and decision-making situations are complex. An understanding of the cognitive and social processes that affect knowledge translation (KT) in emergency medicine (EM) is crucial and at present understudied. As part of the 2007 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference on KT in EM, our group sought to identify key research areas that would inform our understanding of these cognitive and social processes. We combined an online discussion group of interdisciplinary stakeholders, an extensive review of the existing literature, and a "public hearing" of the recommendations at the Consensus Conference to establish relative preference for the recommendations, as well as their relevance and clarity to attendees. We identified five key research areas as follows. 1) What provider-specific barriers/facilitators to the use of new knowledge are relevant in the EM setting? 2) Can social psychological theories of behavior change be used to develop better KT interventions for EM? 3) Can the study of "distributed cognition" suggest new vehicles for KT in the emergency department? 4) Can the concept of dual-process reasoning inform our understanding of the KT process? 5) Can patient-specific, immediate feedback serve as a vehicle for KT in EM? We believe that exploring these key research questions will directly lead to improved KT interventions and to further discussion of the cognitive and social factors impacting KT in EM.

### Adapting interventions to new contexts-the ADAPT guidance [^c528ead5]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Framework and recommendations

The ADAPT process model (fig 1), presents the steps of our framework. Outcomes of each step, indicated in the grey boxes, inform decisions on movement forward or backwards, or exiting adaptation processes in favour of developing a new intervention or considering different interventions.

Fig 1 
ADAPT process model for adapting interventions to new contexts. Purple boxes=stages of ADAPT step-by-step guidance (box 3 provides more details). Grey boxes=potential outcomes from each stage. Directional arrows=recommendations for moving, forward, or backwards through stages (or exiting)

The distinction between intervention development and adaptation is not always clear; development can involve the combination of evidence informed components into a new intervention. Teams might also use a hybrid approach to development and adaptation, in which one intervention is adapted and augmented with new components. In such circumstances, we recommend the use of our guidance in combination with guidance for intervention development.Most adaptation literature focuses on translating an evidence informed intervention into a new context, which has guided our approach. Some researchers, however, suggest that interventions can and should be adapted to context during development and evaluation.Considering adaptability from the earliest stages of development could help ensure that interventions are more resilient to changes in context. Examples of studies that consider adaptability within intervention development and evaluation are increasing,aided by advances in complex logic modelling.

We include stakeholder involvement as an overarching principle central to all stages of adaptation, rather than a discrete stage; to operationalise this principle, stakeholder involvement is positioned as surrounding all steps within our model (fig 1).

Box 4 presents a checklist of questions for adaptation teams to consider. These questions do not need to be answered sequentially, and many will be answered by the available evidence. Using these questions to guide discussions within adaptation teams can help identify uncertainties for which further research can inform the adaptation process. Consistent with concerns that much existing guidance for adaptation is overly prescriptive,we present flexible recommendations relevant to stakeholders who might enter at different stages, and iterate between and within stages. We illustrate recommendations with reference to several empirical examples, a broader selection of which appear in our full guidance document.

### Translation initiation in cancer: a novel target for therapy [^5e5fa2d1]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Translation initiation is regulated in response to nutrient availability and mitogenic stimulation and is coupled with cell cycle progression and cell growth. Several alterations in translational control occur in cancer. Variant mRNA sequences can alter the translational efficiency of individual mRNA molecules, which in turn play a role in cancer biology. Changes in the expression or availability of components of the translational machinery and in the activation of translation through signal transduction pathways can lead to more global changes, such as an increase in the overall rate of protein synthesis and translational activation of the mRNA molecules involved in cell growth and proliferation. We review the basic principles of translational control, the alterations encountered in cancer, and selected therapies targeting translation initiation to help elucidate new therapeutic avenues.

### Translation initiation and its deregulation during tumorigenesis [^66e7781f]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Regulation of protein synthesis at the level of translation initiation is fundamentally important for the control of cell proliferation under normal physiological conditions. Conversely, misregulation of protein synthesis is emerging as a major contributory factor in cancer development. Most bulk protein synthesis is initiated via recognition of the mRNA 5′ cap and subsequent recognition of the initiator AUG codon by a directional scanning mechanism. However, several key regulators of tumour development are translated by a cap-independent pathway. Here we review eukaryotic translation initiation, its regulation and the ways in which this regulation can break down during tumorigenesis.

### Non-equilibrium dynamics of a nascent polypeptide during translation suppress its misfolding [^86fb15f8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 6 
Schematic of co-translational folding in and out of equilibrium. a The equilibrium scenario shows the onset of folding after reaching the minimum length predicted from stalled complexes (dashed red line). After this point the nascent chain misfolds. At the stop codon, the misfolded protein would be released from the ribosome. b Out of equilibrium, as we observe, there is a delay after reaching the length required to fold seen in equilibrium. This delay is long enough that the unfolded protein is released upon termination, whereupon it would fold post-translationally

Kinetic modeling suggests that not all proteins are equilibrated on a translational timescale, and the percent of proteins that are predicted to fold co-translationally can vary from 37% to 59% of the proteome when altering translation speed. However, experimental evidence that folding is not necessarily limited by the translation rate and folding takes place out of equilibrium has been indirect, for example, through decreases in protein activity after increasing the translation rate via synonymous codon mutations or changing tRNA levels,,,. Other in vitro experiments that incorporate active translation employ ensemble assays where ribosomes are not synchronized, which could make deviations from equilibrium behavior difficult to detect, depending on the magnitude of the delay and the folding rates in question. Using a real-time single-molecule assay we detect a clear signature of non-equilibrium dynamics that may play an important role in the fate of the newly synthesized polypeptide. The polypeptide is not equilibrated with the ensemble of accessible conformations measured in stalled complexes; rather, it persists in the unfolded state until some equilibration step occurs. Our results show that comparing equilibrium-derived folding rates from stalled RNCs with translation rates is not always sufficient to predict co-translational folding of a polypeptide. Indeed, in this case we find that the peptide product must be observed in real-time as it is being generated, as other processes may also be at play that are obscured in stalled complex measurements. Stalled complexes require, for most experimental techniques, at minimum tens of minutes to prepare, which allows time for equilibration processes to occur. If these processes could be induced in stalled complexes, we would expect to be able to predict the co-translational behavior during continuous synthesis; however, as the exact nature of this process is unknown and was not previously predicted, the measurement must be conducted in real-time. The real-time folding assay developed in this study will also be useful in other situations where measurements of stalled RNCs may not capture the full dynamics of folding, such as length-dependent protein conformational changes, dynamic interactions with chaperones, or folding near domain boundaries.

### A short translational ramp determines the efficiency of protein synthesis [^5be14a16]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Translation initiation is a major rate-limiting step for protein synthesis. However, recent studies strongly suggest that the efficiency of protein synthesis is additionally regulated by multiple factors that impact the elongation phase. To assess the influence of early elongation on protein synthesis, we employed a library of more than 250,000 reporters combined with in vitro and in vivo protein expression assays. Here we report that the identity of the amino acids encoded by codons 3 to 5 impact protein yield. This effect is independent of tRNA abundance, translation initiation efficiency, or overall mRNA structure. Single-molecule measurements of translation kinetics revealed pausing of the ribosome and aborted protein synthesis on codons 4 and 5 of distinct amino acid and nucleotide compositions. Finally, introduction of preferred sequence motifs only at specific codon positions improves protein synthesis efficiency for recombinant proteins. Collectively, our data underscore the critical role of early elongation events in translational control of gene expression.

### EIF5B gates the transition from translation initiation to elongation [^71643172]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Translation initiation determines both the quantity and identity of the protein that is encoded in an mRNA by establishing the reading frame for protein synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, numerous translation initiation factors prepare ribosomes for polypeptide synthesis; however, the underlying dynamics of this process remain unclear 1,2 . A central question is how eukaryotic ribosomes transition from translation initiation to elongation. Here we use in vitro single-molecule fluorescence microscopy approaches in a purified yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation system to monitor directly, in real time, the pathways of late translation initiation and the transition to elongation. This transition was slower in our eukaryotic system than that reported for Escherichia coli 3-5 . The slow entry to elongation was defined by a long residence time of eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) on the 80S ribosome after the joining of individual ribosomal subunits-a process that is catalysed by this universally conserved initiation factor. Inhibition of the GTPase activity of eIF5B after the joining of ribosomal subunits prevented the dissociation of eIF5B from the 80S complex, thereby preventing elongation. Our findings illustrate how the dissociation of eIF5B serves as a kinetic checkpoint for the transition from initiation to elongation, and how its release may be governed by a change in the conformation of the ribosome complex that triggers GTP hydrolysis.

### A short translational ramp determines the efficiency of protein synthesis [^b6357a88]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The efficiency of protein synthesis is governed by the rates of translation initiation, elongation and to a lesser extent termination –. Potential factors that contribute to protein synthesis efficiency have been discovered using both endogenous genes and reporter sequences by focusing on tRNA abundance, amino acid sequence or both mRNA sequence and structure –. Several conflicting models for the efficiency of protein synthesis have been proposed that consider the codon distribution at the N-terminus as well as local mRNA structure around the translation start sites,,,,,. Reduced abundance of tRNAs coding for N-terminal protein residues may play a crucial role in slowing down initial rounds of translation elongation,,. Such a translational ramp would be beneficial in preventing detrimental collision-dependent abortion of protein synthesis,,. Some of these effects can be rationalized by the presence of mRNA structural elements within the first 5–16 codons,,,–. In addition, interactions between the nascent peptide and the exit tunnel of the ribosome appear to play an important role in dictating peptidyl transfer rates during early elongation events,–. However, the mechanism of nucleotide and peptide sequence effects on early elongation and processivity of protein synthesis remain poorly understood. Here, we present data that strongly suggest that the mRNA and the encoded protein sequences of the first five codons are key in dictating the efficiency of protein synthesis.

### Translational control in cancer [^5d17f27d]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2010). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress has been made in defining a new understanding of the role of mRNA translation and protein synthesis in human cancer. Translational control is a crucial component of cancer development and progression, directing both global control of protein synthesis and selective translation of specific mRNAs that promote tumour cell survival, angiogenesis, transformation, invasion and metastasis. Translational control of cancer is multifaceted, involving alterations in translation factor levels and activities unique to different types of cancers, disease stages and the tumour microenvironment. Several clinical efforts are underway to target specific components of the translation apparatus or unique mRNA translation elements for cancer therapeutics.

### Bedside to bench: integrating quantitative clinical pharmacology and reverse translation to optimize drug development [^75efb2f5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

The goal of drug development remains to lower attrition of drugs while bringing efficacious medications more quickly to patients. Successful implementation of early clinical and translational research has proven to be an effective strategy, with successful proof‐of‐concept studies being the benchmark of success. Over the last decade, MBDD has evolved from a concept to a now commonly implemented strategy across major pharmaceutical institutions. The basic tenet of this concept is to integrate knowledge across the stages of drug development and inform decision‐making. Because the knowledge flow has to go back from bedside to bench, appropriate knowledge sharing across various functional teams is paramount to the successful application of translational sciences.

There are several steps that can enhance the value of reverse translation. First, appropriate platforms are required that can foster multiple data types for seamless integration of quantitative knowledge from bedside to each of the preceding development steps. Second, to embed expectations from pharmaceutical R&D governance bodies for reverse translation to aid forward translation. Third, to proactively engage with regulatory authorities to share quantitative aspects from reverse translation to achieve greater alignment across constituents.

### Description of the cross-cultural process adopted in the STRiDE (STrengthening responses to dementia in DEveloping countries) program: a methodological overview [^0132219b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Cross‐cultural adaptation process

We broadly followed the ISPOR Principles of Good Practice and the World Health Organization recommendations for the cross‐cultural adaptation of patient report outcomes.This included:
Two translators, proficient in English and experts in the target language, independently performed the forward‐translations of the English toolkit into the target language.
The two forward‐translations were then compared and synthesized into a single translation. Discrepancies were discussed between at least one of the forward‐translators alongside two researchers familiar with the original questionnaire but not involved in the translation process. One of these researchers was from the country in which the translation occurred.
The final synthesized forward‐translation was then independently back‐translated by two additional translators not involved in the forward‐translation of the toolkit. These translators were required to be proficient in both the target language and English.
The two back‐translated English language toolkits were then synthesized into a single translation. Again, discrepancies between translations were discussed in a group that included at least two independent members of the research team and one translator.
Inconsistencies between the original toolkit and the synthesized toolkit were then checked. At each stage the emphasis was to retain the original meaning.
Lateral comparisons were made between different language translations to ensure consistency in the decision‐making process.
Different translations of the toolkit then were used for a series of cognitive interviews with participants that represented the target language and population (described below). This process allowed for a further refinement of the translations based on issues that arose during the testing.
Final discussion occurred with local research teams and an independent researcher about the choice of wording and any fine‐tuning of the toolkit.

### Mitochondrial protein synthesis quality control [^bb7c09cd]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Mitochondrial ribosomes as a hub for protein quality control

Since there appears to be no surveillance mechanism to prevent translation of mRNAs with aberrant 3′ ends, understanding how defects in translation elongation arise, are recognized, and resolved is critical for developing an integrated view of mitochondrial protein synthesis quality control. The mitochondrial ribosome provides an ideal hub to coordinate these events. First, we focus on how protein synthesis termination occurs on aberrant mRNAs.

Termination of protein synthesis is commonly understood as a process in which the decoding centre of the translating ribosome arrests on the stop codon of the mRNA because no tRNA recognizes the mitochondrial UAA or UAG (Fig. 2). The arrested ribosome is then recognized by a class I release factor that catalyses hydrolysis of the nascent chain from the tRNA in the ribosomal P-site. Together, these steps facilitate release of the nascent chain, recycling of the ribosome into the small and large subunits, and dissociation of the mRNA.

### So similar, yet so different: selective translation of capped and polyadenylated viral mRNAs in the influenza virus infected cell [^71e6ce0a]. Virus Research (2011). Low credibility.

Influenza virus is included among the Orthomyxoviridae family and it is a major public health problem causing annual mortality worldwide. Viral mRNAs bear short capped oligonucleotide sequences at their 5'-ends, acquired from host cell pre-mRNAs during viral transcription, and are polyadenylated at their 3'-end. Therefore, viral and cellular mRNAs are undistinguishable from a structural point of view. However, selective translation of viral proteins occurs upon infection, while initiation and elongation steps of cellular mRNA translation are efficiently inhibited. Viruses do not possess the complex machinery required to translate their mRNAs and are then obliged to compete for host-cell factors and manipulate the translation apparatus to their own benefit. Thus, the understanding of the processes that govern viral translation could facilitate the finding of possible targets for anti viral interventions. In the present review, we will point out the mechanisms by which influenza virus takes control of the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to ensure the production of new viral particles. First, we will discuss the mechanisms by which the virus counteracts the anti viral translation repression induced in the infected cell. Next, we will focus on the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis and the specific requirements for the eIF4F complex on influenza mRNA translation. Finally, we will discuss the role of different cellular and viral proteins in the selective translation of viral messengers in the infected cell and we will summarize the proposed mechanisms for the recruitment of cellular translational machinery to the viral mRNAs.

### Disrupting upstream translation in mRNAs is associated with human disease [^e8095998]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The classic view of information processing in the cell by gene expression occurs through transcription followed by translation. This basic flow is often complicated by regulatory elements which confer additional stages of processing and control. In particular, upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are segments of 5′UTR mRNA sequences that can initiate and terminate translation upstream of protein-coding start codons. Specific uORFs are known to control protein expression by tuning translation rates of downstream protein-coding sequences, and potential uORFs have been identified in ~50% of all human protein-coding genes,.

Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step controlling post-transcriptional gene expression, and rates of translation initiation can significantly impact mRNA stability –. Cap-dependent translation initiation begins when the 40 s ribosomal subunit encounters a start codon as it scans along the 5′UTR. At the start codon, peptide synthesis initiates when the 40 s subunit acquires the 60 s subunit with other translation initiation factors. If scanning ribosomes encountering uORFs prematurely initiate translation in the 5′UTR, upon reaching the uORF termination codon the ribosome may dissociate from the mRNA transcript, or the 40 s subunit may resume scanning after the 60 s subunit is lost. Resumption of scanning leads to translation of downstream reading frames only if the necessary translation initiation factors are reacquired by the 40 s subunit before reaching the downstream start codon. Thus, the spatial combination of uORFs and protein-coding start codons can produce different effects on downstream protein translation.

### Cellular mechanisms that control mistranslation [^8f323fd7]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Mistranslation broadly encompasses the introduction of errors during any step of protein synthesis, leading to the incorporation of an amino acid that is different from the one encoded by the gene. Recent research has vastly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms that control mistranslation at the molecular level and has led to the discovery that the rates of mistranslation in vivo are not fixed but instead are variable. In this Review we describe the different steps in translation quality control and their variations under different growth conditions and between species though a comparison of in vitro and in vivo findings. This provides new insights as to why mistranslation can have both positive and negative effects on growth and viability.

### Heterogeneous pathways and timing of factor departure during translation initiation [^59c2d264]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

The initiation of translation establishes the reading frame for protein synthesis and is a key point of regulation. Initiation involves factor-driven assembly at a start codon of a messenger RNA of an elongation-competent 70S ribosomal particle (in bacteria) from separated 30S and 50S subunits and initiator transfer RNA. Here we establish in Escherichia coli, using direct single-molecule tracking, the timing of initiator tRNA, initiation factor 2 (IF2; encoded by infB) and 50S subunit joining during initiation. Our results show multiple pathways to initiation, with orders of arrival of tRNA and IF2 dependent on factor concentration and composition. IF2 accelerates 50S subunit joining and stabilizes the assembled 70S complex. Transition to elongation is gated by the departure of IF2 after GTP hydrolysis, allowing efficient arrival of elongator tRNAs to the second codon presented in the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site (A site). These experiments highlight the power of single-molecule approaches to delineate mechanisms in complex multicomponent systems.

### When complexity science meets implementation science: a theoretical and empirical analysis of systems change [^212d51c8]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In what now seems to us like the distant past, yet, in reality, was merely a decade or so ago, medical scientists believed that the translation of research evidence into practice followed a prescribed set of research steps, moving from test tube to needle, or bench to bedside. It was common to apply the concept of a ‘pipeline’ as a heuristic for understanding research uptake. Adherents to this view frequently diagrammed the process as a linear one, conceptualizing interventions through a series of stages starting from the laboratory, into the randomized trial environment, and then across real-world settings.

Such models implicitly assumed that those on the clinical frontlines would naturally provide new types of care, such as novel pharmaceuticals, practices, or innovative technologies, based on the latest evidence, and all heavily informed by upstream research. While various research pipeline models were proposed over the years, all were similar in that research evidence was assumed to advance in a rational, step-wise manner. One influential model, described in the Cooksey report (Fig. 1), was developed following a review of health research funding in the UK examining the critical pathways to successful research translation; it is often referred to, and equivalent models have been developed in other countries.

However, the linear, rational way in which such a model assumes that evidence is converted into practice masks the complexity of the research–practice ecosystem. It hides much of what is important in trying to accomplish evidence-based medicine, namely, that basic research is fundamentally risky and often does not produce any useable breakthrough; that some ideas never even reach the prototype stage, let alone pre-clinical development; that even if developments progress to a trial, this may prove unsuccessful; that health services research is relatively poorly funded and thus implementers often fall short of truly understanding how socio-professional systems work in practice; and that the ‘translation gaps’ (more like chasms) between research findings and their use in practice often cannot be bridged.

### Normalisation process theory: a framework for developing, evaluating and implementing complex interventions [^eb425d80]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

While the factors contributing to successful recruitment were difficult to ascertain, the authors suggested that trials which were clearly grounded in existing clinical practice had a greater chance of successful recruitment, probably because recruitment for the trial did not require additional effort from its clinical collaborators. The results from such trials were also deemed to be more readily applicable to future practice.

Another substantive problem is the gap between research evidence and practice, which remains wide, with at least two recognised gaps [-]. The first translational gap refers to the difficulties and barriers of moving from laboratory-based basic research to clinical medicine. The second gap focuses on the gap between developing new treatments and knowledge and implementing these in practice for the patient or population groups for which they are intended. While recognition of these gaps in the research process is valuable, a third translational gap is also evident: that of using the results of such health services research to inform wider health-related policy and practice. Such implementation failures are often attributed to slow behaviour change by professionals, but there may be other good and predictable socio-organisational reasons for such failure, including time constraints during consultations and patient preference. Wider societal and contextual barriers are also present, in particular engaging policymakers in the research process, where research often does not proceed within a timeline suited to that of the policy agenda. Policy makers also engage with and use research evidence in complex ways, with the context and timing in which research findings become available as important as the evidence itself [-].

To overcome some of these difficulties, a number of strategies have been proposed which should be heeded by researchers interested in having their findings implemented into practice and policy. These include a greater role for theoretical approaches in research focused on implementation; consideration of how new research findings are sustained in practice; and use of a wide range of methods appropriate to the policy questions and the wider social context in which they are placed. If these wider issues are not considered during the design of a trial, there is a risk that there will be interventions which are never implemented, despite being shown to be effective. Interventions which are not implemented will not improve health or health care. This requires both researchers designing complex interventions and research funders to consider whether an intervention exhibits the required potential for future implementation into routine practice, if demonstrated to be effective. We argue that the implementation and sustainability of interventions can be considered from the very beginning of their development and evaluation by using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT).

More InformationTranscription Enlarge this image in new windowTranscription and translation are processes a cell uses to make all proteins the body needs to function from information stored in the sequence of bases in DNA. The four bases are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. During transcription, a piece of DNA that codes for a specific gene is copied into messenger RNA in the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then carries the genetic information from the DNA to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs.

During translation, proteins are made using the information stored in the mRNA sequence. The mRNA attaches to a structure called a ribosome that can read the genetic information. As the mRNA passes through the ribosome, another type of RNA called transfer RNA carries a protein building block called an amino acid to the ribosome. The tRNA carrying the amino acid binds to a matching sequence in the mRNA. As each tRNA binds to the mRNA strand, the amino acid it carried joins with the other amino acids to form a chain of amino acids. Once all of the amino acids coded for in the piece of mRNA have been linked, the completed protein is released from the ribosome.

### Mitochondrial protein synthesis quality control [^214b7c9c]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Here, we focus on the molecular processes by which aberrations in mitochondrial protein synthesis can arise and the mechanisms to resolve these errors. Other reviews in this series cover mtDNA replication, transcription, repair, post-transcriptional processing, mitochondrial ribosomes and translation. Protein synthesis defects can arise naturally due to the culmination of inherent mistakes of molecular events in gene expression that are amplified by orders of magnitude from the genome through transcription and to translation on ribosomes. In turn, pathogenic variants and small molecules that inhibit any steps in mitochondrial gene expression can exacerbate these errors, manifesting into human pathologies that differ in severity, age of onset, and tissue-specificity. In this review, we will omit discussion on pathogenic mtDNA variants, such as deletions, rRNA and tRNA mutations, as well as tRNA charging by mitochondrial aminoacyl tRNA synthetases as these topics have been covered previously in considerable detail. Instead, we seek to understand the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis quality control by tracing the origin of errors that can occur naturally in a wild type setting and get amplified with the vectorial path from the genome to the nascent chain. This process starts with synthesis of the mRNA templates, folding of the emerging nascent chain and the co-translational insertion into the inner membrane, followed by the stepwise series of molecular events that are needed to eliminate any aberrations that would perturb organelle homeostasis. We will also explore how mitochondrial ribosomes can act as a hub for coordinating proteostasis within the organelle matrix. Our goal is to provide a unifying and integrated view on the quality control of mitochondrial protein synthesis, the connection to human diseases when relevant and to identify promising avenues for future research.

### Signaling control of mRNA translation in cancer pathogenesis [^1fb86a3b]. Oncogene (2004). Low credibility.

The regulation of translation and the control of ribosome biogenesis are essential cellular processes whose impact on cell growth and proliferation is manifested at a number of specific levels. Disruption in one or more of the steps that control protein biosynthesis has been associated with alterations in the regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression. Consistent with this, tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes have been found to act on these functions and may therefore regulate malignant progression by affecting the protein synthetic machinery. Although many studies have correlated deregulation of protein biosynthesis with cancer, it remains to be established whether this process is necessary and/or sufficient for neoplastic transformation and metastasis.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^991ebf84]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are tools used to guide evidence-based healthcare that have been implemented internationally since the 1980s. However, there is widespread lack of agreement on the impact of clinical pathways on hospital resources and patient outcomes. This can be partially attributed to the confusion for both researchers and healthcare workers regarding what constitutes a clinical pathway. This paper describes efforts made by a team of Cochrane Review authors to develop criteria to assist in the objective identification of clinical pathway studies from the literature.

Methods

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop criteria to define a clinical pathway: (1) identify publications exploring the definition of a clinical pathway; (2) derive draft criteria; (3) pilot test the criteria; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Results

Previous literature and liaison with the European Pathways Association resulted in five criteria being used to define a clinical pathway: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression; and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population. After pilot testing it was decided that if an intervention met the first criteria (a structured multidisciplinary plan of care) plus three out of the other four criteria then it was included as a clinical pathway for the purposes of this review. In all, 27 studies were included in the final review. The authors of the included studies referred to these interventions as 'clinical pathways', 'protocols', 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

Conclusions

The criteria used for the identification of relevant studies for this Cochrane Review can be used as a foundation for the development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### Molecular basis of intervertebral disc degeneration and herniations: what are the important translational questions? [^571c68c4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intervertebral disc degeneration is a common condition with few inexpensive and effective modes of treatment, but current investigations seek to clarify the underlying process and offer new treatment options. It will be important for physicians to understand the molecular basis for the pathology and how it translates to developing clinical treatments for disc degeneration. In this review, we sought to summarize for clinicians what is known about the molecular processes that causes disc degeneration.

Results

A healthy disc requires maintenance of a homeostatic environment, and when disrupted, a catabolic cascade of events occurs on a molecular level resulting in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, increased degradative enzymes, and a loss of matrix proteins. This promotes degenerative changes and occasional neurovascular ingrowth potentially contributing to the development of pain. Research demonstrates the molecular changes underlying the harmful effects of aging, smoking, and obesity seen clinically while demonstrating the variable influence of exercise. Finally, oral medications, supplements, biologic treatments, gene therapy, and stem cells hold great promise but require cautious application until their safety profiles are better outlined.

Conclusions

Intervertebral disc degeneration occurs where there is a loss of homeostatic balance with a predominantly catabolic metabolic profile. A basic understanding of the molecular changes occurring in the degenerating disc is important for practicing clinicians because it may help them to inform patients to alter lifestyle choices, identify beneficial or harmful supplements, or offer new biologic, genetic, or stem cell therapies.

### Nascent peptide-induced translation discontinuation in eukaryotes impacts biased amino acid usage in proteomes [^22a98ce4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Robust translation elongation of any given amino acid sequence is required to shape proteomes. Nevertheless, nascent peptides occasionally destabilize ribosomes, since consecutive negatively charged residues in bacterial nascent chains can stochastically induce discontinuation of translation, in a phenomenon termed intrinsic ribosome destabilization (IRD). Here, using budding yeast and a human factor-based reconstituted translation system, we show that IRD also occurs in eukaryotic translation. Nascent chains enriched in aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) in their N-terminal regions alter canonical ribosome dynamics, stochastically aborting translation. Although eukaryotic ribosomes are more robust to ensure uninterrupted translation, we find many endogenous D/E-rich peptidyl-tRNAs in the N-terminal regions in cells lacking a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, indicating that the translation of the N-terminal D/E-rich sequences poses an inherent risk of failure. Indeed, a bioinformatics analysis reveals that the N-terminal regions of ORFs lack D/E enrichment, implying that the translation defect partly restricts the overall amino acid usage in proteomes.

### The process defines the product: what really matters in biosimilar design and production? [^c6ff4d53]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Biologic drugs are highly complex molecules produced by living cells through a multistep manufacturing process. The key characteristics of these molecules, known as critical quality attributes (CQAs), can vary based on post-translational modifications that occur in the cellular environment or during the manufacturing process. The extent of the variation in each of the CQAs must be characterized for the originator molecule and systematically matched as closely as possible by the biosimilar developer to ensure bio-similarity. The close matching of the originator fingerprint is the foundation of the biosimilarity exercise, as the analytical tools designed to measure differences at the molecular level are far more sensitive and specific than tools available to physicians during clinical trials. Biosimilar development, therefore, has a greater focus on preclinical attributes compared with the development of an original biological agent. As changes in CQAs can occur at different stages of the manufacturing process, even small modifications to the process can alter biosimilar attributes beyond the point of similarity and impact clinical effectiveness and safety. The manufacturer's ability to provide consistent production and quality control will greatly influence the acceptance of biosimilars. To this end, preventing drift from the required specifications over time and avoiding the various implications brought by product shortage will enhance biosimilar integration into daily practice. As most prescribers are not familiar with this new drug development paradigm, educational programmes will be needed so that prescribers see biosimilars as fully equivalent, efficacious and safe medicines when compared with originator products.

### Control of the translational machinery by amino acids [^3d1d796e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Amino acids are the precursors for the synthesis of proteins. In humans, approximately half of the 20 different amino acids are essential, ie, must be obtained from the diet. Cells must therefore take account of amino acid availability to achieve sustainable rates of protein synthesis. One of the major mechanisms involved in this is signaling through a complex of proteins termed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1, which is activated by amino acids. In turn, mTORC1 regulates the production of ribosomes, the molecular machines that make proteins, and the activity of other cellular components required for protein synthesis. mTORC1 signaling promotes the transcription of the genes for ribosomal RNAs and many other components involved in ribosome production. It also positively regulates the translation of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for ribosomal proteins. Indeed, recent studies have shown that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling drives the translation of mRNAs for many anabolic enzymes and other proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. The translational machinery is also regulated by the absence of amino acids through the protein kinase GCN2 (general control nonrepressed 2), which phosphorylates and in end-effect inhibits the translation initiation factor eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2). This process shuts down general protein synthesis to conserve amino acids.

### Codon optimality in cancer [^4a41c115]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

A key characteristic of cancer cells is their increased proliferative capacity, which requires elevated levels of protein synthesis. The process of protein synthesis involves the translation of codons within the mRNA coding sequence into a string of amino acids to form a polypeptide chain. As most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, the nucleotide sequence of a coding region can vary dramatically without altering the polypeptide sequence of the encoded protein. Although mutations that do not alter the final amino acid sequence are often thought of as silent/synonymous, these can still have dramatic effects on protein output. Because each codon has a distinct translation elongation rate and can differentially impact mRNA stability, each codon has a different degree of 'optimality' for protein synthesis. Recent data demonstrates that the codon preference of a transcriptome matches the abundance of tRNAs within the cell and that this supply and demand between tRNAs and mRNAs varies between different cell types. The largest observed distinction is between mRNAs encoding proteins associated with proliferation or differentiation. Nevertheless, precisely how codon optimality and tRNA expression levels regulate cell fate decisions and their role in malignancy is not fully understood. This review describes the current mechanistic understanding on codon optimality, its role in malignancy and discusses the potential to target codon optimality therapeutically in the context of cancer.

### EIF5B and eIF1A reorient initiator tRNA to allow ribosomal subunit joining [^c5c4e888]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Translation initiation defines the identity and quantity of a synthesized protein. The process is dysregulated in many human diseases 1,2 . A key commitment step is when the ribosomal subunits join at a translation start site on a messenger RNA to form a functional ribosome. Here, we combined single-molecule spectroscopy and structural methods using an in vitro reconstituted system to examine how the human ribosomal subunits join. Single-molecule fluorescence revealed when the universally conserved eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1A and eIF5B associate with and depart from initiation complexes. Guided by single-molecule dynamics, we visualized initiation complexes that contained both eIF1A and eIF5B using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting structure revealed how eukaryote-specific contacts between the two proteins remodel the initiation complex to orient the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA in a conformation compatible with ribosomal subunit joining. Collectively, our findings provide a quantitative and architectural framework for the molecular choreography orchestrated by eIF1A and eIF5B during translation initiation in humans.

### Mitochondrial protein synthesis quality control [^5cd580d1]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Human mitochondrial DNA is one of the most simplified cellular genomes and facilitates compartmentalized gene expression. Within the organelle, there is no physical barrier to separate transcription and translation, nor is there evidence that quality control surveillance pathways are active to prevent translation on faulty mRNA transcripts. Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize 13 hydrophobic proteins that require co-translational insertion into the inner membrane of the organelle. To maintain the integrity of the inner membrane, which is essential for organelle function, requires responsive quality control mechanisms to recognize aberrations in protein synthesis. In this review, we explore how defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis can arise due to the culmination of inherent mistakes that occur throughout the steps of gene expression. In turn, we examine the stepwise series of quality control processes that are needed to eliminate any mistakes that would perturb organelle homeostasis. We aim to provide an integrated view on the quality control mechanisms of mitochondrial protein synthesis and to identify promising avenues for future research.

### Human protein synthesis requires aminoacyl-tRNA pivoting during proofreading [^efa46ea6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Protein synthesis is dependent on megadalton ribonucleoprotein complexes known as ribosomes, which decode genetic information into polypeptide sequences. Ribosomes decode genetic information - in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA) - three nucleotides at a time (codon), using aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) as a substrate. During this process the mRNA forms three Watson-Crick base pairs with the aa-tRNA (codon-anticodon interactions) to select which amino acid to incorporate into the peptide. Maintaining the fidelity of translation during decoding is essential to the integrity of the proteome and has been evolutionarily fine-tuned to an error rate of 10 −3 to 10 −4 or 10 −4 to 10 −5 amino acids are miscoded per codon in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively –. The importance of maintaining fidelity during decoding is exemplified by several antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, that disrupt this process in bacteria – and by the fact that perturbation of translational fidelity can lead to protein aggregates, which have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in humans, recent therapies have been designed to target tRNA selection as a strategy for treating cancer, viral infections, and certain monogenic disorders –.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^28d8464d]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic score (PGS) development and validation for clinical use—Ordering providers should have a basic understanding of PGS test development and downstream testing restrictions in order to support appropriate test utilization, and there are no best practices or standards for developing a PGS, such that PGS for the same condition are often not the same. Regulatory requirements for genetic tests to make it to market often require demonstrated analytic and clinical validity, and for PGS and integrated PGS risk models analytic and clinical validity may be restricted to the model parameters used during development. From genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to PGS, the basic steps are to (1) conduct a GWAS to identify variants in a training/source data set, (2) select disease-associated variants that meet prespecified thresholds and combine these to create a PGS, and (3) validate the PGS using an independent dataset; GWAS evaluates associations using “common” variants with “common” population prevalence (≥1% frequency in a population).

### The 5th annual one mind summit: lessons learned about "Science informing brain health policies and practice" [^bef7a93c]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2017). Low credibility.

Lesson 1: Scientific Discovery and Innovations Follow a Slow and Meandering Path to Clinical Practice

The average length of time between scientific discovery and implementation into clinical practice is estimated to be 17 years.The process is complicated and has been divided into two phases, T1 and T2 (Fig. 1). Often referred to as “bench to bedside,” the T1 phase involves translating basic and pre-clinical discoveries into effective treatments for humans. The second phase, T2, is often referred to as “bedside to practice” and covers the translation of clinical evidence into patient healthcare and policies.The failure of early discoveries in the T1 phase to demonstrate effectiveness in large human studies has been closely examined over the past few years.While acknowledging its importance to the entire biomedical research enterprise, the Summit primarily addressed the lesser known issues of the T2 phase.

FIG. 1. 
Translating a hypothesis or research question into patient care involves multiple steps, some of which are clustered into phases called T1 and T2. The T1 phase has been referred to as “bench to bedside” and includes the translation of discoveries from preclinical research and smaller human studies into evidence of effectiveness in large-scale clinical trials. The T2 phase, referred to as “bedside to practice” includes research to promote widespread acceptance and implementation of validated diagnostics and effective treatments. T2 research may also include learning health care models and pragmatic clinical trials that incorporate feedback mechanisms to evaluate the patients' responses to treatment, and adapt treatments as needed on an on-going basis. In addition to T1 and T2 research, other key stakeholders and steps may be needed to achieve widespread adoption into clinical care.

### The ribosome uses two active mechanisms to unwind messenger RNA during translation [^7430273a]. Nature (2011). Excellent credibility.

The ribosome translates the genetic information encoded in messenger RNA into protein. Folded structures in the coding region of an mRNA represent a kinetic barrier that lowers the peptide elongation rate, as the ribosome must disrupt structures it encounters in the mRNA at its entry site to allow translocation to the next codon. Such structures are exploited by the cell to create diverse strategies for translation regulation, such as programmed frameshifting, the modulation of protein expression levels, ribosome localization and co-translational protein folding. Although strand separation activity is inherent to the ribosome, requiring no exogenous helicases, its mechanism is still unknown. Here, using a single-molecule optical tweezers assay on mRNA hairpins, we find that the translation rate of identical codons at the decoding centre is greatly influenced by the GC content of folded structures at the mRNA entry site. Furthermore, force applied to the ends of the hairpin to favour its unfolding significantly speeds translation. Quantitative analysis of the force dependence of its helicase activity reveals that the ribosome, unlike previously studied helicases, uses two distinct active mechanisms to unwind mRNA structure: it destabilizes the helical junction at the mRNA entry site by biasing its thermal fluctuations towards the open state, increasing the probability of the ribosome translocating unhindered; and it mechanically pulls apart the mRNA single strands of the closed junction during the conformational changes that accompany ribosome translocation. The second of these mechanisms ensures a minimal basal rate of translation in the cell; specialized, mechanically stable structures are required to stall the ribosome temporarily. Our results establish a quantitative mechanical basis for understanding the mechanism of regulation of the elongation rate of translation by structured mRNAs.

### Translation and cultural adaptation of tools to assess diverse Asian American and Asian Canadian subgroups: the Asian cohort for Alzheimer's disease (ACAD) study [^281b3996]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1 
Collaborative and interactive translation, cultural adaptation, and verification process for each ethnic language translation team.

The workflow of the multistage translation process was developed to ensure that translated content was accurate, consistent, and delivered on time across the four language teams. First, study materials were categorized into two groups: materials already translated (published) or requiring minor revisions, and materials requiring new translations or major revisions. Second, based on the status of the translation and characteristics of the materials, translation methods of verification or cultural translation were decided by the ACAD investigators and community advisory board (CAB) members, as shown in Table 1.

Below is the process of translation and cultural adaptation for study materials that were identified as needing major revisions:
Step 1: Preparation: Translators were provided with basic information about study populations, including socio‐demographic, mode of administration, and how and where the instruments would be administered. Also, the translators were provided specific instructions about the reading and educational level of study populations so that their translation would reflect language usage by study participants.
Step 2: Translators 1 and 2, who were bilingual and bicultural, independently forward translated the original English documents into the target languages. When translating, translators were asked to identify terms difficult to translate, such as “culture‐specific terms,” “concepts with no direct equivalent,” “concepts with multiple terms in translation,” or “concepts needing an explanation or sentence” requiring adaptation or explanation to convey the intended meaning.
Step 3: The third translator, having ethnic expertise and being knowledgeable about health terminology and content areas of concepts in the instrument, reviewed the ethnic language translated versions checking agreement and discrepancies with the English version.
Step 4: One bilingual native‐tongue lay person (CAB or community outreach members) reviewed the translated version to identify culturally appropriate translations and to reflect literacy and the common use of language in the study population.
Step 5: Panel discussion: A multilingual expert group consisting of translators, investigators, clinicians, and CAB or community outreach members reviewed the translated version to check for any inconsistencies between the source language and the translated version and to maintain the integrity of the original instrument, in terms of semantics, conceptual equivalence, and to reach consensus. The panelists reviewed and discussed until an agreement was reached.
Step 6: Comprehensiveness checking: Individual research team members with bilingual and bicultural backgrounds and CABs reviewed the final version to check whether the instructions and response options were understood.

### Type 2 translational research for CKD [^214be456]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Strategies to effectively treat people with CKD have been identified by conventional clinical research. Despite this evidence, awareness, screening, detection, diagnosis, risk factor control, treatment, and outcomes remain substandard. Translating clinical evidence into actionable measures that reduce the burden of CKD is a pressing need. Expansion from a "bench-to-bedside" paradigm (conventional type 1 translation) to research that encompasses "clinic and community" is the core concept of type 2 translation. Specifically, this is the discipline of identifying factors and using strategies that lead to adoption, maintenance, and sustainability of science-based interventions in practice. This review identifies key elements of type 2 translational research and highlights the current scope of this type of research for CKD. For type 2 translation to achieve the goals of providing high-quality care and better health outcomes, key facilitators (e.g., theory-based frameworks, adaptable interventions, and inclusion of sustainability and evaluation metrics) and essential elements (e.g., multidisciplinary team care, health information technology, and stakeholder engagement) must be integrated. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently funded five proposals that aim to improve outcomes for people with CKD, focusing on diverse components of the healthcare continuum: patient safety and transitions; delivery of high-quality, evidence-based CKD care; and elimination of disparities. The need for type 2 translational research in CKD is urgent because of preventable human suffering and unsustainable costs of providing care. Focus on the theory, framework, and approaches we have suggested may help us meet that challenge.

translationListen to pronunciationThe process of synthesizing an amino acid sequence from the messenger RNA code. More InformationTranslation Enlarge this image in new windowTranscription and translation are processes a cell uses to make all proteins the body needs to function from information stored in the sequence of bases in DNA. The four bases are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. During transcription, a piece of DNA that codes for a specific gene is copied into messenger RNA in the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then carries the genetic information from the DNA to the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. During translation, proteins are made using the information stored in the mRNA sequence. The mRNA attaches to a structure called a ribosome that can read the genetic information.

As the mRNA passes through the ribosome, another type of RNA called transfer RNA carries a protein building block called an amino acid to the ribosome. The tRNA carrying the amino acid binds to a matching sequence in the mRNA. As each tRNA binds to the mRNA strand, the amino acid it carried joins with the other amino acids to form a chain of amino acids. Once all of the amino acids coded for in the piece of mRNA have been linked, the completed protein is released from the ribosome.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^c333598a]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical pathways (CPWs) are a common component in the quest to improve the quality of health. CPWs are used to reduce variation, improve quality of care, and maximize the outcomes for specific groups of patients. An ongoing challenge is the operationalization of a definition of CPW in healthcare. This may be attributable to both the differences in definition and a lack of conceptualization in the field of clinical pathways. This correspondence article describes a process of refinement of an operational definition for CPW research and proposes an operational definition for the future syntheses of CPWs literature. Following the approach proposed by Kinsman et al. (BMC Medicine 8(1):31, 2010) and Wieland et al. (Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine 17(2):50, 2011), we used a four-stage process to generate a five criteria checklist for the definition of CPWs. We refined the operational definition, through consensus, merging two of the checklist's criteria, leading to a more inclusive criterion for accommodating CPW studies conducted in various healthcare settings. The following four criteria for CPW operational definition, derived from the refinement process described above, are (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions' (i.e. the intervention had time-frames or criteria-based progression); and (4) the intervention aimed to standardize care for a specific population. An intervention meeting all four criteria was considered to be a CPW. The development of operational definitions for complex interventions is a useful approach to appraise and synthesize evidence for policy development and quality improvement.

### Translational research working group developmental pathway for immune response modifiers [^a969720c]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

The Translational Research Working Group (TRWG) was created as a national initiative to evaluate the current status of the investment of National Cancer Institute in translational research and envision its future. The Translational Research Working Group conceptualized translational research as a set of six developmental processes or pathways focused on various clinical goals. One of those pathways describes the development of immune response modifiers such as vaccines and cytokines. A hallmark of the Immune Response Modifier Developmental Pathway is the coordinated development of multiple components. The Immune Response Modifier Pathway was conceived not as a comprehensive description of the corresponding real-world processes but rather as a tool designed to facilitate movement of a candidate assay through the translational process to the point where it can be handed off for definitive clinical testing. This paper discusses key challenges associated with the immune response modifier agent development process in light of the pathway.

### Selenoprotein synthesis: a unique translational mechanism used by a diverse family of proteins [^295eea1f]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the unique mechanism by which mammalian selenoprotein synthesis occurs. Selenoprotein synthesis requires translational recoding of the UGA codon from a stop signal to a selenocysteine insertion signal (SECIS). Dedicated factors directly involved in this translation process include specific secondary structure in the mRNA (SECIS), a unique tRNA (Sec-tRNA(Sec)), an RNA binding protein (SBP2), and a specialized elongation factor (EFsec). Regulation of this process is discussed along with physiologic and clinical issues regarding selenoprotein synthesis, including the side effects associated with statin drugs.

### The mechanism of mRNA cap recognition [^95b5d262]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome 1-3 . In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message 1-3 . Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear 3 . Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.

### Gene transcription as a limiting factor in protein production and cell growth [^3cdf8488]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Taken together, we propose that maximizing transcript production, under steady-state and balanced growth, may serve to increase the maximal cell size (or protein content), for which cells can still maintain optimal growth. The maximal possible initiation rate, which limits this production, may, therefore, serve as a fundamental physical constraint, limiting cell size. This is analogous to the time of ribosome translation, which is the fundamental unit defining the cell growth rate. These two physical constraints on transcription and translation, set by the basic biochemical parameters inherent to these processes, may define the characteristic values of the division time and size of rapidly proliferating cells.

### Distinct pre-initiation steps in human mitochondrial translation [^0aae39ab]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The genome of human mitochondria encodes for thirteen proteins that require specialized mitoribosomes for their synthesis. The specialization of the mitoribosomes is illustrated by the reduction of rRNA and addition of specific proteins, for many of which the functions are not known,. The process of protein synthesis starts with translation initiation. The canonical bacterial translation begins with the initiation factors IF1, IF2, IF3, and initiator tRNA that assemble on the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) to recognize the mRNA start codon, followed by the joining of the large subunit (LSU). The Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence is used to recruit mRNA to SSU through the anti-SD of the rRNA. However, in human mitochondria the mRNAs and the mitoribosome do not have the respective SD and anti-SD sequences. In addition, IF1 is missing compared to the bacterial system, whereas the GTPase mtIF2 and mtIF3 have specific extensions. Mitochondrial mRNAs are also different as most of them do not possess 5′ leader sequences, further highlighting special requirements for translation initiation.

A complete mitochondrial translation initiation complex with the joint mitoribosomal subunits has been reconstituted from bovine components, and mtIF3 has been identified as a crucial component for initiation in mouse. However, how the initiation complex is formed and which structural elements of the mitoribosome, initiation factors, and the interplay between them lead to the full assembly is not known. To investigate how translation initiation starts in human mitochondria, we analyze here the early involved complexes of the small mitoribosomal subunit using a combination of cryo-EM, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, and single-molecule fluorescence techniques. Our data reveal two defined steps that lead to the mitochondrial translation initiation, termed mitochondrial preinitiation steps 1 and 2 (mtPIC-1, mtPIC-2), which explains how mitochondria-specific extensions of initiation factors interact with mitoribosomal proteins to govern the mechanism of translation.

### Mechanisms of ribosome rescue in bacteria [^b0fc7707]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ribosomes that stall during translation need to be rescued to ensure that the protein synthesis capacity of the cell is maintained. Stalling arises when ribosomes become trapped at the 3' end of an mRNA, which occurs when a codon is unavailable, as this leads to the arrest of elongation or termination. In addition, various factors can induce ribosome stalling in the middle of an mRNA, including the presence of specific amino acid sequence motifs in the nascent polypeptide. Almost all bacteria use a mechanism known as trans-translation to rescue stalled ribosomes, and some species also have other rescue mechanisms that are mediated either by the alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA) or ArfB. In this Review, I summarize the recent studies that have demonstrated the conditions that trigger ribosome stalling, the pathways that bacteria use to rescue stalled ribosomes and the physiological effects of these processes.

### Translation of non-standard codon nucleotides reveals minimal requirements for codon-anticodon interactions [^81ba9f9f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Extensive structural, physico-chemical, and kinetic studies of the decoding process have revealed that an integrative interaction network between mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA ensures efficient and accurate translation –. Additional factors have been identified that modulate the decoding process by impacting the quality of the codon–anticodon interaction. A significant and essential influence on decoding derives from RNA modifications –. tRNAs, in particular, contain many post-transcriptionally modified nucleotides. Also, rRNAs and mRNAs harbor numerous base and ribose modifications, implying that they may play an important role during protein synthesis –. Their functions, however, are still largely unknown.

A well characterized non-standard nucleoside in mRNAs is inosine (I). I is a result of a hydrolytic deamination of adenosine by a family of proteins called ADARs. This editing event leads to a switch from a hydrogen donor (amino group) to a hydrogen acceptor (carbonyl oxygen) at position 6, generating a W–C edge reminiscent of guanosine (G), thereby altering the genetic information through the preferential base pairing of I with cytosine (C). In addition, the I–C interaction is less stable than that of G–C, mainly due to the loss of one hydrogen bond (H-bond). Since inosine has also been revealed in coding sequences (CDSs) of mRNAs, it is remarkable that, so far, inosine has not been observed to impair protein synthesis. This potentially implies that the number of H-bonds between codon and anticodon is less critical during translation than previously assumed or that a loss in stability of the codon–anticodon interaction can be compensated for by other means,.

### Cancer moonshot immuno-oncology translational network (IOTN): accelerating the clinical translation of basic discoveries for improving immunotherapy and immunoprevention of cancer [^90759398]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunotherapy is based on the principle that the immune system can recognize tumor-associated antigens and direct a targeted response (figure 1). While immunotherapy has emerged as the most promising cancer treatment since the development of chemotherapy in the 1940s, the majority of patients with cancer do not yet obtain durable benefit from immunotherapies, thus underscoring the need to understand mechanisms of immune resistance, identify biomarkers of responsiveness and develop novel approaches. The ultimate goal of immuno-oncology is to improve the clinical impact and cost/benefit ratio of immunotherapy by extending immunotherapeutic approaches to more patients and tumor types. To accomplish this goal, immuno-oncology research must address basic, translational and clinical research barriers, thus harnessing the full therapeutic potential of the immune system.

Figure 1 
Critical steps of effective antitumor immunity and the Immuno-Oncology Translational Network (IOTN) research projects tackling the steps. The immunological destruction of tumors is a multistep, coordinated process that can be modulated or targeted at several critical points to elicit tumor rejection. These steps include: (1) processing and presentation of a tumor-specific antigen by antigen-presenting cells, (2) generation of sufficient numbers of effector T, B or natural killer (NK) cells in vivo; (3) trafficking and infiltration into the tumor; (4) overcoming inhibitory networks in the tumor microenvironment; and (5) persistence of the antitumor T cells and the generation of memory T cells. The twelve 2018 IOTN awards tackle several key aspects (highlighted in blue) in this process.

### Pseudo-understanding: an analysis of the dilution of value in healthcare [^a2c56384]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Management concepts cycle through healthcare in trends lasting 3-5 years. This may hinder policy-makers, healthcare managers, researchers and clinicians from grasping the intricacies of a management concept and prevent organisations from realising the potential of these concepts. We, therefore, sought to characterise how the newest management concept, value-based healthcare (VBHC), is used and understood in the scientific literature.

Methods

We developed a novel five-step approach: (1) identification of a trend-starting article, (2) identification of key conceptual aspects in the trend-starting article, (3) collection of citing articles and identification of citing text, (4) categorisation of citing text to evaluate which aspects were used and (5) categorisation of citing text according to the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy to evaluate understanding.

Results

We identified four aspects in the trend-starting article, 'What is value in healthcare', of which value and outcomes were the most cited. More than one-quarter of the citing texts demonstrated no understanding of the aspect referred to; most demonstrated a superficial understanding. Level of understanding was inversely related to journal impact factor (IF), and did not change significantly over time. A deeper understanding was demonstrated in those articles that repeatedly cited the trend-starting article.

Conclusions

None of the four aspects were understood at a level required to develop the management concept of VBHC. VBHC may be undergoing a process of dilution rather than diffusion. To break the cycle of management trends, we encourage a deeper reflective process about the translation of management concepts in healthcare.

### Mechanisms and control of protein translation in the kidney [^7709a97e]. American Journal of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Translational control of protein synthesis is critical for cell division, homeostasis and survival. Recent data indicate that dysregulation of protein synthesis that leads to either increased or decreased expression of specific proteins contributes to the manifestations of various kidney diseases. Most of the control of protein synthesis occurs in the first or initiation phase, which is also the most complicated. Following the initiation phase is the elongation phase where the peptide chain is formed. RNA transcripts are released from ribosomes after the termination phase. Transcripts can be translated in a cap-dependent or cap-independent manner. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) cascade regulates translation of most cap-dependent transcripts at the level of initiation and elongation, which represents 95% of total transcripts. During specific events (e.g. mitosis, stress cell survival) control of the less-common cap-independent transcripts occurs which allows the cell to adapt to the new state. Activation of stress kinases and inactivation of the mTOR pathway are at the center of this adaptive mechanism. Recent studies have elucidated the role of micro-RNAs (miRs) in controlling translation. miRs bind directly to specific transcripts and most often directly reduce translation; however, by targeting other positive or negative regulators of the pathways regulating protein synthesis they may indirectly affect synthetic levels of other transcripts. Several examples are described below in which these mechanisms are intertwined and act together to dysregulate protein synthesis in the diseased kidney.

### How well are we applying quantitative methods to reverse translation to inform early clinical development? [^af8535c1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

If we are to improve our low success rate and rising costs in the pharmaceutical industry, we need to use every tool available. Reverse translation can particularly inform discovery and early clinical development via appropriate quantitative integration of relevant data. This commentary reports on a crowd-sourced survey (2017) that sought to evaluate the integration of reverse translation in pharma. The results indicate that these methods are being applied, to varying degrees, across most respondents.

Key challenges and lessons learnt in translation implementation research

Key challenges: developing a voice, conveying idioms, distance

The team described several challenges during the translation process. First, there was a learning process around developing a ‘voice’ and tone as a translator. Translators described an iterative process of translating and reviewing, and how particularly with the first set of transcripts there was a clear learning curve as they engaged with the content and texts. One translator described the process,

It wasn't until I got to the first ten or fifteen, I was like okay, this is my style. And the ones I translated afterwards have a very distinct kind of more objective style, because I think with the first two, I was almost struggling with wanting to translate word-for-word but I also know that [doing so] did not click as well… Like it is a skill that you're developing, you're still finding out how to do in a very standardised same way. It’s almost like you need a little bit of trial period, almost needing to hone that skill a bit more. And then you can produce your best work from that onwards. (P02)

One translator expanded on the interpretative aspect of translating tone and the process of developing translation skills to express this well, explaining:

Even though we were told to transcribe it word-for-word it’s just your own interpretation of how the words come together. And even how you choose to write how those words come together can actually influence what that sentence ends up meaning in a way… As I translated more, it became easier for me, and I knew like which steps I should take before. I knew the whole process of how, what is the best way to approach this. I tried out several methods. And I finally, like found the best one I should go with, and I just stick to that one for most of the other transcripts. (P01)

### The initiation of mammalian protein synthesis and mRNA scanning mechanism [^f24fe405]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

During translation initiation in eukaryotes, the small ribosomal subunit binds messenger RNA at the 5' end and scans in the 5' to 3' direction to locate the initiation codon, form the 80S initiation complex and start protein synthesis. This simple, yet intricate, process is guided by multiple initiation factors. Here we determine the structures of three complexes of the small ribosomal subunit that represent distinct steps in mammalian translation initiation. These structures reveal the locations of eIF1, eIF1A, mRNA and initiator transfer RNA bound to the small ribosomal subunit and provide insights into the details of translation initiation specific to eukaryotes. Conformational changes associated with the captured functional states reveal the dynamics of the interactions in the P site of the ribosome. These results have functional implications for the mechanism of mRNA scanning.

### Structure of the 30S translation initiation complex [^cf315b68]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Translation initiation, the rate-limiting step of the universal process of protein synthesis, proceeds through sequential, tightly regulated steps. In bacteria, the correct messenger RNA start site and the reading frame are selected when, with the help of initiation factors IF1, IF2 and IF3, the initiation codon is decoded in the peptidyl site of the 30S ribosomal subunit by the fMet-tRNA(fMet) anticodon. This yields a 30S initiation complex (30SIC) that is an intermediate in the formation of the 70S initiation complex (70SIC) that occurs on joining of the 50S ribosomal subunit to the 30SIC and release of the initiation factors. The localization of IF2 in the 30SIC has proved to be difficult so far using biochemical approaches, but could now be addressed using cryo-electron microscopy and advanced particle separation techniques on the basis of three-dimensional statistical analysis. Here we report the direct visualization of a 30SIC containing mRNA, fMet-tRNA(fMet) and initiation factors IF1 and GTP-bound IF2. We demonstrate that the fMet-tRNA(fMet) is held in a characteristic and precise position and conformation by two interactions that contribute to the formation of a stable complex: one involves the transfer RNA decoding stem which is buried in the 30S peptidyl site, and the other occurs between the carboxy-terminal domain of IF2 and the tRNA acceptor end. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of 70SIC assembly and rationalizes the rapid activation of GTP hydrolysis triggered on 30SIC-50S joining by showing that the GTP-binding domain of IF2 would directly face the GTPase-activated centre of the 50S subunit.

### Nascent peptide-induced translation discontinuation in eukaryotes impacts biased amino acid usage in proteomes [^0aeb42b2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Life depends on the functions of proteins. Myriads of proteins in living organisms are synthesized by ribosomes, and robust translation elongation of any given amino acid sequence is required to shape proteomes. The translation mechanisms of ribosomes, including the essential properties of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and the exit tunnel, are well conserved in all living organisms. The ribosome complex processively synthesizes the nascent polypeptide chain without detachment, despite the large conformational changes during the elongation cycle. The elongation by the translating complex progresses, decoding any codon on the open reading frame (ORF) of an mRNA until the ribosome arrives at a stop codon. Essentially, the ribosomes decode any codon on ORFs. The lengthening nascent polypeptides pass through the ribosomal exit tunnel, which encloses 30–40 amino acids of the growing nascent polypeptidyl-tRNA,.

Recent studies have revealed that the translation elongation rate is non-constant. The dynamics of translating ribosomes are affected not only by the scarcity of tRNAs in corresponding codons and mRNA secondary structures – but also by specific interactions between the ribosome exit tunnel and the nascent chain,,. The tunnel-nascent chain interactions result in altered translational speeds in both bacteria and eukaryotes –. Mechanistically, the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged ribosomal RNAs and positively charged nascent polypeptides could cause ribosomal pausing –. For instance, the translation of proline stretches reportedly causes elongation pausing, which is alleviated by eIF5A. Recent global studies on eIF5A using the ribosome profiling method showed that eIF5A also affects the elongation of tripeptide motifs enriched with negatively charged amino acids (Asp: D and Glu: E), in addition to proline stretches,. The translation of aberrant mRNAs causes elongation pausing and ribosome collision, and is subsequently eliminated by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) systems in eukaryotes,.

### Translation from unconventional 5' start sites drives tumour initiation [^5fb4f295]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects tumour initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the transition from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of inducible SOX2, which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers, we show that despite widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, certain oncogenic mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites, enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation factor eIF2A is essential for cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation at these upstream sites, differentially skewing translation and protein expression. Our findings unveil a role for the translation of 5' untranslated regions in cancer, and expose new targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Translation of non-standard codon nucleotides reveals minimal requirements for codon-anticodon interactions [^a9ef6b6f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our study implies that the codon–anticodon helix can accommodate several natural and non-natural base modifications within mRNAs as long as the resulting base pair is isosteric to W–C geometry. The data show that the interactions, in the middle of the base pair, between N 1 and N 3 at the first two nucleotides are crucial and appear to be sufficient for tRNA binding and for defining of the identity of the codon nucleotide. It should be noted, however, that the ability to decode modified bases might be dependent upon the identity of the codon and on the presence and type of tRNA modifications. In addition, we observe distinct selectivity differences between the bacterial and eukaryotic translation systems with the eukaryotic system appearing less tolerant to nucleotide modifications in the mRNA codons than the bacterial one.

Despite this robustness, the tolerance toward weakening the W–C interactions is limited. In the case of multiple inosines within the CDS, the ribosome is no longer able to provide efficient translation of the modified mRNA. Although A-to-I editing of mRNAs is a potent way to increase the genetic flexibility, this benefit might also come at the cost of losing translation efficiency. It is also conceivable that inosines are deliberately employed to regulate expression by inhibiting protein synthesis. Nonetheless, it is remarkable that the ribosome can tolerate the loss of a variety of interactions between the codon and the anticodon, which illustrates the robust nature of the decoding process.

### Quantitative tRNA-sequencing uncovers metazoan tissue-specific tRNA regulation [^1f149104]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Translation of the genetic code is clearly critical to all life. While the ribosome is the cellular instrument that executes translation, it relies upon transfer RNA (tRNA) to properly decipher the genetic information contained within messenger RNA (mRNA). tRNAs parlay codon identity into amino acid identity. Each tRNA is charged with high precision and fidelity to one of 20 amino acids; the amino acid matches the tRNAs triplet code as determined by its anticodon loop. Reading of the genetic code takes place in the ribosome one amino acid at a time via base pairing between the mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon; in this way, each amino acid is brought to the ribosome and polymerized into the growing polypeptide chain in precisely the order specified within the DNA-encoded gene.

This singular nature of tRNA in deciphering the genetic code necessitates that they are subject to a high degree of processing and quality control. tRNA transcripts are small; typically ~70–80 nucleotides in size. They are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in the nucleus and undergo an extensive maturation process before utilization,. Pol III promoter elements are internal to the tRNA body, constraining sequence variation. In addition, all tRNAs undergo exo/endonucleolytic trimming events and post-transcriptional nucleotide modifications. Some tRNAs are spliced, and all are post-transcriptionally 3′ end modified with the trinucleotide C-C-A. In the cytoplasm, tRNAs are charged with their appropriate amino acid by specific aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Mature tRNAs exhibit extensive secondary cloverleaf and tertiary L-shaped structure and a loop structure containing the codon-specific reverse-complement trinucleotide (anticodon). Together, processing, modification, and genomically encoded structure cooperate to stabilize tRNA and serve as recognition features for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and translation factors,.

### Secondary structures that regulate mRNA translation provide insights for ASO-mediated modulation of cardiac hypertrophy [^0c5bb6c2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is a fundamental process required to produce proteins that in turn conduct biochemical reactions and other biological functions in all organisms. This process is tightly regulated to control protein levels in response to physiological and pathological cues,. During canonical translation initiation, the 40S small ribosomal subunit is recruited by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F; also known as eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF4A trimeric complex) to form the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC). The PIC then scans the 5′-untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the mRNA towards the coding sequence start codon, and translation initiation occurs. While scanning, the PIC interacts with cis-acting elements that regulate mRNA translation. One of the most common elements is upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that encode short peptides and are present in approximately 50% of human mRNAs. Translating these peptide-encoding sequences leads to suppression of the main open reading frame (mORF; also referred to as the protein-coding sequence, CDS) because the PIC is consumed during translation initiation in uORFs,. Despite this seemingly wasteful process, uORFs have persisted throughout evolution, suggesting this mechanism is vital to protein expression and physiological homeostasis. uORFs are known to regulate the expression of proteins that play important roles in diverse biological processes such as cell differentiation or catabolic metabolism, and may contribute to disease processes –. However, considering the large number of uORFs and the great diversity of 5′ UTRs in the human transcriptome, the mechanistic regulation and functional significance of most uORFs remain unknown.

### Real-time tRNA transit on single translating ribosomes at codon resolution [^519bcea9]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Translation by the ribosome occurs by a complex mechanism involving the coordinated interaction of multiple nucleic acid and protein ligands. Here we use zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) and sophisticated detection instrumentation to allow real-time observation of translation at physiologically relevant micromolar ligand concentrations. Translation at each codon is monitored by stable binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)-labelled with distinct fluorophores-to translating ribosomes, which allows direct detection of the identity of tRNA molecules bound to the ribosome and therefore the underlying messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. We observe the transit of tRNAs on single translating ribosomes and determine the number of tRNA molecules simultaneously bound to the ribosome, at each codon of an mRNA molecule. Our results show that ribosomes are only briefly occupied by two tRNA molecules and that release of deacylated tRNA from the exit (E) site is uncoupled from binding of aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site) tRNA and occurs rapidly after translocation. The methods outlined here have broad application to the study of mRNA sequences, and the mechanism and regulation of translation.

### Structural basis for messenger RNA movement on the ribosome [^93732b7d]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Translation initiation is a major determinant of the overall expression level of a gene. The translation of functionally active protein requires the messenger RNA to be positioned on the ribosome such that the start/initiation codon will be read first and in the correct frame. Little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction of mRNA with the ribosome at different states of translation. Recent crystal structures of the ribosomal subunits, the empty 70S ribosome and the 70S ribosome containing functional ligands have provided information about the general organization of the ribosome and its functional centres. Here we compare the X-ray structures of eight ribosome complexes modelling the translation initiation, post-initiation and elongation states. In the initiation and post-initiation complexes, the presence of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) duplex causes strong anchoring of the 5'-end of mRNA onto the platform of the 30S subunit, with numerous interactions between mRNA and the ribosome. Conversely, the 5' end of the 'elongator' mRNA lacking SD interactions is flexible, suggesting a different exit path for mRNA during elongation. After the initiation of translation, but while an SD interaction is still present, mRNA moves in the 3'-->5' direction with simultaneous clockwise rotation and lengthening of the SD duplex, bringing it into contact with ribosomal protein S2.

### Tracking transcription-translation coupling in real time [^3f60addd]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled 1-4 . Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome-RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process 5-10 , we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription-translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.

Despite major scientific investments, safety accounts for significant pipeline attrition, especially in late preclinical and early clinical development.

Model-informed translation can address these challenges, both through "forward" translation of early signals to future scenarios, as well as through "reverse" translation of safety data into mechanistic insight.

### Coupled protein synthesis and ribosome-guided piRNA processing on mRNAs [^0dece706]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The linked but distinct biogenic requirements before and after the stop codon of uppl main ORFs suggest that post-transcriptional processing of piRNAs can be further divided into two phases: substrate recognition and efficient processing. Since uppl ORFs are still processed into piRNAs distinct from other cellular mRNAs, this suggests that uppl mRNAs are recognized as substrates for piRNA processing as entire transcripts before endonucleolytic cleavages occur. Otherwise, if the substrate recognition couples with piRNA processing, as soon as the initial cleavage starts on 3′UTRs, the ORF portion of the transcripts would display no unique feature compared to other translating mRNAs. Our finding that the ORF portion of transcripts still enter piRNA processing but in an inefficient manner suggests that either post-termination ribosomes streamline piRNA production and/or the translating ribosomes inhibit piRNA processing machinery from accessing the RNAs. The requirement of TDRD5 for 3′UTR piRNA biogenesis suggests that TDRD5 may function by coordinating post-termination ribosomes with piRNA processing machinery. TDRD5 detected in amniotes (which harbor a homolog with >50% protein sequence identity with the mouse TDRD5) but not in fish (<10% of potential homologs)may have co-evolved with appearance of ribosome-guided piRNA biogenesis. Furthermore, although 3′UTR piRNAs have been characterized in fruit flies and the cis RNA elements sufficient to promote piRNA biogenesis in somatic cells have been identified,, their biogenesis remains when upstream translation is inhibited, and the region downstream of the cis RNA element produce fewer piRNAs than the element region itself. Thus, consistent with the recent appearance of TDRD5, ribosome-guided piRNA biogenesis is unlikely to be conserved in invertebrates and further studies are required to trace its evolutionary origins.

In summary, we reveal a conserved and general piRNA biogenesis mechanism that recognizes translating RNAs regardless of whether they harbor long ORFs or not. The assembly of 80S ribosomes on non-coding regions of RNA is not restricted by the length of the upstream ORFs and is temporally staggered with translation-dependent RNA quality-control pathways, suggesting compromised ribosome recycling. The coupling of piRNA biogenesis with translation fine-tunes the abundance of proteins that are critical for spermatogenesis in both mice and chickens.

### Cultural adaptation and validation of the health and work performance questionnaire in German [^c1407216]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Design

This study was conducted in two phases. First, the HPQ was translated from English into German, culturally adapted, and tested using “cognitive debriefing” in interviews. Second, the translated item measuring presenteeism as productivity loss was validated regarding its ability to show differences between groups for related constructs. For the reporting of the results, we adhered to the guidelines from the Consensus-based Standards of the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN).The COSMIN manual offers checklists for conducting hypothesis testing elaborating structural validity and for cross-cultural validity. The checklist for hypothesis testing consists of 10 questions, such as “Were hypotheses regarding correlations or mean differences formulated a priori?”. The checklist for cross-cultural validity consists of 15 questions, such as “Was the instrument pretested (eg, cognitive interviews to check interpretation, cultural relevance of the translation, and ease of comprehension)?”.

Phase 1: Translation and Cultural Adaption

The HPQ was fully translated and cross-culturally adapted to German in accordance with established guidelines for scientific translation processes “SPOR Principles of Good Practice.”Figure 1 presents the stages of the translation process. In stage 1, all items were independently forward translated by a native German-speaking professional translator and a native German-speaking researcher. After translation, the two versions were compared by an expert panel and discussed, and a consensual final version 1 was created. The expert panel was consisted of the project team and the translators. In stage 2, the translated items were independently back translated into English by an English-speaking translator and researcher, who were both native German speakers. Afterward, language discrepancies were resolved by discussion, and a consensual final version 2 was created. In the last step, the translated items were tested using “cognitive debriefing,”to reach cross-cultural validity by determining acceptability, understandability, and clarity for translation. After those interviews, a final version was created and proofread by a translation agency.

### A memory transcriptome time course reveals essential long-term memory transcription factors [^34ed2c59]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Taken together, our courtship LTM transcriptome time course analysis reveals a MB-specific transcriptional memory trace in the late stages of training and the early post-training period when memory consolidation is occurring. This memory trace is enriched for genes involved in the cellular correlates of LTM. Many of these genes are broadly activated in the MB and WH during the early training stages, with MB-specific re-induction occurring later towards the end of training, and post-training.

Post-training requirement of translation for courtship LTM

Many components of the translation machinery were identified among TIGs and TRGs in both WH and MB (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Since translation is essential for LTM, we examined the expression of all genes annotated for “ribosome” (GO: Cellular Component) and “translation factors” (WikiPathways). In naïve MBs, these genes fluctuate in concordance with circadian activity rhythms showing a peak of expression precisely at the day to night transition and a low point of expression during the mid-day siesta (Fig. 2A). In trained flies, this pattern is completely disrupted. Translation genes are not reduced in expression during mid-day. Instead, they maintain a more consistent expression level during the day, while training is occurring, and after training during the consolidation period, with a peak in expression at 4hAT (Fig. 2A). Examples of expression profiles for specific translation initiation factors (eIF3b, eIF1A) and ribosomal proteins (RpS21, RpS9) are shown in Fig. S2. Translation is one of the essential processes that is crucial for LTM formation in many paradigms,, but the requirement for translation in courtship LTM has not been previously tested. We inhibited protein synthesis by feeding wild type flies media containing cycloheximide (CXM) beginning 1 day prior to STM or LTM training, and tested memory ability. Flies fed CXM were able to form STM, but not LTM (Fig. 2B–D). Flies that were removed from CXM media at the end of training, therefore allowing for translation to resume during the post training consolidation period, showed normal LTM (Fig. 2B–D). Taken together, this suggests that translation is required for courtship LTM, with translation occurring during the post-training period being the most critical for normal LTM formation.

Procedure and sampling

Following permission from the original author, the translation of CAPD involved two translators: one professional and the main author, who was familiar with the measurement tool context. Their translations were consolidated through discussions with RNs and physicians knowledgeable about pediatric care and delirium. The merged Swedish version was subsequently back-translated into English by a new translator unfamiliar with the original. A harmonization process ensured consistency across versions. All translations were compared to verify accuracy, and the final version was submitted to the original author for approval.

To ensure the comprehensibility of the translated CAPD in the Swedish setting, a process of cultural adaptation was conducted using cognitive interviews, a method for testing questionnaires in healthcare settings, following the method outlined by Andersen et al. This method aims to clarify how respondents understand and interpret different components of healthcare questionnaires.

### Conserved GTPase OLA1 promotes efficient translation on D / E-rich mRNA [^6c97e047]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Ribosome stalling is a common event in living cells, especially under stress conditions. Ribosomes stall to allow co-translational protein folding, targeting or interactions, and this stalling is dictated by a combination of the mRNA sequence and structure, tRNA availability and the nascent peptide. However, ribosome stalling can also lead to ribosome collisions and co-translational degradation of both mRNA and nascent chain. It has been reported that 63% of the conserved stall sites (CSS) could be explained by specific amino acids (Pro, Gly and Asp) at P-site, Glu at A-site, lysine stretches or negatively charged amino acids at the entrance to the exit tunnel. As the entrance to the exit tunnel is narrow, it has been hypothesized that upon encountering it, the negative charge of amino acids might repel the negative charge of the exit tunnel and slow down the translation,. EF-P/eIF5A, Rbg1/Tma46, and some ABCF proteins have been reported to promote the translation on these stall sites,,. Understanding how the translating ribosome tunes the different maturation steps that nascent proteins must undergo, what the timing of these maturation events is, and how degradation can be avoided when stalling is needed, is now possible by the emergence of methods to follow ribosome dynamics in vivo. Here, we showed that OLA1 is related to the ribosome stalling at the D/E-rich mRNA region. Alignment of the TGS domain between YchF, Rbg1 and RelA suggested a possible binding site of OLA1/YchF on the stalled ribosome, which is h5 of the small subunit rRNA. We still do not know the details of the splitting process due to the absence of structures of the pre-splitting complexes. However, based on the observation that YchF(H114A) binds to the 50S subunit, ATPase activity is most likely not required for ribosomal subunit dissociation, but important for YchF dissociation from the 50S subunit.

### A threonyl-tRNA synthetase-mediated translation initiation machinery [^b666915f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A fundamental question in biology is how vertebrates evolved and differ from invertebrates, and little is known about differences in the regulation of translation in the two systems. Herein, we identify a threonyl-tRNA synthetase (TRS)-mediated translation initiation machinery that specifically interacts with eIF4E homologous protein, and forms machinery that is structurally analogous to the eIF4F-mediated translation initiation machinery via the recruitment of other translation initiation components. Biochemical and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses coupled to sequencing suggest that this machinery emerged as a gain-of-function event in the vertebrate lineage, and it positively regulates the translation of mRNAs required for vertebrate development. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TRS evolved to regulate vertebrate translation initiation via its dual role as a scaffold for the assembly of initiation components and as a selector of target mRNAs. This work highlights the functional significance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the emergence and control of higher order organisms.

### The balance between proinsulin biosynthesis and insulin secretion: where can imbalance lead? [^522e01fa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Insulin is stored in pancreatic beta-cells in beta-granules. Whenever insulin is secreted in response to a nutrient secretagogue, there is a complementary increase in proinsulin biosynthesis to replenish intracellular insulin stores. This specific nutrient regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis is predominately regulated at the translational level. Recently, a highly conserved cis-element in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of preproinsulin mRNA, named ppIGE, has been identified that is required for specific translational regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis. This ppIGE is also found in the 5'-UTR of certain other translationally regulated beta-granule protein mRNAs, including the proinsulin processing endopeptidases, PC1/3 and PC2. This provides a mechanism whereby proinsulin processing is adaptable to changes in proinsulin biosynthesis. However, relatively few beta-granules undergo secretion, with most remaining in the storage pool for approximately 5 days. Aged beta-granules are retired by intracellular degradation mechanisms, either via crinophagy and/or autophagy, as another long-term means of maintaining beta-granule stores at optimal levels. When a disconnection between insulin production and secretion arises, as may occur in type 2 diabetes, autophagy further increases to maintain beta-granule numbers. However, if this increased autophagy becomes chronic, autophagia-mediated cell death occurs that could then contribute to beta-cell loss in type 2 diabetes.

### Tracking transcription-translation coupling in real time [^7e20154e]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled –. Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process –, we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.

### Co-translational assembly of mammalian nuclear multisubunit complexes [^fc094857]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Often proteins do not act alone, instead they function as components of large multisubunit complexes in a cell. To better understand cellular functions, investigating the precise mechanism that guide the formation of these multisubunit assemblies is of key importance. A cell uses hundreds of different protein complexes that vary with respect to their complexity. Some complexes require the association of multiple copies of the same subunit, while others are constituted of many different subunits. The latter group includes many transcription regulatory and chromatin remodelling complexes (see below). In order to achieve the efficient formation of protein complexes in eukaryotes, the genes coding for all the subunits (dispersed in the eukaryotic genome) have to be transcribed in the nucleus, their corresponding mRNAs transported to the cytoplasm, translated into proteins, and the formation of correct interactions among the subunits must be orchestrated. A polysome is a cluster of ribosomes acting on a single mRNA to translate its information into polypeptides. Appropriate translation-based mechanisms may exist in the cell to regulate the interactions between specific subunits in order to avoid incorrect non-specific interactions or subunit aggregations in the absence of the correct partner. Currently, it is not well understood how functional subunit interactions are regulated in eukaryotic cells. Protein complex formation is often studied in vitro using purified subunits, assuming that individually translated subunits assemble stochastically by diffusion, and thus favouring the idea that these multisubunit complexes assemble post-translationally. However, in the crowded environment of an eukaryotic cell such simple diffusion-dependent models may not work, as subunits may engage in non-specific interactions or form aggregates. Recent studies in bacteria demonstrated that co-translational building of a functional protein dimer is more efficient than the post-translational assembly of its individual subunits,, and also in yeast co-translation has been shown to be an efficient assembly pathway to assemble multiprotein complexes –. Consequently, two co-translational models have been put forward: (i) the simultaneous model which suggests that two polysomes in close physical proximity synthesise subunits, which interact while being translated and (ii) the sequential model implies that a mature fully translated subunit interacts co-translationally with its polysome-bound nascent interaction partner.
