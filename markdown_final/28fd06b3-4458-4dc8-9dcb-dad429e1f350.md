## Question

What is the trabecular bone score?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about a precise definition and technical basis of TBS. Then, I should verify what TBS actually measures compared with bone mineral density (BMD). Next, I will examine the evidence for fracture risk prediction and how TBS integrates with FRAX and guidelines. After that, I need to check practical advantages, populations where TBS adds value, algorithm versions and precision, and its role in therapy monitoring. Finally, I should summarize interpretation thresholds, limitations, and the overall clinical take-home message [^115M99Tp] [^114EhJjh] [^114K51MS].

> Let me first confirm the core definition before drawing conclusions: TBS is a gray-level textural index derived from standard two-dimensional lumbar spine DXA images that provides information about trabecular microarchitecture and bone quality beyond BMD, functioning as a BMD-independent risk indicator for fracture, calculated retrospectively from existing spine scans using dedicated software without additional imaging acquisition [^115M99Tp] [^114EhJjh].

> I will now examine the technical basis to ensure I am not overinterpreting what TBS captures: TBS is computed from variogram-based analysis of pixel gray-level variations across the projected spine DXA image, allowing discrimination between scans with similar BMD but differing microstructural texture; software such as TBS iNsight applies this analysis to previously acquired L1–L4 images, enabling retrospective processing within standard DXA workflows [^115M99Tp] [^114EhJjh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about direct microarchitecture measurement; I should confirm that TBS is an indirect surrogate: higher TBS corresponds to more homogeneous, better-connected trabecular structure, whereas lower TBS indicates degraded, heterogeneous architecture, complementing but not replacing BMD as a determinant of bone strength within the broader concept of bone quality beyond density alone [^115M99Tp] [^112zeqnb].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for fracture risk prediction to avoid overstatement: across large cohorts, a one-SD decrease in TBS is associated with a substantially higher risk of major osteoporotic fractures independent of age and remains significant even after adjusting for FRAX probability; similar associations are observed in older men, supporting TBS as an independent and complementary risk marker beyond BMD and FRAX [^114K51MS] [^113Fuiw3].

> Wait, let me verify how guidelines operationalize this: current expert recommendations endorse incorporating TBS alongside BMD and FRAX probability, especially in individuals near pharmacologic intervention thresholds, with FRAX-plus platforms allowing TBS adjustment and modest, clinically meaningful reclassification of patients close to decision cutpoints [^111VR2ML] [^114EhJjh] [^112yr3Ci] [^116Lak3Y].

> I need to check practical advantages and workflow realities: TBS adds no radiation exposure, can be applied retrospectively to existing lumbar spine DXA images, is available as software integrated into routine densitometry, and has been shown to add clinically useful information across typical densitometry populations without requiring new hardware [^114EhJjh] [^115M99Tp] [^111Jw22r].

> Let me consider where TBS particularly helps so I don't miss key phenotypes: in type 2 diabetes, paradoxically higher BMD coexists with lower TBS and higher fracture risk; in chronic glucocorticoid exposure, degraded TBS is common and discriminates fractures better than BMD; in reduced kidney function and primary hyperparathyroidism, TBS relates to fragility risk or structure and can reveal abnormalities not captured by BMD alone, supporting its complementary role in these conditions [^113yMkvN] [^114FQuJF] [^113MdQp8] [^1136GN7t].

> But wait, what about algorithm updates and potential confounding by body composition; I should double-check this: earlier versions adjusted for BMI (v3.03), whereas an updated algorithm accounts for regional soft tissue thickness (v4.0) and shows stronger fracture prediction, which matters particularly in individuals with higher soft tissue or varying anthropometrics and in pediatrics where tissue-thickness algorithms underlie the new reference norms [^111dXVeH] [^114JFmuT].

> I should confirm precision and monitoring implications before recommending serial use: TBS short-term precision is lower than that of BMD, with an LSC around 5.8% in clinical practice and approximately 5.2–5.4% in precision studies depending on scan mode, so facilities should establish their own LSC and interpret small serial changes cautiously [^114EhJjh] [^116jjCq1].

> Next, I should review how TBS behaves during therapy, because misinterpreting change could mislead decisions: changes in TBS during bisphosphonate or short-term denosumab therapy generally do not predict fracture risk reduction, whereas anabolic or dual-effect therapies like teriparatide and romosozumab, and longer-term antiresorptives, can produce measurable TBS gains consistent with microarchitectural improvement; I almost said denosumab improves TBS reliably in the short term, but wait, the evidence shows limited short-term predictive utility and more consistent gains with anabolic or longer-term regimens, so I should be precise here [^114omRsH] [^112YUKd4] [^112PQfcE].

> I need to ensure interpretation thresholds are framed appropriately: commonly cited cut-points categorize normal TBS around 1.35 or higher and degraded microarchitecture below about 1.230, but these thresholds can be context- and algorithm-dependent, with population means around 1.30 in postmenopausal cohorts, so clinical decisions should consider the specific software version, population, and FRAX-adjusted risk rather than relying on TBS alone [^1136GN7t] [^114FQuJF] [^11716UsZ] [^114EhJjh].

> Let me reconsider limitations so I don't overgeneralize: pediatric application remains limited by evolving reference data and algorithm differences that can bias Z-scores if mismatched, soft tissue and BMI can impact older algorithms, and TBS should not be used as a standalone diagnostic measure but rather integrated with BMD, FRAX, and clinical context; updated algorithms that account for tissue thickness mitigate some confounding but do not eliminate the need for careful interpretation [^114JFmuT] [^111dXVeH] [^114EhJjh].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-based: TBS is a software-derived, DXA-based texture index of lumbar spine images that provides BMD-independent insight into trabecular microarchitecture and fracture risk, improves risk stratification when combined with BMD and FRAX — particularly near treatment thresholds — adds no radiation, and is endorsed in contemporary guidance, while requiring attention to algorithm version, precision limits, and its complementary (not standalone) role in management [^115M99Tp] [^114K51MS] [^111VR2ML] [^114EhJjh].

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a DXA-derived, grayscale texture index from lumbar spine images [^115M99Tp] that provides an **indirect measure of trabecular microarchitecture** and predicts fracture risk independently of BMD [^114K51MS] [^113Fuiw3]. TBS is **complementary to BMD** [^112yr3Ci] and is recommended to be used with BMD and FRAX, especially near intervention thresholds [^114EhJjh] [^116Lak3Y]. It is particularly useful in diabetes [^113yMkvN], glucocorticoid therapy [^114FQuJF], and secondary osteoporosis [^1136GN7t], and can be applied retrospectively to existing DXA scans without extra radiation or scanning [^114EhJjh] [^111Jw22r]. TBS is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD, so **BMD remains primary for monitoring therapy** [^114omRsH] [^112yr3Ci].

---

## Definition and measurement

TBS is a gray-level texture metric derived from lumbar spine DXA that reflects **trabecular microarchitecture** and provides information beyond BMD [^115M99Tp]. Measurement: It is calculated from standard lumbar spine DXA images using specialized software (e.g. TBS iNsight) [^114EhJjh] and requires **no additional scans or radiation** [^111Jw22r].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Fracture risk prediction**: TBS predicts major osteoporotic and vertebral fractures [^113Fuiw3] independently of BMD and clinical risk factors [^114K51MS].

- **Complementary to BMD**: TBS adds value to BMD, especially in patients with normal or osteopenic BMD but degraded microarchitecture [^112yr3Ci].

- **Integration with FRAX**: TBS-adjusted FRAX modestly improves fracture risk prediction [^114K51MS] and can reclassify patients near intervention thresholds [^116Lak3Y].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ISCD and ESCEO recommend using TBS alongside **BMD and FRAX** for fracture risk assessment, particularly near intervention thresholds [^114EhJjh] [^112PQfcE]. The **ESCEO 2024 men's osteoporosis guideline** similarly recommends TBS with BMD and FRAX for risk assessment in men [^111VR2ML].

---

## Clinical applications

- **Diabetes mellitus**: TBS helps explain increased fracture risk in type 2 diabetes [^114dm1Cw] despite higher BMD [^113yMkvN].

- **Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis**: TBS improves fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid-treated patients [^114FQuJF].

- **Secondary osteoporosis**: TBS is useful in secondary osteoporosis, including chronic kidney disease [^113MdQp8] and hyperparathyroidism [^1136GN7t].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Technical factors**: TBS is influenced by BMI, soft tissue thickness, and imaging mode; updated algorithms adjust for these factors [^111dXVeH] [^114JFmuT].

- **Reproducibility**: TBS has lower reproducibility than BMD, with a higher least significant change (LSC) [^116jjCq1].

- **Therapy monitoring**: TBS is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD, so BMD remains primary for monitoring [^114omRsH] [^112yr3Ci].

Trabecular bone score is a DXA-derived index that reflects trabecular microarchitecture [^115M99Tp] and predicts fracture risk independently of BMD [^114K51MS]. It is recommended to be used with BMD and FRAX, especially near intervention thresholds [^116Lak3Y], and is particularly useful in diabetes, glucocorticoid therapy, and secondary osteoporosis [^113yMkvN] [^114FQuJF] [^1136GN7t]. TBS can be applied retrospectively to existing DXA scans without additional radiation or scanning [^114EhJjh], but it is less responsive to antiresorptives than BMD, so **BMD remains primary for monitoring therapy** [^114omRsH] [^112yr3Ci].

### A meta-analysis of trabecular bone score in fracture risk prediction and its relationship to FRAX [^114K51MS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural index of bone microarchitecture derived from lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images. TBS is a bone mineral density (BMD)-independent predictor of fracture risk. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether TBS predicted fracture risk independently of FRAX probability and to examine their combined performance by adjusting the FRAX probability for TBS. We utilized individual-level data from 17,809 men and women in 14 prospective population-based cohorts. Baseline evaluation included TBS and the FRAX risk variables, and outcomes during follow-up (mean 6.7 years) comprised major osteoporotic fractures.

The association between TBS, FRAX probabilities, and the risk of fracture was examined using an extension of the Poisson regression model in each cohort and for each sex and expressed as the gradient of risk (GR; hazard ratio per 1 SD change in risk variable in the direction of increased risk). FRAX probabilities were adjusted for TBS using an adjustment factor derived from an independent cohort (the Manitoba Bone Density Cohort).

Overall, the GR of TBS for major osteoporotic fracture was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.53) when adjusted for age and time since baseline and was similar in men and women (p > 0.10). When additionally adjusted for FRAX 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture, TBS remained a significant, independent predictor for fracture (GR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.24–1.41). The adjustment of FRAX probability for TBS resulted in a small increase in the GR (1.76, 95% CI 1).

### Tbs (trabecular bone score) and diabetes-related fracture risk [^113yMkvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased fracture risk but paradoxically greater bone mineral density (BMD). Trabecular bone score (TBS) is derived from the texture of the spine dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image and is related to bone microarchitecture and fracture risk, providing information independent of BMD. This study evaluated the ability of lumbar spine TBS to account for increased fracture risk in diabetes.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using BMD results from a large clinical registry for the province of Manitoba, Canada. The study included 29,407 women 50 years old and older with baseline DXA examinations, among whom 2,356 had diagnosed diabetes. Lumbar spine TBS was derived for each spine DXA examination blinded to clinical parameters and outcomes. Health service records were assessed for incident nontraumatic major osteoporotic fractures with a mean follow-up of 4.7 years.

Diabetes was associated with higher BMD at all sites but lower lumbar spine TBS in both unadjusted and adjusted models (all P < .001). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a measurement in the lowest vs. the highest tertile was less than 1 for BMD (all P < .001) but was increased for lumbar spine TBS (aOR 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30–2.97). Major osteoporotic fractures were identified in 175 women (7.4%) with diabetes and 1,493 (5.5%) without diabetes (P < .001). Lumbar spine TBS was a BMD-independent predictor of fracture and predicted fractures in those with diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.10–1.4).

### Evidence-based guideline for the management of osteoporosis in men [^111VR2ML]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for osteoporosis in men, specifically concerning bone mineral density testing, technical considerations, and ESCEO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of the trabecular bone score alongside bone mineral density and FRAX probability. This combination provides useful information for fracture risk assessment in men.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^114EhJjh]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is discussed in the ISCD Official Positions and a position paper from ESCEO, providing information on its use in clinical practice. TBS is a DXA-based software applied to lumbar spine DXA images previously obtained for BMD assessments. An advantage of TBS is the ability to apply it retrospectively to previously obtained DXA scans without the need for repeated testing. TBS of the lumbar spine has been shown to predict the risk of fragility fractures independently of BMD and clinical risk factors in men and women over 50 years old. The greatest utility of TBS appears to be for individuals who lie close to a FRAX or BMD T-score pharmacologic intervention threshold. Therefore, TBS should be used in conjunction with BMD and/or FRAX probability, rather than as a standalone measure. TBS can adjust either FRAX probability or BMD T-score and is incorporated into the FRAXplus ® platform, allowing for modification of FRAX probability to reflect a TBS measurement readily.

TBS, when used in combination with BMD, may add useful information in monitoring response to anabolic or long-term denosumab treatment, although it is of limited value for bisphosphonate or short-term denosumab therapy. The clinical utility of monitoring with TBS is influenced by the LSC value. It is suggested that the DXA facility calculate a TBS LSC using the same methodology as described for BMD LSC, or use a conservative estimation for TBS LSC of 5.8%. Normative reference data in children and various ethnicities are limited.

### Trabecular bone score: A noninvasive analytical method based upon the DXA image [^115M99Tp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a gray-level textural metric extracted from the two-dimensional lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image. TBS relates to bone microarchitecture and provides skeletal information not captured by the standard bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Based on experimental variograms of the projected DXA image, TBS can discern differences between DXA scans with similar BMD measurements. An elevated TBS value correlates with better skeletal microstructure, while a low TBS value correlates with weaker skeletal microstructure. Lumbar spine TBS has been evaluated in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

The following conclusions are based upon publications reviewed in this article:

- **Trabecular bone score gives lower values in specific populations**: TBS gives lower values in postmenopausal women and in men with previous fragility fractures than their nonfractured counterparts.

- **Complementary nature of TBS with DXA measurements**: TBS is complementary at the time of writing to the available lumbar spine DXA measurements.

- **Trabecular bone score distinguishes fracture risk**: TBS results are lower in women who have sustained a fragility fracture but in whom DXA does not indicate osteoporosis or even osteopenia.

- **Trabecular bone score predicts fracture risk effectively**: TBS predicts fracture risk as well as lumbar spine BMD measurements in postmenopausal women.

- **Variation in response to osteoporosis treatments**: Efficacious therapies for osteoporosis differ in the extent to which they influence the TBS.

- **Association of TBS with fracture risk in special conditions**: TBS is associated with fracture risk in individuals with conditions related to reduced bone mass or bone quality.

Based on these data, lumbar spine TBS holds promise as an emerging technology that could well become a valuable clinical tool in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

### Change in trabecular bone score (TBS) with antiresorptive therapy does not predict fracture in women: The Manitoba BMD cohort [^114omRsH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS), along with additional clinical risk factors, can be used to identify individuals at high fracture risk. Whether a change in TBS in untreated or treated women independently affects fracture risk is unclear. Using the Manitoba (Canada) DXA Registry, which contains all BMD results for the population, we identified 9,044 women aged ≥ 40 years with two consecutive DXA scans who were not receiving osteoporosis treatment at baseline (baseline mean age 62 ± 10 years).

We examined the change in BMD and TBS, osteoporosis treatment, and incident major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) for each individual. Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 770 women developed an incident MOF. During the interval between the two DXA scans (mean, 4.1 years), 5,083 women initiated osteoporosis treatment (with bisphosphonate use at 80%), whereas 3,961 women did not receive any osteoporosis treatment. Larger gains in both BMD and TBS were seen in women with greater adherence to osteoporosis medication (p for trend < 0.001), and the magnitude of the increase was consistently greater for BMD than for TBS.

- **Antifracture effects**: Among treated women, there was a greater antifracture effect for each SD increase in total hip BMD change (fracture decrease of 20%; 95% CI, 13% to 26%; p < 0.001), femoral neck BMD change (19%; 95% CI, 12% to 26%; p < 0.001), and lumbar spine BMD change (9%; 95% CI, 0% to 17%; p = 0.049). In contrast, a change in TBS did not predict fractures in women who initiated osteoporosis treatment (p = 0.10). Among untreated women, neither change in BMD nor TBS predicted fractures.

We conclude that, unlike…

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112PQfcE]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

The ability of the trabecular bone score (TBS) to predict fracture risk has been widely demonstrated in numerous studies. It has been found to be consistently independent of and complementary to bone mineral density (BMD) and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) using clinical risk factors. As a result, TBS, when used alongside BMD and FRAX® to adjust the FRAX® probability of fracture, has been incorporated into international guidelines. It serves as a readily available tool for identifying patients at risk for fractures and candidates for osteoporosis therapy.

Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits sclerostin. It exerts a dual effect of increasing bone formation while decreasing bone resorption. Treatment with romosozumab in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis has been shown to increase BMD and decrease the risk of fractures when compared with placebo and alendronate. In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH) trial, monthly subcutaneous injections of romosozumab for 12 months followed by open-label alendronate significantly improved bone mass and bone strength parameters. This treatment provided superior risk reduction in new vertebral, clinical, nonvertebral, and hip fractures compared to alendronate alone at the primary analysis.

The objective of this study was to explore the effect of 12 months of romosozumab followed by 24 months of alendronate versus 36 months of alendronate alone on bone microarchitecture. This was assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted TBS in a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (LS DXA) scans collected from a subgroup of patients in the ARCH study, using the tissue thickness-adjusted TBS algorithm.

### Clinical performance of the updated trabecular bone score (TBS) algorithm, which accounts for the soft tissue thickness: The OsteoLaus study [^111dXVeH]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Low credibility.

Regional soft tissue may create noise that affects the trabecular bone score (TBS) and can potentially alter its estimate. The TBS software (TBS iNsight®) is based on an algorithm that accounts for body mass index (BMI) (TBS v3.03). We aimed to explore the updated TBS algorithm that accounts for soft tissue thickness (TBS v4.0). This study was embedded in the OsteoLaus cohort of women in Lausanne, Switzerland. Hip and lumbar spine (LS) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were performed using the Discovery A System (Hologic). The incidence of major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) was assessed using vertebral fracture assessments with Genant's method (vertebral MOF) or questionnaires (nonvertebral MOF).

We assessed the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD) or TBS with body composition parameters, the MOF prediction ability of both versions of TBS, and the differences between the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) adjusted for TBS v3.03 or TBS v4.0. In total, 1,362 women with a mean age of 64.4 ± 7.5 years and a mean BMI of 25.9 ± 4.5 kg/m² were followed for 4.4 years, during which 132 experienced an MOF.

All the anthropometric measurements of interest were positively correlated with LS, femoral neck, or hip BMD and TBS v4.0, whereas with TBS v3.03, their correlations were negative. In the models adjusted for age, soft tissue thickness, osteoporotic treatment, and LS-BMD, for each standard deviation decline in TBS v3.03, there was a 43% (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83) increase in the odds of having an MOF. For each standard deviation decline in TBS v4.0, there was a 54% (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.00) increase in the odds.

### Trabecular bone score (TBS) varies with correction for tissue thickness versus body mass index: Implications when using pediatric reference norms [^114JFmuT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). High credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) derived from secondary analysis of lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans improves fracture prediction independent of bone mineral density (BMD) in adults. The utility of TBS to assess fracture risk in younger patients has not been established because pediatric norms have been lacking. Robust TBS reference data from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) have been published. TBS values for the BMDCS study were derived using an algorithm that accounts for tissue thickness (TBS TH) rather than the commercially available algorithm that adjusts for body mass index (BMI; TBS BMI).

We examined the magnitude of differences in TBS TH and TBS BMI in a cohort of 189 healthy youth. TBS values using both algorithms increased with age and pubertal development in a similar pattern. However, TBS BMI values were systematically and significantly higher than TBS TH (mean = 0.06, p < 0.0001). The difference between calculated TBS BMI and TBS TH was not uniform. Differences were greater at lower TBS values, in males, in older individuals, in those at later Tanner stages, and in those with a greater BMI Z-score.

These systematic differences preclude the development of a simple formula to allow conversion of TBS BMI to TBS TH "equivalents". Because of these systematic differences in these two algorithms, using an individual's TBS BMI to calculate a Z-score using the BMDCS TBS TH reference values results in a falsely higher TBS Z-score (differences mean = 0.73, interquartile range [IQR] = 0.3 to 1.6).

### Association of glycaemic variables with trabecular bone score in post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114dm1Cw]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to determine the relationship between bone microarchitecture, as measured by trabecular bone score, and advanced glycation end-product accumulation, assessed by skin autofluorescence.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study involving 64 post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes and 175 post-menopausal women without diabetes. Trabecular bone score and skin autofluorescence data were obtained at the time of bone density measurement.

- **Results**: Trabecular bone score and skin autofluorescence were inversely correlated in women with type 2 diabetes (r = -0.34, P = 0.006); no correlation was observed in post-menopausal women without diabetes (r = -0.029, P = 0.707). After adjustment, neither skin autofluorescence nor a diagnosis of diabetes were associated with trabecular bone score, but HbA1c and waist circumference were independently associated with trabecular bone score.

- **Conclusion**: Skin autofluorescence did not predict trabecular bone score. In contrast, glycaemia, as reflected by HbA1c, and visceral adiposity, as indicated by waist circumference, were independently associated with trabecular bone score.

### The utility and limitations of using trabecular bone score with FRAX [^112yr3Ci]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a texture index derived from lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, which can assess skeletal quality and provide information about fracture risk independent of bone mineral density (BMD). TBS is useful in assessing osteoporotic fracture risk, with lower TBS values associated with increased fracture risk. In this article, we review the state of TBS, including its utility and limitations in the assessment and management of osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the recent literature.

- **Recent findings**: Ten-year fracture risk assessment using the FRAX tool can be improved through the use of a TBS adjustment. The use of TBS-adjusted FRAX can change management in a modest but significant number of patients, particularly in those close to an intervention threshold. Change in lumbar spine TBS for patients undergoing antiresorptive treatment is not a useful indicator of antifracture effect.

- **Summary**: Lumbar spine TBS provides information complementary to conventional BMD and has been shown to be clinically useful for enhancing fracture risk prediction.

### Clinical utility of using lumbar spine trabecular bone score to adjust fracture probability: The Manitoba BMD cohort [^116Lak3Y]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Decreased lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS), a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived image texture measurement, is a risk factor for major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) independent of 10-year fracture probability estimated using FRAX. We determined how often applying the TBS adjustment to fracture probability altered treatment qualification. Using a population-based registry containing all clinical DXA results for Manitoba, Canada, we identified 34,316 women with baseline spine and hip DXA, FRAX-based fracture probability measurements (computed with femoral neck bone mineral density), lumbar spine TBS, and a minimum of 5 years of observation (mean 8.7 years).

Population-based health services data were used to identify incident non-traumatic MOF and HF in 3,503 and 945 women, respectively. Baseline MOF and HF probabilities were estimated using FRAX before and after applying the TBS adjustment. Risk recategorization was assessed using net reclassification improvement (NRI) for individual FRAX-based intervention criteria and three national clinical practice guidelines (CPGs): the US National Osteoporosis Foundation, Osteoporosis Canada, and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group.

Overall, proportions of women reclassified with the TBS adjustment to FRAX were small (less than 5%), with more than 90% of the reclassification occurring close to the intervention threshold. For women close to an intervention cut-off, reclassification rates ranged from 9.0% to 17.9% and were less than 1% otherwise. There was a small but significant improvement in overall NRI for all criteria.

### Trabecular bone score (TBS) — a novel method to evaluate bone microarchitectural texture in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^1136GN7t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

In the milder form of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), cancellous bone, represented by areal bone mineral density at the lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is preserved. This finding contrasts with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) results indicating an abnormal trabecular microstructure and epidemiological evidence for increased overall fracture risk in PHPT. Since DXA does not directly measure trabecular bone and HRpQCT is not widely available, we used trabecular bone score (TBS), a novel gray-level textural analysis applied to spine DXA images, to estimate trabecular microarchitecture indirectly.

The purpose of this study was to assess TBS from spine DXA images in relation to HRpQCT indices and bone stiffness in the radius and tibia in PHPT.

This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a referral center. Participants were 22 postmenopausal women with PHPT. Outcomes measured were areal bone mineral density by DXA, TBS indices derived from DXA images, HRpQCT standard measures, and bone stiffness assessed by finite element analysis at the distal radius and tibia.

TBS in PHPT was low at 1.24, representing abnormal trabecular microstructure (normal ≥ 1.35). TBS was correlated with whole bone stiffness and all HRpQCT indices, except for trabecular thickness and trabecular stiffness at the radius. At the tibia, correlations were observed between TBS and volumetric densities, cortical thickness, trabecular bone volume, and whole bone stiffness.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^111Jw22r]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study to evaluate the correlations of bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS), and organ iron overload measured by MRI in iron-overloaded patients. In the study, abnormal bone mass was found at any of the three sites in a total of 9 (22.0%) patients, of which 7 patients had lumbar spine (LS) abnormality. Notably, 19 (46.3%) patients had abnormal microarchitecture by TBS, implying that TBS may be a more sensitive parameter than BMD to assess vertebral bone strength in iron-overloaded patients. Moreover, because TBS uses previously obtained dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images, it is simple to use in routine practice. It enables the generation of longitudinal data concerning cross-sectional and clinical studies, allows direct comparison with areal BMD, and applies to existing datasets. Hence, the authors propose TBS as a valuable and complementary clinical tool in the general diagnosis of osteoporosis and in fracture risk assessment in iron-overloaded patients. From a clinical perspective, the additional information about bone strength provided by TBS could aid the management of patients with osteopenia, as well as those with normal BMD who have risk factors for osteoporosis.

In the study, TBS of LS showed no significant differences between moderate-severe and no-mild hepatic iron overload groups, as it did between no- and pancreatic iron overload groups. Neither hepatic nor pancreatic T2✱-value correlated with LS TBS, in line with the results by Baldini et al. that TBS did not correlate with liver iron concentration values.

### Prediction of incident major osteoporotic and hip fractures by trabecular bone score (TBS) and prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture in older men [^113Fuiw3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) has been shown to predict major osteoporotic (clinical vertebral, hip, humerus, and wrist) and hip fractures in postmenopausal women and older men. However, the association of TBS with these incident fractures in men, independent of prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture, is unknown. TBS was estimated on anteroposterior (AP) spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans obtained at the baseline visit for 5979 men aged ≥ 65 years enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. Its association with incident major osteoporotic and hip fractures was estimated with proportional hazards models. Model discrimination was tested with Harrell's C-statistic and with a categorical net reclassification improvement index, using 10-year risk cutpoints of 20% for major osteoporotic fractures and 3% for hip fractures.

For each standard deviation decrease in TBS, there were hazard ratios of 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 1.39) for major osteoporotic fracture, and 1.20 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39) for hip fracture, adjusted for FRAX with bone mineral density (BMD) 10-year fracture risks and prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture. In the same model, those with prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures compared with those without prevalent radiographic vertebral fractures had hazard ratios of 1.92 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.48) for major osteoporotic fracture and 1.86 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.74) for hip fracture. There were improvements of 3.3%, 5.2%, and 6.2%, respectively, in the classification of major osteoporotic fracture cases when TBS and prevalent radiographic vertebral fracture were included.

### Trabecular bone score and incident fragility fracture risk in adults with reduced kidney function [^113MdQp8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score is a gray-level textural measure obtained from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry lumbar spine images that provides information independent of areal bone mineral density. The association between trabecular bone score and incident fractures in adults with reduced kidney function, and whether this association differs from that of adults with normal kidney function, are unknown.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We included 1,426 participants aged ≥ 40 years (mean age of 67 years) in the community-based Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study. We stratified participants at cohort entry (2005–2008) by eGFR (< 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² [n = 199; 72.4% stage 3a, 25.1% stage 3b, and 2.5% stage 4] versus ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² [n = 1,227]). Trabecular bone score was obtained from lumbar spine (L1-L4) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry images, with a lower trabecular bone score representing worse bone structure. Over an average of 4.7 years of follow-up (maximum follow-up of 5 years), we documented incident fragility (low-trauma) fracture events (excluding craniofacial, foot, and hand sites). We used a modified Kaplan-Meier estimator to determine the 5-year probability of fracture. Cox proportional hazard regression per SD lower trabecular bone score expressed the gradient of fracture risk.

- **Results**: Individuals with an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² who had a trabecular bone score value below the median (< 1.277) had a significantly higher 5-year fracture probability than those above the median (18.1% versus 6.2%; P = 0.01). The association…

### Trabecular bone score improves fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^114FQuJF]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

To analyze the clinical utility of trabecular bone score (TBS) evaluation for fracture risk assessment in glucocorticoid (GC)-treated patients compared with bone mineral density (BMD) assessment, a cross-sectional study was conducted.

One hundred and twenty-seven patients on GC treatment were included, with a mean age of 62 (18) years, of which 63% were women. The study evaluated medical history, anthropometric data, lumbar and femoral BMD (via DXA, considering osteoporosis (OP) as T-score ≤ -2.5), TBS (considering degraded microarchitecture as < 1.230), and dorsolumbar X-ray to assess vertebral fractures (VF). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) for BMD and TBS were evaluated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the two methods.

All patients were receiving GC treatment for autoimmune diseases over a period of 47.7 (68.9) months, at a mean daily dose of 14.5 mg. Among them, 17% had VF, 28% had any type of fragility fracture (combining VF and non-vertebral fractures (non-VF)), 29% had OP, and 52% had degraded microarchitecture. Degraded microarchitecture was significantly more frequent than densitometric OP in patients with VF (76% vs. 38%) and with any fragility fracture (69% vs. 36%).

For VF, TBS and BMD showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.76, 0.53, 0.25, 0.92, and 0.38, 0.72, 0.22, and 0.85, respectively. Specificity increased to 0.89 for VF and 0.9 for any fragility fracture when combining BMD and TBS. TBS demonstrated a better ability than BMD to discriminate between patients with fractures, especially VF, with an area under the curve of 0.73.

In conclusion, TBS appears to have greater discriminative power than BMD for fracture risk assessment in GC-treated patients.

### Short-term precision assessment of trabecular bone score and bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry with different scan modes: an in vivo study [^116jjCq1]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

We estimated the in vivo reproducibility of the trabecular bone score (TBS) from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using different imaging modes to compare to that of bone mineral density (BMD).

- **Methods**: We enrolled 30 patients for each imaging mode: fast-array, array, and high definition. Each patient underwent two DXA examinations with in-between repositioning. BMD and TBS were obtained according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was calculated as the ratio between root mean square standard deviation and mean. The percent least significant change (LSC) was calculated as 2.77×CoV, and reproducibility was assessed as the complement to 100% LSC.

- **Results**: Fast-array imaging mode resulted in 0.8% CoV and 2.1% LSC for BMD, and 1.9% CoV and 5.3% LSC for TBS. The array imaging mode resulted in 0.7% CoV and 2.0% LSC for BMD, and 1.9% CoV and 5.2% LSC for TBS. High-definition imaging mode resulted in 0.7% CoV and 2.0% LSC for BMD, and 2.0% CoV and 5.4% LSC for TBS. Reproducibility of TBS (95%) was significantly lower than BMD (98%) (p < 0.012). Differences in reproducibility among the imaging modes were not significant for either BMD or TBS (p = 0.942).

- **Conclusion**: While TBS reproducibility was significantly lower than BMD, differences among imaging modes were not significant for both TBS and BMD.

- **Key points**: TBS is an emerging tool for assessing BMD. TBS reproducibility is lower than BMD. Differences between imaging modes are not significant for either TBS or BMD.

### Mild hyponatremia is not associated with degradation of trabecular bone microarchitecture despite bone mass loss [^11373Nph]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, the impact of hyponatremia on noninvasive indices of bone quality remains unknown.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether trabecular bone microarchitecture, assessed noninvasively by trabecular bone score (TBS), is altered in patients with hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the 2005–2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which TBS measurement was performed. The main outcome measures included TBS values and bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.

- **Results**: A total of 4,204 subjects aged 50 years or older were included in the study, consisting of 4,041 normonatremic and 163 hyponatremic individuals (90.8% with mild hyponatremia). Univariate analyses revealed no significant difference in TBS between patients with and without hyponatremia (1.308 ± 0.145 vs. 1.311 ± 0.141, P = .806). However, hyponatremic subjects displayed lower BMD T-scores at the total hip (-0.70 ± 1.46 vs. -0.13 ± 1.32, P < .001) and femoral neck (-1.11 ± 1.26 vs. -0.72 ± 1.14, P = .004), while no difference was noted at the lumbar spine (-0.27 ± 1.63 vs. -0.31 ± 1.51, P = .772). After adjusting for relevant confounders, hyponatremia was confirmed as an independent predictor of lower BMD T-score at the total hip (β = -0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-0.39, -0.02], P = .029), but the significance was lost at the femoral neck (P = .308). Additionally, no association was found between hyponatremia and lumbar spine BMD (P = .236) or TBS (P = .346).

In conclusion, while hyponatremia is associated with lower bone mass, it is not linked to degradation of trabecular bone microarchitecture, as assessed by TBS.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^11716UsZ]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to determine the mean trabecular bone score (TBS) of postmenopausal Taiwanese women and to analyze the value of TBS in predicting osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,915 postmenopausal women with lumbar spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD) and spine TBS were enrolled from a single medical center into this study. The women's BMD and TBS were measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Discovery Wi; Hologic, Bedford, Mass) and iNsight software (Med-Imaps SASU, Merignac, France), respectively. The women's demographic characteristics; lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD; and lumbar spine TBS were recorded, and correlations among the parameters were identified using a 2-tailed Pearson test, in which a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Simple linear regression models were developed to represent changes related to TBS, and an analysis of variance was performed on the selected variables.

- **Results**: The average age of the women was 62.5 ± 9.1 years (range, 25.7–93.7 years). The mean TBS was 1.300 ± 0.086 (range, 1.015–1.596). The TBS was weakly and negatively correlated with body mass index (r = -0.078) and moderately and positively correlated with lumbar spine BMD (r = 0.619). The patients' lowest BMD values among those measured at multiple sites revealed a higher rate of osteoporosis (32.5%) than those measured at individual sites. Degraded TBS were noted in 21.2% of the participants, and a combination of BMD and TBS results predicted more individuals (7.8%) at a high risk of fracture than BMD alone.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^115TcD4B]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

We retrospectively reviewed the patients' demographic records, bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular bone score (TBS) data based on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and analyzed the correlations between these variables. Both BMD and TBS were negatively correlated with age in our results. The patients' lowest BMD values among those measured at the multiple designated sites revealed a higher rate of osteoporosis (32.5% or 622/1,915 participants) than those measured at individual sites. Degraded TBS was observed in 21.20% of the patients (406/1,915), and the combination of BMD and TBS results identified more patients (7.8%) at high risk of fracture than the BMD result alone. The ratios of both osteoporosis and degraded TBS increased with age, and the ratio of degraded TBS in patients without osteoporosis also increased with age.

Studies have explored the negative correlation between TBS and age not only in White women but also in women from other ethnic groups. In this study, a moderate negative correlation (r = −0.505) was identified between TBS and age in postmenopausal Taiwanese women, which was similar to the results reported in studies involving patients of different ethnic groups. The results suggested that older adults exhibit lower bone quality that, in turn, affects bone strength. Studies have demonstrated that TBS was negatively correlated with age for 53 healthy postmenopausal Turkish women and 4,907 French postmenopausal women aged 20 to 90 years. Additionally, the TBS of non-Hispanic White American women aged 30 to 90 years decreases significantly with age.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^115K4RMB]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

The trabecular bone score (TBS) is a new tool used to measure bone microarchitecture by analyzing changes in the gray level of pixels in standard lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) images. It also provides indirect indicators of trabecular bone microarchitecture and bone texture derived from bone quality. The TBS can be used as an auxiliary measure of BMD and as an assessment tool for osteoporotic fracture risk. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TBS in predicting osteoporosis and have indicated that the combination of BMD and TBS can predict the risk of osteoporosis and fractures more effectively than BMD alone. However, these studies have focused mainly on White women, and a similar study involving a sample of patients from the Asian population has not yet been conducted.

The purposes of this study are to determine the mean TBS of postmenopausal Taiwanese women in different age groups, to analyze the association between TBS, demographic characteristics, and BMD, and to assess the value of TBS in predicting osteoporosis.

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^116RkV8S]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is only one of several bone strength determinants affected by osteoporosis therapies. Trabecular bone score (TBS), a gray-level texture index determined from lumbar spine (LS) dual-X-ray absorptiometry scans, is an indirect measure of bone microarchitecture, independent of and complementary to BMD and clinical risk factors. In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH), monthly subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg for 12 months followed by 24-month open-label weekly oral alendronate 70 mg (romosozumab-to-alendronate) significantly reduced fracture risk compared to 36-month alendronate alone in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prior fractures.

This analysis evaluated tissue thickness-adjusted TBS (TBSTT) in a subgroup of patients from ARCH who had post-hoc TBS measurements at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit at months 12, 24, and 36. Baseline characteristics were similar between romosozumab-to-alendronate (n = 190) and alendronate alone (n = 188).

Romosozumab led to significantly greater gains in TBSTT compared to alendronate at month 12 (least squares mean difference, 3.6%), with greater gains maintained after transition to alendronate and persisting at months 24 (2.9%) and 36 (2.3%; all p < 0.001). Romosozumab-to-alendronate increased the percentage of individual patients with "normal" TBSTT from 28.9% at baseline to 48.1%, 43.9%, and 45.4% at months 12, 24, and 36, respectively, and decreased the percentage of individual patients with degraded TBSTT from 52.6% to 33.3%, 36.0%, and 33.5%, respectively.

### Mild hyponatremia is not associated with degradation of trabecular bone microarchitecture despite bone mass loss [^111SA8y8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, the impact of hyponatremia on noninvasive indices of bone quality remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate whether trabecular bone microarchitecture, assessed noninvasively by trabecular bone score (TBS), is altered in patients with hyponatremia.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the population-based 2005–2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, where TBS measurement was performed. The main outcome measures were TBS values and bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.

A total of 4204 subjects aged 50 years or older were included in the study, consisting of 4041 normonatremic and 163 hyponatremic individuals, of whom 90.8% had mild hyponatremia. Univariate analyses did not show any difference in TBS between patients with and without hyponatremia (1.308 ± 0.145 vs. 1.311 ± 0.141, P = .806). Hyponatremic subjects exhibited lower BMD T-scores at the total hip (−0.70 ± 1.46 vs. −0.13 ± 1.32, P < .001) and femoral neck (−1.11 ± 1.26 vs. −0.72 ± 1.14, P = .004), while no difference was observed at the lumbar spine (−0.27 ± 1.63 vs. −0.31 ± 1.51, P = .772). After adjustment for relevant confounders, hyponatremia was confirmed as an independent predictor of lower BMD T-scores at the total hip (β = −0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [−0.39, −0.02], P = .029), while the significance was lost at the femoral neck (P = .308). No association between hyponatremia and lumbar spine BMD (P = .236) or TBS (P = .346) was observed.

In conclusion, hyponatremia does not appear to be associated with degradation of trabecular bone microarchitecture despite a loss in bone mass.

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^116kkAtw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is only one of several bone strength determinants affected by osteoporosis therapies. Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), a gray-level texture index determined from lumbar spine (LS) dual-X-ray absorptiometry scans, is an indirect measure of bone microarchitecture independent of and complementary to BMD and clinical risk factors. In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH), monthly subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg for 12 months, followed by 24-month open-label weekly oral alendronate 70 mg (romosozumab-to-alendronate), significantly reduced fracture risk compared to 36-month alendronate alone in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and prior fracture. This analysis evaluated tissue thickness–adjusted TBS (TBS TT) in a subgroup of patients from ARCH who had post-hoc TBS measurements at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit at months 12, 24, and 36.

Baseline characteristics were similar between romosozumab-to-alendronate (n = 190) and alendronate alone (n = 188). Romosozumab led to significantly greater gains in TBS TT versus alendronate at month 12 (least squares mean difference, 3.6%), with greater gains maintained after transition to alendronate and persisting at months 24 (2.9%) and 36 (2.3%; all p < .001). Romosozumab-to-alendronate increased the percentage of individual patients with "normal" TBS TT from 28.9% at baseline to 48.1%, 43.9%, and 45.4% at months 12, 24, and 36, respectively. It also decreased the percentage of individual patients with degraded TBS TT from 52.6% to 33.3%, 36.0%, and so on.

### Spinal bone texture assessed by trabecular bone score in adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa [^112psdRS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a bone assessment tool that offers information beyond that afforded by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) are known to exhibit compromised bone density and skeletal strength.

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to determine TBS among adolescents with AN and evaluate the correlation with anthropometric, clinical, and densitometric variables.

- **Design**: Areal BMD spinal measures were analyzed for TBS. Findings were compared with clinical (height, weight, body mass index [BMI], age, pubertal development, 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and self-reported data (illness duration, amenorrhea, exercise, fracture, family history of osteoporosis, and antidepressant use) and BMD measures by DXA and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT).

- **Setting and participants**: This was an urban adolescent program consisting of 57 females with AN, aged 11–18 years.

- **Interventions**: Interventions included DXA (absolute BMD and Z-score), pQCT (volumetric BMD [vBMD] and stress-strain index [SSI]), laboratory evaluation, and questionnaire administration.

- **Main outcome measures**: Main outcome measures included TBS, areal and vBMD, SSI, fracture history, and disease duration.

Results indicated that the TBS of six participants (11%) showed degraded and 19 (33%) partially degraded microarchitecture. Spinal TBS was correlated (P < .05) with age, height, weight, BMI, pubertal stage, BMD, and body composition by DXA, and BMD and SSI by pQCT. TBS was not correlated with disease duration, fracture, vitamin D status, or other factors mentioned.

### High-resolution computed tomography for clinical imaging of bone microarchitecture [^112zeqnb]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) only explains about 70% to 75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance is due to the cumulative and synergistic effect of factors such as bone macro- and microarchitecture, tissue composition, and microdamage. In a multicenter fracture intervention trial, the antifracture efficacy of all drugs tested was only partially explained by their effects on BMD. In this context, and specifically in osteoporosis, the concept of bone quality emerged. Bone quality represents different properties of bone to researchers and could encompass one or all of the factors mentioned.

Trabecular and cortical bone play important roles in the prediction of bone strength and are affected by age, gender, and metabolic conditions and have varying responses to therapy. Sites containing predominantly trabecular bone, such as the hip, spine, and wrist, are most frequently associated with increased fracture risk. Traditionally, trabecular microarchitecture is assessed from bone biopsies by two-dimensional histomorphometry, applying stereologic principles to measure:

- **Trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV)**: The ratio of mineralized bone volume to total volume.
- **Trabecular thickness (Tb. Th)**
- **Trabecular separation (Tb. Sp)**
- **Trabecular number (Tb.N)**

On the other hand, cortical bone constitutes about 80% of total bone mass. In previous studies, cortical thinning and increased cortical porosity were important factors in the assessment of osteoporosis and bone strength. Recently, focus has increased on the ultrastructure of cortical bone that can be attributed to resorption spaces.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^1121RZ4W]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Iron-overloaded patients are recognized as presenting an increased risk of osteoporosis. However, studies on the correlation between osteoporosis and organ iron overload are controversial or scarce. The aim of this study is to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in correlation with hepatic and pancreatic iron overload.

- **Methods**: Forty-one patients diagnosed with hemoglobinopathies were studied. BMDs of the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. LS bone quality was derived from each spine DXA examination using the TBS analysis. Hepatic and pancreatic iron overload were obtained with a multi-echo gradient echo T2✱ technique.

- **Results**: Abnormal microarchitecture and abnormal bone mass were observed in 19/41 (46.3%) and 9/41 (22.0%) patients, respectively. For 26 males, BMD, T-score, and Z-score of LS were significantly lower among subjects with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload than their counterparts, as is also the case between no- and pancreatic iron overload groups. For 15 females, patients with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD and T-score of FN and TH, and patients with pancreatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD, T-score of FN, and lower BMD, T-score, and Z-score of TH than their counterparts. Moreover, pancreatic T2✱-value was positively correlated with BMD and T-score at all analyzed sites and Z-score at TH.

- **Conclusion**: These data showed lower bone mass in patients with organ iron overload, particularly for LS in m.

### Effect of denosumab on trabecular bone score in de novo kidney transplant recipients [^116XKPSN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) are at risk of losing bone mass. The trabecular bone score (TBS) represents a recently developed parameter of lumbar spine trabecular bone texture that correlates with the occurrence of fractures.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the 1-year changes in TBS in 44 de novo KTR who were randomized 1:1 to receive denosumab or no treatment. TBS was derived from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and was correlated with 1-year areal bone mineral density (aBMD) changes at the lumbar spine and total hip. Correlations were also performed with parameters of peripheral bone microarchitecture and bone strength at the distal tibia and distal radius, as assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) and micro-finite element analysis.

- **Results**: The baseline TBS in KTR amounted to 1.312 ± 0.101, which is lower than the TBS of an age-matched normal control population (range 1.364–1.471). The TBS correlated positively with aBMD at the lumbar spine (Spearman's ρ = 0.56; P < 0.001) and total hip (ρ = 0.33; P < 0.05). The baseline TBS also correlated with HRpQCT-derived total (ρ = 0.49; P < 0.05) and trabecular volumetric BMD (ρ = 0.57; P < 0.01) and trabecular separation (ρ = -0.46; P < 0.05) at the tibia. Denosumab treatment led to an increase in TBS, paralleling the BMD changes at the lumbar spine.

- **Conclusions**: The TBS is a useful additional score of bone health, which may help to better define fracture risk. Treatment with denosumab led to improved trabecular bone texture in de novo KTR in addition to its beneficial effect on BMD.

### Combining frailty and trabecular bone score did not improve predictive accuracy in risk of major osteoporotic fractures [^114NM3uY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

It is recognized that the trabecular bone score (TBS) provides skeletal information, and frailty measurement is significantly associated with increased risks of adverse health outcomes. Given the suboptimal predictive power in fracture risk assessment tools, we aimed to evaluate the combination of frailty and TBS regarding predictive accuracy for risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF). Data from the prospective longitudinal study of CaMos (Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study) were used for this study. TBS values were estimated using lumbar spine (L1 to L4) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images; frailty was evaluated by a frailty index (FI) of deficit accumulation. The outcome was the time to first incident MOF during the follow-up.

We used Harrell's C-index to compare the model predictive accuracy. The Akaike Information Criterion, likelihood ratio test, and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare model performances between the model combining frailty and TBS (subsequently called "FI+TBS"), FI-alone, and TBS-alone models. We included 2730 participants (mean age 69 years; 70% women) for analyses, with a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. There were 243 (8.90%) MOFs observed during follow-up. Participants with MOF had significantly higher FI (0.24 versus 0.20) and lower TBS (1.231 versus 1.285) than those without MOF. FI and TBS were significantly related to MOF risk in the model adjusted for FRAX with bone mineral density (BMD) and other covariates: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.43) for per-SD increase in FI; HR = 1.38 (95%…

### Romosozumab improves microarchitecture as assessed by tissue thickness-adjusted trabecular bone score in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^112uqMWS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). High credibility.

The study design of the ARCH trial (NCT01631214) has been published. Briefly, ARCH was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 study in 4,093 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and a prior vertebral or hip fracture. In the double-blind study conducted for a duration of 12 months, patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab or a weekly oral dose of 70 mg alendronate. After completion of the double-blind trial period, all patients received an open-label weekly dose of 70 mg oral alendronate for a period of at least 12 months until the end of the event-driven study, with a median study duration of 2.7 years from patient enrollment. All patients received daily supplementation of calcium and vitamin D.

DXA scans were selected for this TBS TT analysis based on a three-step process (Figure S1). First, among the 4,093 patients enrolled in the ARCH trial, 1,095 patients were eligible for inclusion because they had LS BMD measurements available at baseline and all post-baseline visits (months 12, 24, and 36), and provided consent for DXA scans to be used for future research. Second, of the 1,095 patients, a subset of 478 patients (239 in each treatment group) were randomly selected for TBS evaluation. This sample size was determined to be sufficient to provide enough viable scans to maintain statistical power for hypothesis testing, even with consideration for patients with scans requiring examination.

### Factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in non-osteoporotic elderly population: Bushehr elderly health program [^113ThF4M]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) are moderately correlated. TBS is sometimes used as an adjuvant to BMD in fracture risk assessment. Some individuals with normal BMD or osteopenia have more degraded TBS. We aimed to identify factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in the non-osteoporotic elderly population.

- **Methods**: The study subjects were selected from 2,384 women and men aged ≥ 60 years participating in the second stage of the Bushehr Elderly Health program, a population-based prospective cohort study in Iran. The BMDs of different sites and the lumbar spine texture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the TBS algorithm, respectively. Subjects were categorized based on their BMD and TBS status. Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with "TBS worse than BMD" in non-osteoporotic individuals.

- **Results**: Of 1,335 participants included in the study, 112 of 457 women and 54 of 878 men had worse TBS than BMD. In multivariable analysis, TBS worse than BMD in women was statistically significantly associated with years since menopause (OR: 1.04 [1.00–1.07]) and waist circumference (OR: 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). In men, the condition was statistically significantly associated with waist circumference (OR: 1.10 [1.03–1.17]), smoking (OR: 2.54 [1.10–5.84]), and HDL-C (OR: 1.03 [1.00–1.06]).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study show that higher waist circumference is associated with more degraded TBS than BMD in both men and women. Additionally, years passed since menopause and smoking are other factors affecting TBS in this population.

### Trabecular bone score in patients with chronic glucocorticoid therapy-induced osteoporosis treated with alendronate or teriparatide [^112YUKd4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). High credibility.

To determine the effect of alendronate (ALN) and teriparatide on the trabecular bone score (TBS) in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, patients undergoing chronic glucocorticoid therapy (median 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent for ≥ 90 days) were randomized to receive either oral ALN 10 mg/day (n = 214) or subcutaneous teriparatide 20 μg/day (n = 214) for 36 months. Of these, 118 patients in the ALN group and 123 patients in the teriparatide group completed the treatment. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results for 53 patients receiving ALN and 56 patients receiving teriparatide, who had adequate resolution DXA scans to perform TBS analysis and completed the 36-month therapy, were blindly analyzed for TBS at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.

In the teriparatide-treated patients, TBS was significantly increased at 18 months compared to baseline, and by 36 months, it had increased by 3.7% (P < 0.05). In the ALN-treated patients, there was no significant change in TBS compared to baseline at any time point. Changes in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) measured by DXA in the subgroup with TBS data were similar to BMD results in the overall study population. At 36 months, increases in lumbar spine BMD were 5.5% in patients treated with ALN and 10.3% in those treated with teriparatide.

In conclusion, in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, both ALN and teriparatide increased lumbar spine BMD. However, trabecular bone score significantly increased with teriparatide but did not significantly change with ALN.

### Association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with incident clinical and radiographic vertebral fractures adjusted for lumbar spine BMD in older men: A prospective cohort study [^113zFMwV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

The association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with incident clinical and radiographic vertebral fractures in older men is uncertain. TBS was estimated from baseline spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for 5,831 older men (mean age 73.7 years) enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of TBS (per 1 SD decrease) with incident clinical vertebral fractures. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between TBS (per 1 SD decrease) and incident radiographic vertebral fracture among the subset of 4,309 men with baseline and follow-up lateral spine radiographs (mean 4.6 years later). We also examined whether any associations varied by body mass index (BMI) category.

TBS was associated with a 1.41-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23 to 1.63) higher age-adjusted odds of incident radiographic fracture, and this relationship did not vary by BMI (p value = 0.22 for interaction term). This association was no longer significant with further adjustment for lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD; odds ratio [OR] = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.30).

In contrast, the age-adjusted association of TBS with incident clinical vertebral fracture was stronger in men with lower BMI (≤ median value of 26.8 kg/m²; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.82 to 2.87) than in men with higher BMI (> median; HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.94; p value = 0.0002 for interaction term). With further adjustment for lumbar spine BMD, the association of TBS with incident clinical vertebral fracture was substantially altered.

### Changes to bone mineral density, the trabecular bone score and hip structural analysis following parathyroidectomy: a case report [^1177Zjpu]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Within 6 months of parathyroidectomy, bone mineral density (BMD) gains up to 42% occurred at the spine and hip, with a smaller but significant improvement at the ultradistal radius and no significant change at the 1/3 radius, a site of cortical bone. After parathyroidectomy, the high surface area of trabecular bone facilitates mineralization of former resorption sites and secondary mineralization due to reduced bone remodeling. In contrast, in cortical bone, the reduced cortical thickness and increased porosity are less readily repaired. In the lumbar spine, the trabecular bone score (TBS) was high normal (TBS T-score + 0.8) prior to parathyroidectomy, suggesting that the trabecular network had not been severely compromised in this patient. The TBS showed an increase following parathyroidectomy, returning to the baseline value over the subsequent year on dialysis.

Patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism are recognized to have gains in BMD of 10–15% following parathyroidectomy, and patients on hemodialysis have recorded gains of 7–23%. The 'hungry bone syndrome' has also been associated with impressive BMD gains. In a case series of Indian patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, 46 of 51 patients developed post-operative hypocalcemia, with BMD increases at 12 months of 106% (IQR 67–178%) at the spine and 133% (IQR 54–176%) at the hip. The case demonstrates that large increases in BMD may also occur in a patient on dialysis with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and the 'hungry bone syndrome'.

### Improvements in bone density and structure during anti-TNF-α therapy in pediatric Crohn's disease [^111YWgz9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with deficits in trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical structure, potentially related to TNF-α effects that decrease bone formation and promote bone resorption.

This study aimed to examine changes in bone density and structure in children and adolescents with CD following the initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy. Participants (n = 74; age 5–21 years) with CD completed a 12-month prospective cohort study. Tibia peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans were obtained at the initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy and 12 months later. Musculoskeletal outcomes were expressed as sex- and race-specific z scores relative to age, based on over 650 reference participants.

At baseline, CD participants had lower height, trabecular BMD, cortical area (due to smaller periosteal and larger endocortical circumferences), and muscle area z scores compared with reference participants (all P < .01). The pediatric CD activity index decreased during the 10-week induction (P < .001), in association with subsequent gains in height, trabecular BMD, cortical area (due to recovery of endocortical bone), and muscle area z scores over 12 months (height P < .05; others P < .001). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels, a biomarker of bone formation, increased a median of 75% (P < .001) during induction with associated 12-month improvements in trabecular BMD and cortical area z scores (both P < .001). Younger age was associated with greater increases in trabecular BMD z scores (P < .001).

### Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis: A cross-sectional single-centre experience with bone histomorphometry and quantitative computed tomography [^115KRHzq]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In the study, which used QCT to discriminate cortical and cancellous bone compartments, a decrease in both trabecular and cortical BMD Z-scores was observed, with greater impairments in trabecular BMD, confirming previous reports that highlighted the greater importance of impaired trabecular bone in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. However, the low Z-score for both BMD and cross-sectional area in the cortical compartment may explain the significant frequency of cortical fractures observed in this cohort. Indeed, although children with IJO are usually known to present both vertebral compression fractures and long bone fractures, in our series, only two patients presented with vertebral compression fractures, whereas long bone fractures and extremity fractures (e.g. toes, metatarsals) were much more frequent.

Due to the retrospective design of the study, compression fractures were not systematically screened in the patients but only in cases of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the association between histomorphometry and QCT parameters highlights the potential interest of this non-invasive three-dimensional imaging technique for the follow-up of children with IJO. In some patients, the biopsy and QCT were not obtained at the same age due to the retrospective nature of the study, which may have lessened the association between QCT and bone biopsy. However, to the best of our knowledge, this association between QCT and bone biopsy has never been evaluated in pediatrics, and further prospective studies are warranted to evaluate its potential clinical application.

### Does baseline PTH influence recovery of bone mineral density, trabecular bone score and bone turnover markers? A prospective study following curative parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism [^114zWzQv]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

This prospective study was carried out to assess trabecular bone score, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone biochemistry in Indian subjects with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), and to study the influence of baseline parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the recovery of these parameters following curative surgery.

- **Methods**: This was a 2-year prospective study conducted at a tertiary care centre in southern India. Baseline assessment included demographic details, mode of presentation, bone mineral biochemistry, BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS), and bone turnover markers (BTMs). These parameters were reassessed at the end of the first and second years following curative parathyroid surgery.

- **Results**: Fifty-one subjects (32 men and 19 women) with PHPT who had undergone curative parathyroidectomy were included in this study. The mean (SD) age was 44.6 (13.7) years. The TBS, BTMs, and BMD at the lumbar spine and forearm were significantly worse at baseline in subjects with higher baseline PTH (≥ 250 pg/mL) when compared to the group with lower baseline PTH (< 250 pg/mL). At the end of 2 years, the difference between high versus low PTH groups (mean ± SD) persisted only for forearm BMD (0.638 ± 0.093 versus 0.698 ± 0.041 g/cm²; p = 0.01). However, on follow-up visits in the first and second years after curative parathyroidectomy, there was no significant difference in BTMs, BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and TBS between the two groups stratified by baseline PTH.

- **Conclusion**: The BMD at the forearm remained significantly worse in individuals with high baseline PTH even at the end of the study period.

### Bone microarchitecture assessed by trabecular bone score is independent of mobility level or height in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy [^1131WczJ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

Bone strength and fracture risk depend not only on bone density but also on bone structure. The trabecular bone score (TBS) evaluates the homogeneity of bone microarchitecture indirectly by measuring gray-level variations of two-dimensional (2D) DXA images. Although TBS is well established for adults, there have been only a few publications in pediatrics. In this monocentric retrospective analysis, we investigated TBS in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP), a patient group vulnerable to low bone mineral mass due to impaired mobility. The influence of different parameters on TBS and areal BMD (aBMD) was evaluated, as well as the relationship between TBS and aBMD. We compared TBS values of our study population to a reference population.

A total of 472 lumbar spine-dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (LS-DXA) scans of children and adolescents with CP (205 female), aged between 4 and 18 years, were analyzed. The DXA scans were part of the routine examination. The children had no records of fractures or specific bone diseases. Our study population with CP had similar TBS as the reference population. TBS did not increase with age until an inflection point at 10 years in females and 12 years in males. Girls had significantly higher TBS than boys (p = .049), and pubertal girls aged 8 to 13 years had significantly higher TBS than prepubertal girls (p = .009). TBS standard deviation score for age (SDS-TBS) and aBMD Z-scores correlated weakly (p < .001; R = 0.276 for males, R = 0.284 for females). Other than for aBMD Z-scores, SDS-TBS was not influenced by age-adjusted height Z-scores.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^113YR8dk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Iron-overloaded patients are recognized as presenting an increased risk of osteoporosis. However, studies on the correlation between osteoporosis and organ iron overload are controversial or scarce. The aim of this study is to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) in correlation with hepatic and pancreatic iron overload.

- **Methods**: Forty-one patients diagnosed with hemoglobinopathies were studied. BMDs of the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH) were analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. LS bone quality was derived from each spine DXA examination using the TBS analysis. Hepatic and pancreatic iron overload were obtained with a multi-echo gradient echo T2✱ technique.

- **Results**: Abnormal microarchitecture and abnormal bone mass were observed in 19/41 (46.3%) and 9/41 (22.0%) patients, respectively. For 26 males, BMD, T-score, and Z-score of LS were significantly lower among subjects with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload than their counterparts; this was also true between no- and pancreatic iron-overload groups. For 15 females, patients with moderate-severe hepatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD and T-score of FN and TH, and patients with pancreatic iron overload had significantly lower BMD, T-score of FN, and lower BMD, T-score, and Z-score of TH than their counterparts. Moreover, pancreatic T2✱-value was positively correlated with BMD and T-score at all analyzed sites and Z-score at TH.

- **Conclusion**: These data showed lower bone mass in patients with organ iron overload, particularly for LS in male patients, highlighting a nuanced relationship.

### Longitudinal association between trabecular bone loss and disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis: A 4-year prospective study [^114oUGyW]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether trabecular bone loss is longitudinally associated with disease activity measures in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).

- **Methods**: Data from patients enrolled in the Incheon Saint Mary's axSpA prospective observational cohort were evaluated. Trabecular bone loss was assessed using the trabecular bone score (TBS). The relationship between TBS and disease activity measures — Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) — was investigated using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models.

- **Results**: Four-year follow-up data from 240 patients (80% males, mean age 37 ± 12 years) were evaluated. At baseline, higher disease activity according to ASDAS-ESR and ASDAS-CRP showed a trend toward lower TBS (p = 0.003 and p = 0.016, respectively). Univariate GEE analyses showed a significant association between TBS and disease activity measures over time, with the exception of BASDAI. Univariate analysis revealed a longitudinal association between TBS and age, smoking, and spinal structural damage. In multivariate GEE analysis, ASDAS-ESR, ASDAS-CRP, ESR, and CRP were longitudinally associated with TBS after adjustment for confounding factors. ASDAS scores and inflammatory markers were longitudinally associated with TBS in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS; 79%), but not in patients with nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA). BASDAI scores showed no relationship with TBS in either the AS or nr-axSpA groups.

### Spine trabecular bone score as an indicator of bone microarchitecture at the peripheral skeleton in kidney transplant recipients [^116VEXUV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Studies using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography have shown progressive abnormalities in cortical and trabecular microarchitecture and biomechanical competence over the first year after kidney transplantation. However, high-resolution peripheral computed tomography is a research tool lacking wide availability. In contrast, the trabecular bone score is a novel and widely available tool that uses gray-scale variograms of the spine image from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to assess trabecular quality. There are no studies assessing whether the trabecular bone score characterizes bone quality in kidney transplant recipients.

Between 2009 and 2010, we conducted a study to assess changes in peripheral skeletal microarchitecture, measured by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography, during the first year after transplantation in 47 patients managed with early corticosteroid-withdrawal immunosuppression. All adult first-time transplant candidates were eligible. Patients underwent imaging with high-resolution peripheral computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry pretransplantation and 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. We now test if, during the first year after transplantation, the trabecular bone score assesses the evolution of bone microarchitecture and biomechanical competence as determined by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography.

At baseline and follow-up, among the 72% and 78%, respectively, of patients having normal bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, the data was collected to analyze the measurement changes.

### Bibliometric analysis of publications on trabecular bone score (TBS) [^111vCgjZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS), as a texture indicator of bone microarchitecture, predicts the risk of fracture. This study aims to explore the knowledge map of TBS.

- **Methods**: We searched Scopus for "trabecular bone score" or "trabecular score" from the beginning to 2021. Our inclusion criteria were original articles and reviews related to TBS. We excluded non-English articles, documents unrelated to TBS, and document types other than original articles and reviews. Related documents were included for bibliometric analysis. Excel, VOS viewer, and Science of Science (Sci2) software were used for data synthesis.

- **Results**: From 749 retrieved articles, 652 were included for analysis. These documents were cited 12,153 times and had an H-index of 56. The most productivity belonged to the United States (n = 130 documents), Switzerland (n = 101), and Italy (n = 67). "Osteoporosis International" (n = 80) had the highest participation in publishing. Research topics of interest mainly related to the applicability of TBS for fracture risk assessment in chronic endocrine disorders such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Bursting analysis of the title and abstract revealed the initial focus on the discriminative power of TBS for osteoporotic fracture and the more recent focus on comparing bone mineral density (BMD) and TBS in a variety of chronic diseases.

- **Conclusion**: The number of annual publications on TBS has increased, especially after 2016. These publications highlight the importance of in-depth knowledge of TBS in predicting fracture risk.

### Spine trabecular bone scores and bone mineral density of postmenopausal Taiwanese women [^1155Gpyh]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

In our study, the BMD assessment results indicated that 32.5% of the participants (622/1915) had osteoporosis. This rate increased by 7.8% when the patients' risk of osteoporosis was evaluated using a combination of the BMD assessment and TBS. Among the patients exhibiting degraded TBS, 3.3% (11/330) and 14.4% (139/963) had normal bone density and low bone mass, respectively. Our results are similar to those of a previous South Korean study that reported a 10.1% higher risk of osteoporosis after incorporating TBS into osteoporosis risk assessment. Therefore, TBS is helpful for identifying patients with poor bone quality, but not those with reduced bone density.

According to the results of our age analysis, higher rates of degraded TBS in the patients without osteoporosis were noted in older age groups. The rates of degraded and partially degraded TBS were 26.9% (7/26) and 34.6% (9/26), respectively, in the subgroup of patients older than 70 years with normal bone density. Our findings suggest that a combination of TBS and BMD assessments can identify a higher number of postmenopausal Taiwanese women at risk of osteoporosis than BMD assessment alone. Furthermore, a higher rate of poor bone quality, determined according to degraded TBS, was noted in older women without low BMD.

- **Correlation with BMI**: Several studies have examined the effects of BMI on BMD and TBS in various ethnic groups. In our study, BMD was positively correlated with BMI; this finding is consistent with the results of studies involving not only White women but also Asian women. However, our results indicated that TBS was…

### Factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in non-osteoporotic elderly population: Bushehr elderly health program [^114JQUVC]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) are moderately correlated, with TBS sometimes used as an adjuvant to BMD in fracture risk assessments. Some individuals with normal BMD or osteopenia have more degraded TBS. We aimed to identify factors associated with TBS worse than BMD in the non-osteoporotic elderly population.

- **Methods**: The study subjects were selected from 2,384 women and men aged ≥ 60 years participating in the second stage of the Bushehr Elderly Health Program, a population-based prospective cohort study in Iran. The BMDs of different sites and the lumbar spine texture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the TBS algorithm, respectively. Subjects were categorized based on their BMD and TBS status. Logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with "TBS worse than BMD" in non-osteoporotic individuals.

- **Results**: Of 1,335 participants included in the study, 112 of 457 women and 54 of 878 men had worse TBS than BMD. In multivariable analysis, TBS worse than BMD in women was statistically significantly associated with years since menopause (OR: 1.04 (1.00–1.07)) and waist circumference (OR: 1.09 (1.05–1.14)). However, in men, the condition was statistically significantly associated with waist circumference (OR: 1.10 (1.03–1.17)), smoking (OR: 2.54 (1.10–5.84)), and HDL-C (OR: 1.03 (1.00–1.06)).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the study show that higher waist circumference is associated with more degraded TBS than BMD in both men and women. Years passed since menopause and smoking are also significant factors.

### Trabecular bone score of postmenopausal women is positively correlated with bone mineral density and negatively correlated with age and body mass index [^113FhbLn]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Trabecular bone score (TBS), an indirect evaluation of skeletal microarchitecture, is calculated from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study aimed to determine the mean TBS values in healthy postmenopausal women and the overall association between TBS and demographic features, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and femoral neck, and BMD to body mass index (BMI) ratio of the lumbar spine.

Fifty-three postmenopausal healthy women were enrolled in the study. The BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by DXA. Anteroposterior lumbar spine acquisitions were used to calculate the TBS for L1 to L4.

The mean BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was 0.945 ± 0.133 and 0.785 ± 0.112 g/cm, respectively. The mean TBS was 1.354 ± 0.107. There was a significant positive moderate correlation between TBS and total lumbar BMD to BMI ratio (r = 0.595, P < 0.001) and significant positive weak correlations between TBS and BMD of the lumbar spine (r = 0.347, P = 0.011) as well as between TBS and the femoral neck (r = 0.305, P = 0.026). Significant negative moderate correlations were observed between TBS and age (r = -0.393, P = 0.004) as well as between TBS and BMI (r = -0.333, P = 0.015).

TBS values of postmenopausal women were negatively correlated with age and BMI, and positively with BMD and BMD to BMI ratio.

### Association of hepatic/pancreatic iron overload evaluated by quantitative T2✱ MRI with bone mineral density and trabecular bone score [^115Zw3Su]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

In this cross-sectional study, patients diagnosed with hemoglobinopathies, including hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aplastic anemia, β-thalassemia, myelofibrosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary spherocytosis, were recruited between March 2014 and May 2019. The key eligibility criteria were as follows: age between 20 and 80 years, and a body mass index (BMI) between 15 and 37 kg/m², since the trabecular bone score (TBS) analysis is not recommended for patients outside this BMI range. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following conditions:

- **Bone metabolic diseases**: Such as definitive hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism.
- **Rheumatic and neurological diseases**
- **Pregnancy and lactation**
- **Previous use of drugs that interfere with bone metabolism**
- **Poor-quality DXA images**

The included patients underwent multi-echo gradient echo T2✱ MRI and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) examinations on the same day for quantification of organ iron, bone mineral density (BMD), and TBS.

All DXA studies were conducted using the same GE Lunar Prodigy Advance DXA scanner (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI), and the same software (enCORE version 10.50.086) was utilized for the automatic calculation of BMD of the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total hip (TH). According to WHO criteria, postmenopausal women and men aged 50 and older were classified as osteoporotic (T-score ≤ − 2.5), osteopenic (T-score between − 1.0 and − 2.5), and normal (T-score ≥ − 1). According to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), premenopausal women and men younger than 50 years of age were defined and classified similarly based on their T-scores.
