## Question

What kind of medication treat lipoprotein B like , vldl and quilomicrones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what medications treat apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins, including VLDL and chylomicrons. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and which particles are truly atherogenic. Then, I should verify how we measure and monitor these lipoproteins in practice. Next, I will classify the pharmacologic options by mechanism and match them to clinical phenotypes, including severe hypertriglyceridemia and dysbetalipoproteinemia. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based thresholds and safety considerations, and I will double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the biology so I don't anchor on the wrong target. ApoB is the structural protein on all atherogenic lipoproteins, with one apoB per particle, so apoB concentration reflects particle number and atherogenic burden; chylomicrons and VLDL carry apoB-48 and apoB-100, respectively, and their remnants are atherogenic, whereas mature chylomicrons are too large to enter the arterial wall and are not directly atherogenic, though they drive pancreatitis risk when markedly elevated [^8a0f65c0] [^4a9656d8] [^31defd0a].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implications of particle size and clearance. Small VLDL and IDL remnants can penetrate the endothelium and be retained in the intima, contributing to atherosclerosis; this helps explain why apoB and non–HDL-C often outperform LDL-C for risk prediction when there is discordance, particularly in hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic disease, and why therapies that reduce apoB particle number are prioritized when ASCVD risk is high [^2b5475e4] [^2fcfa041] [^7e313384].

> I need to check how we monitor and set targets. Non–HDL-C captures cholesterol in all apoB-containing lipoproteins and is a co-primary target in guidelines, while apoB is a direct measure of particle number and is increasingly used to guide therapy, especially when LDL-C and non–HDL-C are discordant; suggested apoB thresholds align with LDL-C risk categories, with < 90 mg/dL for primary prevention and < 80 mg/dL for very high risk, though apoB is still a secondary, optional target in many statements [^d207e6cc] [^1d3e4c6f] [^47034bef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating triglycerides alone. I initially thought fibrates would be the main therapy for VLDL and chylomicrons, but I should correct that: for ASCVD risk reduction, the primary target is apoB particle number, and statins remain first-line because they markedly reduce LDL apoB and moderately reduce VLDL apoB; fibrates lower triglycerides and VLDL apoB but have modest effects on total apoB and limited outcome data in statin-treated patients, so they are reserved for specific scenarios or when triglycerides are very high [^bae3e9d4] [^88f453f8].

> Let me consider the statin class carefully. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, upregulate LDL receptors, and reduce hepatic synthesis of apoB-100–containing lipoproteins, thereby lowering LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB; they also modestly reduce triglycerides and VLDL-C, and in high or very high risk patients, intensification to high-intensity statins or addition of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors is recommended to achieve apoB and non–HDL-C goals [^c3f053d6] [^2474837e] [^4636f05f].

> Next, I should review ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors. Ezetimibe reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption and further lowers LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB when added to statins, while PCSK9 inhibitors increase LDL receptor recycling and produce large, durable reductions in LDL-C, non–HDL-C, apoB, and VLDL-C; these are particularly useful when apoB remains above threshold despite maximally tolerated statin therapy or when statins are not tolerated [^4636f05f] [^77262fcc].

> I will now examine fibrates, since they directly target triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Fibrates activate PPARα, upregulate lipoprotein lipase, and reduce hepatic VLDL secretion, lowering triglycerides and VLDL-C; however, their effect on total apoB is modest and outcome benefits beyond statins are inconsistent, so they are best used for severe hypertriglyceridemia, especially when pancreatitis risk is present, or for dysbetalipoproteinemia where remnant clearance is impaired [^88f453f8] [^e68818a1] [^cdd66fb4].

> But wait, what if triglycerides are extremely high and chylomicrons predominate. In fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and particularly ≥ 1000 mg/dL, the immediate priority is to reduce triglycerides to < 500 mg/dL to mitigate pancreatitis risk; this requires a very low-fat diet, aggressive lifestyle measures, and consideration of fibrates and prescription omega-3 fatty acids, with fenofibrate preferred over gemfibrozil if combined with a statin due to lower myopathy risk [^f713e62a] [^0a14f523] [^a10c2f96].

> Let me verify the special case of familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Conventional lipid-lowering drugs are largely ineffective in FCS because the defect is in lipoprotein lipase–mediated clearance; management centers on an extremely low-fat diet with < 15–20 g/day fat, medium-chain triglycerides for calories, and avoidance of alcohol and estrogen, with emerging therapy including apoC-III inhibitors such as olezarsen (FDA-approved) and plozasiran (pending), which can dramatically lower triglycerides and apoB in this population [^a7179965] [^58ec0c02] [^e91e6420].

> I should double-check dysbetalipoproteinemia. In type III hyperlipoproteinemia, impaired remnant clearance yields elevated cholesterol-enriched VLDL and chylomicron remnants with relatively normal or low apoB; here, statins are first-line, but fibrates and even niacin can be particularly effective at clearing remnants, and apoB may not fully reflect risk, so therapy should target remnant reduction rather than apoB alone [^cdd66fb4] [^777b060e].

> Next, I should review omega-3 fatty acids. Prescription EPA/DHA at 2–4 g/day lowers hepatic VLDL synthesis and can reduce triglycerides by 20–45%, with modest reductions in apoB; they are reasonable adjuncts in severe hypertriglyceridemia and are endorsed in stroke prevention guidance for patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, though outcome data are limited and they are not substitutes for statins when ASCVD risk is high [^f713e62a] [^47fbbd81] [^88f453f8].

> Hold on, I should verify niacin's role. Niacin lowers triglycerides, VLDL-C, and LDL-C and can increase HDL-C, but its use has declined due to flushing, glycemic effects, and lack of incremental cardiovascular benefit on top of statins in contemporary trials; it may still be considered in select cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia or dysbetalipoproteinemia when other options are unsuitable [^0345f7dc] [^cdd66fb4].

> Let me consider MTP inhibition briefly. Lomitapide blocks MTP, preventing assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in hepatocytes and enterocytes, and is approved for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia; it lowers LDL-C and apoB substantially but causes hepatic steatosis and gastrointestinal adverse effects, so it is reserved for highly selected, refractory cases with close monitoring [^d0f6563d] [^f17f14b1].

> I should confirm the practical, stepwise approach. For most patients with elevated apoB, VLDL, and chylomicron remnants, start with lifestyle therapy and a statin to reduce apoB particle number; if apoB or non–HDL-C remains above threshold, add ezetimibe; if still above threshold or if statin intolerance, add a PCSK9 inhibitor; if triglycerides are ≥ 500 mg/dL, prioritize pancreatitis prevention with a very low-fat diet, fibrates, and omega-3s, and consider apoC-III inhibitors in FCS; tailor choices to risk category, comorbidities, and drug interactions, and monitor for safety and adherence [^2474837e] [^0a14f523] [^f713e62a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: medications that treat apoB-containing lipoproteins, including VLDL and chylomicron remnants, are those that reduce apoB particle number, with statins as foundational therapy, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as key intensification options, and fibrates and omega-3s reserved for severe hypertriglyceridemia or specific phenotypes; novel apoC-III inhibitors address refractory chylomicronemia, and apoB or non–HDL-C should guide therapy when discordance with LDL-C is present [^8a0f65c0] [^4636f05f] [^88f453f8] [^a7179965].

Medications that target apoB-containing lipoproteins (VLDL, chylomicrons, and their remnants) include **statins** as first-line therapy to lower LDL and VLDL apoB [^2474837e] [^bae3e9d4]; **ezetimibe** for additional LDL/VLDL apoB lowering [^cdd66fb4]; **PCSK9 inhibitors** for high-risk patients who need further apoB reduction [^4636f05f]; and **fibrates** or **omega-3 fatty acids** for severe hypertriglyceridemia to reduce VLDL/chylomicrons and pancreatitis risk [^f713e62a] [^88f453f8]. In familial chylomicronemia syndrome, **APOC3 inhibitors** (e.g. olezarsen) are indicated to lower triglycerides and apoB [^a7179965] [^58ec0c02]. Therapy is individualized by risk, triglyceride level, and phenotype, with apoB or non–HDL-C guiding targets [^1d3e4c6f] [^d207e6cc].

Statins are the frontline therapy for this disorder, and apoB is the target of therapy. Addition of ezetimibe may be required. In high‐risk individuals, PCSK9 inhibitors may be required as well.

Dysbetalipoproteinemia

Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Figure 6E) is characterized by markedly increased numbers of cholesterol‐enriched chylomicron and VLDL remnant particles. By contrast, the number of LDL particles is low. Total apoB is <120 mg/dL, triglycerides are elevated (>1.5 mmol/L), the triglycerides/apoB ratio is <10:1, and the TC apoB ratio is >6.2:1.Dysbetalipoproteinemia is a highly atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia, less common than heterozygous FH, but often much more easily treatable. The pathophysiology is complex. The great majority of those affected are homozygous for the apoE E2 isoform. However, this is only a precondition, not a sufficient requirement.Obesity, diabetes, and exogenous hormones are among the factors that may trigger the expression of the abnormal accumulation of remnant particles, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, in contrast to all the other phenotypes, apoB is not the primary target of therapy. The targets of therapy are the cholesterol‐enriched chylomicron VLDL and remnant particles, but statins, once again, are still be the preferred initial therapy, although fibrates and even niacin are effective in many patients.

Non–HDL cholesterol (non–HDL-C)—NLA recommendations emphasize its central role and composition: they “outlined the central role of elevated concentrations of cholesterol carried by atherogenic lipoprotein particles (ie, non–HDL-C) as a root cause of atherosclerosis and that reduction in the circulating levels of these lipoproteins would lower ASCVD risk,” and “Non–HDL-C comprises cholesterol carried by all apolipoprotein B (apo B)–containing lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein (a), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons, and chylomicron remnant particles.”

HyperTG normoapoB is the characteristic phenotype seen in mild‐to‐moderate hypertriglyceridemia, which is primarily a non‐Mendelian polygenic phenotype that corresponds to former type IV hyperlipoproteinemia.This contrasts with hyperTG hyperapoB, which is the phenotype of familial combined hyperlipidemia, also primarily a non‐Mendelian polygenic phenotype that corresponds to the former type IIB hyperlipoproteinemia,in which plasma triglycerides and apoB are both increased.In combined hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is attributable increased secretion of VLDL particles, whereas, in mild‐to‐moderate hypertriglyceridemia, hypertriglyceridemia is attributable to secretion of triglyceride‐enriched VLDL particles at a normal rate.The difference in apoB correlates with the difference in cardiovascular risk, which is substantially higher in hypertriglyceridemic patients with combined hyperlipidemia than in patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertriglyceridemia.

The elevation in plasma triglycerides in these patients is primarily because of VLDL particles, not chylomicrons, and therefore, these patients are not at risk for pancreatitis. However, for reasons still not well understood, plasma triglycerides in these patients may suddenly rise substantially because of a failure in chylomicron clearance and, if this occurs, pancreatitis is possible. Cardiovascular risk attributable to the apoB lipoproteins in these patients is proportional to the number of apoB particles. Typically, apoB is low. Sometimes, however, it may be high, pointing to concurrent elevation of VLDL and LDL apoB particles.In all instances, other causes of cardiovascular risk may be present, such as diabetes or hypertension, and these must be considered in determining the overall level of cardiovascular risk. When lipid‐lowering therapy is required, statins are the preferred therapy, not fibrates, because the target of therapy is apoB, not triglycerides. Fibrates substantially reduce triglycerides and VLDL apoB, but only modestly reduce LDL apoB.Because LDL apoB accounts for the great majority of total apoB, the effect of fibrates on apoB is modest. This modest effect explains why fibrates were successful in some randomized trials but not in most. By contrast, statins reduce VLDL apoB moderately, LDL apoB markedly, and therefore total apoB markedly, and this explains why statins, not fibrates, were virtually uniformly successful in randomized clinical trials of cardiovascular outcomes.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^8a0f65c0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

National Lipid Association consensus—apolipoprotein B (apoB) structure and measurement—states that apolipoprotein (apo)B is the main structural protein on all atherogenic lipoproteins and is the principal ligand for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, that each atherogenic particle carries a single apoB (apoB-100 for LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein [IDL], very-low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and apoB-48 for chylomicron and chylomicron remnant particles), making apoB concentration a direct measure of the circulating burden of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, and that apoB is a precise, accurate, and well-validated measurement.

Other apolipoproteins, such as apoE, apo CII, and apo CIII, play important roles in regulating the metabolism of the chylomicron and VLDL particles. However, we will not deal with these here, because these other markers have not yet been shown to add clinically relevant information beyond that provided by apoB. That is not the case for lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) particles. Lp(a) is an LDL particle to which a molecule of apo(a) has been disulfide bonded to apo B 100.Lp(a) appears to increase the risk of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease independently of LDL‐C or total apoB.Therefore, to assess the atherogenic risk attributable to the apoB lipoproteins, Lp(a) must be measured as well as apoB. Lp(a) also plays a causal role in the genesis of calcific aortic stenosis.Lp(a) particles generally account for only a small minority of total apoB particles in plasma. Occasionally, however, they may contribute significantly to total apoB and LDL‐C.Newer assays that report Lp(a) in nanomoles per liter rather than mass should solve this problem, because the proportion of total apoB attributable to Lp(a) will be calculable.The levels of Lp(a) are determined genetically, and there is little variance over our lifetimes. Medications to lower Lp(a) with the goal to reduce cardiovascular risk and the likelihood of aortic stenosis are being developed, but the results of randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes are not yet available.Therefore, we will not deal further with Lp(a).

Particle Number

The relative numbers of the different apoB particles in the plasma of a normal person are illustrated in Figure 2. Chylomicron particles are the largest, 75 to 1200 nm in diameter, and the fewest; they are normally almost all removed from plasma within 3 to 4 hours of eating.Chylomicron particles are too large to enter the arterial wall and therefore are not atherogenic. However, they are not entirely innocuous. Pancreatitis can occur secondary to a marked increase in chylomicron particle numbers and residence time. However, pathogenic chylomicronemia is relatively rare and, although important, will not be dealt with here. All the other apoB particles, including chylomicron remnant particles, can enter the arterial wall and therefore are atherogenic. These are the particles on which we will focus.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

High blood cholesterol and ASCVD—cholesterol, lipoproteins, and apolipoprotein B describe that serum cholesterol and its lipoprotein carriers (LDL, very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], and HDL) are known to be related to ASCVD, with LDL-C the dominant atherogenic cholesterol; VLDL-C is also atherogenic, HDL-C is seemingly not atherogenic, and chylomicron atherogenicity is uncertain; the combination of LDL-C and VLDL-C (non–HDL-C) is more atherogenic than either alone; apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main protein in LDL and VLDL and, like non–HDL-C, is a stronger indicator of atherogenicity than LDL-C alone.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Hyperlipidemia has been widely documented to be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk,and pharmacological reduction of circulating non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is beneficial in primary and secondary CVD prevention. Widely-used clinical CVD risk calculators frequently include classical biochemistry measures of total cholesterol, HDL-C, or a combination of these. –

Total cholesterol is an estimate of the cholesterol in all very-low-density lipoproteins, intermediate-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, and lipoprotein(a) in the fasted state, as well as chylomicrons and their remnant particles in the unfasted state. Notably, the majority of total cholesterol resides in LDL particles, and the additional clinical utility of recently developed direct LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) measurements are not entirely clear. Non–HDL-C has been suggested as a pragmatic and cost-effective alternative to direct LDL-C measurement, requiring only total cholesterol and HDL-C to be performed.

Apolipoproteins (Apo) A1 and B are the principle protein components of HDL and non-HDL particles, respectively, and have also been of interest for their potential in improving CVD risk prediction. This is partly because of the proteins being key components of lipoprotein function, and their measurement facilitating quantification of objective particle numbers.ApoB is thought to be of similar use in CVD prediction as non–HDL-C and LDL-C, but in some studies has shown improvements in prediction in scenarios where treated LDL-C levels are within the normal range.However, an Emerging Risk Factor Collaboration individual participant meta-analysis from 37 prospective cohorts (165 544 participants) suggested that replacement of traditional lipid parameters with ApoA1 and ApoB measurements only offered very modest improvement in CVD prediction. Despite this, enthusiasm for clinical use of apolipoprotein measurements beyond LDL-C or total cholesterol remains high in many places.

### Oral muvalaplin for lowering of lipoprotein (a) [^e2ae564e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this phase 2 study, patients with lipoprotein concentrations of 175 nmol/L or greater with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to receive treatment with placebo or muvalaplin at dosages of 10 mg/d, 60 mg/d, or 240 mg/d for 12 weeks. Apheresis has been used to lower lipoprotein but it is invasive, time-consuming, and costly. 10, 11. Lipoprotein includes an apolipoprotein B–containing low-density lipoprotein –like particle covalently bound to the apolipoprotein molecule. 7 Nucleic acid–based therapeutics that lower lipoprotein by preventing apolipoprotein transcription are in clinical development. A parenterally administered antisense oligonucleotide lowered lipoprotein by approximately 80%, 12 and parenterally administered small interfering RNA–based therapies have shown greater than 90% reductions. 13-16.

This phase 2 study demonstrated that muvalaplin, an oral agent that inhibits lipoprotein formation, was well tolerated and reduced lipoprotein levels. At the highest dose studied, 240 mg, muvalaplin produced a placebo-adjusted reduction of intact lipoprotein of 85. 8% and a reduction of lipoprotein as measured by a traditional apolipoprotein-based assay of
68. 9%. The 240-mg/d dosage resulted in 96. 7% of patients achieving lipoprotein concentrations of less than 125 nmol/L using an intact lipoprotein assay and
77. 4% using an apolipoprotein assay. Dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C and apolipoprotein B of up to 21. 3% and
16. 1%, respectively, were also observed. Muvalaplin was well tolerated, with no dose-dependent adverse events and no concerning biochemical abnormalities.

While most therapies in clinical development have used injectable agents that target apolipoprotein messenger RNA, muvalaplin inhibits lipoprotein assembly with oral delivery, with evidence of effective lipoprotein lowering and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Future studies are needed to determine whether muvalaplin reduces clinical events and plays a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)—apoB response relative to LDL-C (or non-HDL-C) in lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) trials—notes that RCTs investigating LLTs and cardiovascular outcomes have typically enrolled patients based on cardiovascular risk and threshold LDL-C levels, that non-HDL-C and apoB have been measured or reported for some but not all trials, and that apoB measurements were often not completed as frequently during follow-up as LDL-C.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) limitations—The page notes conditions in which apoB will not provide a complete assessment regarding lipoprotein-associated ASCVD risk, including severe hypertriglyceridemia with chylomicronemia where the priority is reducing chylomicronemia/triglycerides to lower pancreatitis risk; dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia) with elevated chylomicron- and VLDL-remnant cholesterol despite apoB that may be normal or low; elevated Lp(a) not always accompanied by apoB elevation; and other lipid disorders such as lipoprotein X or very low HDL-C.

Table 6—dyslipidemia classification by triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (apoB)—links Fredrickson-Levy-Lee phenotypes to numeric thresholds and syndromes; for example, hypercholesterolemia (IIa: LDL) has TG <133 with apoB ≥120 corresponding to familial hypercholesterolemia, and combined or mixed hyperlipidemia (IIb: LDL + VLDL) has TG ≥133 with apoB ≥120 corresponding to familial combined hyperlipidemia; severe hypertriglyceridemia categories include I: chylomicrons (familial chylomicronemia syndrome) and V: VLDL + chylomicrons (multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome).

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^7e313384]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions—apolipoprotein B (apoB) represents the concentration of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, while non-HDL-C represents all cholesterol carried by apoB-containing lipoproteins; compared to LDL-C, apoB more accurately reflects the atherogenic impact of lipoproteins before and during lipid-altering treatment; there can be discordance between LDL-C and apoB, and when discordance exists between apoB and LDL-C, or non-HDL-C and LDL-C, apoB and non-HDL-C provide more accurate indications of lipoprotein-associated ASCVD risk to guide therapy; apoB measurement is particularly useful to improve risk assessment at both the lower and higher ends of the LDL-C range, can be a confirmatory marker of high risk for ASCVD and a risk-enhancing factor when very high, and when apoB is not as high as expected with elevated LDL-C it can reassure that prescription of LLT is not as urgent in a low-risk patient.

### Statins in cardiometabolic disease: what makes pitavastatin different? [^319f1f85]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The recommended treatment for MetS is lifestyle change, focusing on weight loss and physical activity, followed by pharmaceutical treatment for the individual risk factors [,-]. Dyslipidemia – an imbalance between the proatherogenic apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins (low-density lipoproteins, very-low density lipoproteins and chylomicrons/chylomicron remnants) and anti-atherogenic high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) – is a major risk factor for CV and cerebrovascular disease. Numerous studies show that lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins can significantly reduce CV risk in people with and without T2D, with no lower limit beyond which LDL-C-lowering is not beneficial [-]. Based on these results, most international treatment guidelines recommend lowering LDL-C to <2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) in patients with established CV disease and to <1.8 to 2.0 mmol/l (70 to 80 mg/dl) in those with very high CV risk, reducing total cholesterol to <4.5 mmol/l (174 mg/dl) with an option of <4 mmol/l (154 mg/dl) if feasible [,,-]. Although most statins (including atorvastatin, simvastatin and pitavastatin) have similar effects on LDL-C levels [-], differences in chemical structure and pharmacokinetic profile can lead to variations in pleiotropic effects, adverse event profiles and drug–drug interactions. The choice of statin should therefore depend on the characteristics and needs of the individual patient.

Despite the widespread availability of effective lipid-lowering drugs, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia varies considerably throughout Europe, ranging from 3 to 53% in men and from 4 to 40% in women, depending on the country. In most populations, almost 50% of people treated with lipid-lowering drugs have a total cholesterol level >6.5 mmol/l (251 mg/dl), suggesting that greater efforts are needed to identify and adequately treat people with hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, even in patients that fully attain their total cholesterol/LDL-C targets, the risk of major vascular events is only reduced by around one-third, leaving substantial residual risk. The identification and treatment of residual risk factors is therefore essential for the effective management of CV disease.

Atherogenic cholesterol and lipoprotein metrics—The NLA Expert Panel concluded that “An elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein (apo) B–containing lipoproteins (non–HDL-C and LDL-C, termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical ASCVD events,” and identified HDL, LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and chylomicrons as “the 5 major classes of lipoproteins.” LDL is described as the predominant cholesterol carrier, “comprising ∼75% of cholesterol carried by non-HDL particles, with the remaining ∼25% of non–HDL-C in triglyceride-rich particles.” Clinical laboratories “typically report the LDL-C concentration as a calculated value using the Friedewald equation (LDL-C = total cholesterol [total-C] – HDL-C – triglycerides/5 with all values in mg/dL) as long as the triglyceride level is below ∼400 mg/dL,” and “This calculated value includes cholesterol carried by true LDL particles, as well as IDL particles”; “LDL-C estimated by the Friedwald equation also includes cholesterol carried by these lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] particles.” Non–HDL-C is “calculated as total-C – HDL-C” and “represents the sum of cholesterol carried by all potentially atherogenic, apo B–containing lipoprotein particles,” and the document states that “non–HDL-C is more strongly related to risk for ASCVD than LDL-C.”

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^2fcfa041]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) versus LDL-C and non-HDL-C for risk assessment—By far the most abundant apoB-containing lipoprotein in the circulation is LDL, and although apoB and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) correlate closely in populations, LDL particle composition and size can vary, creating discordance between LDL-C and apoB measurements in individuals, especially in those treated with statins and in those with cholesterol-depleted and cholesterol-enriched LDL. This discordance can lead to both under-treatment with LLT and potential misclassification of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk if cholesterol content is relied upon exclusively. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) represents the cholesterol carried by all apoB-containing lipoproteins, correlates more closely with apoB than LDL-C and is a stronger predictor of ASCVD risk, yet discordance between non-HDL-C and apoB can also occur with similar issues, albeit to a lesser degree than for LDL-C. ApoB measurement can be useful to identify patients with borderline ASCVD risk who have discordantly low apoB relative to LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C and can assist shared decision-making about whether pharmacotherapy can be deferred.

Metabolic risk definition—identification of a general condition called metabolic risk is considered reasonable, defined as an individual’s predisposition for developing ASCVD and/or T2DM, and individuals at metabolic risk often have elevations of very-low density lipoproteins with elevated triglycerides, reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased plasma glucose, systemic hypertension, enlarged waist circumference, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state; they can also have elevated apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins (primarily LDL, but also non-HDL lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, and chylomicrons), although this applies more specifically to ASCVD.

### Clinical lipidology and the prevention of vascular disease: time for personalized therapy [^4b98dfc8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle modifications can cause elevations of lipoproteins that contribute to atherosclerotic lesions over time. In the modern world with life extension from many improvements in medicine and public health, most humans live long enough to develop atherosclerosis with concentrations of blood plasma lipoproteins that are very common. Familial abnormalities are prevalent and provide additional challenges in identifying unhealthy but treatable values of low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Multiple community studies and clinical trials have provided guidance on selecting targets and new tools that make possible effective goals of treatment. Lipid-lowering drugs are making it possible to achieve those goals and place responsibility on physicians to master the art of preventing atherosclerotic events. Lipoprotein management remains a very focused effort and requires an artful individualized approach for each patient. Few skills are more important for healthcare providers in primary care and cardiovascular medicine.

Search strategy

References (English language only) were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published from 2000 by the use of the terms ‘triglycerides’; ‘lipoprotein remnants’; ‘triglyceride-rich lipoproteins’; in combination with the terms ‘cardiovascular disease’; ‘atherosclerosis’; ‘residual risk’; and ‘therapeutics’. Relevant articles were also identified through searches of the reference lists of the identified literature.

Triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and remnants: definitions and clinical relevance

Triglycerides are an efficient means of storing excess energy, mainly in adipose tissue. In the blood, TG and cholesteryl esters (CE) circulate within the core of spherical lipoproteins, covered with a monolayer ‘shell’ of phospholipids and free cholesterol, with apolipoproteins stabilizing the structure. Apolipoprotein (apo) B is the major structural protein in TRL, present as either apoB100, made in the liver, or a truncated form, apoB48, made in the intestine. These isoforms, rather than size or density, best define the TRL class. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), made in the liver, contain apoB100 and are metabolized to VLDL remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and LDL. Chylomicrons, made in the intestine, are larger and contain apoB48, and are also metabolized to remnant particles but not to IDL and LDL (Figure 1). The intestine also secretes apoB48-containing VLDL-sized particles.

TRL decrease in size during lipolysis; concomitantly, the core content of TG decreases and CE increases due to cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of TRL–TG for LDL- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-CE. During lipolysis apoB remains with the TRL on which it was secreted. With one apoB molecule per particle, apoB concentration is thus a measure of particle number. Other apolipoproteins (particularly apoCs) transfer mainly to HDL during lipolysis. The spectrum of apoB100- and apoB48-containing remnants varies with plasma TG levels (Figure 1). At optimal levels (<1.2 mmol/L or <100 mg/dL),efficient lipolysis results in limited accumulation of remnant particles, predominantly in the small VLDL and IDL size range. At higher TG levels (e.g. ≥3.0 mmol/L or ≥260 mg/dL), increased secretion and impaired lipolysis result in the substantial accumulation of chylomicron and VLDL remnants.

Based on these concepts, care givers will understand why, except for dysbetalipoproteinemia, apoB includes all the information about cardiovascular risk from LDL‐C, non–HDL‐C, and triglycerides, and therefore, how apoB could improve diagnosis and simplify therapy. We will explain why LDL particles are more important drivers of cardiovascular risk than very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, even in those with hypertriglyceridemia, and why not all individuals with hypertriglyceridemia have an elevated apoB, and therefore, why not all those with high triglycerides have the same cardiovascular risk. We will also demonstrate how the number of LDL apoB particles, and therefore cardiovascular risk, can be elevated when LDL‐C and/or non–HDL‐C are normal. Finally, we will illustrate the most significant proatherogenic apoB lipoprotein phenotypes to help reframe the conventional disorders of lipid metabolism as disorders of apoB lipoprotein particle metabolism.

National Lipid Association consensus—apoB treatment thresholds and clinical application—states that thresholds for initiating or intensifying pharmacotherapy for apoB levels are not as well-established compared to LDL-C and non-HDL-C; however, based on evidence from untreated populations and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in individuals on lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), apoB thresholds for very high, high, and borderline to intermediate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk are suggested to be 60, 70, and 90 mg/dL, respectively, to correspond with current LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment thresholds; it adds that lowering apoB and non-HDL-C can be achieved with nutritional and other lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy, and that apoB testing provides information relevant to prognosis, treatment expectations, and the need for family cascade screening.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) measurement—clinicians may consider measuring apoB at initial evaluation to assess for discordance between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apoB and to identify an elevated apoB level as a potential risk-enhancing factor or a marker of severe hyperlipoproteinemia; 4–12 weeks after changes in lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) to determine whether LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB levels are above therapeutic thresholds on treatment; during clinical or metabolic change to determine the effect of a newly diagnosed health condition and to determine whether the initiation of a new medication affecting lipid/lipoprotein metabolism has affected LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB levels (e.g., sex hormone therapy, thiazide diuretics, antiretroviral therapy, and immunosuppressive drugs); and for cascade screening to assist in clarifying a potential genetic lipoprotein disorder in family members of patients with elevated apoB levels.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^38ff2bd4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology—production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fafb2f33]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Appendix B: Lipid metabolism—triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol are transported as the core components of lipoproteins. TG are assembled into chylomicrons in the small intestine and enter the circulation via the thoracic duct, and chylomicrons are normally not found in fasting plasma. The liver synthesizes and secretes TG in the form of VLDL, and lipolysis of TG from TG-rich lipoproteins is performed primarily by interaction with LPL at the luminal surface of capillaries, releasing fatty acids for energy or storage by muscles and adipose tissue. The resulting particles are chylomicron or VLDL remnants; with further TG loss, VLDL remnants can become low-density LDL and are removed primarily by liver LDL receptors, and chylomicron remnants and some VLDL remnants are cleared in the liver by the LDL receptor and at least 1 other pathway mediated by LRP. High-density lipoprotein has a distinct metabolic pathway including production from the liver and gut, addition and removal of lipids in the circulation, and clearance mainly in the liver. Clinically, the approach focuses on abnormal circulating lipoproteins, primary disorders must be separated from endocrine and other organ system effects, monogenic primary disorders are rare, and other primary disorders are mostly polygenic and common and influenced by diet, exercise, and medications. Routine ranges are based on population distributions; however, clinicians may be better served by the concepts of “optimal” and “elevated,” and various guidelines and scientific statements have denoted TG levels above 150 mg/ dL (1.7 mmol/L), 170 mg/dL (1.9 mmol/L), or 200 mg/dL.

Discussion

Our study was designed to provide insight into whether reductions in VLDLs and their contents are associated with incremental reductions in residual ASCVD risk, beyond reductions in LDL‐C. Similar to LDL‐C, 23, 24 we observed a dose‐response reduction in incident ASCVD risk with greater reductions in NMR‐measured VLDL‐C and small VLDL‐p. Change in these lipoproteins was not strongly correlated with change in LDL‐C on‐statin, and the incremental risk reductions associated with reductions in VLDL‐C and small VLDL‐p remained significant after accounting for each participant's change in LDL‐C. Conversely, although allocation to statin was associated with reduced ASCVD risk compared with placebo, there was no further reduction in risk with greater reductions in chemically measured triglycerides nor in NMR‐measured large VLDL‐p/chylomicrons or medium VLDL‐p. Overall, these results support a potentially important role for small VLDL lipoproteins and their associated cholesterol in the development of ASCVD events, and suggest that, beyond reductions in LDL‐C, greater reductions in these particular lipoproteins may possibly confer incremental ASCVD risk reduction. Importantly, risk associated with these smaller atherogenic triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins was not captured by the chemically measured triglyceride level.

The implementation of broad pharmacological‐ and lifestyle‐based preventive strategies targeting LDL‐C has resulted in appreciable reductions in LDL‐C on the population level. 1, 2, 3 At the same time, there is histopathological evidence that the composition and morphology of human atherosclerotic plaque has changed in recent years in parallel with these secular trends in LDL‐C reduction, 25 compelling a shifting focus toward residual, non‐LDL‐C mediators of ASCVD, 26 including VLDL. 5, 11 To investigate this potential risk pathway, we performed detailed 1 H‐NMR spectroscopy to profile changes in VLDL lipoprotein species and their associated cholesterol and triglycerides in relation to changes in risk. Our results support the hypothesis that VLDL species are important contributors to ASCVD risk, and raise hope that their targeted reduction may possibly further reduce event rates beyond reductions in LDL‐C.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^0a14f523]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Management of adults with hypertriglyceridemia—when fasting triglyceride (TG) levels are elevated, ie, >150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), individuals with TG between 500 and 884 mg/dL (5.6-9.9 mmol/L) have increasing concern for metabolic deterioration predisposing to acute pancreatitis, for which secondary causes should be addressed, diets modified, and fibrates/omega-3 fatty acids initiated if levels do not improve. In those with a history of HTG-associated pancreatitis or with fasting TG remaining >885 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) on repeat testing without an obvious and treatable secondary cause, treatment to protect against future pancreatitis episodes must be considered; first-line treatment includes a low-fat diet with strong consideration for a fibrate, and omega-3 fatty acids are also a consideration. For mild to moderate HTG (TG 150-499 mg/dL; 1.6-5.6 mmol/L), the primary concern is increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and the primary target must be low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in those with TG 500 to 884 mg/dL (5.6-9.9 mmol/L), ASCVD risk also warrants attention and other risk factors—hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and chronic stress—should be managed concurrently. If ASCVD risk is high or intermediate, medications with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as statins and ezetimibe, are preferred; when LDL-C is difficult to determine with persistently elevated TG on statin therapy, non–HDL-C and/or apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are alternative tests for treatment thresholds and monitoring. If ASCVD risk is low, lifestyle advice should be recommended with periodic lipid monitoring every 12 to 24 months, and statin treatment can be considered as the individual’s situation evolves. For individuals with confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), clinicians may consider use of FDA-approved apolipoprotein CIII inhibitors, and access to investigational therapies for severe HTG can be explored through a specialty clinic.

LDL-C–apoB discordance and thresholds for decision-making—LDL-C and apoB are both meant to represent the relative contribution of atherogenic lipoproteins to ASCVD risk, but despite strong correlation significant discordance can exist and is amplified in treated patients due to larger relative reduction in LDL-C compared to apoB. The analysis suggests conceptualizing discordance by observing guideline-based LDL-C thresholds for intensification of therapy of 55, 70, and 100 mg/dL for very high, high, and borderline to intermediate risk, respectively, and noting the wide variance of apoB around these levels.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^985eee22]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lipid disorders involving derangements in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, or both are commonly encountered in clinical practice and often have implications for cardiovascular risk and overall health. Recent advances in knowledge, recommendations, and treatment options have necessitated an updated approach to these disorders. Older classification schemes have outlived their usefulness, yielding to an approach based on the primary lipid disturbance identified on a routine lipid panel as a practical starting point. Although monogenic dyslipidemias exist and are important to identify, most individuals with lipid disorders have polygenic predisposition, often in the context of secondary factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. With regard to cardiovascular disease, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is essentially causal, and clinical practice guidelines worldwide have recommended treatment thresholds and targets for this variable. Furthermore, recent studies have established elevated triglycerides as a cardiovascular risk factor, whereas depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol now appears less contributory than was previously believed. An updated approach to diagnosis and risk assessment may include measurement of secondary lipid variables such as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a), together with selective use of genetic testing to diagnose rare monogenic dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia or familial chylomicronemia syndrome. The ongoing development of new agents—especially antisense RNA and monoclonal antibodies—targeting dyslipidemias will provide additional management options, which in turn motivates discussion on how best to incorporate them into current treatment algorithms.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia: an update [^ea393489]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Triglycerides (TGs) form part of the standard lipid profile. Elevations in TGs are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk through triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles found as part of non-HDL cholesterol. Many elevations of TGs are secondary to other causes, but primary hypertriglyceridaemia syndromes need to be identified. The genetic causes of hypertriglyceridaemia range from familial combined hyperlipidaemia through the autosomal recessive remnant hyperlipidaemia (related to apolipoprotein E variants) and familial chylomicronaemia syndromes. Patients with primary hypertriglyceridaemia >10mmol/L require characterisation and specific intervention. Simple lipid profiles do not provide adequate information for detailed diagnosis and additional assays such as apolipoprotein (apo)B 100 , apoE genotype and next-generation sequencing may be useful. Management of raised TGs includes optimising diet, reducing exacerbating factors as well as lipid-lowering medications such as statins, fibrates, niacin and omega-3 fatty acids. Novel medications for orphan disease indications such as familial chylomicronaemia syndrome include volanesorsen, evinacumab and other antisense therapeutics. Extreme hypertriglyceridaemia syndromes, especially chylomicronaemia syndromes, which can be exposed by pregnancy or other factors are a medical emergency and require admission and specialist management sometimes including plasma exchange.

Evidence for Apo B Lipoproteins as the Root Cause of Atherosclerosis: Response‐to‐Retention

Apo B lipoproteins transport cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma. Apo B lipoproteins up to 70 nm diameter, including low‐density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate‐density lipoproteins (IDL), smaller very‐low‐density lipoproteins (VLDL), chylomicron remnant particles, and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], efficiently cross the protective endothelial layer and penetrate into the intima of the artery wall. 5, 6 The probability that these particles enter and leave the arterial subendothelial space is dependent on particle size, plasma concentration, blood pressure, arterial injury, and the affinity and ability of the lipoprotein to bind proteoglycans. The equilibrium can be shifted when either lipoprotein particle concentration or intimal hyperplasia is increased (Figure 1). Normally, most LDL particles that cross the endothelium and enter the intima then return to the circulation. However, in the presence of certain cardiovascular risk factors or disturbed laminar flow, LDL particles are more likely to adhere to intimal proteoglycans and be retained in situ. 7, 8 The triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins, including IDLs, chylomicron remnants, and VLDL, may have difficulty leaving the intima because of their larger size or because of entrapment by components of the arterial intima. 5

Figure 1 
Apo B lipoprotein response‐to‐retention model of atherosclerosis initiation and progression. High plasma concentrations of apo B lipoproteins (,,, chylomicron remnants, Lp(a)) increase entry into intima and retention. Apo B lipoproteins bind to proteoglycans and begin aggregating, a process that accelerates once plaque begins. Retention is influenced by particle composition and diet, among other factors. Retention leads to a maladaptive cellular response leading to increased inflammation, fibrosis, and necrosis. The lipid/necrotic core forms when normal phagocytotic processes and efferocytosis are overwhelmed by continued retention and accumulation of “toxic” apo B lipoproteins. Plaque rupture or erosion can lead to formation of overlying thrombus, which can precipitate an acute clinical event. Apo indicates Apolipoprotein;, intermediate lipoprotein;, low‐density lipoprotein; Lp(a), Lipoprotein (a);, very‐low‐density lipoprotein.

Dysbetalipoproteinemia—genotype prevalence, phenotype, and diagnostic clues are specified: It is formerly known as type III dyslipidemia and involves impaired uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants with a second “hit” such as obesity or insulin resistance; the phenotype sometimes occurs in APOE ε2/ε2 homozygotes whose prevalence is estimated at ≤1% in cohorts with European ancestry, and only a minority (≤20%) manifest the phenotype, while the condition has an estimated prevalence as high as ~2% when milder phenotypes are identified. Individuals typically show decreased clearance of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron remnants with increased VLDL-C and VLDL-TG and an elevation in reported LDL-C that generally reflects the intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) portion, yielding an increased ratio of IDL-C to “true” LDL-C; because “true” LDL-C is generally not elevated, apolipoprotein B (Apo B) measurement can be helpful for diagnosis and Apo B will generally be low to normal despite non-HDL-C elevation, and in more severe TG elevation fasting chylomicronemia may be present.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C.Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4. 
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to <50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level.In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

Chart 2—Apolipoprotein B (apo B) targeting is considered optional and secondary after achieving atherogenic cholesterol goals; goals for apo B as an optional target are <90 mg/dL for primary prevention and <80 mg/dL for those with very high risk, and clinicians may consider measuring LDL particle concentration as an alternative to apo B.

### Biomedical consequences of elevated cholesterol-containing lipoproteins and apolipoproteins on cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes [^bd434dc7]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Circulating concentrations of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins have been linked to risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular coronary heart disease (CHD). Certain circulating lipids have also been implicated in other disorders such as dementia, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), Crohn’s disease (CD), rheumatoid arthritis, and some forms of cancers.

The major blood lipid components, free cholesterol, cholesteryl-esters, and triglycerides are transported by lipoprotein particles. Large lipoprotein particles are triglyceride-rich and encompass chylomicrons derived from dietary fat, and very-low density lipoproteins synthesised in the liver. These particles carry a single apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) on the surface (Apo-B 48 for chylomicrons and Apo-B 100 otherwise), and are progressively depleted of triglycerides, through the action of lipoprotein lipase, becoming smaller, denser, and proportionately richer in cholesterol. Lipoproteins, are involved in the process of transporting cholesterol to peripheral tissues (endogenous transport), and are classified according to density gradient centrifugation as (VLDL) very-low-density-, (IDL) intermediate-density- and (LDL) low-density-lipoproteins. Reverse cholesterol transport, from tissues to liver, is mediated by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that are synthesised and released from the liver in nascent form, and which possess membrane-bound apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1).

### New therapeutic approaches to the treatment of dyslipidemia [^7b42190e]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Abundant data indicate that low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are causal for ASCVD; a new class of LDL-lowering medicines, the PCSK9 inhibitors, will address much unmet medical need. Human genetics suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) are pro-atherogenic and have pointed to a number of protein regulators of lipoprotein lipase activity that are candidates for therapeutic targeting. Finally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol does not appear to be causally associated with protection from ASCVD, reinforced by the failure of three CETP inhibitors in CV outcome trials, but HDL function remains of interest.

### Treating low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: what is the evidence? [^21fa24e9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, genetic and interventional studies have failed to consistently support this relationship. There is an increasing body of evidence that the function of HDL, including its antiatherogenic properties and its reverse cholesterol transport activity, has a greater impact on CVD risk compared with levels of HDL alone. Targeting HDL has become a growing interest. Nevertheless, raising HDL pharmacologically has failed to show a considerable, if any, impact on cardiovascular outcome. Efforts should focus on improving HDL quality in addition to raising HDL levels when developing new therapies. Ongoing and future research will help determine the most safe and effective approach to improve cardiovascular outcome and establish the safety, efficacy and impact on atherosclerosis of the emerging HDL-raising therapies.

Management of hypertriglyceridemia—for very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower triglycerides to <500 mg/dL to reduce pancreatitis risk; for high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), the primary objective is to lower atherogenic cholesterol (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) to reduce ASCVD risk. Lifestyle measures include weight loss targeting 5%–10% of body weight, physical activity ≥150 min/wk of moderate or higher intensity, and restriction of alcohol and sugar or refined carbohydrate intakes. With very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL), chylomicronemia will often be present, and essentially all patients with fasting triglycerides of ≥750 mg/dl will demonstrate chylomicronemia; for such patients, a low-fat diet (<15% of energy) may help reduce entry of new chylomicron particles into the circulation.

Dietary management—very high triglycerides (TG): For individuals with very high TG (≥500 mg/dL), nutrition therapy will differ from the management of TG <500 mg/dL; plasma TG are mainly transported by 2 distinct classes of lipoproteins—1) chylomicrons produced and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and 2) very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesized in the liver.

### Diagnosis and treatment of apolipoprotein B dyslipoproteinemias [^44a790cf]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, atherogenic dyslipidemias have been defined by elevated levels of triglyceride and/or LDL cholesterol. However, cholesterol and triglycerides are not metabolically and physically independent entities. Rather, they are constituents of the atherogenic apolipoprotein B (apoB) particles, which differ in their origin and their metabolic function. Moreover, the risk of vascular disease is not related to the plasma concentration of cholesterol or triglyceride per se, but to the number, composition and size of the apoB particles, within which the cholesterol and triglycerides are contained. After all, the entire apoB particle--rather than individual cholesterol or triglyceride molecules--enters and is trapped within the arterial wall, and this particle initiates and sustains the process that results in atherosclerosis. Accordingly, we suggest a change of name and focus from dyslipidemias to dyslipoproteinemias. Virtually all the atherogenic apoB dyslipoproteinemias can be specifically identified on the basis of plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and apoB. Not only does this enable an accurate diagnosis in the individual, but the major familial dyslipoproteinemias can be identified as well. Here, we review the diagnostic algorithm for apoB dyslipoproteinemias and provide, for the first time, a treatment plan on the basis of a reduction of atherogenic lipoprotein particles rather than plasma lipids.

Figure 4 
Regulation of VLDL and LDL apoB particle number.

This figure illustrates the metabolic relations among the various VLDL and LDL particles. The liver secretes VLDL1 and VLDL2 particles. VLDL1 particles are the most TG rich and can be converted to VLDL2 particles by hydrolysis of core TG in peripheral tissues. Similarly, VLDL2 particles can be converted to VLDL3 particles, which can be converted to IDL particles or removed by the liver. IDL particles can be converted to LDL1 particles, which, following core lipid exchanges as illustrated in Figure 3, can be converted successively to LDL1, LDL2, and LDL3 particles. VLDL1 are the most TG‐rich particles secreted by the liver; VLDL2 contain an intermediate mass of TG and are also secreted by the liver. VLDL1 and VLDL2 particles can be sequentially converted to VLDL3 particles, which can be converted to IDL particles, which can be converted successively to LDL1, LDL2, and LDL3 particles. apoB indicates apolipoprotein B; CE, cholesteryl ester; IDL, intermediate density lipoprotein; LDL, low‐density lipoprotein; TG, triglycerides; and VLDL, very low‐density lipoprotein.

Just as with VLDL secretion, little is known as to what determines whether VLDL particles are removed from plasma or converted to LDL particles. apoE likely plays an important roleand perhaps so also does apo CIII.As well, we suspect, so does the mass of cholesterol relative to triglycerides within the particle. The processes that catabolize the smaller VLDL particles, from which much of the triglycerides have been removed, are also not well defined. Specific receptors for VLDL have been postulated, but none have been rigorously demonstrated. On the other hand, there is good evidence that binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans may be a critical step in the removal process.Whether the LDL receptor pathway is involved at all is an open question, particularly because turnover studies suggest statin treatment increases VLDL clearance from plasma, and VLDL particles all contain a molecule of apo B 100 and many apoE as well, which are both ligands for the LDL receptor. However, the fact that triglyceride levels are characteristically low in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), in whom the LDL receptor pathway is genetically defective, argues against a critical role for the LDL receptor in this process.

### New therapeutic principles in dyslipidaemia: focus on LDL and Lp (a) lowering drugs [^370e2db3]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Dyslipidaemias play a key role in determining cardiovascular risk; the discovery of statins has contributed a very effective approach. However, many patients do not achieve, at the maximal tolerated dose, the recommended goals for low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Available agents combined with statins can provide additional LDL-C reduction, and agents in development will increase therapeutic options impacting also other atherogenic lipoprotein classes. In fact, genetic insights into mechanisms underlying regulation of LDL-C levels has expanded potential targets of drug therapy and led to the development of novel agents. Among them are modulators of apoB containing lipoproteins production and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors. Alternative targets such as lipoprotein(a) also require attention; however, until we have a better understanding of these issues, further LDL-C lowering in high and very high-risk patients will represent the most sound clinical approach.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^b062288b]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Lipid and lipoprotein metabolism

Cholesterol, in both free and esterified forms, and triglycerides are the two main lipids in plasma. They are transported in lipoproteins, pseudomicellar lipid–protein complexes, in which the main apolipoproteins, apo B-100/48, apo A-I, apo A-II, apo E, and the apo Cs, are integral components. Apo B is a component of all atherogenic lipoproteins (chylomicron remnants, VLDL and their remnants, IDL, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and LDL), whereas apo A-I and apo A-II are components of HDL. The apo B-containing lipoproteins and the apo A-I/A-II lipoprotein classes are closely interrelated via several metabolic pathways (Figure 2). –

### Fenofibric acid [^e68818a1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenofibric acid delayed release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce triglycerides (TG) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibric acid delayed release capsules therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.2 Treatment of Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenofibric acid delayed release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of fenofibric acid delayed release capsules did not reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

1.4 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting fenofibric acid delayed release capsules therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants: metabolic insights, role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies-a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^88f453f8]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Available and novel therapies that target TG metabolism can reduce TRL plasma concentration but need to be evaluated individually for impact on atherogenic lipoproteins. Baseline TG level (fasting or non-fasting), as a reflection of the underlying metabolic abnormality (Figure 6), as well as concomitant medications, especially LDL-lowering drugs, may also influence the potential impact of any therapy on ASCVD outcomes. For example, fibrates effectively lower TG across the range of TG levels but only modestly reduce apoB levels. Their effects on LDL-C differ between moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (LDL-C is decreased or shows no change) and severe hypertriglyceridaemia (LDL-C is increased, albeit from a low baseline level).

Guideline-recommended first steps for managing hypertriglyceridaemia are diet modification and weight loss. Dietary goals include (i) avoiding highly refined carbohydrate foods;, (ii) incorporating seafood, particularly fatty fish;(iii) increasing fibre-rich foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains);(iv) avoiding excess alcohol;and (v) substituting mono- and polyunsaturated fat (mostly from plant oils and nuts) for animal fat (meat and dairy).Dietary trans FA increase TG levels minimally but should be avoided because they significantly raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C.Energy intake should be adjusted to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for dyslipidaemia management recognize that ASCVD risk is increased at TG levels >1.7 mmol/L (>150 mg/dL), but only recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in high-risk patients if >2.3 mmol/L (>200 mg/dL) after excluding secondary causes.There are also no treatment goals, either for plasma TG or indices of remnant abundance, given limited evidence from randomized controlled trials that lowering TG or TRL reduce ASCVD risk.Thus, strategic approaches to lowering TRL warrant discussion. This point is especially pertinent given that PESA reported the presence of peripheral atherosclerotic plaques in 58% of middle-aged individuals with elevated TG levels (≥1.7 mmol/L), low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk, and high or normal LDL-C.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: a clinical guide for endocrinologists [^5e7a3784]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in lipoprotein lipase, resulting in accumulation of chylomicrons in plasma and hypertriglyceridemia. Elevated triglycerides cause several complications in patients, the most serious being episodes of acute pancreatitis. This review focuses on expert guidance and opinion from an experienced lipidologist and endocrinologist as well as a current review of the literature, as there are no specific guidelines on FCS.

Methods

Discussion of expert guidance and opinion review of current literature.

Results

To date, there is no pharmacologic treatment for affected patients, and management options primarily include adoption of an extremely restricted, very-low-fat diet, along with avoidance of certain medications and alcohol. Endocrinologists often diagnose and manage patients with metabolic disorders, including patients with high triglyceride levels, but rare diseases like FCS can be missed or poorly evaluated due to knowledge gaps about disease state. Given endocrinologists' role in the treatment of lipid disorders, it is important that they understand the clinical signs and symptoms of FCS to correctly diagnose patients. Patients with FCS can be identified based on a defined clinical criteria and a thorough review of medical history, after excluding differential diagnoses and secondary factors. Typical manifestations include hypertriglyceridemia characterized by lipemic serum, history of abdominal pain, and acute/recurrent pancreatitis. Secondary factors to be excluded are pregnancy, alcohol abuse, uncontrolled diabetes, and use of certain medications.

Conclusion

FCS is a rare, inherited lipid disorder disease that often goes underdiagnosed and unmanaged. This review provides a summary of clinical characteristics of FCS that can be potentially used to screen patients in an endocrinologist's office and direct them to the appropriate standard of care.

Introduction

Low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) is the primary lipid treatment target to reduce atherosclerotic risk. 1, 2, 3, 4 Non‐high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) is considered to be a co‐primary 3 or secondary treatment target, 1, 2, 4 while apolipoprotein B (ApoB) can be considered as a secondary target 2, 3 or an alternative to LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) as the primary measurement, and may be preferred over non‐HDL‐C in patients with high triglycerides, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or very low LDL‐C. 1 Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is recognized as a risk factor, based on Mendelian randomization, for atherosclerotic disease 1 and cardiovascular events, 5, 6 and its measurement can help improve cardiovascular risk classification under certain conditions. 1, 2 Non‐HDL‐C levels are an estimate of the concentration of atherogenic cholesterol in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. 7 ApoB is a direct measure of non‐HDL atherogenic lipoprotein particle concentration. 8

Both non‐HDL‐C and ApoB are well‐validated measures of cardiovascular risk, particularly for patients with elevated triglyceride levels, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome. 1, 2, 8 For patients at very high total cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend lowering of non‐HDL‐C (<100 mg/dL) for which treatment intensification on top of statin therapy may be needed. 1, 2 A treatment goal for ApoB <80 mg/dL has also been recommended for these patients. 1 It has been suggested that in patients at cardiovascular risk with Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L, intensification of treatment directed to modifiable risk factors, including LDL‐C, is a reasonable strategy. 1, 2 Another recommendation suggests that levels of Lp(a) >75 nmol/L are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. 9

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^c1372567]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dyslipidemia—elevated lipoprotein(a) and combined lipid abnormalities are addressed as follows: There is currently no medication therapy specific for elevated Lp(a), and in adults, niacin will lower Lp(a) approximately 15 percent, but this has not been studied in children; management may focus on addressing other risk factors and concomitant elevations of LDL–C, TG, and non–HDL–C. In obesity-associated combined dyslipidemia (low HDL–C, high TG, and a mild increase in LDL–C with smaller, denser particles), these patients do not meet the criteria for pharmacologic therapy and management focuses on reducing adiposity and changing diet composition, with the CHILD 2–TG diet referenced. When risk factors cluster, pharmacologic therapy may be selectively directed at elevations in non–HDL–C; treatment with statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates might be considered, but evidence is very limited in children and there have been no RCTs. For primary dyslipidemias with elevated VLDL–C (often with elevated LDL–C and high TG), pharmacologic therapy is usually guided by non–HDL–C levels, and statins, omega-3 fish oil, or fibrates should be considered as first-line agents for patients who meet the criteria for medication therapy under the direction of a lipid specialist.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^2261d16c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in relation to reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins [^52fdf1d4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) in the population are declining in response to lifestyle interventions and pharmacological strategies that target LDL‐C reduction, such as statins. 1, 2, 3 However, among individuals with achieved lower levels of LDL‐C, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events continue to occur with unacceptable frequency. 4 Such residual risk may reflect aspects of atherogenesis not captured by LDL‐C, including effects of very‐low‐density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and their contents (cholesterol and triglycerides). 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Enzymatic hydrolysis of VLDL results in the formation of smaller, cholesterol‐enriched lipoprotein particles, 5, 10, 11 which experimental studies suggest could contribute to the development of ASCVD. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Clinically, however, there has been uncertainty as to whether ASCVD events could be further reduced by reducing these triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins, with several neutral trials examining this strategy to date. 10, 17

To study whether pharmacological reductions in concentrations of VLDL lipoprotein particle (VLDL‐p) subclasses, and their component cholesterol (VLDL‐C) and triglyceride, may be associated with lower ASCVD risk among individuals with low LDL‐C on‐statin, we built on the observation that, in some individuals, statins reduce triglycerides and VLDL (in part, through increased clearance and effects on lipoprotein lipase), 18, 19 and that, for uncertain reasons, these effects are variable: Some individuals experience reductions whereas others experience no reduction in VLDL lipoproteins on statin. We thus examined whether individuals achieving larger reductions in VLDL‐p, VLDL‐C, and triglycerides were at incrementally lower risk of ASCVD events than those with smaller or no reductions. Importantly, we examined whether these potential risk reductions conferred benefit beyond statin‐related changes in LDL‐C. Overall, we hypothesized that incrementally greater reductions in small (relatively cholesterol‐enriched) VLDL lipoproteins and VLDL‐C would be associated with incrementally greater reductions in ASCVD events, beyond reductions in LDL‐C. In addition to identifying potential therapeutic targets, broader profiling of the lipid/lipoprotein changes in response to statin therapy could identify independent markers of benefit from statin therapy, and could support more precision‐medicine, individualized approaches to cardiovascular patient care.

Metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants

The primary role of TRL is to transport TG to adipose tissue for storage and to skeletal and cardiac muscle for energy production. The metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins is integral to these functions(Figure 4), with regulation of the assembly, secretion, and clearance of TRL discussed below.

Figure 4 
Overview of apolipoprotein B lipoprotein metabolism. During absorption of fat from the diet, chylomicrons are generated by the enterocytes in the small intestine, travel via lymphatics, and appear in the bloodstream. Lipidation of a primordial apolipoprotein (apo) B48-containing particle (apoB48, a truncated form of apoB100 made solely in the intestine) is mediated by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein using triglyceride synthesized from absorbed fatty acids. In a similar assembly process, a large triglyceride-rich, apoB100-containing very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1 is made in the liver using a variety of sources for triglyceride synthesis— de novo lipogenesis, fatty acids released from intracellular storage droplets, free fatty acids taken up from the circulation after their release from adipose tissue, and triglyceride fatty acids present in VLDL chylomicron remnants. Chylomicrons and VLDL 1 (and to an extent VLDL 2) compete for the same lipolytic mechanism. Lipoprotein lipase is anchored to the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein-1. This enzyme hydrolyzes triglyceride in the core of the particle releasing fatty acids into the underlying tissue bed. Lipase maturation factor 1 is essential for the secretion of functional lipase from adipose tissue and muscle. ApoCII is an activator (essential cofactor) of lipoprotein lipase, whereas apoCIII is an inhibitor of the enzyme and of remnant particle uptake. The angiopoietin-like proteins 3, 4, and 8 (ANGPTL3, 4, 8) have a tissue-specific role in modifying (inhibiting) lipoprotein lipase action, whereas apoAV increases lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis. Lipolysis of chylomicrons leads to the formation of remnant particles, which are cleared by the liver via the low-density lipoprotein receptors and, based on mouse studies, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1. Likewise, VLDL 1 is delipidated to VLDL 2, remnants, and intermediate-density lipoproteins, which are either removed by liver receptors or converted to low-density lipoprotein as the final product. Smaller VLDL 2 is also made by the liver and can be delipidated to intermediate-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (for more detail see refs). It should be noted that lipolysis of both chylomicrons and VLDL in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is neither equally divided nor randomly apportioned but is determined by insulin mediated regulation of lipoprotein lipase in each tissue, with insulin stimulating lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue and inhibiting it in skeletal muscle. In addition, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity in skeletal muscle in the fed state and ANGPTL4 inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity in white adipose tissue during fasting.FFA, free fatty acids; GPIHBP1, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein-1; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LDLr, low-density lipoprotein receptor; LMF1, lipase maturation factor 1; LRP1, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein.

### Fenofibrate (fenoglide) [^c85ced56]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fenoglide is a peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARα) activator indicated:

as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia when response to diet and non-pharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. (1.1)
as an adjunct to diet to treat patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention. (1.2)

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1.3)

1.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenoglide is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

1.2 Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenoglide is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.

1.3 General Guidelines

Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) .]

Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. >2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Fenoglide therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing these patients from those with elevated VLDL.2

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^4ce1cf64]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1.1 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce triglycerides (TG) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.2 Treatment of Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules did not reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

1.4 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^09785bff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Also, of note, diabetic dyslipidemia is multifactorial and is frequently accompanied by elevated VLDL and triglycerides. In patients with diabetes mellitus and impaired triglyceride clearance, remnant lipoprotein levels (small VLDLs and intermediate‐density lipoproteins) are increased. It is now widely accepted that remnant lipoproteins are atherogenic and proinflammatory. 36, 37, 38 In previous work, we have demonstrated reduction in remnant lipoproteins by evolocumab. 39 Herein we demonstrate a substantial reduction of VLDL‐C, the direct precursor to remnant lipoprotein formation. For diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia, ApoB and non‐HDL‐C reductions are important. The diabetic patients in this analysis experienced marked reductions in both ApoB and non‐HDL‐C, with notable improvements in goal attainment for these risk markers when compared with either placebo or ezetimibe, with or without a statin background.

Limitations of the analysis include the 12‐week duration of most studies and the between‐study heterogeneity, which was minimized by the use of highly consistent procedures across studies for randomization, blinding, and lipid measurement. Additionally, LDL‐C and VLDL‐C were calculated by the Friedewald equation and not directly measured, with VLDL‐C estimated as the difference between LDL‐C and non‐HDL‐C. As such, LDL may have been underestimated at low LDL levels and higher triglyceride levels.

In this pooled analysis of 15 studies, evolocumab treatment demonstrated consistent and stable reductions in non‐HDL‐C, ApoB, and Lp(a) across all patient populations studied.

### What is the role of advanced lipoprotein analysis in practice? [^7320a0a3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Some practitioners use advanced lipoprotein analysis with the goal of better predicting risk and individualizing lifestyle and drug therapy for cardiovascular prevention. Unfortunately, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle number and size, other lipoprotein subfractionation, apolipoproteins B and A, and lipoprotein(a) have not yet met current standards for biomarker evaluation, and it remains to be determined whether these tests incrementally add to cardiovascular risk predicted by traditional risk factors. More importantly, it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by, or targeting, these measures improve cardiovascular outcomes. Drug therapies known to alter advanced lipoprotein analysis parameters, specifically niacin and fenofibrate, have not been shown to additionally reduce cardiovascular risk in recent randomized trials of high-risk patients treated with statin therapy. These findings suggest advanced lipoprotein analysis-guided strategies may not further reduce cardiovascular events and could lead to increased adverse effects and costs; this approach needs further research to establish its role in individualizing therapies for cardiovascular prevention. In contrast, a large body of evidence supports focusing on LDL cholesterol reduction and intensification of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Long-term experience with lomitapide treatment in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: over 10 years of efficacy and safety data [^d0f6563d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Lomitapide mechanism of action in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): Lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes and enterocytes, preventing assembly of apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]) and lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) via mechanisms independent of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). It binds directly to MTP in the endoplasmic reticulum and acts independently of the LDLR, being effective in HoFH with absent or very low LDLR residual functionality.

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^063936c5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society stated that apolipoprotein B (apoB) was a more accurate marker of cardiovascular risk than low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Since then, the evidence has continued to mount in favor of apoB. This review explicates the physiological mechanisms responsible for the superiority of apoB as a marker of the cardiovascular risk attributable to the atherogenic apoB lipoprotein particles chylomicron remnants, very low‐density lipoprotein, and low‐density lipoprotein particles. First, the nature and relative numbers of these different apoB particles will be outlined. This will make clear why low‐density lipoprotein particles are almost always the major determinants of cardiovascular risk and why the concentrations of triglycerides and LDL‐C may obscure this relation. Next, the mechanisms that govern the number of very low‐density lipoprotein and low‐density lipoprotein particles will be outlined because, except for dysbetalipoproteinemia, the total number of apoB particles determines cardiovascular risk, Then, the mechanisms that govern the cholesterol mass within very low‐density lipoprotein and low‐density lipoprotein particles will be reviewed because these are responsible for the discordance between the mass of cholesterol within apoB particles, measured either as LDL‐C or non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the number of apoB particles measured as apoB, which creates the superior predictive power of apoB over LDL‐C and non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. Finally, the major apoB dyslipoproteinemias will be briefly outlined. Our objective is to provide a physiological framework for health care givers to understand why apoB is a more accurate marker of cardiovascular risk than LDL‐C or non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) [^0345f7dc]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk-factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate (see also Table 8 and the NCEP treatment guidelines1).

ADVICOR

ADVICOR (niacin extended-release and lovastatin) is indicated for use when treatment with both NIASPAN and lovastatin is appropriate. As described in the labeling for Niaspan and lovastatin below, the components of ADVICOR are both indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Patients receiving treatment with ADVICOR should be on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet and should continue on this diet during treatment.

NIASPAN (niacin extended-release)

Hypercholesterolemia

NIASPAN is indicated as an adjunct to diet for reduction of elevated TC, LDL-C, Apo B and TG levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Table 7), when the response to an appropriate diet has been inadequate.

Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events

In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Hypertriglyceridemia

Niacin is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with very high serum triglyceride levels (Table 7) who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Such patients typically have serum TG levels over 2000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-C as well as fasting chylomicrons (Table 7). Patients who consistently have total serum or plasma TG below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to develop pancreatitis. Therapy with niacin may be considered for those patients with TG elevations between 1000 and 2000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. Some patients with TG under 1000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcohol indiscretion, convert to a pattern with massive TG elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of niacin therapy on risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma TG, but who have normal levels of VLDL-C.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants: metabolic insights, role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies-a consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society [^8de8dcb8]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Which factors regulate the generation and clearance of chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein remnants?

Remnant formation is enhanced by overproduction of TRL or by genetic or physiological factors that limit lipolysis, or both. At moderately elevated plasma TG levels, there is increased secretion of large TG-enriched VLDL and chylomicrons from the liver and small intestine that, when combined with suboptimal LpL action in obesity, insulin resistance, and/or diabetes mellitus, results in remnant accumulation.Variants in the LpL gene that cause partial LOF of the LpL enzyme, or in other genes affecting LpL activity, also lower the rate of TG removal from VLDL and chylomicrons, resulting in elevated plasma TG levels and remnant accumulation even when TRL secretion is normal (Figure 5). The absence of lipolysis (i.e. complete LPL deficiency) results in the extreme elevation of large ‘nascent’ TRL without any concomitant increase in remnants;,, here, pancreatitis rather than ASCVD is the major risk.

Figure 5 
Metabolism of remnant lipoproteins. Remnants are a population of particles in the circulation that have been partially lipolysed by lipoprotein lipase. Efficient lipolysis (broad green arrow) leads to rapid conversion to low-density lipoprotein, with little remnant formation. Causes of remnant accumulation are overproduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or compromised (but not completely absent) lipase action (red arrows). ‘ Transient ’ remnants in the very low-density lipoprotein/intermediate-density lipoprotein range are converted to low-density lipoprotein; chylomicron remnants are not converted to low-density lipoproteins (see Graphical Abstract and Figure 4). Inefficient lipolysis increases the residence time of remnants and they undergo remodelling, acquiring cholesterol (specifically cholesteryl ester by transfer mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein), and apolipoprotein (apo) E. This remodelling can lead to a particle that is no longer susceptible to lipolysis—an ‘ end-product ’ remnant—with a prolonged residence time in the circulation.CETP, cholesteryl ester transfer protein; IDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LpL, lipoprotein lipase; VLDL, very low-density lipoprotein.

Apolipoproteins B and A–1—In adults, apolipoprotein B (apoB), the major apolipoprotein of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C), and apolipoprotein A–1 (apoA–1), the major apolipoprotein of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL–C), are predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and treatment response, with total apoB reflecting all apoB-containing lipoproteins (including chylomicrons, VLDL–C, intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol [IDL–C], LDL–C, and lipoprotein[a]) and providing the most accurate assessment of the total number of LDL–C particles because each particle contains one apoB molecule. ApoB and apoA–1 are determined using well-standardized immunonephelometric methods, and pediatric cutpoints were empirically derived from NHANES III (1988–1994). In the Bogalusa Heart Study, tracking of apoB and apoA–1 over 4 years was comparable to LDL–C and HDL–C with no clear population-level advantage for apoB/apoA–1 to assess tracking; however, improved prediction of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) over LDL–C and TC/HDL–C was observed when using apoB, apoA–1, or their ratio, and a Young Finns report indicates childhood apoB and apoA–1 were better predictors of adult cIMT and brachial endothelial function than LDL–C or HDL–C.

### Lovastatin [^c3f053d6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

The involvement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in atherogenesis has been well-documented in clinical and pathological studies, as well as in many animal experiments. Epidemiological and clinical studies have established that high LDL-C and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are both associated with coronary heart disease. However, the risk of developing coronary heart disease is continuous and graded over the range of cholesterol levels and many coronary events do occur in patients with total cholesterol (total-C) and LDL-C in the lower end of this range.

Lovastatin has been shown to reduce both normal and elevated LDL-C concentrations. LDL is formed from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and is catabolized predominantly by the high affinity LDL receptor. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect of lovastatin may involve both reduction of VLDL-C concentration, and induction of the LDL receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL-C. Apolipoprotein B also falls during treatment with lovastatin.

Lovastatin is a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome—medical management: The only US FDA-approved treatment for adults with FCS at the time of publication is an APOC3 inhibitor, olezarsen. Plozasiran, a first-in-class investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic designed to reduce production of APOC3, is currently in clinical trials and in January 2025 received a new drug application acceptance by the FDA for the same indication. Volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense therapeutic oligonucleotide that targets the messenger RNA for APOC3, is approved by the European Medicines Agency for FCS; however, blood platelets need to be monitored closely for concerns of thrombocytopenia. Medications known to worsen hypertriglyceridemia in patients should be carefully assessed for benefit-to-risk ratio, and lipoprotein profiles should be monitored closely. For women with FCS, any estrogen and estrogen-like medications should be avoided.

Particles andParticle Number

The different classes of the apoB lipoproteins are illustrated schematically in Figure 1. apo B 48 is 2143 amino acids in length and 264 kDa in size, and is a truncated, lighter version of apo B 100, which is 4136 amino acids in length and 550 kDa in size.,apo B 48 encircles chylomicron particles secreted by the intestine, providing an exoskeleton for these particles; apo B 48 does not contain the low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding region of apoB, which is excised by a distinctive intestine‐specific RNA editing mechanism.

Figure 1 
apoB lipoprotein particles.

One molecule of apo B 48 encircles each chylomicron and chylomicron remnant particle. The chylomicron remnant particle contains less TG but the same amount of cholesterol as the intact chylomicron particle. The difference in TG mass represents the mass of TG delivered to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. One molecule of apo B 100 encircles VLDL, LDL, and Lp(a) particles. Lp(a) particles are an LDL particle to which a molecule of apo(a) has been attached. One molecule of apo B 48 encircles a chylomicron or chylomicron remnant particle. apoB indicates apolipoprotein B; CE, cholesteryl ester; LDL, low‐density lipoprotein; Lp(a), lipoprotein(a); TG, triglycerides; and VLDL, very low‐density lipoprotein.

### Contemporary aspects of the biology and therapeutic regulation of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein [^f17f14b1]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), the product of the MTTP gene, is essential for the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, but when defective causes abetalipoproteinemia. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the inability to produce chylomicrons or very low-density lipoproteins, with the absence of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in the circulation. Knowledge of the molecular basis for abetalipoproteinemia has led to the development of therapies for dyslipidemia that inhibit MTP. Partial MTP inhibition using small molecule inhibitors, such as lomitapide, can effectively lower plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels, but is associated with gastrointestinal side effects and hepatic steatosis, whose long-term sequelae remain unclear; lomitapide has accordingly only been approved as a treatment for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Intestine-specific inhibitors of MTP decrease chylomicron biogenesis and improve insulin sensitivity in experimental animals and, while overcoming hepatic steatosis, may have significant gastrointestinal side effects that could limit their use in humans. We review contemporary aspects of the biology and therapeutic regulation of MTP and their significance for lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease.

### The year in cardiovascular medicine 2021: dyslipidaemia [^2ad49722]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The past year was an exciting time for clinical lipidology when we learnt more about existing therapies as well as therapies targeting novel pathways discovered through genetic studies. LDL cholesterol remained the main target and a variety of drugs to lower LDL cholesterol through different mechanisms were explored. Emerging evidence on the atherogenity of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins led to renewed interest in lowering them with new treatments. Lp(a) was back in focus with evidence on causality and new targeted therapeutics which dramatically lower Lp(a) levels. We will be able to personalise lipid lowering therapy further with this enriched armamentarium once we have the results of the cardiovascular outcome studies with some of these new agents.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f8e2207]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations—patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient’s absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

Fibrates in familial chylomicronemia syndrome—benefit limitations and risks. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of fibrates for patients with FCS, and studies in FCS showed reductions in triglyceride levels only when used in combination with other interventions, such as fat restricted diet and MCT oil. Fibrates could be helpful in certain patients with FCS who have secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia that raise VLDL, including obesity. Concerns with fibrates include the potential for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (especially when given with statins), elevations in liver enzymes, and reversible increases in serum creatinine.

### Atherogenic lipoprotein determinants of cardiovascular disease and residual risk among individuals with low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^a2930c67]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, among individuals with low (<130 mg/dL) LDL‐c, risk remains associated with lipoprotein particle concentration, including VLDL lipoproteins. We observed on‐statin risk strongly associated with small VLDL‐p—risk that appears to be triglyceride‐independent and instead related to the cholesterol carried by these small VLDL particles. Overall, these hypothesis‐generating findings draw attention to the potential importance of VLDL lipoproteins, in particular small remnant particles, which are associated with risk but are currently not the target of prediction or therapeutic intervention. Additional studies are needed to validate these findings and assess the potential causal role of these lipoproteins as determinants of CVD risk.

### Effect of evolocumab on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a): a pooled analysis of phase 2 and phase 3 studies [^77262fcc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ApoB, non‐HDL‐C, and Lp(a) are important measures of risk for ASCVD. The incorporation of these apoprotein and lipoprotein measures into guidelines makes risk assessment more comprehensive and helps to identify more patients likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering therapies. Herein we demonstrate that evolocumab provides substantial reductions in ApoB, non‐HDL‐C, and Lp(a) when used either as monotherapy or when used as adjuvant therapy to statins or ezetimibe. Moreover, the administration of evolocumab in a broad range of patients at high cardiovascular risk or unable to receive high‐intensity statin therapy (eg, patients with primary dyslipidemia, HeFH, diabetes mellitus, or statin intolerance) substantially increases the likelihood of attaining risk‐stratified goals of therapy for ApoB and non‐HDL‐C in these subgroups. The reductions in ApoB, non‐HDL‐C, and Lp(a) are durable for up to 5 years of continuous therapy. We also demonstrate substantive reductions in VLDL‐C in these patients. In total these changes represent significant, broad‐spectrum incremental reductions in total atherogenic lipoprotein burden in serum that no other currently available drug class can achieve.

Very high triglycerides (TG) and chylomicron clearing—When fasting TG are ≥500 mg/dL, and particularly when ≥750 mg/dL, fasting chylomicronemia is often present; at very high fasting TG levels, especially if ≥1000 mg/dL, restriction of dietary fat to less than 15% total energy intake (usually <20–40 g daily; 40 g is 15% of energy for a 2400 kcal diet) is recommended, and Table 6 advises to temporarily limit total fat to 10%–15% calories (typically 20–40 g/day) during chylomicron clearing, avoid alcohol, avoid refined starches and added sugars, exercise 30–60 min most days, and if extra calories are needed add medium chain TG oil and increase gradually; once chylomicron particles have been cleared and TGs are <500 mg/dL, gradually advance dietary fat to tolerance, with additional guidance including complete alcohol abstinence for those with very high TG, engaging in moderate or higher intensity aerobic activity ≥5 days per week, and for those on very-low fat diets (<15% of energy) over an extended period, consumption of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation.

APOC3 inhibitor therapies in FCS—while promising, current evidence is limited to short-term triglyceride lowering and key uncertainties remain about longer-term outcomes, safety, and practical access. While novel APOC3 inhibitors show promise, their long-term efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life remain largely understudied. Current clinical trials report significant TG reductions over a 1-year period, but there are no data on long-term outcomes, adverse effects, and the management of concomitant conditions. It remains unclear whether these agents will enable patients with FCS to liberalize their fat intake, further data on these agents in children are needed, and practical considerations related to cost and accessibility must be addressed.

### Gemfibrozil [^82f0bf57]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Gemfibrozil Tablets, USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for:

Treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who present a risk of pancreatitis and who do not respond adequately to a determined dietary effort to control them. Patients who present such risk typically have serum triglycerides over 2,000 mg/dL and have elevations of VLDL-cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia). Subjects who consistently have total serum or plasma triglycerides below 1,000 mg/dL are unlikely to present a risk of pancreatitis. Gemfibrozil therapy may be considered for those subjects with triglyceride elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or of recurrent abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis. It is recognized that some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1,000 mg/dL may, through dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of gemfibrozil therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia.
Reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease only in Type IIb patients without history of or symptoms of existing coronary heart disease who have had an inadequate response to weight loss, dietary therapy, exercise, and other pharmacologic agents (such as bile acid sequestrants and nicotinic acid, known to reduce LDL- and raise HDL-cholesterol) and who have the following triad of lipid abnormalities: low HDL-cholesterol levels in addition to elevated LDL-cholesterol and elevated triglycerides (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The National Cholesterol Education Program has defined a serum HDL-cholesterol value that is consistently below 35 mg/dL as constituting an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Patients with significantly elevated triglycerides should be closely observed when treated with gemfibrozil. In some patients with high triglyceride levels, treatment with gemfibrozil is associated with a significant increase in LDL-cholesterol. BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL TOXICITY SUCH AS MALIGNANCY, GALLBLADDER DISEASE, ABDOMINAL PAIN LEADING TO APPENDECTOMY AND OTHER ABDOMINAL SURGERIES, AN INCREASED INCIDENCE IN NON-CORONARY MORTALITY, AND THE 44% RELATIVE INCREASE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD IN AGE-ADJUSTED ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY SEEN WITH THE CHEMICALLY AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY RELATED DRUG, CLOFIBRATE, THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF GEMFIBROZIL IN TREATING TYPE IIA PATIENTS WITH ELEVATIONS OF LDL-CHOLESTEROL ONLY IS NOT LIKELY TO OUTWEIGH THE RISKS. GEMFIBROZIL IS ALSO NOT INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH LOW HDL-CHOLESTEROL AS THEIR ONLY LIPID ABNORMALITY.

### Standardization of apolipoprotein B, LDL-cholesterol, and non-HDL-cholesterol [^080d02e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Errors due to imprecision and bias are independent of each other. Thus, a method can be unbiased, but imprecise, and vice versa. Only if medical tests are standardized will results, within allowable measurement uncertainty, obtained from 1 laboratory using 1 method, be comparable to results obtained from another laboratory using a different method to measure the same marker. Even if the same method by the same manufacturer is used, a robust standardization program will ensure that new lots of critical reagents and calibrators are validated so that no bias occurs over time. In the absence of effective ongoing standardization, there is no assurance that test results at 1 moment in time will be exactly comparable to measurements at another.

There is yet another aspect of the measurement of lipoprotein particles and lipids: selectivity. However, the signal importance of selectivity as a criterion to assess the validity of cholesterol assays in particular has not been widely recognized. Therefore, we will briefly explain its significance. A marker must be measurable, accurately and precisely, over the full range of concentrations, irrespective of pathological variations encountered clinically. Pathological variation in this case refers to the different combinations of apoB‐containing lipoproteins that characterize the different dyslipoproteinemias. Thus, the triglyceride‐rich apoB lipoprotein particles include intact chylomicrons, normal chylomicron remnants, cholesterol‐enriched chylomicron, and very‐low‐density lipoprotein remnants characteristic of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, as well as the full range of different size very‐low‐density lipoprotein particles. Each of these particles contains 1 molecule of apoB but different amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Secondary factors and treatment responsiveness distinguish familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) from multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS): FCS is typically not caused by or associated with secondary factors, many patients have a normal body mass index, and it is notoriously refractory to conventional therapies; conversely, MCS is usually associated with at least 1 or more secondary factors such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, alcohol use, or certain medications, and triglyceride levels typically decrease with management of these factors plus fibrates, O3FAs, and dietary fat restriction, though 5% to 8% of patients with MCS remain refractory and may require more intensive management similar to FCS.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds—evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of <100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of <130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of <55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that “normal” very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are <150 mg/dL is typically ≤30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically >30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk—cholesterol and lipoproteins are linked to disease through epidemiology and pathobiology: Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between serum cholesterol levels and increased ASCVD risk, with a log-linear relationship between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality shown in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (N = 356,222). The importance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is supported by familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), where very high LDL-C and early ASCVD occur, and by findings that removal of apo B–containing lipoproteins by lipoprotein apheresis has been shown to markedly reduce arterial wall inflammation. Individuals with proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mutations and with polymorphisms in Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) associated with lifelong reduced LDL-C have markedly reduced ASCVD events. Atherosclerosis is described as a lipid-driven inflammatory disorder of the arterial wall, and atherosclerotic plaque rupture is generally the proximal cause of acute coronary syndromes.

### Surprises from genetic analyses of lipid risk factors for atherosclerosis [^06916df0]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Observational epidemiological studies have associated plasma lipid concentrations with risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), but these studies cannot distinguish cause from mere correlation. Human genetic studies, when considered with the results of randomized controlled trials of medications, can potentially shed light on whether lipid biomarkers are causal for diseases. Genetic analyses and randomized trials suggest that low-density lipoprotein is causal for CHD, whereas high-density lipoprotein is not. Surprisingly, human genetic evidence suggests that lipoprotein(a) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally contribute to CHD. Gene variants leading to higher levels of plasma apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins [low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, or lipoprotein(a)] consistently increase risk for CHD. For triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, the most compelling evidence revolves around lipoprotein lipase and its endogenous facilitator (APOA5 [apolipoprotein A-V]) and inhibitory proteins (APOC3 [apolipoprotein C-III], ANGPTL4 [angiopoietin like 4]). Combined, these genetic results anticipate that, beyond low-density lipoprotein, pharmacological lowering of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or lipoprotein(a) will reduce risk for CHD, but this remains to be proven through randomized controlled trials.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^58ec0c02]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome—Key points emphasize that nonpharmacologic management primarily involves an extremely low-fat diet (10%-15% of daily calories or <20 g of fat daily), ensuring essential fatty acid needs are met, and avoiding alcohol; conventional lipid-lowering agents are ineffective in FCS, but the novel APOC3 inhibitors olezarsen (recently approved) and plozasiran (approval pending) show great promise; and treatments such as heparin and insulin are not proven to be effective, while TPE has only transient effects and is not beneficial in most clinical scenarios.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^f713e62a]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Triglycerides—severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis risk: Most patients with triglycerides ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L) have increased VLDL and chylomicrons, and patients with triglycerides from 500 to 999 mg/dL are at risk of developing unrecognized marked increases in triglycerides, leading to pancreatitis. To prevent acute pancreatitis, it is reasonable to reduce triglycerides whenever levels exceed 500 mg/dL. This reduction can be achieved by addressing and eliminating the underlying factors by implementing a very low-fat diet and by adding fibrates or omega-3 fatty acids for patients with persistently elevated severe hypertriglyceridemia. If a fibrate is necessary in a patient being treated with a statin, fenofibrate is safer than gemfibrozil because of a lower risk of severe myopathy. Severe hypertriglyceridemia during pregnancy is best managed in consultation with a lipid specialist.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: a rare but devastating autosomal recessive disorder characterized by refractory hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis [^ff47aa0f]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid disorder characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis. Because the disorder is often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed and because traditional triglyceride lowering medications are often ineffective, the disease leads to a tremendous physical, social and emotional burden on afflicted patients and their caretakers. Mutations in 5 different genes have been implicated in the development of FCS, all of which have an effect on the activity of lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein lipase(LPL) is responsible for removing triglycerides from chylomicrons and other triglyceride rich lipoproteins in the circulation, breaking them down into free fatty acids for use as energy. Patients with FCS have loss of function of their LPL leading to severely elevated chylomicrons in the circulation and hence, severe hypertriglyceridemia. The principle treatment for FCS is to reduce chylomicron formation in the gut by placing the patient on an extremely low fat diet. New medications in development hold significant promise for improving the quality of life for FCS patients.

Cholesterol, LDL, and LDL-C

The terms ‘cholesterol’, ‘LDL’, and ‘LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)’ are frequently conflated or used interchangeably, potentially leading to confusion. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids and steroid hormones. Importantly, cholesterol of both exogenous and endogenous origin is transported to peripheral cells largely by the apoB-containing lipoproteins in plasma. In most people, LDL particles constitute ∼90% of circulating apoB-containing lipoproteins in fasting blood (Figure 1). However, in clinical practice, the plasma LDL level is generally not measured directly but instead is estimated from its cholesterol concentration—LDL-C—a measure of the total amount of cholesterol contained in LDL particles. As a result, calculated plasma LDL-C has become the focus for assessing cardiovascular risk and for evaluating therapeutic benefit in randomized clinical trials.

Figure 1 
Relative concentration of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) contained in circulating lipoproteins in normolipidaemic individuals. ApoB content was calculated in nanomoles per litre using 500 000 as the defined molecular mass [i.e. low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 100 mg/dL or 2000 nmol/L, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) remnants 5 mg/dL or 100 nmol/L and lipoprotein(a) 10 nmol/l*]. *Based on population median.

Under most conditions, LDL-C concentration and LDL particle number are highly correlated, and therefore plasma LDL-C is a good surrogate for LDL particle concentration. However, in certain conditions (e.g. the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridaemia), plasma LDL-C and LDL particle concentration can become discordant as a result of the predominance of small, dense cholesterol-poor LDL, and therefore plasma LDL-C may not accurately reflect LDL particle concentration or its effect on cardiovascular risk. Under these conditions, direct measurement of LDL particle number or apoB concentration (recognizing that each LDL particle contains a single apoB molecule) may more accurately reflect the causal effect of LDL on ASCVD. In this Consensus Statement, we assess the evidence that LDL causes ASCVD by critically appraising the clinical evidence, with the understanding that the majority of clinical studies have used LDL-C as an estimate of LDL concentration.

### HDL as a target in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^22d00993]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Lipid abnormalities are among the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Indeed, lipid-modifying drugs - in particular, the statins, which primarily lower plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - considerably reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, leading to their widespread use. Nevertheless, it seems that there might be limits to the degree of benefit that can be achieved by lowering LDL-cholesterol levels alone, which has led to increased interest in targeting other lipid-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In this article, we first consider the mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of HDL cholesterol, and then discuss several strategies that have recently emerged to increase levels of HDL cholesterol to treat cardiovascular disease, including nuclear receptor modulation, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and infusion of apolipoprotein/phospholipid complexes.

### Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol XL) [^4206c481]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, 
consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C 
level is > 130 mg/dL (NCEP-ATP II).

Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that 
the LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if 
LDL-C levels are not available, should the Total-C be used to monitor therapy.

C = cholesterol, TG = triglycerides, LDL = low density 
lipoprotein, VLDL = very low density lipoprotein,

IDL = intermediate density lipoprotein

Neither Lescol nor Lescol XL have been studied in conditions where the 
major abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons, VLDL, or IDL (i.e., 
hyperlipoproteinemia Types I, III, IV, or V).

The NCEP classification of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients 
with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular 
disease is summarized below:

Children treated with fluvastatin in adolescence should be re-evaluated 
in adulthood and appropriate changes made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen 
to achieve adult treatment goals.

In patients with coronary heart disease, Lescol and Lescol XL are 
indicated to reduce the risk of undergoing coronary revascularization 
procedures.

Lescol and Lescol XL are also indicated to slow the progression 
of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a 
treatment strategy to lower total and LDL cholesterol to target levels.

### Recognition and management of persistent chylomicronemia: a joint expert clinical consensus by the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^fcc8a370]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Persistent chylomicronemia—assessment of secondary factors and lifestyle treatment: Once chylomicronemia (TG ≥1000 mg/dL) is identified, healthcare professionals should identify secondary factors that may contribute to elevated TG levels, including poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, ethanol intake, suboptimal dietary habits, inactivity, and TG-raising medications. Lifestyle modification should be initiated as a foundational approach with a diet very low in fat (<10%-15% daily caloric intake), reduction in simple/refined carbohydrates, avoidance of high fructose and ethanol intake, regular exercise with ≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity or ≥75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, and weight regulation in overweight or obesity; referral to a dietitian expert in low-fat diet should be considered.

### Discordance analyses comparing LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B for cardiovascular risk estimation [^d23aaf4b]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

For decades, studies have tried to identify the cholesterol marker that best reflects risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease(ASCVD). Comparing low-density-lipoprotein(LDL) cholesterol, non-high-density-lipoprotein(non-HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B(apoB) as ASCVD risk markers has been challenged by high correlation between them. Thus, discordance analyses, directly addressing disagreements between the cholesterol markers, have emerged. Approaches adopted to define discordance originate in one of three methods: discordance by cut-points, discordance by percentiles, or discordance by residuals. Commonly, concordant lipid levels serve as reference examining the association between discordant lipid levels with risk of ASCVD. Importantly, concordant reference groups present heterogeneity of clinical relevance across different discordance methods as concordant low lipid levels associate with lowest ASCVD risk while concordant high lipid levels associate with highest risk. Thus, results from different discordance approaches cannot be directly compared. Moreover, discordance between cholesterol markers is more frequently seen in individuals treated with lipid-lowering medication than in individuals not treated with lipid-lowering medication. Accordingly, studies performing discordance analyses have reported inconsistent and even conflicting results. Discordance by cut-points appears the most intuitive and clinically applicable method; results from these analyses suggest that elevated LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, or apoB levels in individuals not treated with lipid-lowering medication confer increased ASCVD risk while in individuals treated with lipid-lowering medication, elevated non-HDL cholesterol and apoB levels best indicate residual risk. Results from discordance analyses comparing LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apoB in risk of ASCVD as well as complexities of discordance analyses and considerations regarding interpretations are discussed in this review.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^8481ad6f]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Using meta-regression analysis, we were able to determine factors associated with the treatment effect such as percent change of LDL-C and ApoB from baseline. Changes in mean LDL-C was incorporated as possible covariate because of the reported higher discordance in LDL-C reduction for higher Lp(a) levels.While Farmakis et aldid not include ApoB in their meta-regression, ApoB was incorporated in our regression analysis as studies have suggested that it is not always linked on a single Lp(a) particle, hence can affect Lp(a) levels after PCSK9i.Our study demonstrated that a greater Lp(a) reduction is associated with more marked LDL-C and ApoB reduction, which indicates a similar effect of PCSK9i on these 2 biomarkers. This is consistent with fact that the LDL receptor plays a role in LDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a) clearance from the bloodstream, and PCSK9i prevents LDL receptor degradation, thus optimizing its function.Additionally, ApoB is a component of LDL, chylomicrons, and other lipoproteins; therefore, ApoB levels are expected to decrease concurrently with LDL-C. However, the R 2 values in the metaregression analyses were low, which could be explained by discordance between LDL-C reduction and Lp(a) reduction (ie, LDL-C:Lp(a) reduction >3.5:1). This discordance observed in a previous study suggests alternate pathways of Lp(a) clearance beyond the LDL receptor.

Determinants ofParticle Number

LDL particles are produced when triglycerides are removed from VLDL particles. Thus, LDL particles are produced indirectly by the liver, because they are products of metabolized VLDL particles. In general, the rate of production of VLDL particles is the major determinant of the rate of production of LDL particles.Therefore, to the extent that the determinants of production of VLDL particles remain to be fully clarified, so do the determinants of production of LDL particles. A second mechanism that can affect production of LDL particles is variance in the proportion of VLDL particles converted to LDL particles. In FH, an increased proportion of VLDL particles are converted to LDL particles, perhaps because of decreased reuptake of newly secreted VLDL particles by the liver,whereas in dysbetalipoproteinemia, a decreased proportion is converted, perhaps because of impaired interaction with the liver.The APOB p.Arg3480Pro variant is an unusual but apt and vivid example of a critically sited mutation producing hypobetalipoproteinemia because of reduced conversion of VLDL to LDL.Understanding the metabolic determinants of this process should be a high priority, because it appears to be an important target for drug development; the inhibitors of ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin like protein type 3), for example, might act at this site.

As with VLDL particles, the number of LDL particles in plasma is a function of the rate at which they are produced and the rate at which they are removed or cleared from plasma (Figure 3). The plasma half‐life of a VLDL particle is 3 to 4 hours, whereas the plasma half‐life of an LDL particle is 3 to 4 days.Thus, although each LDL particle was derived from a VLDL particle, this dramatic difference in clearance rates results in the dominance of LDL particles versus VLDL particles. Almost all attention has focused on clearance as the primary determinant of LDL particle number, based, in large part, on the brilliant studies by Brown and Goldstein and their colleagues, who not only described the LDL receptor pathway as the physiological route to remove LDL particles from plasma, but also demonstrated that the highest levels of LDL occur in individuals in whom the LDL receptor pathway is completely defective.

### Advanced lipoprotein testing: recommendations based on current evidence [^2cee3ed5]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level currently is used as the major determinant of lipid- and lipoprotein-associated risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease, and varying levels have become the standard goals of lipid-altering treatment. The predictive value of the LDL-C cholesterol level, however, often is less than that provided by other variables such as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), and the number of LDL particles measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This article reviews studies that compare these different lipoprotein variables, describes advanced methodologies of lipoprotein testing, and suggests goals of treatment and clinical situations in which these tests might be ordered.
